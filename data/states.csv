(Photo by Getty Images)Pharmacies across Pennsylvania are holding off on administering new COVID-19 vaccines until the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) vaccine advisory committee recommends them, or the commonwealth writes new rules on how to authorize them.
The New York Times reported on Thursday that CVS and Walgreens, the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, have severely restricted access to the seasonal vaccines in Pennsylvania and other states.
Trade groups representing independent and small chain pharmacies across the state have told the Capital-Star that they’re following suit, at least until there’s more clarity from federal regulators, or new guidance from the state.
“The easiest thing to tell you is COVID vaccines are on pause until we have better clarification,” said John DeJames, president of the Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association.
However, DeJames also said there is no reason yet for Pennsylvanians who want a COVID-19 vaccine to panic. Many pharmacies have yet to receive shipments of the latest seasonal vaccines, he said, and the optimal time to get one is around the start of October.
“In my opinion, instead of rushing to judgement, let’s wait and see how this pans out,” DeJames said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As it stands, Pennsylvania’s State Board of Pharmacy is responsible for determining when and to whom pharmacists can administer vaccines. And its is statutorily bound to follow guidance from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
The federal panel has yet to recommend the latest round of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which means pharmacies in the commonwealth are largely unable to administer them.
The committee is set to meet in mid-September. But shakeups at the CDC, including the recent firing of its director, Susan Monarez, and the appointment of vaccine skeptics to key positions at the behest of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has some pharmacists, lawmakers and elected leaders in Pennsylvania concerned that the agency may place new, politicized restrictions on COVID-19 shots.
In June, Kennedy replaced all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee, which he described as an effort to restore public trust.
Meanwhile, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a handful of lawmakers, and advocates like the Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association are considering what actions the state could take to possibly bypass the CDC’s recommendations altogether, if the federal body places severe restrictions on COVID-19 vaccines.
Reading the tea leaves, some have pointed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent ruling that restricted who can receive COVID-19 shots this year.

In previous years, the agency approved the shots for broad use. But this year, they approved the latest vaccines for at-risk Americans, like those 65 and older or younger adults and children with pre-existing conditions or other health risks. 
The list includes smokers, people who are obese, and those with diseases that could impact the severity of a COVID-19 infection.
Still, it’s up to the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee to formally recommend the shot. While the panel is scheduled to convene in September, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has called on the vaccine advisory committee to delay in the wake of the CDC Director’s firing.
Marc Ost, the co-owner of Eric’s RX Shoppe in Montgomery County, said it’s been difficult having so much uncertainty around what may happen with the COVID-19 vaccine. As it stands, he’s not administering them.
“We’ve had a lot of patients come into the store. We’ve had a lot of patients call wondering when they can get the new vaccine, or when we’ll have it in stock,” Ost said. “The frustrating part has been the lack of answers we can give patients.”
What can Pennsylvania do?
State Rep. Arvind Venkat (D-Allegheny), an emergency physician as well as a lawmaker, is worried about the politicization of vaccination recommendations under Kennedy’s health department.
“Secretary Kennedy has made up his mind that vaccines are harmful,” Venkat said. “He doesn’t seem to be willing to accept any evidence — very robust evidence — that that is simply not the case.”
Since Kennedy removed and replaced every member of the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Venkat began working on legislation to ensure continued access to COVID-19 shots and other vaccines.
Last Thursday, Venkat and other Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill to require private insurance to cover vaccines recommended by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

But since he heard CVS would not be widely offering COVID-19 shots in Pennsylvania, he’s begun pushing for Shapiro and the legislature to work together to ensure pharmacies in the state can administer the shots, regardless of the CDC’s recommendations. But, he said he’s early in that process.
One solution, he said, would be an executive order from Shapiro. But, he called that approach a  short-term solution. 
Rosie Lapowsky, a spokesman for Shapiro, did not respond directly to questions about whether he would consider executive action, but pointed to a recent social media post from the governor.
“The Trump Administration’s outrageous decision to limit access to the COVID vaccine is an affront to Pennsylvanians’ personal freedom and parental rights,” Shapiro wrote Friday. “My Administration is currently reviewing all of our options to ensure Pennsylvanians have access to the health care they want and will have more to say soon.”
For a long-term fix, Venkat is considering possible legislation, though no bill has been drafted.
“I am discussing with my colleague to rapidly push such legislation forward,” Venkat said. “The severity of this issue just became apparent, at least to me.”
Ost, the co-owner of Eric’s RX Shoppe, also said he and other pharmacists are pushing for the State Board of Pharmacy to consider the recommendations of another authority, instead of the CDC vaccine panel when authorizing pharmacists to administer vaccines.
A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees the State Board of Pharmacy, referred questions to Shapiro’s office.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Labor Day weekend marks the unofficial close of lake-recreation season, and the official end of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ weekly beach monitoring program for summer 2025.  
This summer, 28 state park beaches, out of 41 monitored, had at least one weekend where swimming was not recommended due to high levels of E. coli or microcystins, a toxin released by certain types of algae. 
For the final week of monitoring, swimming is not recommended at 15 state park beaches. The majority of these beaches have excessive levels of E. coli present, and one beach has excessive levels of algal toxins, according to DNR’s beach monitoring database.

How does beach monitoring work?
The “swimming not recommended” advisories are not a beach closure, but rather a warning to recreators that the beach may carry a higher risk of causing things like diarrhea, nausea or other acute symptoms than can result from exposure to E. coli and microcystins. 
A single water sample taken at the beach must exceed E. coli measurements of 235 colony forming units, or CFU, per 100 milliliters, for a swimming advisory to be issued. An advisory is also triggered if the mean of five samples over a 30-day period exceeds 126 CFU/100 mL. At these levels, an estimated 36 out of 1,000 swimmers will experience minor illnesses. 
Single samplings at some state park beaches this summer had E. coli concentrations as high as 24,000 most probable number, or MPN, per 100 mL. MPN is a statistical calculation of the number of colonies rather than a direct count. 
Microcystins are toxins produced by certain green-blue algae that typically have a paint-like or oily appearance on the water. The blooms occur in nutrient dense water. 
This summer five state beaches had microystin levels in excess of 8 micrograms per L, which is the level that triggers an advisory. 
There are 15 weeks between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend. Three state beaches, at Backbone State Park, Beeds Lake State Park and Pine Lake State Park, had swimming advisories for all but three of the weeks. 
13 beaches had no swimming advisories this summer due to water quality, this number includes the beach at Lake Keomah State Park, which was not monitored this summer due to ongoing renovations. 
This means more beaches had adverse water conditions this summer than last summer. Iowa Environmental Council follows the DNR beach monitoring data each week and found that in 2024, 16 state park beaches did not have an advisory in place all summer. 
IEC reported in 2024 that Green Valley Lake, Honey Creek, and Lake Anita were the only monitored state beaches that had never had an E. coli related advisory. This statistic holds true after this summer’s beach monitoring season, though the beach at Green Valley Lake had one advisory for microsystins. 
Driftless Water Defenders closes 48 Lakes Initiative 
Driftless Water Defenders, a water advocacy group based in northeast Iowa, started a clean-water dialogue project at the beginning of lake season. Participants were encouraged at in person events and over social media, to share their experiences of recreating in Iowa lakes and how it has changed over the years. 
The group is planning a final gathering for the 48-Lakes Initiative on Sept. 1, Labor Day, at 11 a.m. at the beach lodge at Backbone State Park.
Chris Jones, president of the Driftless Water Defenders, said much of Iowa’s water is “seriously impaired” largely because of nitrate, phosphorus and manure that run off of agricultural operations. 
“We know how to correct this,” Jones said in a press release. “However, the industrial-agricultural interests have impeded Iowa from moving forward to improve this condition.”   
DWD invites Iowans to join the event which will feature several speakers, including Jones, musical entertainment and free lunch. Those interested in attending can RSVP on the group’s Facebook page. 
The initiative also exists on various social media platforms under the tags #48Lakes and #NoSwimEra
The 48-Lakes Initiative is also supported by Progress Iowa, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and Food & Water Watch.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)North Carolina was one of more than two dozen states that argued earlier this month that the federal government was “secretly” withholding millions of dollars in AmeriCorps funding, representing a second round of cuts to the national service program since April.
Now, federal officials say that funding — totaling nearly $185 million — is heading out to the states after all. In North Carolina that means money for jobs and grants supporting recovery from Hurricane Helene last September.
“The federal government knew that it would lose against us in court because it had no right to cut funds for AmeriCorps that Congress had already authorized,” N.C. Attorney General Jeff Jackson said in a statement Friday. “This money belongs to North Carolina and is crucial for western North Carolina’s recovery. I’m deeply grateful for the AmeriCorps members on the ground who can keep helping our communities rebuild after Helene.”
AmeriCorps officials said in a filing Thursday in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, that the $185 million represents the remainder of the funding appropriated by Congress for AmeriCorps in the current fiscal year. AmeriCorps pledged to apportion the funds by Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal 2025.
Nationwide the unlocked funding will go to several different service programs, including AmeriCorps Seniors, which connects Americans 55 and up with service opportunities, including helping children learn to read, assisting the elderly and responding to natural disasters.
Jackson was one of 22 attorneys general and two governors who sued the Trump administration in April over the funding. According to a press release from the AG’s office, the money will allow the following programs to continue:

Project MARS (Big Brothers Big Sisters of WNC) which delivered supplies and meals to families, assisted shelters and crisis hotlines, and supported schools as they reopened in 18 western North Carolina counties after Hurricane Helene.
Project Conserve which partnered with local organizations in 25 western North Carolina counties to remove debris, plant trees and make storm repairs.
Project POWER which coordinated food donations, conducted wellness checks and managed cleanup in Buncombe, Henderson and Madison counties after the storm.

Other programs in North Carolina affected by the decision include literacy services, community gardens and mental health support for students.
In addition to North Carolina other parties to the suit include the District of Columbia and the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

The ruling also does not affect other tariffs Trump issued under different authorities, including industry- or material-specific tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminum.In a post to social media, Trump said he would appeal to the Supreme Court, where he predicted victory, and repeated his claim that tariffs were an essential economic tool.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” he wrote shortly after the decision was published. “It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong.… If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America. At the start of this Labor Day weekend, we should all remember that TARIFFS are the best tool to help our Workers, and support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products.”Several Democratic states challenged the IEEPA tariffs. Oregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman argued on their behalf on July 31. The 11 judges on the appeals court expressed skepticism of both sides during those arguments.In a statement Friday, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling ""a huge win for Americans.""“Every court that has reviewed these tariffs has agreed that they are unconstitutional,"" he said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)For millions of years, water flowing through the Colorado River shaped the geography of the West, carving out features like the Grand Canyon. Now, the Colorado River sustains the cities, farms and industries of the southwestern U.S., providing 40 million people with water. The river winds through canyons, alpine tundras, deserts and forests, underpinning ecosystems, vitalizing trout fisheries, feeding migratory birds and maintaining river deltas.
The Colorado River is remarkable in and of itself, it lays the foundation for remarkable habitats, and, apparently, can precipitate remarkable political alliances. This month, all 10 of Colorado’s U.S. legislators, from the most progressive representatives to MAGA Lauren Boebert, sent a letter to President Donald Trump calling for the release of funding for Colorado River water projects.
The water in the Colorado River is distributed among seven Western states, separated into two groups — Upper Basin and Lower Basin states — via terms established in a 1922 compact. Individuals and businesses within those states are allocated water by the doctrine of prior appropriation, which, in Colorado, was established in 1876. The prior appropriation doctrine grants permanent rights to (surface) water on a first come, first served basis, more frequently known as “first in time, first in right” — although the true first-comers, Native Americans, were excluded from the doctrine and only secured water rights through a series of lawsuits throughout the 20th century.



There are many faults with the 1922 Colorado River Compact and prior appropriation doctrine, but one of the greatest is that the river is perpetually over-allocated. In fact, the Colorado River is dammed and diverted to such an extent that most years it fails to reach the Pacific Ocean. When government officials estimated how much annual flow was available for use back in 1922, they settled on 20 million acre-feet — nearly double the approximately 12 million acre-feet flowing through the river today.
Three-quarters of water diverted from the Colorado River irrigates farmland, and 62% of that is used for hay to feed dairy and beef cows in the U.S., China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. Over the years, existing water rights have been concentrated into fewer hands. About 20 farming families, producing mostly hay, control about 15% of the water allocated to Lower Basin states. One family in California’s Imperial Valley uses more water than the entire Las Vegas metropolitan area annually — again, mostly to grow hay.
Climate change is exacerbating the Colorado River water shortage by extending droughts and aridifying the Southwest. That’s why the $150 million appropriated to Colorado for water projects to improve drought resiliency, ecosystem conservation, and aging infrastructure is so essential. The projects — awarded to coalitions of local governments, tribes and nonprofits — would benefit agriculture, recreationists, municipalities, endangered species … and ultimately all of the stakeholders reliant upon the Colorado River. The Trump administration’s decision to withhold the funding while re-reviewing the projects benefits nobody and hurts everybody, thereby instigating a true bipartisan effort to release the funds.
The money allocated to Colorado’s water projects represents only a small portion of the $4 billion set aside in the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for Colorado River water conservation programs. Much of that money was spent on direct payments to farmers for not using their full “water rights” — instead, the farmers were compensated for letting acreage go fallow. This program and its sudden end under the Trump administration demonstrate several points. One, that the nation’s food supply does not rely on all farmers in the West maximizing their yields. Two, that local and state officials cannot rely on federal funding to solve the Colorado River water shortage. And, three, that voluntary solutions that work within the current framework of water allocation are not sustainable or sufficient in the long run.
Ultimately, the federal government should release the owed water project funding — what better use is there for taxpayer dollars than ensuring Western communities have access to plentiful drinking water, vibrant ecosystems and healthy economies? But also, the only way to truly confront this water crisis is a paradigm shift; a reallocation of the river’s water, not just among states, but also uses. The prior appropriation doctrine was designed to stimulate industrial and colonialist expansion. It’s an inappropriate framework to handle modern priorities of sustainability, conservation and equity. Undermining certain tenets of the doctrine is warranted.
Solutions — many of which are controversial — exist, like charging more for using water that isn’t beneficial to the region or country (e.g., irrigating alfalfa to feed Saudi Arabian cattle) or outlawing wasteful irrigation techniques. Bold policies are needed to preserve the remarkable Colorado River and life in the West. Stakeholders must rethink current systems of water allocation.

That’s how Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said he imagined it during the sergeant’s public funeral Friday, in front of about 3,000 people at Utah State University’s Dee Glen Smith Spectrum arena. Cox never met Sorensen, but officers from the small Tremonton-Garland Police Department can attest to it. 
Sorensen was there for his fellow officers’ rough days, and also right after the births of their children. Officers and family members described him as a patient voice, and a person many in the Tremonton-Garland community could rely on.

“Lee was a true hero. Even on that fateful night, Lee stood for everything the men in blue stand for. Lee did his job. Lee did what was asked of him,” his brother Will Sorensen said. “You’ll never find a kinder, (more) loving person than Lee. I guarantee it.” 
The service had several speakers both from Sorensen’s family and the station. Many wore blue ribbons on their chest, and almost none could contain tears while speaking of his life.
Two officers killed, sheriff’s deputy wounded responding to domestic violence call in Tremonton

Sorensen received his bachelor’s degree in agriculture from Utah State University this year, fulfilling one of his lifelong goals. He always had multiple jobs. He was a jokester, and a peacemaker with a special skill to de-escalate any fight, Will Sorensen said. 
“He cared about everybody, he cared about his community, he cared about his family,” Will Sorensen said, telling stories he had heard over the past two weeks about his brother, and how he walked women leaving their late-night shifts to their cars, or took time out of his day to talk with drivers about the importance of wearing a seatbelt. “That is caring, that is loving, that is Lee.”
That lively memory remains after Sorensen and officer Eric Estrada were killed on Aug. 17 while responding to a domestic violence incident. An autographed closed-up photo of his face — that he printed as a joke — still hangs at the department. And this year, during the Box Elder County Fair, everyone thought about him and Estrada at the sight of two riderless horses brought out during the rodeo in their honor.

Among the many jobs Sorensen had, was a role as an investigator for the Office of the Medical Examiner, a place that Cox described as a “tough place with very strong people. People who see the worst tragedies every single day.”
A day after Sorensen’s killing “they weren’t the stoic people I knew,” Cox said. “The tears were flowing.” That same day was also Sorensen’s 31st wedding anniversary with his wife, Lanette, Cox learned then. 
“(When) I became governor, and I realized, that literally, I have people who wear the badge whose job it is to protect me and my family, to take a bullet for us. Then I realized that’s not just something the governor gets. That’s something that every person in Utah gets,” Cox said. “I’m in a room full of people who put a badge on every day, a badge that says, ‘I will take a bullet for you.’”
Sorensen died while responding to a domestic violence incident from a home near Bear River High School with Estrada, whose funeral was Thursday.
According to court documents, the officers were responding to 911 hang-up calls when 32-year-old Ryan Michael Bate emerged from the house with a “high-powered rifle,” killing one of the two officers. It’s still uncertain which officer arrived at the scene first. Bate immediately shot the second other officer that arrived at the home, killing him as well.
A sheriff’s deputy and his police service dog were also shot that day and are in recovery.
After the shootings, investigators said they learned Bate had slammed his wife’s head into a doorframe, grabbed her throat, pinned her down and threatened to kill her. He’s now facing 20 separate charges, including aggravated murder, a capital offense in Utah. Box Elder County prosecutors announced they will pursue the death penalty if Bate is convicted.

A life of sacrifice
What made Sorensen a remarkable member of the community wasn’t only defined by what happened that final night, Cox said. But, what he did every day before.
“Lee was not just willing to take a bullet for all of us,” Cox said, “Lee was willing to wear out his life in service to all of us.”
Sorensen is survived by his wife Lanette, his children Lacee and Landon, and many cousins, nieces and nephews — so many that dozens of them performed a musical number during the service as a choir. 
Tremonton-Garland Police Chief Dustin Cordova described Sorensen as “sharp-witted, thoughtful, always prepared and never afraid to speak up for those around him.” Also as someone who never missed an opportunity to teach. 
“Today we mourn our brother, who gave everything in the service of others. He sacrificed himself to protect an innocent life that night and he will forever be our hero,” Cordova said. “His bravery is not just a memory. It’s a torch passed to us.”

This is the third time that Castillo, who is running for a city council seat this year, has been arrested and accused of harvesting voters’ ballots during the 2019 and 2023 Democratic primary elections in Bridgeport.
The Connecticut Chief State’s Attorney’s office posted a press release late Friday afternoon that accuses Castillo of illegally taking possession of four voters’ absentee ballots during the September 2023 primary, when he was on the ballot and was campaigning in support of Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim.
Frank Riccio, Castillo’s defense attorney, did not return a call on Friday. 
The new charges will add to the felony counts that Castillo is already facing in Superior Court.
Catillo has become one of the most well-known defendants to be charged with abusing Bridgeport’s absentee voting system because of his position on the city council and because he has been accused of mishandling absentee ballots in back-to-back mayoral elections.
He is not alone, however. Castillo is just one of 11 people who have been charged with defrauding the absentee voting system in Bridgeport as part of a growing criminal investigation led by the Chief State’s Attorney’s office. 
The city became the poster child for absentee ballot fraud after several political operatives, including the vice chairwoman of the city’s Democratic party, was captured on video allegedly depositing stacks of absentee ballots into drop boxes ahead of the 2023 election.
A Connecticut judge eventually overturned that 2023 election between Ganim and his Democratic challenger John Gomes because of that video footage, which he described as “shocking” evidence of “blatant” ballot harvesting.
Only one of the 11 defendants has resolved their criminal case by pleading guilty to the charges filed against them to this point.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A new report shows that Ethics Commission complaints that don’t require a full investigation are usually closed in fewer than six months.
The commission was directed by the 2025 Legislature to compile annual reports to help the public understand how it operates — especially in light of ongoing concerns from state officials that the agency takes too long to resolve baseless allegations.
The first-of-its-kind document released Friday highlights the commission’s work since its inception in 2019, with a special focus on the fiscal year that began on July 1, 2024, and ended June 30, 2025.
Over the last six years, the commission has received a total of 158 complaints. Of those, 106 have been closed, the report states.
It says most complaints were dismissed without requiring an official investigation.
Voters created an ethics commission in North Dakota. Then the Legislature limited its power.

The report indicates that these complaints have typically been tossed out in a matter of months. The quickest to be dismissed were those identified as falling outside the commission’s jurisdiction. In this scenario, the commission concludes that the individual accused of unethical behavior and/or the alleged wrongdoing is not subject to the board’s regulatory authority.
Complaints thrown out for lack of jurisdiction were typically closed within 29 days, the report states. Ethics Commission Executive Director Rebecca Binstock noted in a Wednesday meeting that the reason such complaints aren’t resolved sooner is because a vote by the commission — which meets once a month — is required for them to be dismissed.
Other complaints required a preliminary review before the commission determined they should be tossed. These complaints took an average of 68 days to be closed, according to the report.
Before complaints get to the investigation stage, state law allows the person who filed the allegation to try to arrive at an informal settlement with the accused. The annual report indicates that to date, this has not been an effective method of addressing complaints. As of the report’s publication, only two complaints had been resolved this way. They took an average of 98 days to close.
One of those two informal resolutions, which was disclosed last summer, required the North Dakota School Boards Association to no longer partner with the international exchange program Global Bridges. The content of the complaint was not made public. Former Sen. Ray Holmberg, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison earlier this year for a sex crime related to traveling to the Czech Republic, went on several state-subsidized trips to Europe through Global Bridges.
The Legislature this year amended state law to allow the Ethics Commission to negotiate informal settlements directly with the accused.
North Dakota Ethics Commission makes first finding of violations by public official

According to the report, the time it took the commission to dismiss complaints at the initial review stage varied widely from year to year. The shortest average time was eight days in 2021, though this was before the commission experienced a large uptick in complaint filings in 2022. The longest average times were 154 days in 2023 and 153 days in 2024.
So far in 2025, it has taken an average of 43 days for complaints to be dismissed at the initial review, the report indicates.
Between Jan. 1 and June 30, there were 74 complaints filed with the commission — more than any other year. A total of 52 complaints were pending.
The report also includes three policy recommendations that the commission believes will make the state government more transparent:

Requiring registered lobbyists to provide email addresses to help the Ethics Commission better communicate with them
Requiring state leases to be subject to a competitive bidding process
Improving the commission’s rule-making process to provide “ample opportunity for interactive discussion and revision prior to final adoption”

Binstock said the commission would like to have a more rigorous public comment process — like hosting multiple public hearings in multiple locations, for example — but it’s unclear if state law allows this.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Accomplishments highlighted by the commission in the report include:

Resolving eight complaints involving Rep. Jason Dockter, finding the lawmaker had committed three ethics violations related to a conflict of interest
Issuing eight advisory opinions as of June 30 giving officials guidance on ethical gray areas
Putting on dozens of  educational workshops and presentations that reached an estimated audience of more than 1,000 people

The Ethics Commission was established in 2018 by a voter-initiated amendment to the state constitution. It’s tasked with promoting ethical behavior in the areas of elections, transparency, corruption and lobbying.
During the 2025 Legislative session, some lawmakers voiced concerns that they believe the Ethics Commission is being weaponized by people who lodge frivolous complaints against their political opponents. 
Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, supported an amendment that would have forced the commission to dismiss complaints not resolved after 180 days. He noted some complaints have taken more than two years to address. The amendment ultimately failed.
“It’s just a matter of fairness to the accused,” Nathe said previously. “They shouldn’t have to sit there with this hanging over their head for years at a time.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The Trump administration has agreed to release $184 million for AmeriCorps, the federal agency for service and volunteerism, after a coalition of 22 attorneys general and two governors sued in April.
The coalition, including New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, challenged the administration’s plans to eliminate 90% of AmeriCorps’ workforce, cancel contracts and close $400 million worth of programs the agency supports, Platkin’s office said in a statement.
AmeriCorps, a federal agency signed into law in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton, places roughly 200,000 members across the United States at 35,000 service locations, according to current agency data.
It supports national and state community service programs by funding and placing volunteers in local national organizations that address critical community needs. It also provides support for organizations to recruit and supervise volunteers.
Members serve in schools, local governments and with a wide range of nonprofits that focus on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans.
The frozen funding has created uncertainty for AmeriCorps programs across the country.
“When the Trump Administration targeted AmeriCorps and hurt communities across our state, we vowed to fight back, and today we have won,” Platkin said. “The funding we have secured for AmeriCorps will help New Jersey residents and ensure that AmeriCorps’ volunteers – who help our state at no cost – are still able to perform their critical responsibilities. We will never stop fighting for New Jersey when this Administration or anyone attempts to hurt our state – and we will continue to deliver results for our residents.”
In June, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated hundreds of AmeriCorps programs that were unlawfully canceled and barred the agency from making further cuts without going through a formal rulemaking process.
The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), however, continued to withhold more than $184 million for service programs for seniors and those awarded highly competitive federal grants. The coalition filed an amended lawsuit in July and requested another preliminary injunction to release the remaining funds, Neronha’s office said.
The Trump administration’s deadline to respond was Thursday.

Oh Thursday, the government said the funds — nearly $185 million — is headed to the states after all.","Former AmeriCorps service member Daniel Zare, 27, visits Project CHANGE at Sligo Middle School on Monday, Aug. 11, 2025 in Silver Spring, Maryland, where he mentored students before federal government cuts in April. (Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Maryland was one of more than two dozen states that argued earlier this month that the federal government was “secretly” withholding millions of dollars in AmeriCorps funding, representing a second round of cuts to the national service program since April.
Now, federal officials say that funding — totaling nearly $185 million — is heading out to the states after all.
AmeriCorps officials said in a filing Thursday in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, that the $185 million represents the remainder of the funding appropriated by Congress for AmeriCorps in the current fiscal year. AmeriCorps pledged to apportion the funds by Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal 2025.
The unlocked funding will go to several different service programs nationwide, including AmeriCorps Seniors, which connects Americans 55 and up with service opportunities, including helping children learn to read, assisting the elderly and responding to natural disasters. Some will go to state-level service commissions, too.
At least $2 million of the $185 million is bound for Maryland, court records show. It will go to programs such as the Maryland Reading Corps, which provides children with literacy tutors, and Frostburg State University’s ASTAR program, through which AmeriCorps members contribute to educational programming, food pantries, health care and more in rural Western Maryland.
In a news release Friday, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown held the new development up as a win for his office, which leads the multistate lawsuit against cuts to AmeriCorps, originally filed in late April.
Maryland, other states expand lawsuit against Trump administration over AmeriCorps

“This is a major victory for Maryland’s most vulnerable and the AmeriCorps members who serve them,” Brown said Friday. “This outcome provides security for the programs and dedicated AmeriCorps members who tutor and mentor struggling Maryland students and give food to Marylanders who need it. By protecting these programs, we are defending the wellbeing of thousands of Marylanders who depend on this critical support to live full, healthy lives.”
Besides Maryland, other parties to the suit include the District of Columbia and the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
The AmeriCorps saga began in April, when Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, placed an estimated 85% of headquarters staff at AmeriCorps on leave, and dismissed thousands of AmeriCorps members completing community service projects across the nation. The decision was based on issues uncovered in recent financial audits of the national service organization, White House officials said.
In Maryland, the abrupt termination devastated AmeriCorps members who were busy serving inside state parks, educational centers and other institutions. The Maryland-led lawsuit, challenging an estimated $400 million in cuts, came shortly thereafter.
By early June, a Maryland federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, stating that AmeriCorps would have to temporarily reverse the cuts in the 24 jurisdictions that filed suit while the litigation proceeded. The injunction did not impact cuts in other states, or the staffing reductions at AmeriCorps headquarters.
But earlier this month came another wrinkle.
The states reported in a filing that the federal Office of Budget and Management was “ refusing to release tens of millions of dollars that Congress already appropriated, and that AmeriCorps chose to award to service programs for fiscal year 2025.”
They requested another preliminary injunction from the court, arguing that the funding was being withheld unlawfully, and it should be restored.
The feds were due to reply on Thursday, and that’s when they filed an update, stating that the $185 million was being released.
Attorneys for the Justice Department  wrote that “in light of this development, the Parties are conferring about the appropriate next steps in this litigation, including whether the preliminary injunction motion still requires the Court’s resolution or whether it may be withdrawn.”

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.
While the amounts are much smaller, three New England ports also lost funding. Bridgeport was one of the ports. It had $10.5 million withdrawn for an offshore wind project that had been planned, but abandoned nearly two years ago.
In Rhode Island, more than $11 million was pulled from the Port of Davisville at Quonset Point. Quonset has been part of earlier offshore wind projects and is currently in use for the construction of Revolution Wind, the joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is 80% complete, but was put on hold a week ago by the Trump administration. The funding was for upgrades to the existing facility.
Nearly $34 million was pulled from a major project in Salem, Massachusetts. The plan had been to reconstruct an area around a gas plant there as a major offshore wind staging area.
“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”
The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change. 
President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.
California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.
Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”
The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.
Other wind projects are also being halted
Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.
The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are. 
Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.
Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.
Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.
Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices
Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects. 
“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.
Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings. 
Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.
Critics say climate and jobs are at risk
Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.
Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.
“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”
Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.” 
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong has also initiated legal action against the stop-work order on Revolution Wind. He notified the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that he is adding the stop-work order to an existing challenge to President Trump’s January 20 memorandum that halted all federal approvals for offshore and onshore wind projects on federal land.
“We’ve got billions of dollars in investment and a project on the finish line to deliver affordable, American-made, renewable energy right off the coast of Connecticut. There are more than 1,000 jobs on the line,” Tong said in a statement. “We’re notifying the court now that Trump’s irrational stop to Revolution Wind will jack up energy bills, hurt workers, and weaken our grid.” 
The case includes Tong and 18 other attorneys general. A court hearing on a motion for summary judgment was already scheduled for September 4.
Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) With less than a week before his scheduled firing squad execution, the Utah Supreme Court ruled in favor of death row inmate Ralph Menzies on Friday, effectively repealing his execution warrant. 
Now, the 67-year-old with dementia will receive another evaluation to determine whether he is competent to be executed. That means his Sept. 5 execution will be delayed, and there’s a possibility that it will never happen. 
It’s a major twist after more than a year of debate surrounding Menzies’ mental decline. Menzies was sentenced to death in 1988 for the murder of Maurine Hunsaker, but his attorneys have argued that his dementia has progressed, making him ineligible to be executed. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Death row inmates in the U.S. must have a “rational understanding” of why they’re being executed, per both state and federal law — that means they must understand the government’s reasoning for pursuing the death penalty, and know that their crime is particularly heinous.
Menzies’ attorneys say he doesn’t meet that bar. But earlier this year, Utah 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates ruled that Menzies, despite having dementia, was competent enough to be executed. The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole also denied Menzies commutation. 
The Utah Supreme Court marked Menzies’ final appeal. And in a 23-page ruling issued Friday afternoon, the justices wrote Menzies’ “vascular dementia and its progressive effects call into question whether he remains competent to be executed.” 
The question before the state’s high court was whether Menzies should get another competency evaluation. Several doctors and medical experts evaluated Menzies last year, and over several days presented their findings to Bates, who ruled in June that the execution should move forward. 
In July, Menzies’ attorneys filed a petition for another competency review, arguing that his dementia had worsened since the initial evaluations, which were done last year. Bates denied that request on Aug. 14 — last week, Menzies’ attorneys made their appeal to the Utah Supreme Court. 
The ruling on Friday “requires the district court to reevaluate his competency.” 
“We reverse the district court’s order denying Menzies’s petition for reevaluation, vacate the warrant of execution and remand to the district court for further proceedings,” the ruling reads. 
In a statement, Menzies’ attorneys celebrated the ruling, telling Utah News Dispatch they look forward to making their case as to why the death row inmate is no longer competent to be executed. 
“We are pleased that the Supreme Court has ensured Mr. Menzies will not be executed without the benefit of an updated, independent competency evaluation,” said Lindsey Layer, one of Menzies’ attorneys. “It has been more than a year since his last evaluation, during which time his dementia has significantly worsened. He’s tethered to an oxygen tank, uses a wheelchair, is confused and disoriented, and no longer understands why the State of Utah is trying to kill him.” 
Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, said in a text message his family is “distraught and disappointed” and asked for privacy. The Utah Attorney General’s Office said it is reviewing the decision, and had no statement as of Friday afternoon. The Utah Department of Corrections said it would be releasing a statement soon.

The town claimed in its decision the applicants provided “unreliable” and “misleading” traffic information regarding the proposal to build an Amazon distribution facility in Saxon Hill.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Representatives for Amazon are appealing the Essex Development Review Board’s July decision to nix an application to build a 107,000-square-foot warehouse in town.
The applicant “has failed to meet its burden by providing incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable information on critical traffic issues,” the town board’s decision, published July 17, states.
Gravel & Shea PC, representing Scannell Properties and Allen Brook Development Inc., filed the appeal dated Aug. 15 in the environmental division of Vermont Superior Court, according to documents shared with VTDigger.
“We’ve filed an appeal to thoughtfully address the concerns raised by the Essex Development Review Board, because we believe our traffic analysis is thorough and that our proposal fully meets local requirements,” Amber Plunkett, a spokesperson for Amazon, wrote in an emailed statement Friday.
Town officials received notification of the filing from their lawyers on Aug. 21. A hearing date has not yet been set.
Named Project Moose, the site plan for the application outlines a 107,000-square-foot facility and 500 parking spaces at 637 Kimo Drive on 22.94 acres of mostly vacant and wooded land in the Saxon Hill Industrial Park off Thompson Drive. If built, it would be the first Amazon facility in Vermont.
“With the applicant’s appeal of that decision, the project now goes to the State’s Environmental Court and the Town will await the court’s decision,” Town Manager Greg Duggan wrote in an email Friday.
A court hearing would give Amazon “a second bite at the apple” and community members the opportunity to reassert their arguments, this time in a judicial forum, according to Jared Carter, one of two lawyers representing Essex residents opposed to the project. In response to the project, residents have formed a nonprofit called ACRES —  Alliance of Concerned Residents Envisioning Solutions.
“Of course we’re disappointed that Amazon has decided to appeal this despite the fact that the DRB, I think, pretty resoundingly said no. It’s certainly their legal right to do,” Carter said.
Starting over
The legal review is independent of the board vote, however, which essentially means starting over, he added.
Residents who remain opposed to the project are ready to argue why the proposed project should be rejected.
“The story unfolding in Essex is nothing short of a modern David vs. Goliath,” said resident Lorraine Zaloom in a statement on behalf of ACRES. “Our town’s Development Review Board made a sound decision in rejecting Amazon’s proposed warehouse, citing serious concerns that remain unresolved.”
After protests, heated debates and objections from residents during extensive public testimony this summer, the town’s project review board issued its 4-2 vote July 17 denying the site plan proposed by Scannell in the Saxon Hill Industrial Park.
The basis for the board’s denial was the project’s failure to comply with town zoning regulations, and particularly, its “failure to meet the burden of proof by providing unreliable traffic data” that “fails to meet the Town’s standards for data quality and methodology,” according to the decision published last month.
The decision further states that the applicant did not provide additional information requested and provided “misleading” information about an alleged state review.
At the July 17 public hearing, the town board “was led to believe that the project’s traffic impacts had been reviewed and accepted by the Vermont Agency of Transportation,” the decision notes. Upon further investigation, town officials found the VTrans traffic engineer had not given an opinion on the applicant’s traffic study. 
“This admission revealed that a key state agency with expertise in traffic safety had not, in fact, reviewed the traffic analysis for this specific high-intensity proposal,” the decision states.
Residents who testified against the project remain opposed due to traffic, noise, pollution, stormwater management and other environmental and quality-of-life issues.
Town regulations exist to be implemented, not waived, reads the ACRES statement sent by Zaloom. Residents claim the Amazon proposal is unsafe, and puts drivers, pedestrians and school traffic at risk.
“It is still a terrible location in our community for large scale distribution, far from the interstate,” Zaloom stated. “Yet Amazon presses forward, relying on unlimited financial resources — and the local developer’s outsized influence — to steamroll local opposition under the guise of civic generosity, while acting in pursuit of profit.”
Patty Davis, one of the area residents who testified against the project, said she wants the developer to build an alternate access road to take potential traffic pressure and hazards off the nearby residential neighborhood where she lives.
“We are not moving. A permanent injunction from trucks accessing lower Sandhill Road is personally all I want ASAP no matter what company comes here. Why? Because, we live here!” she added.
Amazon says it is committed to serving the Burlington area with faster delivery and reliable service. 
“Beyond improving delivery service for Burlington-area families and businesses, this facility would bring new jobs and contribute to Essex’s economic growth. We look forward to continuing the conversation and sharing more about the positive impact this project can have for the community,” Plunkett wrote in the statement.

The Anthony Timberlands Center for Design and Materials Innovation is a nearly 45,000-square-foot, primarily mass timber building that includes wood and metal fabrication workshops, a 3D printing lab, external fabrication yard and lecture hall. More than 62,100 cubic feet of Arkansas timber was used in the $43 million facility, which is part of the Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design.
Mass timber buildings are constructed with large pre-manufactured, multilayered, solid wood panels that make for efficient construction and enables disassembly and material repurposing, which contributes to waste reduction and extends the lifetime of carbon stored in these wood products, according to the American Wood Council. 
The new applied research center is focused on Arkansas timber and wood products, and offers students hands-on experience with innovative design and construction materials, according to a university press release. The center will also serve as a research and development lab for construction technologies and affordable housing. 
Deacue Fields, vice president for agriculture in the UA’s Division of Agriculture, told the more than 300 people who attended Friday’s dedication that the new building provides a space for education, research and innovation that can help transform communities. 
“This is a concept of integrative research and educational outreach on which the land-grant university was actually founded,” Fields said. “This facility has a vision to utilize local timber resources to address the tremendous need of affordable housing in our state and in our nation.”

Affordable housing is a big issue in Northwest Arkansas where the population has been rapidly expanding. The need for regional leaders to work together to address the area’s worsening housing crisis is more urgent than it was five years ago, according to a report released in May. 
John Folan, head of the architecture department and director of the Urban Design Build Studio, said he’s been looking at mass timber and how it can be used to address workforce housing issues in Northwest Arkansas. 
“As the population grows here and the economic forces of that population expand, then people who are in lower income sectors, maybe essential workers at the $16 to $18 an hour payscale, are finding it more and more difficult to find housing close to jobs, close to resources,” he said. 
To address the issue, Folan said they’ve been developing mass timber strategies, specifically one called “design to income.” This strategy involves considering the cost of land, materials and labor and then backing “into the size of home that somebody can actually afford to build,” he said.
Folan and his students have constructed prototypes in their lab and will build one in the newly dedicated center in a few weeks, he said. They’ve been using a mass timber construction system called wave layered timber that doesn’t use adhesives and allows wood to be shaped and stacked “stick by stick,” he said. 
The benefits of this process, Folan said, is it creates a long-lasting durable shell, allows him to train a workforce and uses a renewable resource. 
Forestland covers nearly 57% of Arkansas, which has the second most timber-dependent economy in the nation, according to the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. About 4% of the state’s gross domestic product relies on forest industries, and forestry contributes more than $7.27 billion to the state’s economy according to the U.S. Forest Service. 
Folan said they’ve been working with Northwest Arkansas municipalities to identify underutilized land that would be good sites for the prototypes they’re building. He’s been working with the city of Fayetteville to install six of these homes, which will be built on site, on land near Wilson Park.
“It takes populations in that income sector and puts them in a mixed-income environment where there are lots of community assets,” he said. 
Noting that “there’s no single solution to the housing crisis,” Folan said they’ll use shavings created as a byproduct from the wave layered timber process to 3D print structures in southern Arkansas where they don’t have the needed labor force. 
“There’s a huge opportunity that a building like this affords us because it becomes the shelter for doing all the experimental work … there are a lot of projects that are underway and we’re so excited to be in here and really can’t get moving fast enough,” Folan said.

(Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Families and leaders of Evergreen Public Schools in southwest Washington hope students will return to school on Tuesday after a week-long delay due to a classified workers strike. 
But officials of the 22,000-student district in Vancouver have yet to come to an agreement with over a thousand union members demanding that the district address critical understaffing and adequately compensate paraeducators. 
Union leaders say members will not return to work without a contract. 
Members of Public School Employees of Washington SEIU Local 1948 began their strike Aug. 26 following months of failed contract negotiations. The union represents 1,400 paraeducators, bus drivers, security officers, maintenance workers and other classified staff at Evergreen Public Schools,
This is the first strike in its 57-year history. 
The Evergreen Education Association, which represents about 1,500 teachers in the district, conducted a seven-day strike in 2023 over wages, special education staff support and planning time. 
Members of the teachers union are supporting their colleagues by not crossing the picket line. 
Evergreen Public Schools delayed the start of the school year from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2 in response to the classified workers walkout.
“The district will continue to bargain with the union in good faith in order to reach a fair agreement that is affordable and sustainable under our current budget conditions,” Superintendent Christine Moloney said Thursday in a written statement on behalf of the district.
The district hopes to reach an agreement with the union before the new start date, Moloney said. 
The district has been understaffed for many years, which has resulted in classified employees being stretched thinner than is safe for them and the students in their care, said Mindy Troffer-Cooper, president of the Evergreen chapter of the union.  
Paraeducators at the middle and high school level have been donating their time to help their colleagues with school bus pickups and drop offs and other situations where understaffing would cause danger to students and staff.  
The union tried to negotiate a fix into last year’s contract, which resulted in classified staff working without a contract for five months before they ultimately agreed to sign one that didn’t address their concerns. 
On its website, the district states that it would like to see negotiations continue while school is in session. 
Union members also want to return to work, Troffer-Cooper said, but not at the expense of a bad contract or a repeat of last year’s bargaining experience. 
“We decided that we were not going to go that route this time,” Troffer-Cooper said. “It was not fair to the membership to work that long without a contract and work for an employer that didn’t value their employees.” 
Negotiations began in March. 
The district presented an offer to the union on Wednesday that Troffer-Cooper said was “regressive in nature.” 
The Clark College Association for Higher Education has scheduled a solidarity rally on Labor Day, where Troffer-Cooper will speak alongside state Rep. Monica Stonier, an instructional coach in Evergreen Public Schools, and state Sen. Adrian Cortes, a special education teacher in the Camas School District.
Contract talks at other districts  
Vancouver Public Schools also have yet to reach an agreement with its classified employees, but bargaining is continuing while school is in session. 
Students returned to class on Tuesday, Aug. 26. 
The Vancouver Education Association held a bargaining support rally on Thursday. 
The La Center School District and its teacher’s union are in a similar arrangement, with contract negotiations continuing after students returned to school on Tuesday. The latest round of proposals was exchanged Thursday. 
In the Spokane area, educators in the Mead School District are approaching the start of the school year on Sept. 2 without a contract. 
Members of the Mead Education Association voted Thursday to authorize a strike if an agreement isn’t reached by Aug. 31. 
“While we all want to be back in our classrooms with our students, we must have the supports we need to effectively teach them,” the union said in a social media post after Thursday night’s vote. 
The 625-member association represents all non-administrative school employees with certificates, including teachers, nurses, therapists and speech language pathologists.
Union supporters held rallies on Aug. 11 and Aug. 20. 
Educators want the district to reduce class sizes, provide more classroom support and address student safety concerns. 
The district and the union have been negotiating since May. 
“We’ve been at the table with the Mead Education Association for a considerable period of time, and we remain committed to good faith bargaining until we reach an agreement,” Superintendent Travis Hanson said Thursday afternoon, adding that the district looks forward to welcoming students back next week.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2469-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-29 17:57:45.215051

Parties released the set of agreements Friday which they say will hopefully dismiss the case mired in the U.S. Supreme Court for more than a decade.(Photo by Diana Cervantes for Source NM)Parties in a legal dispute over Rio Grande water filed settlement documents Friday that could end a lawsuit that has been mired before the U.S. Supreme Court for the last 12 years and cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.
The potential dismissal of the case would establish new rules in the stretch of Rio Grande below Elephant Butte, an area reshaped by water scarcity and agriculture.
The U.S. Supreme Court in June 2024 struck a previous proposed settlement crafted between New Mexico, Texas and Colorado, ruling in a 5-4 decision that the settlement unfairly excluded the federal government’s “unique federal interests,” and sent the parties back to the negotiation tables in 2024.
In May, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado and the United States announced they were close to a settlement.
The agreement released Friday will provide a measure of stability and truly end the conflict, New Mexico’s lead attorney in the case, Jeff Wechsler, told Source NM.
“I think it’s a fair and appropriate resolution of a number of longstanding disputes in the Rio Grande, and I’m hopeful that it will really be the foundation for continued water use and prosperity in the region in both states,” he said.
The parties provided the settlement to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Chief Judge D. Brooks Smith, who oversees the case as a special master. Smith set a Sept. 29 hearing in Philadelphia to consider the proposal. Following the hearing, Smith will write a recommendation to the U.S. Supreme Court, which holds the power to issue a final decision.
A series of droughts in the early 2000s spurred a slew of lawsuits between irrigation districts, local governments, state agencies and the federal Bureau of Reclamation over the splitting of the Rio Grande. The grievances carried into a 2011 federal lawsuit brought by New Mexico, which alleged the federal government’s operations of a network of dams, canals and irrigation ditches favored Texas farmers and shorted New Mexico its rightful Rio Grande water.
In 2013, Texas elevated the dispute to the U.S. Supreme Court, and alleged that New Mexico’s groundwater pumping from farming and development on the Rio Grande was taking tens of thousands of acre feet of water and violating the 87-year old compact between the states. The Supreme Court allowed the federal government to join the case in 2019.
In addition to the named parties, more than a dozen organizations factor into the case, including the cities of Las Cruces and El Paso; water utilities; farming groups; New Mexico State University and irrigation districts.
The four-part settlement resolves an overlapping series of disputes between:

Texas and New Mexico, by establishing a framework for water accounting; and a new formula for yearly targets, among other provisions;
New Mexico, the federal government and irrigation districts, which resolves water accounting issues and allows for transfers of water between the two irrigation districts for compact compliance;
New Mexico and federal government, thus ending claims that New Mexico pumping threatened the federal government’s responsibility to transfer water to Mexico and the irrigation district; and requiring New Mexico to cut groundwater pumping under a new plan;
and between the U.S. and the Elephant Butte Irrigation District, allowing for Rio Grande water to be used for purposes outside irrigation, while establishing compensation for farmers.

“This historic settlement allows New Mexico to maintain control of our water uses and adds flexibility to how we are able to meet our Compact requirements,” State Engineer Elizabeth Anderson said in a statement. “By working together with the local water users, the other states and the federal government, we have crafted a solution that meets the needs of all the parties.”
Wechsler said the key sign off from two regional irrigation districts — Elephant Butte Irrigation District and El Paso County Water Improvement District No. 1 — allows for groundwater users to continue using water.
“It really ends up being a huge benefit for the cities, the farmers, the water users down there,” Wechsler said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is considering calling the state Legislature into a special session to vote on an assault weapons ban and other gun control measures following a mass shooting in Minneapolis that killed two and wounded 18 others, a person close to the governor told the Reformer on Friday.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about Walz’s deliberations.
Walz’s office is expected to make an announcement related to the special session as soon as next week, the person said.
“It’s time to take serious action at the State Capitol to address gun violence,” Walz said in a social media post Friday afternoon. The governor offered no further details.
A shooter opened fire at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis on Wednesday, killing 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski and injuring 18 others, all children and senior citizens.
Federal, state and city Democratic lawmakers joined gun safety advocates Thursday to call for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.
New gun legislation would face an uphill climb in the closely divided Legislature.
Republicans — led by Speaker Lisa Demuth and who are strongly aligned with the gun rights movement —  have 67 members in the House, while Democrats count 66 in their ranks following the June assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman. Walz and DFL lawmakers are hoping the shooting of a church filled with schoolchildren would pressure Republicans to accede to new laws. A special election to replace Hortman in safely blue District 34B is Sept. 16.
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, dismissed the idea of a special election: “Republicans are committed to addressing the root causes of violence, supporting safe schools, and increasing access to mental health resources. Calling for a special session without even consulting legislative leaders is not a serious way to begin,” he said in a statement. “This is a partisan stunt from a governor who continues to engage in destructive political rhetoric.”
Absent new laws, Republicans would be forced to vote on the issue a little more than a year from a crucial midterm election when all 201 legislative seats will be on the ballot.
Democrats had control of the Legislature for two years and failed to pass a statewide ban on assault weapons. Democratic House Floor Leader Jamie Long of Minneapolis said he had the bill drafted but didn’t introduce it because he didn’t think they were ready.
“We’re ready now,” Long said Thursday. “It shouldn’t have taken tragedy coming to Minnesota to be ready.”
Democrats did pass a slate of gun control laws when they held power in 2023 and 2024. They instituted an extreme risk protection order, or “red flag,” law that allows family members or police to ask judges to take guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.
They also passed universal background check requirements on private gun sales as well as increased penalties for possession of converted machine guns and “straw purchases” when people buy guns for someone not legally allowed to possess them.
One gun safety measure — a ban on binary triggers which increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons  — was recently struck down by a judge because it passed in a monster, 1,400-page bill that violated the state Constitution’s requirement that laws are confined to a single subject.
Although a special legislative session would force Republicans to take potentially difficult votes on gun regulation, it would also give them an opportunity to propose legislation of their own. They could bring bills related to the latest wave of Medicaid fraud allegations, which were so significant in a housing stabilization program that Walz recently shuttered the entire program.
Given the apparent transgender identity of the shooter, Republicans could also be expected to bring forth anti-trans legislation. U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, 6th District Republican and House majority whip, told the New York Post this week that lawmakers should overturn a 2023 law that made Minnesota a trans refuge state.
Complicating matters, the state Senate is currently short two members until a Nov. 4 special election. Until then, the Senate is 33-32, with Democrats in control, but they can’t pass any bills without 34 votes.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The Trump administration has agreed to release $184 million for AmeriCorps, the federal agency for service and volunteerism, after a coalition of 22 attorneys general and two governors sued in April.
The coalition, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, challenged the administration’s plans to eliminate 90% of AmeriCorps’ workforce, cancel contracts and close $400 million worth of programs the agency supports, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha’s office said in a statement.
AmeriCorps, a federal agency signed into law in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton, places roughly 200,000 members across the United States at 35,000 service locations, according to current agency data.
It supports national and state community service programs by funding and placing volunteers in local national organizations that address critical community needs. It also provides support for organizations to recruit and supervise volunteers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Members serve in schools, local governments and with a wide range of nonprofits that focus on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans.
The frozen funding has created uncertainty for AmeriCorps programs across the country. In Pennsylvania, the agency funds 132 programs that deliver services in more than 1,000 locations. AmeriCorps invested $54.8 million in the commonwealth in 2023, but 32 grants were canceled as a result of Trump administration cuts this year.
In June, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated hundreds of AmeriCorps programs that were unlawfully canceled and barred the agency from making further cuts without going through a formal rulemaking process. 
The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), however, continued to withhold more than $184 million for service programs for seniors and those awarded highly competitive federal grants. The coalition filed an amended lawsuit in July and requested another preliminary injunction to release the remaining funds, Neronha’s office said. 
The Trump administration’s deadline to respond was Thursday. 
“Rather than oppose the states’ motion, the administration instead informed the court that OMB would release all withheld AmeriCorps funds … which AmeriCorps will distribute to programs nationwide, as quickly as possible,” Neronha’s office said in a statement.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco Friday ordered Secretary of State Wes Allen to report the Legislature’s intent on her previous order to redraw an Alabama Senate district in Montgomery by Sept. 4.
Manasco last week ordered Senate Districts 25 and 26 to be redrawn, ruling that they violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by giving Black voters less opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice than other voters. 
“The parties agree that if the Legislature proceeds in a manner that results in the Court undertaking the “unwelcome obligation of . . . impos[ing] a reapportionment plan,”… the Court will need to appoint a Special Master to prepare remedial plans for the Court to consider,” Manasco wrote Friday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Allen filed his intent to appeal Manasco’s order on Thursday, saying in part that he did not know if the Legislature intended to redraw the districts. That would have to happen in a special session, called by Gov. Kay Ivey, to meet Manasco’s requirement for the map to be ready in time for the 2026 midterm elections. Allen wrote in the Status Report Thursday that if called, a special session would likely happen in late September or early October.
“Given the logistics involved in calling a special session, and certain timing demands and waiting periods required by the legislative process, it is not known at this time if the Plaintiffs’ proposed deadline of September 22, 2025 would provide a realistic opportunity for the Legislature to act if it chooses to do so,” he wrote.
Gina Maiola, the communications director for Gov. Kay Ivey, wrote in an email Friday afternoon that the governor’s office is reviewing the opinion “and consulting with necessary parties.”
Should the court’s decision be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and redistricting maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s 2021 congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, leading to an odyssey that in 2023 resulted in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.   
Manasco will appoint Richard Allen as the Special Master, David Ely as his cartographer, and Michael Scodro and his law firm, Mayer Brown LLP, as the Special Master’s legal counsel if the Legislature does not redraw the map.

Mike Kehoe is convening a special legislative session to focus on gerrymandering and initiative petition changes (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers will return to the Capitol next week to gerrymander the state’s congressional map in the hopes of creating a new Republican seat. 
They will also debate putting a constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot that would make it harder for voters to change the constitution through the initiative petition process. 
Both proposals were included in the special legislative session agenda crafted by Gov. Mike Kehoe and announced on Friday. The move has been expected for weeks, with Missouri Republicans facing pressure from President Donald Trump to redraw U.S. House districts so the GOP can win more seats in next year’s midterm elections.
 “This is about clarity for voters and ownership of our future, and I hope the legislature will work together to pass our Missouri First Map and critically needed IP reform,” Kehoe said in a statement Friday afternoon.
Missouri has eight congressional districts, and Democrats hold two. The new map would split Kansas City, which is currently entirely in the 5th District and represented by 11-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, into three districts where Republicans would have an electoral edge. 
The intended result is a map where the GOP holds 90% of the state’s seats in the U.S. House.
“President Trump’s unprecedented directive to redraw our maps in the middle of the decade and without an updated census is not an act of democracy — it is an unconstitutional attack against it,” Cleaver said shortly after the proposed new map was revealed. “This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation.”
 Proposed congressional maps released Friday by the governor’s office.
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from St. Louis County, said the president’s motivation for the gerrymandering push is fear of voters seeing files related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.  
“If Democrats retake the House, they will release the Epstein Files, and this scares the hell out of President Trump,” Beck said. “That’s why the President has ordered Missouri to rubber stamp a rigged map drawn in Washington D.C. because he knows Missouri Republicans would rather protect pedophiles than say ‘no’ to Donald Trump.”
As for changes to the initiative petition process, Republicans are pushing a plan that would require a statewide majority and a majority vote in five of the state’s eight congressional districts in order to approve a constitutional amendment. 
Currently, a simple majority is all that is required.
Under that “concurrent majority” standard, analysis by The Independent last year found that as few as 23% of voters could defeat a statewide ballot measure.
The gerrymandering and initiative petition push will begin in the Missouri House next week, with the expectation that bills will be sent to the Missouri Senate for it to consider them during the legislature’s annual veto session on Sept. 10. 
Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers. The bills are unlikely to face any stumbling blocks in the House, but Senate Democrats are expected to use the filibuster and other procedural maneuvers to gum up legislative business as much as possible. 
In order to overcome the gridlock, Senate Republicans may once again have to break a filibuster and force a vote by turning to a rule that was previously rarely-used but got deployed twice during the regular legislative session in May. 
Doing so would create even more bad blood in a legislative chamber already teetering on the edge of full on partisan collapse and could upend the 2026 session before it even gets started. 
There are also questions about whether redistricting now would violate Missouri’s constitution. 
The Missouri Constitution calls for the legislature to draw new congressional districts every 10 years after new census numbers are certified to the governor. 
That happened in 2022, which attorneys Chuck Hatfield and Alix Cossette argue means new districts cannot be drawn until the next census is complete. 
“The plain language of the Missouri Constitution and the Missouri Supreme Court’s precedent make clear that mid-cycle congressional redistricting is prohibited,” Hatfield and Cossette, two longtime Democratic attorneys, wrote in a memo laying out issues with the GOP plan. “Any attempt to do so will draw a substantial legal challenge which will likely succeed and invalidate any map adopted by the General Assembly.”
There are also questions about whether relying on population data could also lead to a court throwing out any new map. 
Kehoe acknowledged the questions about the legality of the plan while speaking to reporters Friday morning. 
“I’ve heard opinions on both sides of that conversation,” he said. “It will get settled in due time.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052725_kehoe3-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-29 17:57:45.215051

Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.
Trump administration vows to ‘come after’ sanctuary states and cities, like Philadelphia

 
Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.  Philadelphia was on it.
Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”
Fewer than half of ICE arrests under Trump are convicted criminals

In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct.22.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-29 21:20:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi gym owner says she reported grooming concerns about gymnastics coach years before his arrest in sex abuse case,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/29/mississippi-gym-owner-concerns-gymnastics-coach/,Warning signs about gymnastics coach Sean Gardner were raised in Mississippi and Iowa long before he was banned from the sport.,"IOWA CITY, Iowa — Long before his banishment from gymnastics and arrest after accusations that he abused girls he coached, warning signs about Sean Gardner were coming from several directions — his former boss, his gymnasts and their parents.
The former boss in Mississippi says she brought her concerns about Gardner’s “grooming” behavior to USA Gymnastics, the sport’s national governing body. The parents and girls in Iowa described telling coaches of inappropriate behavior at Gardner’s new job at an academy there that produced Olympians and is owned by renowned coach Liang “Chow” Qiao.
Yet Qiao not only kept Gardner on the job — he promoted him.
Associated Press interviews with four parents whose daughters trained under Gardner and a letter obtained by the AP from Gardner’s former employer to clients at her gym revealed that concerns about the coach were reported to gymnastics authorities as far back as 2018 — four years before he was kicked out of the sport.
One girl told Qiao during a meeting in 2020 that she had been touched inappropriately by Gardner during training, but Qiao said any such contact was inadvertent and intended to save athletes from injury, a parent told AP.
“She felt totally invalidated,” the parent said of the response from Qiao, who built his reputation coaching Olympic gold medalists Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas and China’s women’s national team.
The watchdog responsible for investigating wrongdoing in Olympic sports confirmed to AP that Qiao and several other coaches were privately sanctioned for failing to report sexual misconduct allegations against Gardner after learning about them.
Qiao did not return AP emails and phone messages seeking comment. Gardner, 38, has been jailed since his Aug. 14 arrest pending federal court proceedings in Mississippi. He hasn’t entered a plea, and court records don’t indicate if he has a lawyer. He did not return AP messages seeking comment before his arrest.
Concerns at Chow’s Gymnastics were first raised in 2019

One parent recalled attending a 2019 meeting with the parents of two other girls with Qiao to discuss their daughters’ concerns, including that Gardner was making them uncomfortable in the way he touched them while spotting and by talking about inappropriate subjects.
The parent, like the others, spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to protect their daughters. The AP generally does not identify alleged sexual abuse victims.
The meeting came more than a year after Gardner’s former employer at a gym in Purvis, Mississippi, Candi Workman, said she discussed concerns with a USA Gymnastics attorney about “troubling behavior” involving Gardner’s “coaching and grooming behavior.”
Gardner was removed from the sport in July 2022 after the U.S. Center for SafeSport received a sexual abuse complaint and issued a temporary ban — a move it called “the only reason Gardner was barred from coaching young athletes” until his arrest.
The center forwarded that information to Iowa police, and it was another three years before the FBI arrested Gardner on charges of child sexual exploitation. Among the most damning evidence were allegations that he installed a hidden camera in the bathroom of the Mississippi gym to record girls as young as 6 undressing.
Gardner’s rise and the sport’s inability to root him out came even as news of Larry Nassar’s decades-long sexual abuse of gymnasts was in the headlines and gyms were implementing safeguards to better protect athletes. It was the inability of USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee to police predators, along with inaction by the FBI after learning of the abuse, that led to SafeSport’s founding in 2017.
“This is the same type of behavior where girls aren’t believed. They are cast aside. They are tamped down,” said Megan Bonanni, a lawyer who helped secure a $138.7 million settlement for Nassar’s victims over the FBI’s failures.
“What we’re seeing with Gardner, it’s multiple institutions failing to act with the urgency that child safety demands. … Local police, SafeSport, USA Gymnastics and this gym. All of them.”
Gardner’s former boss says she reported ‘troubling behavior’ in 2018
In her first comments on the case, Workman, the Mississippi gym owner, told gymnasts and their parents in a recent letter that she reported “troubling behavior” by Gardner to then-USA Gymnastics lawyer Mark Busby in January 2018.
Workman wrote that her concerns were related to “grooming,” which USA Gymnastics defines as a process where a person builds trust and emotional connections with a child for the purpose of sexually abusing them.
Workman did not elaborate on what she reported and hasn’t returned messages from AP seeking comment. Busby, whose job at the time related to athlete safety and is now in private practice, declined to comment when reached by AP.
The SafeSport center said it was notified by USA Gymnastics in January 2018 that one of its affiliated gyms had resolved a report involving Gardner. But the center said it didn’t investigate further because the report was not related to sexual misconduct and it did not receive detailed information.
Despite that, Gardner was able to leave Mississippi for a better job in another USA Gymnastics-affiliated facility — Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute, the West Des Moines, Iowa, gym that had become a mecca for top gymnasts.
Despite concerns at Chow’s, Gardner was promoted
Chow’s Gymnastics said Gardner passed a standard USA Gymnastics background check when he was hired in 2018.
Concerns about his behavior in the gym began soon after, yet Gardner was consistently given more responsibility. Girls in one training group pushed for other adults to intervene, which resulted in the 2019 meeting between parents and Qiao.
But not long after that meeting, Chow’s Gymnastics promoted Gardner in January 2020 to head coach of a key girls’ team, telling parents in an email obtained by AP: “He has demonstrated the leadership and put good effort to do his job well.” Gardner was also director of the Chow’s Winter Classic, a meet that draws hundreds of gymnasts to Iowa every year.
Chow’s Gymnastics kept Gardner on the payroll after he was arrested in August 2021 for second-offense drunken driving, a crash in which he ran another car off the road and his blood alcohol content recorded more than three times the legal limit for driving. Gardner was sentenced to a week in jail and two years of probation.
In a statement, Chow’s Gymnastics said it acted “promptly, responsibly and in full compliance” after it received notice in April 2022 that Gardner was to be barred from one-on-one or unsupervised contact with athletes while SafeSport investigated unspecified misconduct.
Chow’s Gymnastics said that it enforced those measures and removed Gardner as head coach. The gym said it fired Gardner in July 2022 after SafeSport strengthened Gardner’s restrictions to a temporary suspension from coaching and all contact with athletes.
“Although there had been no finding of misconduct at that time, Chow’s Gymnastics chose to err on the side of protecting its athletes,” the statement said.
SafeSport said the sanctions in 2022 against Qiao and the other coaches who failed to report sexual misconduct allegations included warnings, required education, probation, and suspension in one case.
The center does not normally comment about specific cases but said in a statement to AP that it has “the ability to correct the record in light of the recent public letter issued by Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute.”

Gym’s claim of prompt response infuriated parents
The gym’s statement infuriated some parents and former Chow’s pupils who said concerns about Gardner had been widely known. Several of Gardner’s students left the gym beginning in 2019 in what parents called a mass exodus.
The parents of one gymnast recalled witnessing Gardner touch another girl’s buttocks while standing behind her during practice. Gardner told the parents that his hand slipped by accident, and the father recalled warning Gardner that there “would be no accidents with my daughter.”
When that girl eventually quit the gym due in part to Gardner’s conduct, the father recalled restraining himself when Gardner came out to the parking lot to say he was sorry.
Bonanni, the attorney for survivors of Nassar’s abuse, said she is troubled by the slow response in the Gardner case and expects more victims to come forward.
“The damage caused by this kind of abuse is permanent, and it’s really long-lasting,” she said. “It changes the trajectory of a young person’s life.”

Kevin Stitt has joined a growing number of calls for the resignation of a state lawmaker who pleaded guilty Thursday to domestic abuse and assault.
Rep. Ty Burns, R-Pawnee, stepped down from his committee leadership position but not from elected office after pleading guilty to two incidents involving his wife and teenage daughter. He received a one-year suspended sentence and will have to complete a 52-week batterer’s intervention program.
“Representative Burns and his family are in my prayers, but at this time I urge him to step down from his position in the legislature,” Stitt said in a statement. “Domestic violence is a serious crime and should be treated as such. Being an elected official is a full time commitment to the public, and these serious convictions of recent abuse should demand full time attention to rehabilitation and reconciliation.”

Neither Burns nor his attorney, fellow Republican lawmaker Rep. Chris Kannady, of Oklahoma City, returned a request for comment on the governor’s remarks.
The Legislature’s Democratic leaders joined the Republican governor in urging Burns to step down.
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said her caucus was “shocked and horrified” when news broke this week of the investigation into Burns. Oklahomans deserve to know those in power are held to the same standard of accountability as everyone else, she said.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, echoed Munson’s comments.
“It is not appropriate for a member of the legislature to continue to serve after being convicted of abuse charges while in office,” Kirt said in a statement Friday. “We need to demonstrate as state leaders that we take domestic violence seriously and trust the survivors. The representative needs to dedicate his complete attention to treatment and recovery. Respectfully, it is time for him to resign.”
Burns, 46, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of domestic abuse and two misdemeanor counts of assault in Pawnee County District Court.
The domestic abuse charge resulted from his attempt to gouge out his wife’s eye with his finger over the Thanksgiving holiday last year, according to court documents. His wife suffered a broken blood vessel and couldn’t go to work for the next week, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation reported.
In a separate incident on April 25, he ran a van carrying his daughter off a road in Pawnee County, investigators reported. An OSBI agent reviewed a video of the incident and reported hearing Burns’ daughter saying, “He is literally about to kill us,” according to court records.
Burns said in a statement Thursday that he deeply regrets what happened and is prepared to be held accountable. He stepped down from leading an appropriations subcommittee focused on finance.
“I take full responsibility for my actions and have started a year-long batterers intervention program and am getting treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and learning how to deal with past experiences in a more healthy manner,” he said. “I know I must do better for myself and my family.”
Court records indicate this was Burns’ first criminal charge. He has worked in law enforcement, teaching, coaching and ranching and served 20 years in the military, including deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He received a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star and a Combat Infantry Badge for his military service, according to his House biography.
He was elected in 2018 to represent House District 35, covering parts of Pawnee, Payne, Creek, Noble and Osage counties.
State law assigns a penalty of up to a year in a county jail and a $5,000 fine for a conviction of domestic abuse. A conviction of assault is punishable by no more than 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Burns’ case was resolved unusually quickly. He was charged, pleaded guilty and was sentenced on the same day.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond said he took over prosecution of the case after the Pawnee County district attorney recused.

“These are serious charges,“ Drummond said. “While there is no excuse for domestic violence, I am encouraged that the representative has taken responsibility for his actions and will receive counseling under terms of his sentence. Domestic violence is tragically all too common in our state. It must stop.”
Unlike Stitt, the Republican leader of the state House has not publicly urged Burns to resign.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said “there is no place in society for domestic violence of any kind” but appreciated Burns “taking ownership for his actions and seeking treatment.”
When a public official pleads guilty to abuse, “it’s not just a private matter, it’s a breach of public trust,” said Oklahoma County Clerk Maressa Treat, who also serves as the board vice chair for the YWCA of Oklahoma City. The organization provides emergency services to victims of domestic violence.
Treat said she hopes Burns “gets the help he needs and respectfully resigns from the Oklahoma State House.”
“As someone who grew up in an abusive home, this news hits deeply,” she said. “My heart is with Rep. Burns’ wife and daughter. I hope they’re surrounded by the support they need to begin healing from this trauma. Their decision to seek justice is courageous and commendable.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Part of Montana’s effort to reduce overcrowding in its prisons can be found a few minutes outside of Boulder.
Gov. Greg Gianforte, along with Department of Corrections Director Brian Gootkin and Jefferson County Commissioner Cory Kirsch, toured the Riverside Special Needs Unit on Tuesday, which has been repurposed under a new state law.
The name of the unit reflects who used to be there — 25 inmates described by officials as “geriatric” were moved to a special unit at Montana State Prison to open up space in the facility.
Now, 50 women are imprisoned there and the state plans to add more.
“From an agency point of view, our agency has been neglected for decades, and thanks to this governor and the last two legislative sessions, we have had generational changes and investments in our agency,” Gootkin said Tuesday.
House Bill 833, a $250 million legislative package looking to address the overcrowding issue, paid for the project. The plan is to increase capacity at Riverside from 50 prisoners to approximately 100.

“Montanans count on state and local government to make sure our communities are safe and there are consequences of committing crimes,” Gianforte said. “If the state doesn’t build prisons, prisons are not going to get built.”
On Montana’s prison dashboard, the state’s Friday prison population was 3,419 of a capacity of 3,435. Montana State Prison, the state’s largest correctional facility, was about 100 inmates over capacity. Montana State Women’s Prison was eight inmates under capacity on Friday.
There were 57 people in jail awaiting transfer to a state prison on Friday, according to the state’s prison data dashboard.
At one point a mental institution, Riverside has picturesque views of the surrounding mountains from the prison’s grounds. At several points during the tour, inmates told state officials that this was a place where prisoners want to serve their sentences in.
Gootkin agreed.
“This is the incentive,” Gootkin said. “You want to come here, and so therefore you have to behave, you have to be in the programming.”
Inmates also expressed to state officials they thought having the large open space was a huge benefit. There is a grass, open area at the center of the facility. There’s a garden, greenhouse and a gym stocked with a variety of equipment. In fact, the biggest need, inmates told Gianforte while they spoke in the garden, was more jobs and work for them to do.
Gootkin said that this first group of prisoners to Riverside would also have a hand in renaming the prison.
Kirsch said the community is welcome to having new jobs, and said the area struggled after the Montana Developmental Center closed in 2017. He noted infrastructure was already in place for an expansion of the facility.Officials seemed to be eyeing the surrounding unbuilt ground for a potential expansion.
“I think this would be an easy, easy fix for the state right here,” Kirsch said Monday. “We’re close enough to Butte and Helena to bring in some, most of the workers, and we’ll work on housing here in the interim.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prison1-1024x574.jpg,,,2025-08-29 17:57:45.215051

Michelle Lujan Grisham, along with officials from XGS Energy and Meta pictured above, in June announced a high-profile geothermal energy project for the state. An XGS Energy executive earlier this month told lawmakers the initiative represents ""only a fraction"" of the electricity generated from the Earth's heat that it could bring online over the next five years. (Screengrab from Governor's Office live stream)New Mexico officials are seeking public input on their proposal to change the state regulation that governs private projects on state-owned land that convert naturally occurring heat found below ground into electricity.
The State Land Office said in a news release Thursday it expects the proposed rule to modernize and improve the agency’s process for issuing geothermal leases in response to an increase in demand.
New Mexico in 2013 amended the Geothermal Resources Act to limit what counts as a “geothermal resource” to be a renewable source of natural heat from the Earth that is above 250 degrees Fahrenheit. The law also required lease holders to pay both the base rent and royalties for any power generated and minerals or chemicals derived from a project.
The State Land Office said in an Aug. 22 explainer that the proposed rule is meant to align with the 2013 legislation.
Under the proposed rule, the State Land Office would be allowed to issue a geothermal lease for a period of up to five years for the purpose of exploration, in anticipation of a potential long-term lease that would last as long as the resource is producing or capable of producing heat “in commercial quantities.”
New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands Stephanie Garcia Richard said Thursday the public comment process will guide her office’s decisions about how to offer leases of state land “to tap this growing renewable energy potential.”
“New Mexico’s geothermal industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years — with the perfect combination of prime geology, technical expertise and a supportive regulatory environment,” Garcia Richard said in a statement. “We need to be ready to meet the growing demand for clean, sustainable energy.”
For example, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in June announced a new private investment in a geothermal plant or plants that will provide social media giant Meta’s New Mexico data centers with 150 megawatts of energy.
The project is expected to start generating power by 2030, XGS Energy Vice President and Head of Development Logan Stephens told the interim legislative Economic and Rural Development and Policy Committee on Aug. 11.
“It represents only a fraction of the broader opportunity here in the state, driven by that abundance of hot-rock geothermal resources, as well as an abundance of suitable land, both private, federal, state and tribal,” Stephens told the committee. “We believe the market opportunity for XGS in New Mexico over the next five years could be several thousands of megawatts. We’re really limited only by our ability to deliver that power to the grid and to the customers, and our ability to secure permits.”
The State Land Office’s public rulemaking hearing begins at 10 a.m. on Sept. 30 in Morgan Hall at the agency’s building at 310 Old Santa Fe Trail in Santa Fe.
Interested parties can also submit written public comments by emailing SLO-INFO@nmslo.gov by Sept. 26.
More information about the rulemaking, including links to the existing law and regulation, can be found on the State Land Office website.

(Photo courtesy of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, Miami Field Office)More cities and states have responded to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s threat to prosecute them over so-called sanctuary policies limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — some by thumbing their noses, at least one by acquiescing.
Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.

Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.
Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”

In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct.22.

That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.
Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.
“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”
The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects. 
“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”

The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.
Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.
Stuck in limbo
Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.
“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”
Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.
Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.
“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”

More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.
The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade. 
Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.
“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”
The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.
Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind. 
“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line. For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders. We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”
The U.S. Department of Transportation announced Friday it was pulling $679 million in federal infrastructure grants tied to 12 “doomed” offshore wind projects across the country. Among the casualties: an $11.2 million grant for Quonset Development Corp. to upgrade its port, improving terminal access for offshore wind projects along with strengthening resiliency against sea level rise.
Representatives from Quonset Development Corp. and Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Friday.
The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.” 
Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.
Judge Young is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing. A ruling will come at a later, unscheduled date.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-29 20:44:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As Revolution Wind stalls, CT’s clean energy workers are adrift",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/29/clean-energy-jobs-economy-ct-revolution-wind/,"Workers were pushed out of work, and the decision raised larger concerns about the Trump administration’s handling of ongoing projects.","When the Trump administration announced its Aug. 22 decision to halt a nearly-completed offshore wind project, alarm bells immediately went off for clean energy advocates and business leaders in Connecticut.
The Revolution Wind project, a 65-turbine clean energy initiative that would provide roughly 700 megawatts of energy to homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island, was expected to reduce energy costs in the region. The project is roughly 80% complete, with more than 1,200 workers involved in the effort. 
But with the project’s abrupt freeze, many of those workers have been pushed out of work, disrupting a source of high-paying local jobs and leaving local union workers searching for answers.
“A lot of building trades workers, a lot of union workers voted for Donald Trump and his team. But they didn’t vote to have union jobs shut down,” Patrick Crowley, the president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, told USA Today this week. “It shouldn’t work like this.”
The decision has also raised larger concerns about how the administration is handling already ongoing projects. 
“We were surprised that he shut down a project that’s 80% complete,” said Aziz Dehkan, the executive director of the Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs. “I could almost see him stopping nonpermitted or projects that are in the permitting process. But to close down a project that’s 80% complete seems to be a little out of line here.”
In the days since the project was halted, advocates for the Revolution Wind project and clean energy initiatives more broadly told The Connecticut Mirror that the incident raises concerns that go beyond a singular project. 
They also point to a broader climate of uncertainty that has been created by the past few months of policy changes affecting wind and solar programs. Those concerns have grown as the Trump administration reverses many of the energy policies of the Biden administration, including elements of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that provided incentives for clean energy projects around the country.
The uncertainty, advocates say, is contributing to further disruption in the industry as the clean energy sector shifts to avoid further setbacks from the federal government. The result could have serious economic implications, halting the industry’s once rapid job growth, limiting investments in new projects and curtailing the continued development of what clean energy supporters see as a vital part of America’s energy economy.
“Over the last six months, the landscape has really changed dramatically,” said Mike Trahan, executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association, which represents solar companies working in Connecticut. “How do you work your way through all those changes to stay competitive and stay in business?” 
A growing industry thrown into chaos
Connecticut isn’t at the top of the list when it comes to its clean energy workforce. The state ranks 27th in the nation, employing roughly 44,000 clean energy workers. That’s around 60% of all energy and motor vehicle jobs in the state, according to E2, a national organization focused on finding common ground between energy advocates and business groups. 
Still, the state has benefitted from recent investment in clean energy — largely defined as efforts to harness the power of wind, solar, and renewable energy sources — in the past few years. The Revolution Wind project, as well as various “Solar for All” initiatives, have fueled demand for a workforce skilled in clean energy technology, installation, manufacturing and storage. 
In recent months however, that has shifted.
“There’s been more than $22 billion worth of private sector investments in clean energy projects, ranging from offshore wind to electric vehicle production to solar panel factories, that have been canceled in just the past eight months alone,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Unfortunately, it looks like those numbers are going to continue in the wrong direction, which is bad for any of us who depend on electricity or, like, jobs in America.” 
Much of the industry has been at least in part affected by new policy changes in Washington. In January, the president issued an executive order calling for a halt to the disbursement of any remaining funds allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act. 
In July, passage of the Trump-supported budget reconciliation bill included a phase-out of federal tax credits that incentivized solar and wind. Earlier this month, news reports noted that the administration was also planning to claw back some $7 billion in grant money allocated to the Solar for All initiative, a national program to improve access to solar in low-income and disadvantaged communities.
Those changes, Keefe said, have put the potential economic benefits of solar and wind projects in jeopardy. 
“We saw what was truly an economic revolution in the making,” he said. “But now all of that has been put at risk because companies have no more market certainty given this current administration. The tax credits and the policies that they were told were going to be in place for 10 years have suddenly been pulled out from underneath them.” 
The shift has sparked concerns that the clean energy sector will contract significantly, impacting jobs and limiting the possibility of future projects. According to a June estimate from the Solar Energy Industries Association, earlier versions of the budget reconciliation bill would put some 330,000 “current and future jobs across the country” at risk. A separate state-by-state analysis from the group found that around 2,900 jobs in Connecticut could be impacted.
“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy,” SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement earlier this year.
A ‘psychological challenge’
In interviews this week, clean energy advocates and business experts voiced deep concerns about the Trump administration’s reversal of energy policy, framing the sudden halting of Revolution Wind as particularly alarming. But advocates stopped short of saying that the project’s abrupt pause is a harbinger of future economic difficulties in the industry or larger job issues in the state.
Rather, advocates argued that the changes add to an ongoing sense of uncertainty and instability in the clean energy sector more broadly. That uncertainty, they said, could ultimately prove as damaging as any policy changes, as companies retreat from clean energy projects and investors pull away to avoid issues with the federal government.
“That’s the psychological impact that really discourages people,” said Tony Sheridan, the president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut.
That concern was at the top of mind for Kyle Wallace, the then-vice president of public policy and government affairs of solar developer PosiGen, when he spoke to the Connecticut Mirror last month. “We’re just continuing to see an administration that is just actively hostile to renewables, and we had hoped that they would be more indifferent and not actively hostile,” he said. 
Wallace confirmed to CT Mirror this week that he was one of the employees affected by PosiGen’s recent announcement that it was laying off a significant number of its workforce, including 78 workers in Connecticut.
In a WARN notice announcing the layoffs, the company, which has been active in state “Solar for All” initiatives and focuses on providing solar to low-income and disadvantaged households that would be unable to afford it, cited financial difficulties as the main factor behind the layoffs.
“These business circumstances were not reasonably foreseeable and arose in an increasingly challenging economic environment that already has forced several other major companies in the renewables industry to cease or significantly reduce their operations,”  John Truschinger, the company’s chief administrative officer, explained in the notice. 
PosiGen did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.
The PosiGen layoffs have sparked further concerns about the state of the clean energy workforce in Connecticut, with some state lawmakers laying blame squarely at the feet of the federal government.
“President Trump talks a big game about standing up for the working man, but the truth is he’s left 78 Connecticut families without a paycheck,” Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said in a statement this week. “These are blue-collar jobs that built our clean energy future. Now they’re gone because Trump needed the money for tax cuts for billionaires and his corrupt circle.”
Others see the layoffs in a different light. Trahan of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association said he thinks ultimately, PosiGen “did everything right.” 
“I don’t think people should be looking at that as indicative of what the industry as a whole is facing,” Trahan said, noting that the organization faces specific funding issues. His organization is currently working with former Connecticut PosiGen employees to help them find work in the state.
Still, after a tumultuous few months, clean energy supporters, industry organizers and business group leaders say that companies will need to remain resilient if they plan to continue operating.
“If you want to be successful or you want to sustain your business, you’ve got to be willing to adapt to change,” Trahan said. “And that’s what they’re doing right now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-29 16:57:16.915709

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
President Donald Trump has revoked former Vice President Kamala Harris’ extended Secret Service protection as she prepares to head out on a book tour.
A senior White House official confirmed the decision, first reported by CNN, to The 19th. Former vice presidents typically get Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office, which would have been July 21 for Harris. Former Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff’s Secret Service protection ended July 21.
But before he left office, former President Joe Biden signed a previously unreported order extending Harris’ protection for an additional year, CNN reported.
Trump reversed Biden’s order, ending Harris’ protection effective September 1, according to a directive issued Thursday. Harris’ book tour begins September 24.
“You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” the directive said, per CNN.
Women of color in politics are subject to heightened risk of threats and harassment. Harris faces especially high scrutiny as the first woman and first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president and the first woman of color to be a major party presidential nominee.
“The Vice President is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety,” Kirsten Allen, a senior Harris adviser, said in a statement.
Harris is going out on the road to promote her book “107 Days,” detailing her whirlwind 2024 presidential campaign against Trump. Her book tour, with 18 planned stops so far in the United States and internationally, will be her most high-profile public appearances since her election loss in November.
Harris announced in July that she would not run in the open race for governor of California in 2026, leaving her political future open.
“For now, my leadership—and public service—will not be in elected office,” she said in a July 30 statement. “I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.”
Harris, who lives in Los Angeles, has also spoken out to condemn the Trump administration for sending the National Guard and U.S. Marines into Los Angeles after mass protests over a series of immigration raids. In June, she said she was “appalled” by the events unfolding in the city and called sending in the National Guard a “dangerous escalation.”
“In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump administration’s cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division,” she said. “The administration’s actions are not about public safety — they’re about stoking fear.”
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the removal of Harris’ Secret Service protection “another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation.”
“This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” Bass said in a statement to CNN.
Bob Sallady, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, told CNN, “The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AMR_0076-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-29 16:57:16.915709

(Photo illustration by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Platte-Geddes Superintendent Joel Bailey remembers an “eerily quiet” lunch room when his students were still allowed to use their cellphones during the school day.
“We decided that since the kids are in class the majority of the day, they need to talk to one another during lunch. We want that social interaction,” Bailey said. “Albeit, it’s a noisier lunch room now, at least they’re talking and interacting.”
During the 2022-23 school year, the district became one of the first in the state to require all students’ phones to be locked away during school hours. Bailey said the district realized it had been “losing the battle” with students who were making “poor decisions with social media.”
Many other South Dakota school districts have since adopted new cellphone rules, according to a South Dakota Searchlight survey of superintendents and analysis of published policies. As classes begin this fall, nearly all districts in the state have a phone policy or guidelines for students. About 60% of districts do not allow cellphones for at least part of the school day, although in some schools, students can keep the devices in their backpacks or lockers. About one-third of the districts in the state remove or lock away high school students’ cellphones for at least part of the school day.
While some schools lock phones away for the entire day, others require students to place phones in containers during class. Some of those allow students to use their phones during lunch or between class periods.
School districts implementing a locked phone policy for high school students throughout the entire school day this year include De Smet, Dupree, Ethan, Florence, Henry, Iroquois, Oglala Lakota, Rosholt and Waverly. Highmore-Harrold will consider a locked phone policy at its September school board meeting.
The Dupree School District spent about $300 to purchase clear, locked boxes with slots for high schoolers to place their cell phones during the school day, Superintendent Brent Mareska said. Elementary and middle school students give their cellphones to their first period teacher at the start of the school day, but the devices aren’t placed in locked boxes.
The school tried using a door hanging pouch – such as for shoes or calculators – for high school students last year with access during lunch and between classes, but Mareska said administrators and teachers “didn’t see the results we wanted.”
“It’s never going to be a one-size fits all,” Mareska said. “The goal is to keep improving our kids’ education. With not only staff but most Americans hooked on their cellphones, it’s affecting education more than we know.” 
Wall School District implemented a pouch system last year, but purchased new pouches that block cell phone signals to watches or earbuds this year. Students will still be able to use phones between periods and during lunchtime, Superintendent Sally Crowser said.
“Our cellphones are a problem, but I’m not ready for a full ban,” Crowser said.
State legislators, Education Department explore ‘best practices’
South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joseph Graves told South Dakota Searchlight in an emailed statement that he is “pleased” to see school districts set local policies that meet their needs, adding that research shows smartphones have a “direct impact on student learning and the classroom culture.”
“We will be watching closely as schools develop rules and strategies to combat the negative effects of smartphones,” Graves said.
The state Legislature passed a resolution in February encouraging school boards to implement policies limiting cell phone use during instruction. Twenty-six states have laws or policies banning or limiting cellphones in classrooms.
Lawmakers on South Dakota’s Teacher Compensation Review Board recommended in August that the state Department of Education prepare a report about the “best practices” on smartphones and personal technology in schools. The recommendation passed unanimously.
Graves said during the meeting he interpreted the recommendation as instructing the department to survey school districts on their policies, analyze how other states are crafting policies and identify relevant research on the impact of such technology in schools.
School districts with locked phones continue, adjust practices
In interviews with South Dakota Searchlight, superintendents with experience enforcing locked-away phone policies said student engagement and interaction increased. Teachers didn’t have to spend as much time policing student phone use, either. 
Gettysburg Superintendent Amber Mikkelsen surveyed teachers and students at the end of the last school year, after the district’s first year of a locked phone policy. Most teachers who responded thought the change was positive and led to more engagement among students.
Of the one-third of students who responded to the survey, most said the device-free policy helped them focus more in class. Half of students who responded said they felt just as stressed or distracted without their devices, and most students said they didn’t notice a difference in their engagement with other students.

The locked pouches cost the district about $4,400, and they’ve lasted through the second year of use, Mikkelsen said.
Mikkelsen said the district will allow cellphones during lunch for high school students this year, hoping to bring students back to the school lunch program. Students who left for open lunch were allowed to take their phones.
It cost Platte-Geddes $2,000 to purchase 100 new pouches this school year. It has cost the district a couple thousand dollars every few years to purchase new pouches and update equipment, said Bailey, the superintendent.
He hopes students don’t look at the locked-phone policy as a punishment, but as a break from distractions and the world outside the classroom.
“We’re not experts on this. But it’s worked,” Bailey said. “I would not hesitate to make the same decision again.”
Neither district has tracked whether the policies have had an impact on academic success.
Cellphone policies reflect difference in digital education philosophy
The Waverly School District spent about $1,000 purchasing 14 lock boxes for the new school year. Prior to the change, students weren’t allowed to use their cellphones during class periods but could have them in their backpacks or pockets.
Under that policy, students took frequent and lengthy bathroom breaks, said Superintendent Jon Meyer.
But many South Dakota school districts have retained that same cell phone policy for years and plan to keep it in the years to come. While it might be a hassle at times to keep students off their phones, some superintendents say it’s the school’s duty to teach students to be responsible digital users.

Wilmot Superintendent Nicholas Olson said his district strengthened consequences for using cellphones during class, but still allows students to keep their phones on them. The district also stopped letting students take their phones with them for bathroom breaks or other out-of-classroom visits.
“With public schools specifically, a lot of things we do center around preparing students to be contributing members of society,” Olson said. “That’s in a lot of school district mission statements, and we have to uphold that. Digital citizenship is something extremely important and part of that mission, though ever-changing.”
Meyer said he hopes more school districts implement locked phone policies. Schools shouldn’t be solely responsible for teaching healthy digital habits, he said, and younger students shouldn’t be on social media.
The Wilmot district considered a door hanger pouch system, but officials worried that if a student took another’s phone and damaged or destroyed it, the school could be found liable.
“Hopefully next year we can learn and grow,” Olson said, “and make a decision that benefits students and staff in our district.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A year before Alaska’s 2026 primary election, 10 candidates have already announced their intent to run for governor, and more are expected to announce campaigns in the coming months.
Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and unable to run himself, and with so many people in the race, there is no clear front-runner.
During a question-and-answer session at this week’s Alaska Oil and Gas Association conference in Anchorage, Dunleavy was asked who he supports.
Among the confirmed candidates are Dunleavy’s lieutenant governor, Republican Nancy Dahlstrom, and his former revenue commissioner, Adam Crum. His former attorney general, Treg Taylor, is also expected to enter the race.
But given the opportunity to endorse any or all of them, Dunleavy didn’t name any specific candidate as his preference and spoke only in generalities.
“Who do you want to replace you as governor?” asked the event moderator.
“Somebody taller than me,” Dunleavy said to laughter. “No, I’m kidding. … Somebody that believes in Alaska like you do and like I do. You’ve got to be on a mission, right?”
Dunleavy said he believes any governor faces distractions and nay-sayers, people who will oppose projects and a governor’s efforts.
“I would hope that whoever is the next governor has a mission to continue the good things that are happening for the state, continue to work with the Trump administration, because I’ll be gone,” Dunleavy said, alluding to President Donald Trump’s efforts to increase mining, logging and oil and gas drilling in Alaska. 
“There’ll be two more years, at least, of President Trump, and hopefully someone after him in a similar vein, who wants to keep this going for the country. So whoever you talk to that’s running for governor, ask them what their mission is. If they balk, or they look up at the sky or they think about it, that’s a concern,” the governor said. “Getting things across the finish line, getting things across the finish line, is the most important thing.”
After the governor’s remarks, deputy press secretary Grant Robinson said by email that the governor’s statement about “at least” two more years was “nothing more than an approximation of the time remaining in the President’s term.”
The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits someone from being elected President more than twice.
Dunleavy’s own political future is also in question. On Thursday, Fox News, citing unnamed sources, said the governor is considering whether to run against Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, when her current term expires in 2028.
The Fox News report could not be immediately corroborated, but Murkowski herself has said she may leave the Senate. In interviews earlier this month, she declined to rule out a run for governor in 2026.
In addition to Crum and Dahlstrom, seven other Republicans have filed documents for a campaign: former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; current state Sen.

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)William Hart was confirmed as commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections Wednesday after facing questions earlier in the week from the Executive Council about how he’d lead the embattled department through a series of challenges.
“I’m here because I believe in public service,” Hart said during a Monday hearing ahead of the vote. “What I think I bring to this position is an ability to build trust.”
 William Hart
Former Commissioner Helen Hanks resigned suddenly in mid-May amid staffing problems and allegations she destroyed evidence about a death inside a state prison. John Scippa, director of the state’s Police Standards and Training Board, served as interim director and approached Hart about the role, Hart said.
Hart said the biggest challenge the Corrections Department faces is “rebuilding the culture.” In April, state Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican and vice chair of the House Finance Committee, told his fellow lawmakers he had “lost confidence” in Hanks, saying that his sources, whom he did not name, in the department had told him her decision-making was flawed. Hart said he wants to rebuild a “trust-based culture.”
“And when I say trust-based, I don’t mean just the trust between the commissioner and governor or the department and the state of New Hampshire,” he said. “I also mean those who come to work in the Department of Corrections every day in dangerous and sometimes very frightening jobs, their trust in their leadership has to be rebuilt and that’s no reflection on anyone that came before me. It’s simply the way I like to manage and hopefully lead.”
Hart takes over a department with severe staffing issues. Last June, Hanks told the Bulletin 47% of the department’s positions were vacant. She said the department was facing a $3.44 million deficit caused in large part by the overtime payments needed to cover the vacancies. This year, lawmakers, seeking to cut costs amid a difficult budget planning process, eliminated dozens of positions, many of which were vacant.
Hart may also become responsible for building a new men’s prison as the current one in Concord is decaying. Asked how he would approach doing so by councilors, Hart said he’d lean on state leaders and commissioners from other states for advice and input. He acknowledged “the price tag is a hefty one” but said “each moment that we do not act that price will go up.” 
Hart comes to the department from the U.S. Marshal Service. He was appointed Marshal for New Hampshire by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in June 2023. Before the Marshal Service, Hart had a career in local law enforcement and as a prosecutor in New Hampshire. He was Londonderry’s police chief and Rockingham County attorney, though he has no experience in corrections. Hart also served in the Marine Corps and studied at Merrimack College and Boston College School of Law.
“In terms of my career, I’ve frankly been more lucky than good,” Hart said.
Hart was confirmed with the support of all but one of the five councilors. Janet Stevens, a Rye Republican, did not say why she voted against his confirmation.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dochart-1024x721.jpeg,,,2025-08-29 16:57:16.915709

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A woman died while hiking Wednesday in a group on the Highline Trail in Glacier National Park.
She tripped and sustained fatal injuries from a fall, Glacier said in a news release. She has been identified as 73-year-old Diane Bunker of Muscatine, Iowa, the park said.
The news release Friday described the events as follows:

At approximately 11 a.m. park staff were alerted of a female who had fallen off the Highline Trail. While hiking with a large group, Bunker tripped and fell off the edge of the trail, out of sight from her hiking party. The fall occurred between Big Bend and Triple Arches.
The Going-to-the-Sun Road was closed from Logan Pass to Big Bend for about an hour to conduct the recovery. Two Bear Air was dispatched to search for the fallen hiker. Two Bear Air located and recovered her below the trail. She sustained traumatic injuries after falling roughly 450 feet. She was brought to the Apgar horse corrals and transferred to the Flathead County coroner. An investigation is ongoing.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Democrats are in a slump judging by the party booth at the Minnesota State Fair, where just a year earlier volunteers were overwhelmed by crowds buying Harris-Walz merchandise. 
“This was three cash tellers wide, people all the way outside the pavilion, more or less from sunrise until 8 o’clock at night,” said DFL volunteer Corey Vest, 47, of Minneapolis. 
Shorter lines are to be expected in an off year, with only local offices on the ballot. Still, it’s undeniable Democrats are struggling to rebound after their resounding electoral losses in 2024.  
Democrats are banking on reigniting their base by next year, when they have a good chance to retake the House and put a check on Trump’s power. The party of the president in power typically fares poorly in midterm elections, though Trump is hoping to hold onto the trifecta by redrawing congressional district lines in red states.

State Democrats will also need to rally enthusiasm to maintain control of the governorship and avoid further losses in the Legislature, following a run of rough headlines and the tragic loss of Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was the House DFL leader for more than eight years until her June assassination. 
Campaigning for 2026 has already begun. Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan took a ride down the Giant Slide in an “I love Milk” t-shirt, while U.S. Rep. Angie Craig plied Republicans with Sweet Martha’s cookies as both seek support for their Senate bids. 
Gov. Tim Walz, who is still mulling a run for a third term, served coffee at the Hamline Church Dining Hall, and state Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, who recently jumped in the race, posed for photos with WCCO Radio personalities. 
At the Democratic-Farmer-Labor booth, Joel Heller, 48, held a sign with a QR code for visitors to fill out the DFL’s “Vibe Check” opinion poll. 
Heller is a disabled Iraq war veteran who lives in Duluth and serves as the chair of the DFL Veterans Caucus. He said he wants people, especially young people, to “start fighting” and calling out “the BS.” 
Heller said he’s struggling to get Democrats around Duluth to run for local positions, like township or school boards. He also said Democrats should be reaching out to moderates more, “or else we’re going to lose.”

Meanwhile, two Columbia Heights residents arriving at the booth after enjoying bison meatball subs — a Walz favorite — said they want Democrats to pursue progressive policies. 
Junia James, 17, a senior at Columbia Heights High School, said Democrats are “fighting for the right things, but I feel like more can be done in some areas.” They listed safety for immigrants and queer youth as issues they care most about being involved in. They are especially worried about ICE, given that Columbia Heights and their high school has many immigrants, they said. 
For Rachel James, 44, Junia’s mother and a Columbia Heights city council member, the biggest issue for the DFL is the exclusionary way caucuses are run, which limits decisionmaking power to a “group of insiders.” 
“And having met some of those insiders, they’re great, passionate people, but they don’t represent the breadth of our community,” Rachel James said.

Over at the Republican Party booth, sitting at the quiet garden patio beyond a merchandise area filled with red apparel and Trump flags, Laurel Frost, 57, said she generally approves of Trump’s administration so far. 
“I like the way the economy is going,” Frost said, save for one segment: “Groceries are still a little expensive for my family.” 
Frost, who works for the city of Bloomington’s records department, also appreciates Trump’s promise to revive domestic manufacturing. 
“You hear stories about things that are made overseas and with child labor and things like that,” Frost said. “I don’t want a $2 Walmart t-shirt, if that’s what it is.” 
Sitting beside Frost, Mary Tomlinson, 82, a Florida retiree originally from Minnesota, said that though she’s moving back to the state, she’s put off by Minnesota’s politics enough to keep a  residence in Florida. 
“I just don’t like the political climate here at all,” Tomlinson said, citing her disapproval of Minnesota’s taxes and attitudes towards police. “We have a police department down there that is absolutely honored.”
Even as Minnesotans enjoy the fair in record numbers this year, tragedy hangs over the state, which has endured two tragedies bookending the summer: The political assassination of Hortman in June and a shooting at a south Minneapolis church this week that left two children dead and 18 injured. 
How to prevent similar tragedies will certainly feature prominently in the 2026 campaigns.

Carly Grant, a 30-year-old Maple Grove resident who works in marketing, said the political conversation about mass shootings is always about whether it’s a mental health issue or a gun control issue: “But I think the government needs to address both.”

Limiting access to assault rifles, requiring safe storage, making mental health care more accessible — especially to men — and closing loopholes for gun purchases are all ideas she supports. 
“Any one of those things would make a huge difference,” Grant said.
The Democratic trifecta passed a slate of gun safety laws in 2023 and 2024 including a red flag law and universal background checks, but did not ban assault weapons or high capacity magazines. Democratic lawmakers say they will push for those bans next year. 
Dave Heath is a 59-year-old warehouse worker from St. Paul and a lifelong Republican. Rolling back gun rights won’t stop mass shootings, he said. Instead, law enforcement and prosecutors need to keep those convicted of crimes off the street.
“I just think we need to enforce the law. I mean, if you get convicted or charged with a crime, you gotta pay for it,” Heath said.
In the case of the Minneapolis church shooter, police say the individual had no criminal record and purchased the weapons legally.

Seeking refuge from Fidel Castro’s government, Josue Rodriguez Perez came to the U.S. as a teen. Now he’s being shuffled between detainment centers, including a 40-day stretch in a Casper jail cell.
The post Without a country to take him, Cuban immigrant spends month in limbo inside Wyoming jail appeared first on WyoFile .","Josue Rodriguez Perez joined the line outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office near Miami for his annual check-in on June 5.
Three months later, the Cuban national found himself languishing in the Natrona County Detention Center, 2,000 miles from home, increasingly hopeless as his detention felt increasingly endless. 
“You want to die. You pray to God you don’t wake up in the morning, when you’re isolated like this,” Rodriguez told WyoFile over a set of phone interviews from inside the jail. 
Rodriguez’s journey from the Florida coast to the middle of Wyoming is a result of complicated immigration law that made him vulnerable to the mass deportations pursued by President Donald Trump and his administration. While some communities around the country are resisting, Rodriguez’s time in Casper shows how some sheriffs are willing to place their jails in service of the president’s agenda. 
In 1993, Rodriguez and his father fled Cuba, where an authoritarian government squashes independent political activity, tightly controls the press and limits freedom of speech. They were granted legal U.S. residency. But in 2012, felony convictions for credit card fraud sent Rodriguez to a Louisiana state prison for five years. It’s a period in which he says he found religion, found himself and emerged to build a new life. But the crime cost Rodriguez his green card, and a judge ordered his deportation.
Cuba, however, with its fraught history with the United States, does not accept deportees. So Rodriguez stayed, working legally, for eight more years. He built a family in Florida and a career as a commercial truck driver.

Each year, he went to visit ICE and renew the work permit issued to people in his particular situation. But this year, agents detained Rodriguez and more than a dozen other Cubans standing in line with him. 
Under Trump, ICE is trying to deport people whose home country won’t take them to a third country — regardless of whether the person has ties there or, in many cases, even a guarantee of safety. The administration is also seeking third countries when a judge has ruled a migrant can’t be sent to their home country because they’ll face torture or persecution. 
In Rodriguez’s case, ICE appears to have detained him without a plan for what to do with him — or at least without one that held up.
Federal agents shuffled Rodriguez from one place to another. Over the course of roughly six weeks, he was held in detention centers in Miami, El Paso; another place in Texas he can’t quite remember the name of; then Aurora, Colorado; then back to El Paso and then back to Aurora, according to an accounting by him and a sister he was able to check in with via intermittent phone calls. 
WyoFiled asked ICE why the agency detained Rodriguez without a clear plan for his deportation. “They are criminal illegal aliens,” an ICE spokesperson wrote in response. “President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem are reversing the previous administration’s policies that allowed millions of illegal aliens to remain in the United States consequence free.”
Rodriguez made each trip, on both plane and bus, shackled by his wrists and ankles. He stayed in crowded cell blocks, he said, where he could rarely shower. He sometimes slept on the floor and used a toilet in view of others. 
His account aligns with how ICE increasingly is treating the immigrants it detains, two attorneys told WyoFile. 
“We’re seeing people moved around so much they lose track of what day it is … they don’t know time and place,” Laura Lunn, of the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, told WyoFile. “People [end up] detained in Aurora, Colorado, and don’t know there’s a giant mountain range outside their front door.”

On July 18, Rodriguez and 45 other migrants of various nationalities were transferred from Aurora to the Natrona County Detention Center in Casper. 
WyoFile asked ICE about Rodriguez’s case on Wednesday and asked the agency’s media office to respond by Friday afternoon. On Thursday evening, after holding Rodriguez in the Natrona County jail for 40 days, he and six other ICE detainees in the Casper jail were transferred out of the jail, according to inmate rosters. ICE’s detainee tracker indicates Rodriguez was taken to Aurora for a third time.
It’s unclear what prompted the latest move – ICE declined to comment on why Rodriguez was pulled back to that facility.
According to Lunn and other immigration attorneys interviewed by WyoFile, Rodriguez’s case — with no ongoing court proceedings or clear end to his confinement — is typical of the detainees they’ve seen transferred to county jails like Casper’s, though the number of detainees with legal representation at all is slim. In a federal case for a different ICE detainee, agency officials testified that they were sending people with “inactive” cases to Natrona County, to maintain room in Aurora for people who had pending court hearings. 
The detainees’ confinement in Casper raises the question of whether jails could become de facto immigration prisons, as temporary holds drag into lengthy stays. Thirty people who entered the facility with Rodriguez on July 18 remain incarcerated there, according to Friday morning’s inmate roster. 
Other immigrants in the Casper jail told Rodriguez they had successfully appealed their cases, which prevented deportation to their home countries, he said. But once released, ICE officers arrested them again, so the agency could try to deport them to a third country. 
Rodriguez is no longer fighting his deportation. He wants to be sent to México, though he doesn’t have family there or ties to the country. “With Trump, they can do whatever they feel like,” he said. “I don’t want to be in this country anymore, and they’re keeping me here.”
Life in limbo
In Casper, Rodriguez did not see sunlight for 40 days, he said. He spent the majority of each day locked down in his cell, he said.
While inmates receive different classifications, the minimum time out of the cell is five hours a day, according to a sheriff’s spokesperson. 
Sheriff’s deputies are monitoring ICE detainees and the lengths of their stay, Natrona County sheriff’s spokesperson Kiera Hett told WyoFile in an email. “We always keep a watchful eye,” she wrote. “These detainees have been processed through immigration courts and have been ordered to be detained.” 
She did not respond to a question about whether the sheriff had a limit for how long he would keep ICE detainees in his jail. WyoFile has requested interviews with Sheriff John Harlin to discuss the ICE detainees but has not received one. 
Rodriguez says the courts ordered him deported, not imprisoned. 
The detainees in Casper tie Wyoming to a nationwide detention system that critics say is putting due process — and the basic humanity of immigrants — into question, even as the Trump administration works to scale up detention and deportation even further. Flush with a $75 billion budget expansion, the administration hopes to expand its capacity in county jails, including in Wyoming, The Washington Post reported this month.

But México isn’t the only possible destination for Rodriguez and other immigrants in similar positions. There are scarier possibilities afoot for Latino immigrants.  
With the blessing of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Trump administration has been pursuing deportations to African countries including Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda, where Rodriguez worries he would be imprisoned or worse. The U.S. State Department, for example, warns American travelers away from Sudan, citing kidnapping and armed conflict. 
In Florida, Rodriguez’s wife, two daughters and sister worry for him and struggle with the loss of his presence and income in their lives. Rodriguez is growing increasingly desperate and depressed, his sister told WyoFile. Rodriguez himself told WyoFile he was considering a hunger strike. 
Earlier in his confinement, Rodriguez says he signed paperwork allowing his deportation to México. ICE shackled him and bused him to El Paso, he said. 
Rodriguez sat in limbo in a detention center on the border. He saw crying women, separated from their families, and tent facilities swelled by detainees, he said. “It’s bad,” he told WyoFile. “I can’t compare it with anything because I’ve never been through something like that.” 
Eight days after arriving in El Paso, Rodriguez was taken back to Aurora and then to Casper. He never got an answer as to why he couldn’t enter México. He was also never told what ICE might try next. Instead, he spent 40 days in a Wyoming jail cell. 
“He already did his years in prison,” sister Monika Rodriguez said, “so he doesn’t need to do more years in prison. If he needs deportation, OK, go ahead. Deportation.”
Prison and redemption
Rodriguez was 16 years old when his father brought him and Monika to Miami to escape Fidel Castro’s communist government. Today, he is 52 and has two daughters of his own. They’re 33 and 28 years old, he told WyoFile. 
He once had a third daughter. 
In 2005, he was driving his family from Naples, on Florida’s Gulf Coast, across the state to Miami to board a cruise ship. Rodriguez lost control of the vehicle. His first wife, his daughter and his niece died in the resulting crash. Rodriguez was cleared of any legal wrongdoing, he said, but those official inquiries couldn’t clear him of his own guilt.

He used cocaine and drank and committed credit card fraud to pay for it. “I was running from the guilt,” he said. He went to prison once in Florida, and then again in Louisiana — that time for five years. Court records in both states support Rodriguez’s account of the charges. His sister, interviewed by WyoFile separately, also described the accident. 
In the Louisiana prison, Rodriguez’s life changed, he said. He connected with a priest and learned to forgive himself for the fatal crash. He earned a GED, worked as a caretaker for elderly inmates, played football and boxed. “I felt free, inside the prison, believe it or not,” he told WyoFile. “It was beautiful.” 
Indeed, Rodriguez came home changed, Monika said. “It was difficult at the beginning, trying to put his life back together, but he did it,” she said. “He put his life back in line.” He started doing lawn care, she remembered, building patios, and then got into commercial driving and financed his own semitruck. 
He remarried and supported his surviving daughters. WyoFile found no record of additional convictions for Rodriguez after his release from prison in 2017. WyoFile asked ICE if the agency had any additional record of criminality, and officials did not provide a direct answer.
“Eight years of being good,” Monika said.
Then came Trump’s reelection in November. 
Then came Rodriguez’s ICE check-in on June 5. 
Swept back in
The Cubans standing in line that day did not leave home knowing they would be suddenly swept into the immigration detention system and separated from their families, Javier Falcon, another immigrant arrested that day, told WyoFile. 
Had he known, Falcon would’ve said a very different goodbye to his family, he said. Rodriguez too. 
Falcon spoke to WyoFile by phone from México, where the government deported him, though he is also Cuban.
After their arrest, the men were taken to the Krome North Service Processing Center, an ICE facility in Miami. There, both men said, they slept on the floor of a cell that was designed to hold 25 people, but was holding 60 or 70. During the days the Cubans were in Krome, National Public Radio reported on overcrowding and a lack of food at the facilities. 
Falcon and Rodriguez bonded amid the brutal conditions, they said. “We developed a very strong friendship,” Falcon said. 
Both men were sent to Texas. But they were separated. On July 12, ICE agents took Falcon across the border and handed him to Mexican authorities. Not knowing where to go, he made his way to Cancún, hearing it was safe and stable. 
Falcon has no friends or family in México, he said, and so far, no work. He has not seen his wife since June. His voice choked with emotion as he discussed his predicament. “I don’t know what to do,” he said. 
But both men agree: Of the two, Falcon is the luckier one. 
Rodriguez called his friend in México from the Casper jail. Like Rodriguez’s relatives, Falcon worried the confined man was growing more desperate there.
“I give him strength, I give him encouragement,” Falcon said. “I can’t do anything else.” 
Pining for the unthinkable
Four hours south of Casper, Aurora’s detention center is managed by a sprawling for-profit prison company (and significant donor to Trump’s 2024 reelection campaign) called GEO Group. Detainees and attorneys have repeatedly accused the company of maintaining poor conditions there through insufficient health care, overcrowding and other allegations. 
But while still in Casper, Rodriguez longed for the Aurora facility. There is an outdoor area where inmates could feel the sun and breathe fresh air each day. And there is more time to socialize outside their cells, he recalled. 
The notion of missing Aurora is worrying and yet understandable to Elizabeth Jordan, director of the Immigration Law & Policy Clinic at the University of Denver. 
“Aurora is a deeply, deeply problematic place but at least there’s a psychologist on staff and a yard where people can play soccer,” she said.  
Jails are not built for long stays — they’re built, usually on the local taxpayer’s dime, to hold people arrested on suspicion of crimes until their case can be adjudicated or to serve short sentences. If found guilty of felonies, Wyoming criminals are moved to a state prison, where there are facilities to ensure a level of physical and mental well-being as people serve out longer sentences.
Prolonged stays in jail, coupled with mental health issues or less access to health care, can lead to depression and in the worst cases, suicide — a problem that has plagued Wyoming jails at high rates. There’s a legal risk for Wyoming counties that go down the fraught route of holding people for ICE, Jordan said. Though Natrona County has an agreement with ICE to hold detainees, the local government remains liable for their well-being while they hold them.
Ultimately, a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court case found that the government can not keep immigration detainees confined indefinitely. If, after six months in detention, the government can’t show it’s likely to deport the detainee, the justices ruled, they should be released. But the federal government won’t necessarily just kick Rodriguez loose if he hits that threshold, said Jordan, the immigration clinic director. 
“ICE’s practices have always been fairly chaotic, and right now, with the high-pressure agenda, they’ve gotten more chaotic,” she said. 
Even if Rodriguez gets released, ICE could choose to detain him and try deportation again if they think they’ve found a destination. “It’s pretty precarious,” Jordan said. 
As for Rodriguez, he mourned not just for himself, but for the United States. “It’s not the same country, it’s not the same freedom that I used to know,” he said. “I feel a lot for this country. This is home.” 
Or at least it was. Now, he’s ready to leave — if he can just get out of Wyoming and reach a place that will offer him a chance to rebuild again.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Students are back on campus at Florida State University, and they’re studying in classrooms better suited for campus emergencies than they were that tragic day, administrators say. 
During a Board of Trustees meeting Friday, President Richard McCullough said campus security officials have made “significant enhancements” since a gunman opened fire there on April 17, killing two and injuring others.

“We aren’t moving on, but we are healing. That tragedy certainly will impact many of us for years to come. I appreciate the way we responded to it, in Florida State fashion, with coming together as the family that we are,” McCullough said. 
The Floridian reported shortly after the shooting that students barricaded classrooms when they found out that the doors did not lock from the inside.
Days after the shooting, a petition started circulating calling for locks on all classroom doors.
Kyle Clark, FSU vice president for finance and administration, said that over the summer more than 600 classrooms were equipped with buttons to push in case of an active shooter. 
Of those, 330 were ‘“lockdown” buttons, which lock the classroom door when pushed, and 290 were “panic” buttons that alert FSU police and are paired with manual locks on the doors. 
“I feel pretty happy to report that a lot of the things we were working on were planned before the 17th. We just took a one-, three-, five-year plan and pushed it into eight weeks,” Assistant Vice President for Public Safety Barbara O’Connor said. 
Along with attention to door locks, nearly 3,500 people have completed active-threat training since January 2025, according to the university. 
“Faculty and students are so excited to be back but some are, as you can imagine, somewhat anxious or reserved as they continue to process the shooting that occurred on campus and the quick end to the spring semester, and of course in light of news of yet another school shooting, this time in a PreK-8 Catholic school in Minneapolis,” said Jennifer Proffitt, vice chair of the faculty senate.
Adding locks to classroom doors was among the demands FSU students brought to the Capitol following the shooting. 
Lori Alhadeff, a mother of a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting victim and Broward County School Board member, stood in front of trustees Friday to talk about the changes. 
“FSU holds a special place in my heart, not only because of this partnership but because my two boys are here as students. And together, with your leadership, we have the power to save lives and create a future where no parent has to endure what I have,” Alhadeff said.

In this image, Billings is delivering a speech in 2021. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas secretary of state relied Friday on a legal opinion issued by the attorney general to remove Republican Doug Billings from the roster of candidates running for governor.
Attorney General Kris Kobach’s nonbinding opinion pointed to state law requiring governor and lieutenant governor candidates to run as a team. Kobach said the statute meant the decision by Billings’ running mate, April McCoy, to be removed from the ticket and have her name scrubbed from the August 2026 primary ballot meant Secretary of State Scott Schwab was obligated to terminate Billings’ candidacy.
Kobach said the key point was that when one member of this type of electoral alliance withdrew or died, after officially submitting candidate filing documents but prior to the state’s filing deadline, the candidacy had to be concluded because there was no mechanism in state law to replace one of the running mates.
“The Legislature knows how to prescribe a procedure for allowing a candidacy to continue, and it did not include one for this scenario,” Kobach’s opinion said. “While the remaining member is free to find another running mate and pursue ballot access, he must do so as part of a new candidacy.”
Kobach said Billings would be able to relaunch a campaign for governor, but would have to complete all requirements of a candidate to include payment of filing fees.
Billings couldn’t be immediately reached for comment on the decision.
Schwab, who serves as the state’s top elections official and is a candidate for the GOP nomination for governor, requested the attorney general’s opinion. Schwab’s office said the decision to remove Billings as a candidate for governor was based on the legal advice from the attorney general.
Billings, an Olathe podcaster and supporter of President Donald Trump, launched a long-shot campaign for governor. The GOP field includes Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, Senate President Ty Masterson, former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Schwab and several others.
Billings, who began hosting “The Right Side” podcast after a career in human resources, said Kansas needed a governor who would mirror the budget mindset offered by Trump and former DOGE adviser Elon Musk. He said reducing state spending and lowering income and businesses taxes would lead to a flourishing state economy.
In terms of election security, Billings promised to direct the Kansas Bureau of Investigation to investigate voting “irregularities” in Kansas.
“We need a strong conservative governor in that office,” Billings said during an interview in May. “We need a politician who’s going to tell the truth.”
In mid-August, the Kansas City Star published an article highlighting concerns raised by McCoy and others that Billings pocketed a $2,700 donation to his gubernatorial campaign. McCoy says the money was earmarked for purchase of a software program useful to a statewide campaign. Billings told the newspaper the dispute was a misunderstanding and the payment was a donation to his podcast.
In addition, the Star reported Billings was convicted during 2010 in Johnson County District Court of a felony charge of theft involving more than $25,000. Eight counts of fraud were dismissed by the prosecutor, records showed.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Doug-Billings-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-29 16:57:16.915709

Free.,Appeals court backs Venezuelan migrants’ effort to keep protected status,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-backs-venezuelan-migrants-effort-keep-protected-status,,"WASHINGTON — A three-judge panel of a federal appeals court unanimously ruled Friday the Trump administration likely acted unlawfully when it revoked extensions for temporary protections for more than 600,000 Venezuelans. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit panel agreed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California’s March decision to block Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision to vacate two extensions of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, to the group until October 2026 that the Biden administration put in place early this year.One of the groups of Venezuelans had their TPS expire in April and the second is set to expire in September. The three-judge panel found that the Trump administration’s decision to end TPS in April is also likely unlawful.The panel said Noem did not have the authority to revoke the TPS extensions granted by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Judges Kim McLane Wardlaw, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, Salvador Mendoza Jr. and Anthony Johnstone, who were both appointed by former President Joe Biden, reached the decision.The judges ruled that the law creating TPS, which grants work visas and deportation protections to nationals from a country deemed too dangerous to return to, was designed to create “predictable periods of safety and legal status for TPS beneficiaries” and the administration’s cancellation of the extension contradicted that goal.“Sudden reversals of prior decisions contravene the statute’s plain language and purpose,” they wrote. “Here, hundreds of thousands of people have been stripped of status and plunged into uncertainty. The stability of TPS has been replaced by fears of family separation, detention, and deportation.”“Congress did not contemplate this, and the ongoing irreparable harm to Plaintiffs warrants a remedy pending a final adjudication on the merits,” they continued.A spokesperson for DHS did not return a message seeking comment Friday.The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration in May to end TPS for the group of 350,000 Venezuelans that expired in April. It is unclear how Friday’s order will affect that group.The roughly 250,000 Venezuelans in another group are set to have their TPS expire Sept. 10 after the DHS revoked the extension.",,,,2025-08-29 15:58:35.156813

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana State Police will deploy extra patrols, sobriety checkpoints and other enforcement efforts over the Labor Day holiday in a push to reduce crashes and fatalities, officials announced Friday.
Superintendent Anthony Scott said troopers will be out “in full force” as part of the national “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” campaign. The ongoing effort is spearheaded by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
“Our mission this holiday weekend is clear,” Scott said at a news conference in Indianapolis. “We’re committed to targeting aggressive driving, removing impaired drivers from our roads and apprehending those who threaten the safety and insecurity of our fellow citizens.”

Scott noted that state police recorded 1,816 crashes across Indiana over last year’s Labor Day weekend, including 368 injury crashes and eight fatal crashes that killed nine people. 
“That’s unacceptable,” he said. “We’re going to do everything we can until those numbers become zero — which, obviously, is probably not possible — but we’re going to do everything in our control to make that happen.”
Scott emphasized, too, that the increased presence will not end when the holiday does. 
“This is not just about traffic enforcement. It’s about protecting lives and upholding the well-being of every person traveling through our great state,” he said. “Our dedication to keeping Indiana roads safe does not end when the holiday weekend is over.”
Gov. Mike Braun, who joined Friday’s announcement at the Indianapolis State Police District 52 post, tied the holiday crackdown to his broader public safety agenda. 
“You can see how seriously we’re taking public safety, and especially around holidays, where we need to be more on-guard against trying to get those sad statistics down,” Braun said.

“(As) governor … I’ve put a lot of emphasis on public safety, and that doesn’t mean just on holidays. It means throughout the year,” he continued. “We’re taking public safety to a level, hopefully, that’s going to make Hoosiers feel safe wherever they are — in their vehicle, on the road, or when they’re outside.”
In addition to staffing checkpoints and increased patrols, officials showcased a new fleet of state police vehicles that are expected to hit Hoosier roads next month. 
Officials said additional details about the new vehicles and other ISP equipment upgrades are expected in the coming weeks.
“We’re going to put the resources behind public safety. We’re going to put the resources in school safety,” Braun said. “And a fleet for the Indiana State Police is going to be one of the most important things that we invest in.”

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas elected officials and high school students commemorated the twentieth anniversary of the Little Rock Nine monument on the state Capitol grounds Friday.
The memorial honors nine Black students who faced violence and hatred when they attempted to integrate Little Rock public schools in 1957.
Elizabeth Eckford, perhaps the most recognizable of the Little Rock Nine due to the famous photo of her being screamed at while trying to enter Little Rock Central High School alone, sat next to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders at Friday’s commemoration of the memorial, which consists of life-sized bronze statues of the nine students walking toward the state Capitol.
Sanders, who attended Central High while her father was governor, lauded the Little Rock Nine for setting an example for others to follow. She credited their courage for enabling Central High to become “one of the most diverse” schools in Arkansas, “with students from every single walk of life.”
“It has now been nearly 70 years since the Little Rock Nine bravely integrated Central High School and brought about a wave of change to our country,” Sanders said. “Thanks to the statue standing behind us, they are forever memorialized in bronze, serving as a permanent reminder of our past so that we work together to ensure it doesn’t happen in our future.”
Eckford appeared to take issue with Sanders’ phrasing during her own remarks.

“We did not experience integration,” Eckford said with the bronze statue of her younger likeness at her back. “Integration did not happen. In fact, [the] school district continued to operate a dual school system until the 1970s. What we experienced was desegregation. The first year was tumultuous. We were pummeled daily and surrounded by hate speech.”
Eckford said the only way people could truly begin to understand one another was if “we honestly acknowledge our history.”
“My mantra has become that we can never have true racial reconciliation until we honestly acknowledge our painful, but shared, past. Not mythmaking, not pretty stories, but the real truth,” Eckford said.
The students became a central part of the Civil Rights era when Little Rock opted to begin desegregating its schools after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. Former Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus attempted to stop the Little Rock Nine from attending school using the Arkansas National Guard, but the students persisted, eventually earning a federal court victory that allowed them to attend classes.
The violence, however, did not stop. After mobs attempted to breach the school while the Little Rock Nine were attending classes, President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the National Guard and sent the 101st Airborne to tamp down on the violence and guard the students.
John Deering, a sculptor and a long-time political cartoonist who helped create the memorial, said the work represented the long walks the Little Rock Nine would have to take to attend their classes each day.
“The Nine will be here forever, facing the governor’s office, taking that long walk and proving that sometimes being terrified and being afraid isn’t the end of the journey, that’s really the beginning,” Deering said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-29 19:39:11+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Dip in CT labor force could be related to US immigration policy,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/29/ct-labor-force-unemployment/,"In Connecticut and across the United States, ICE arrests are up and the labor force participation rate has dropped.","Across Connecticut, the number of people employed or actively searching for a job has dropped in recent months — a possible result of federal immigration policy. 
According to the most recent monthly jobs report from the Connecticut Department of Labor, the state’s labor force — people working or looking for work — decreased for the second consecutive month in July, by an estimated 2,500 people, following a drop of 3,700 in June.
A press release from the department said the declines may be related to federal immigration policy, but “CTDOL will need more months of data to determine any larger impact on the construction, restaurant, hospitality, and other industries.”
“At 64.7%, the state’s Labor Force Participation Rate remains well above the US national rate of 62.2%,” the press release stated. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests and deportations have increased sharply in Connecticut since President Donald J. Trump returned to office. There were 405 ICE arrests between January and July of this year.
Both trends are playing out similarly across the U.S. — ICE arrests are up and the labor force participation rate has dropped in many states.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Congressional hearing in June that the Trump administration’s immigration policy is one of the reasons economic growth has slowed.
The fluctuation of the number of people participating in the workforce comes as Connecticut employers have slowed hiring. 
The Connecticut Labor Department’s director of research, Patrick Flaherty, said in a July press release that 2025 has been a “stable” year but that job growth has not been as robust as it was in 2024. 
So while the unemployment rate remains below 4%, which is considered “full employment,” part of that could reflect a decline in the number of people in the labor market — the denominator when calculating unemployment.
Year over year, Connecticut’s unemployment rate rose from 3.1% to 3.8%, according to the Labor Department’s August jobs report. However, the state still sits below the national average of 4.2%.
Nationally, including the District of Columbia, unemployment fell in only six states over the past year. It rose in 15 states, including Connecticut, and remained unchanged in 30 others.
Within Connecticut, unemployment varies by town.
Hartford saw high levels of unemployment as of July 2025, reaching nearly 7%. Waterbury, New Britain, Mansfield and Windham were also among the towns with some of the highest levels of unemployment. But those rates, while higher than the statewide average, were relatively on par with where they stood in those cities at the same time last year. 
Some towns saw larger year-over-year changes in their unemployment rate. Canaan and Warren saw unemployment increase 0.79% and 0.85%, respectively.
Only six of Connecticut’s 169 towns saw unemployment decline from July 2024 to July 2025, and the changes were slight.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/E3yrT-which-towns-in-ct-have-the-highest-unemployment-rate--1024x809.png,,,2025-08-29 15:58:35.156813

Laura Walker, the president of Bennington College, will retire from the role at the end of fall term, the chair of the college’s board of trustees announced in an email on Friday sent to staff, faculty and students. 
Walker chose not to renew her contract, Nick Stephens, the chair, wrote in the email. She will continue to serve as president through the end of the fall term “to ensure consistent and steady leadership,” he wrote.
Walker will then continue as a strategic adviser to the board of trustees concentrating on new revenue projects and fundraising next year, Stephens wrote. The board will name an interim president, and then begin a national search for a permanent president, he wrote.
“Along with my board colleagues, I want to express my enormous gratitude to Laura for her leadership, her dedication to and love of Bennington, and the significant positive impact she has had on the college,” Stephens wrote.
Walker, in a statement posted to her LinkedIn page, said she was “so proud of what we’ve done together over the last five years,” and pointed to the college’s “doubling the number of applicants” and “graduating Bennington’s largest-ever class.”
Walker, formerly the long-time president and CEO of New York Public Radio, or WNYC, joined the college as president in 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
She joined the private college in Bennington after a rocky exit from WNYC, facing scandals involving its workplace culture, according to reporting from the New York Times and WNYC..
The email said Walker would be returning to New York City in January, where she will “resume her lifelong commitment to public media, developing new projects in both media and education, at a critical time for both sectors.”
Stephens wrote that the college, under Walker’s leadership, “achieved dramatic increases in fundraising revenue — including the largest gifts in Bennington’s history — and more than doubled the number of applicants, leading to the largest enrollment in the College’s history.”
The college has recently faced financial trouble, and this month announced it was eliminating 15 staff positions as part of the school’s efforts to address budget challenges.
Ashley Jowett, the director of communications at the college, said in a previous statement that the decision was “difficult” but “necessary to place the college on a more sustainable financial path.”

Newsom launches new task force to clear California homeless encampments,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/08/newsom-homeless-encampments-task-force/,"The task force, made up of six different state agencies, is the latest effort by the Newsom administration to remove homeless encampments from California’s streets.","In summary
The task force, made up of six different state agencies, is the latest effort by the Newsom administration to remove homeless encampments from California’s streets.


Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a new homeless response task force Friday, marking the latest escalation in his ongoing campaign to eradicate encampments. 
Newsom’s office expects to deploy the team within the next month to camps in California’s 10 largest cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, San Diego, Sacramento, San Jose, Long Beach, Anaheim, Bakersfield and Fresno. It will address encampments on state property, such as along highway medians or on and off ramps, and under overpasses.
The news comes as Newsom in recent months has pushed for more enforcement against all encampments that line city streets and sidewalks, dot public parks and wind along waterways throughout the state. In May, he urged cities to make it illegal to camp in one place for more than three nights in a row. Last year, he ordered state agencies to ramp up encampment clearings.
“California has put in place a strong, comprehensive strategy for fighting the national homelessness and housing crises — and is outperforming the nation as a result in turning this issue around,” Newsom said in a statement. “No one should live in a dangerous or unsanitary encampment, and we will continue our ongoing work to ensure that everyone has a safe place to call home.”
Dubbed the State Action for Facilitation on Encampments Task Force, Newsom’s new team will include representatives from six different state agencies and departments, each with a different role to play in removing an encampment: 

The California Highway Patrol will be responsible for providing public safety support during a removal, and later for monitoring the area to prevent the encampment from returning. 
The Office of Emergency Services will oversee logistics and procuring resources. 
The Department of Housing and Community Development will be in charge of providing housing and supportive services for the people living in encampments. 
The Interagency Council on Homelessness will guide local governments on how to help those people. 
Health and Human Services will support local government’s efforts to provide health care to people in encampments
Caltrans will do the actual work of clearing encampments.

It’s too soon to tell exactly how this new directive will change the state’s response to homeless encampments, said Alex Visotzky, senior Cailifornia policy fellow for the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The language in the news release sent out by Newsom’s office had few specific details about how the task force will function. Newsom’s office did not respond to a request for an interview.
But the only proven way to resolve an encampment is to move people into housing and connect them with the other services they need, Visotzky said.
“My hope is that the task force will make sure we’re understanding the needs of residents of those encampments,” he said, “and what barriers they’re facing to getting back into housing, if we’re going to see results.”
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass applauded the new task force Friday.
“Homeless encampments, debris and graffiti located on highways and freeways are under state jurisdiction,” she said in a statement. “I am glad that the Governor is continuing action to collaborate with local efforts. Los Angeles has bucked nationwide trends of increasing homelessness and Governor Newsom’s announcement of a task force today will help keep that momentum.”
A 2024 U.S. Supreme Court ruling gave cities and counties more freedom to ticket or arrest people for camping in public, even if there are no shelter beds available. Since then, homelessness-related tickets and arrests have soared in some California cities.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s administration is cracking down on encampments at the federal level. Trump signed an executive order this summer pushing cities and states to use law enforcement to get people off the streets.
Some experts and advocates in the homelessness sector have pointed out the similarities between Trump and Newsom’s approaches to clearing encampments. 
But on Friday, Newsom’s administration tried to distance its policies from that of the president, stating in a news release:
“Unlike the haphazard strategies employed by the Trump Administration, California’s SAFE Task Force brings together each of the tools created by Governor Newsom to clear encampments and connect people with the care they need.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080924_SF-Sweep_MO_CM_33.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-29 15:58:35.156813

Mike Braun speaks at a news conference on Friday, Aug. 29, 2025, in Indianapolis. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun on Friday again declined to say where he stands on redistricting congressional maps, maintaining that he wants to hear first from Republican leaders in the Indiana General Assembly.
“I’ve been very clear on that issue. That hasn’t changed,” Braun told reporters during a visit to the Indiana State Police post in Indianapolis. “You’re going to hear individual representatives and senators speak up, and the two leaders of each caucus, I think, are going to … put a lot of thought into what their own members are wanting to do, and that process will take a while to play out.”
Braun emphasized that he is deferring to House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray. Neither of the Republican legislative leaders have made their positions clear either, though some of their caucus members have. 
One longtime Senate Republican came out Friday against redistricting as the likelihood for a special session seems to be gaining momentum. 
“Our maps are only four years old. They have undergone considerable public scrutiny and review,” said Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus. “There is no justification for holding a special session to change our districts in mid-census. If Texas and California want to take the cynical step of redistricting their seats, so be it. But Hoosier lawmakers should be leaders in resisting this hypocrisy, not followers of this effort promoted by outsiders, not Hoosiers.”
Braun urges ‘listening’
Indiana’s next, regularly scheduled legislative session will begin in early January. There is a one-day ceremonial Organization Day also in November.
“Once I get a clear message from (Bray and Huston), I’ll decide whether we’re going to call a session — or if there are other reasons why you’d need a session prior to what we’re going to be doing in January,” Braun added.
The governor’s indecisiveness comes as Indiana Republicans face increasing pressure from Washington, D.C., to revisit the state’s congressional districts, last drawn in 2021. 
Indiana Republicans go to Washington D.C., critics rebuff redistricting push

Club for Growth — a leading national conservative group — has put together an ad saying, “Hoosier Republicans must fight back. Trump needs state lawmakers to pass new maps to level the playing field.”
A group of Republican state lawmakers traveled to the White House earlier this week where talks centered, in part, on redistricting. Bray and Huston additionally had a private discussion with President Donald Trump. 
“They are polling their own members in each caucus,” Braun said. “They’re in the process, they’re getting their own members engaged, and you’ll see more — because there’ll be more.”
The governor noted, however, that he has yet to speak with Bray, Huston or other state lawmakers about redistricting.
“I want everybody to weigh in, to speak out individually, and then the two leaders will have to collate all that and see where we go,” Braun continued. “And if somebody wants to speak to me directly, just like on any subject, I’m more accessible than probably any governor has been, and they want to talk to me about it, fine, I’m not reaching out to them because they’re members of those two caucuses.
Where Indiana lawmakers stand
While many Indiana Republicans have kept mum about their stances on redistricting, some have shifted their tone since returning from their trip to the nation’s capital.

Walker — who is not seeking re-election — urged Braun and colleagues to resist any push for redistricting.
He defended the current boundaries, writing that “the current maps increased the number of counties contained within one district and reduced the number of townships split among districts.” 
He noted that 84 of Indiana’s 92 counties remain whole under the plan and that population totals in each district are “nearly equal, give or take a handful of people, at just over 753,000 people.”
Republicans currently hold a 7-2 advantage in Indiana’s congressional delegation. The maps, approved by the GOP-controlled legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Eric Holcomb, have not been challenged in court.
“To those who want to redraw the districts it’s worth noting that they are very good maps, free from lawsuits,” Walker said. “Our legislature should keep our focus on solving problems facing Hoosiers, not responding to the political priorities of other states or D.C. interests.”
“Our maps are fair,” he added. “They are balanced. And in Indiana, voters have the power.”

The project will be funded through private donations. A private foundation had raised $6 million for the new residence as of 2022, according to reporting from The Oklahoman. 
The new residence is expected to be completed by November 2026, said Trait Thompson, chair of the commission. Gov. Kevin Stitt will not use the new residence, but the next Oklahoma governor should be able to occupy it if the project goes according to schedule, he said.  
The mansion was built in 1928 and underwent a $2 million renovation in 2021. 
Despite the renovations, the mansion is no longer fit for the standards of what modern families need, Thompson said. 
Thompson said the commission’s unanimous decision to approve construction hinged on ensuring the new design was complementary to the current grounds and buildings. 
“We want to make sure that it doesn’t overwhelm or overshadow any of the current buildings,” he said.  
The current structure for the governor’s mansion will remain on the grounds as historic property. Its future use has not yet been determined. 
“It will be available to the public for tours,” Thompson said. “It could be a place where visiting dignitaries could potentially stay if that was needed. But it will still be maintained as a place for the governor to be able to have some of those more public meetings, like breakfasts and lunches and things like that.”
Duane Mass, state capitol architect and curator, said he’d like to see the mansion be more available to the public once the residence is completed. 
“There are just lots of wonderful things that could be done with that space in the future that the average everyday citizen could come enjoy,” he said. “That’s going to be fleshed out once we get the next governor a new house to live in.” 
The total cost of the project was not immediately clear as the funding is coming from a private group, Mass said.

Last week, Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a petition for the state’s highest court to consider removing Martin from her position, citing violations of the law and a hostile work environment including “yelling, screaming, and belittling behavior.” Martin has denied all allegations of hostile work environments. As of publication, the Supreme Court had not  taken any action on the motion, according to a Source NM review of the docket. 
A voicemail, text message and email to Martin were not returned before publication. 
The petition was sparked after state lawmakers voted to remove funding from Martin’s office and gave it to the neighboring district attorney in San Juan County, a move spearheaded by  Senate Finance Chair George Muñoz (D-Gallup), citing turnover of Gallup prosecutors. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the budget, but Martin has refused to cede financial control and filed a lawsuit in Santa Fe court against lawmakers, the governor and San Juan District Attorney Jack Fortner in July, which remains ongoing.
Torrez said in a news release Friday the failure to prosecute cases with defendents accused of murder and rape endangers the community and trust in the office, and will be added to the petition for Martin’s removal.
“The decision to dismiss these cases without properly referring them to another prosecutor jeopardized not only the pursuit of justice for the victims and their families, but also the safety of our communities. By stepping  in immediately, we are making sure these cases move forward and sending a clear message: no victim in New Mexico will be abandoned, and no community will be left unprotected,” Torrez said in a statement.
Further, the New Mexico Department of Justice requested the state’s highest court require the McKinley County District Attorney’s office to provide all information regarding case dismissals and refusals since Jan. 1 2021, saying it’s necessary to determine “how pervasive this problem is.” 
Both cases are several years old, which pushes the clock for statutes of limitations in bringing charges or finding evidence, the news release said. 
The first case was dismissed in 2023, against Tyson Long, now 28, who Gallup Police accused of murdering an unidentified man on Dec. 6, 2022. In court documents, police say they saw Long confronting the victim with a gun before shots were fired and fleeing the area. 
The petition to dismiss Long’s case noted that then-Chief Deputy District Attorney Mandana Shoushtari had stated there was a conflict of interest. 
When reached by phone on Friday, Shoushtari told Source NM she was ordered by Martin to dismiss the case and send it to another district attorney’s office for prosecution. 
“All the witnesses in the case were defendants I was prosecuting in other cases at the time, so by law, I couldn’t put them on the stand and cross-examine them,” she told Source NM.
Shoushtari said she was unclear on the timeline, but said she believed Martin tried to hand the case over to another office. 
“Other DAs were not willing to take cases from her, for whatever reason, but I did know she tried to conflict it out,” Shoushtari said. 
Shoushtari no longer works for Martin’s office, saying she was let go in September of 2024 after “butting heads because I disagreed with the way she was running the office.” Shoushtari is now a deputy district attorney for the 10th Judicial District overseeing De Baca, Harding and Quay counties. 
The second case involves Valentino Roderick Johnson, now 30, who was arrested by McKinley County Sheriff’s deputies on Oct. 28, 2023. According to police reports, a passerby saw a car crash and said he came upon Johnson, heavily intoxicated and on top of a woman screaming for help and banging on the horn, saying that Johnson had raped her. 
Just over a week later, Martin dismissed the case, writing “this complaint is dismissed without prejudice, for reason, conflict for District Attorney’s Office.” 
In the news release, the New Mexico DOJ says that “Martin indicated the defendant was a friend of her children.” 
“Whether it was negligent or intentional, I find it unacceptable that DA Martin dismissed this case [Valentino Roderick Johnson] due to a personal connection to the suspect and it was never refiled,” said McKinley County Sheriff James Maiorano III in a statement. “The victim in this case deserves better, the deputies that worked this case deserve better, and the community deserves better. We are thankful to the NMDOJ for helping us to seek justice.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bmartin-1024x1024.png,,,2025-08-29 15:58:35.156813

The post Daley, LaHood discuss rebooted ‘fair maps’ campaign in Illinois by Peter Hancock appeared first on Capitol News Illinois - A service of the Illinois Press Foundation","Former U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood joined former Commerce Secretary Bill Daley on the latest episode of the Capitol Cast podcast to discuss their renewed “fair maps” push. 
Article Summary

A bipartisan group led by Democrat Bill Daley and Republican Ray LaHood has launched a new push to pass a state constitutional amendment to put legislative redistricting in the hands of an independent commission.
The Illinois Supreme Court threw out a similar proposal in 2016, but Daley and LaHood believe their new proposal will pass legal scrutiny.
The proposal would not alter the way Illinois draws congressional district maps.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD — Two veteran federal officials from Illinois are relaunching an effort to amend the Illinois Constitution and end partisan gerrymandering in state legislative districts.
Bill Daley, a Democrat from Chicago who served as secretary of commerce under President Bill Clinton, and Ray LaHood, a former Republican member of Congress from Peoria who served as transportation secretary under President Barack Obama, hope they can succeed where a similar effort in 2016 failed.
The two spoke with Capitol News Illinois for an episode of the Capitol Cast podcast. The interview is also available on CNI’s YouTube channel.
“We had a very, rather complicated, process that we put forward to the voters, if it had gotten on the ballot,” Daley said of the 2016 campaign, which he actively supported. “What we learned from that, and looking at the Supreme Court decision and looking at prior cases, (was) that we should simplify and not be as complicated as we became in 2016. We have a plan that’s simple. We feel very confident that the courts will approve this.”



The 2016 effort
In 2016, supporters of the “Fair Maps” initiative gathered enough signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot to establish an 11-member commission to redraw legislative maps after each decennial census. Seven of those members would have been chosen by a panel appointed by the auditor general, while the other four would have been appointed by legislative leaders.
But before the proposal got on the ballot, opponents of the measure – including allies of then-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan – filed a court challenge and the Illinois Supreme Court struck it down on technical grounds.
The court ruled that under the Illinois Constitution, citizen-initiated amendments must be limited to dealing with “structural and procedural subjects contained in Article IV” of the constitution, which deals with the legislature. By assigning new duties to the auditor general, the court said, the proposed amendment went beyond what is allowed in a citizen-initiated amendment and, therefore, was unconstitutional.
That case was filed by a group called People’s Map whose chairman, John Hooker, was an executive at the utility giant Commonwealth Edison. In July, Hooker was sentenced to 1 ½ years in prison and ordered to pay a $500,000 fine after being convicted as part of the “ComEd Four” for his role in bribing Madigan with jobs and contracts for his political allies in exchange for legislation favorable to the utility.
‘Picking your voters’
Daley and LaHood said the problem that existed in 2016 still exists today. That is, legislative maps are drawn in a way that protects the majority party.
Currently, that’s the Democratic Party, which holds 61% of the seats in the Illinois House and 68% of the seats in the state Senate, despite the fact that Democrats, on average, have won only about 55% of the vote in recent statewide elections.
“When the Republicans had the majority, they did the same thing that Democrats did,” Daley said. “Whether they did it as well or not, that can be debated. But this idea of picking your voters to maintain control, whichever party it is.”
The new proposal calls for establishing a 12-member “Legislative Redistricting Commission,” whose members would be appointed by the top Democrat and Republican in each legislative chamber. Each leader would appoint one member of the General Assembly and two members who are not lawmakers.
The commission would be barred from using voters’ party registration or voting history data when drawing maps. Districts also would be required to be compact, contiguous and drawn along existing county and municipal lines where possible.
Congress not affected
The proposal would not, however, change the method of drawing congressional district maps, a topic that has made national news in recent weeks when the Texas Legislature held a special session to redraw that state’s congressional maps to create five more Republican-leaning districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Daley and LaHood said the proposal is limited to state legislative redistricting because citizen-initiated amendments are limited to structural and procedural subjects contained in Article IV of the state constitution. Congressional redistricting is a power conferred on state legislatures from the U.S. Constitution.
Neither Daley nor LaHood would predict whether changing the mapmaking process would alter the makeup of the General Assembly significantly or change the kinds of legislation that passes through it. But LaHood — pointing to states like Iowa and California, which have adopted independent mapmaking commissions — said drawing fair maps is important for individuals and communities.
“They’re not splitting up neighborhoods, they’re not splitting up communities, they’re not splitting up counties,” he said. “These maps are reflective of where people live and having their friends and neighbors as their representatives … and so I think in states where they have citizens drawing the maps and keeping friends and neighbors together, the voters are pretty happy.”

Babies and children in the United States are nearly twice as likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with their peers in other wealthy countries, according to a new study.
The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.

U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

Allen is the first woman and the first Black person to hold the position. She has served in the role since July 2023 and will remain at the university as a full-time faculty member.
Interim LSU Provost Troy Blanchard said the university would conduct a national search for Allen’s replacement, who would start when she steps down at the end of the spring 2026 semester.
Allen is the fourth high-profile Black administrator at LSU to leave their position this year.
In June, the university’s first Black president, William Tate, left for the same position at Rutgers University.
In January, LSU’s first Black general counsel, Winston DeCuir, stepped down and accepted a one-year faculty position at the law school.
Kimberly Lewis, the university’s chief administrative officer, was asked to resign in February.  She has since accepted a job with Tate at Rutgers.
Allen’s departure leaves yet another top administrative job open in the LSU System.
Three other dean posts at its Baton Rouge campus are currently filled by interim office holders, and there are vacancies at president and provost.  LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport is also looking for its next chancellor.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A lawsuit can go forward challenging a Lincoln city ordinance banning the carrying of weapons – even by those with a state concealed carry permit – in city parks and other city property, the state’s highest court ruled on Friday.
The Nebraska Supreme Court, in a 22-page opinion on Friday, ruled that even though the law had not yet been enforced, four individual gun owners named in a lawsuit could challenge the law because there was a “credible threat” that they could be harmed by the ordinance in the future.
The ruling, written by Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, agreed partly with a district judge’s prior ruling that the Nebraska Firearm Owners Association, as an organization, lacked the ability to challenge the Lincoln law.

But it stated that the individual firearm owners had legal standing and could sue – thus sending the lawsuit back to the Lancaster District Court for further proceedings.
The gun rights lawsuit was spawned by passage of Legislative Bill 77 in 2023 that eliminated the requirement to obtain a state permit to carry a concealed handgun. It also barred cities and villages from adopting “certain regulation of weapons.” Individuals can still obtain a state concealed carry permit, so they can legally carry in other states.
On the date the law went into effect, Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird signed an executive order banning the carrying of “weapons” in “vehicles, buildings, or facilities owned, leased, controlled, or maintained by the city.” The order was later amended slightly, but continued to bar anyone — even those who had passed a gun safety class and obtained a state concealed carry permit — from carrying a weapon on city property, including public parks.
The NFOA and four individuals – Terry Fitzgerald, Dave Kendle, Raymond Bretthauer and D.J. Davis – sued to block the Lincoln order. They also challenged city ordinances that required any firearm purchase in the City of Lincoln to be reported to law enforcement and barred the sale or possession of “multiburst trigger activators and switch-blade knives.” Such trigger activators allow a semi-automatic weapon to significantly increase a gun’s rate of firing.
The individuals, all of whom had state concealed carry permits, argued that they regularly carry concealed guns in city parks and city trails to protect themselves and their families. Three of the plaintiffs said they carried concealed weapons “100% of the time.”
Lancaster County District Court Judge Andrew Jacobsen dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that both the NFOA and the four gun owners lacked standing, or the ability, to challenge a law that had not yet been enforced. The judge said the Nebraska Supreme Court had not yet determined how someone could establish standing to challenge a law who had not yet been impacted by the law.
The Supreme Court, in clarifying who has standing to sue, stated Friday that the individual gun owners, because they faced an “imminent and substantial” threat of harm, had the ability to sue the city. The ruling, however, stated that the NFOA, which claimed membership of 10,000, lacked standing to sue on behalf of its members.
There was one exception – the high court ruled that both the NFOA and the four gun owners lacked standing to challenge one Lincoln ordinance, one regulating the storage of guns in vehicles. Three Supreme Court judges – Lindsey Miller-Lerman, Jonathan Papik and Stephanie Stacy – issued brief concurring opinions to the unanimous ruling.
“We are pleased that now we can challenge these laws on the merits,” said Ryan Morrison, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, which represented the gun owners. “Following this victory, we will show the local governments of Lincoln and Omaha, that their firearms regulations violate the Second Amendment and state law.”
Chris Triebsch, the chief communications officer for the City of Lincoln, said Friday that “public safety” is the top priority for the city and the reason for gun restrictions within the public spaces and city properties. Triebsch said the city stands ready to “demonstrate our case on the merits in district court.”

Jesse Merkel said his son Fletcher loved his family, friends, fishing, cooking and “any sport he was allowed to play.”
“Please remember Fletcher for the person he was and not the act that ended his life,” Merkel read from a statement at a news conference outside the church.
He mourned that he would never get to see Fletcher become a man because of the shooting.
“While the hole in our hearts and lives will never be filled, I hope that in time our family can find healing.  I pray that the other victim’s family can find some semblance of the same,” Merkel said.
He thanked students and adults in the church for their heroic actions, without whom the tragedy could have been even worse.
Moyski’s parents Michael and Jackie released a statement saying she was a “bright, joyful, and deeply loved” girl “whose laughter, kindness, and spirit touched everyone.”
They said they are shattered by unspeakable grief and said they hope her “memory fuels action.”
“We urge our leaders and communities to take meaningful steps to address gun violence and the mental health crisis in this country,” the family’s statement said. “Change is possible, and it is necessary — so that Harper’s story does not become yet another in a long line of tragedies.”
Merkel’s family said they have not authorized a GoFundMe or any fundraiser but will establish a scholarship at a later date.

Joni Ernst addressed members of the Westside Conservative Club at the Machine Shed Restaurant in Urbandale Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Democratic candidates running for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat said Friday that reports indicating U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst will not seek reelection in 2026 demonstrate the strength of their campaigns.
According to CBS News article published Friday, Ernst does not plan to seek reelection for a third term in the 2026 election. Ernst’s campaign did not reply to a request for comment Friday on the story. The article states multiple unnamed sources have said Ernst is scheduled to make an announcement on the issue Thursday.
Whether Ernst will run for reelection has been a subject of discussion for several months. The Iowa Republican, who was first elected in 2014 and reelected in, has not publicly stated if she plans to run for a third term, though she said during the Iowa State Fair an announcement would be “coming soon.”
She told Democrats to “bring it on” in the U.S. Senate race at a Westside Conservative Club meeting with Republicans earlier in August. But some in Washington had speculated she would not run, with Politico reporting in July that Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he was “doing everything I can to encourage her to run for reelection” amid concerns from Senate Republicans that she planned retire from Congress after her current term.
Ernst also raised less in the most recent Federal Election Commission filings than she had during the same period in her 2020 reelection campaign, though she still raised more than her Democratic challengers.
Ernst had hired a campaign manager in June and is still set to hold her annual “Roast and Ride” fundraiser Oct. 11.
While Ernst has not officially said if she plans to run again, several other candidates have announced their 2026 campaigns for the Senate seat. Four Democrats, state Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage are running for the Democratic nomination. Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, was also running for the seat, but dropped out to endorse Turek. Among Republicans, former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, a former Libertarian candidate for the state Senate, have also announced campaigns.
In the wake of the story stating Ernst will not run for reelection, other candidates for the U.S. Senate said the report reflects Iowa voters’ want for a change in representation. Wahls said in a statement a recent survey from Public Policy Polling found Wahls leading Ernst in the race.
“Joni Ernst is retiring because she knows our campaign is on track to win,” Wahls said in a statement. “Our campaign was the strongest to take on Ernst, and I will take on any other politician who embraces the same corrupt agenda of the Washington establishment that screws over Iowans in favor of big corporations, billionaires, and self-serving and cowardly politicians.”
Norris released a statement Friday saying she is “ready to defeat any Republican” in the 2026 election cycle.
“Joni Ernst is seeing the writing on the wall that Iowans are ready for change,” Norris said. “Republicans’ destructive and unpopular agenda has failed Iowans and we are paying the price for Joni Ernst’s votes to slash Medicaid and health care, raise housing and energy costs and explode the deficit, to pay for tax giveaways for billionaires.”

Comprehensive consumer privacy laws are taking effect in eight states this year. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)This year, comprehensive privacy laws are going into effect in eight states to regulate how businesses handle digital information and to give consumers more protections over their personal data.
The laws in Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Tennessee have taken effect already this year, according to a database from the International Association of Privacy Professionals’ Westin Research Center.
Maryland’s privacy law, signed by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore last year, will go into effect Oct. 1.
Privacy laws enacted in Indiana, Kentucky and Rhode Island will go into effect next year.
Several other states are considering comprehensive privacy bills during this year’s legislative sessions. They include Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
When a person visits a website, applies to a job or logs into an online portal, they may be sharing their personal information. Comprehensive privacy laws can apply to a wide range of companies that participate in this kind of data collection.
These laws generally include two types of provisions — those related to consumer rights and those that establish business obligations, according to the association.
Under each of the new laws, consumers have the right to control when and how their data is collected and shared. Some of those provisions include the right to delete data from a company’s database, the ability to opt out of sharing sensitive information and the right to prohibit a company from selling their data.
The new measures also require businesses to ask consumers if they want to opt in to data collection. In some states, businesses are required to complete consumer data risk assessments and identify ways in which discrimination could take place. Some companies also may be required to limit to how consumer data is processed.
In 2018, California became the first state to enact comprehensive privacy legislation for consumers in the state; the law went into effect in 2020. Virginia and Colorado enacted laws in 2021. Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Utah also have comprehensive laws that have taken effect, the database shows.
Other states have passed measures with more specific data protections this year. California, Colorado and Montana, for instance, passed legislation that aims to protect sensitive brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings, KFF Health News reported earlier this year.
One bill under consideration in New York would establish data privacy protections for children. And another measure in Pennsylvania aims to improve consumer data protections with genetic testing companies.
In South Carolina, two data privacy bills — one specifically on protecting children — were introduced by Rep. Brandon Guffey ahead of the 2025 session. Neither of those proposals from the Rock Hill Republican received any traction but could be taken up after legislators return in January.
Without comprehensive federal protections, state lawmakers are driving the push to protect consumers from having their personal information shared without their knowledge.

(Photo courtesy of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, Miami Field Office)More cities and states have responded to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s threat to prosecute them over so-called sanctuary policies limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — some by thumbing their noses, at least one by acquiescing.
Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.
Trump administration vows to ‘come after’ sanctuary states and cities, despite court setbacks

Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.
Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct.22.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A 34-year-old female hiker was stable but transported to the hospital after being injured Wednesday by a brown-colored bear at Lake Janet in Glacier National Park, the park said in a news release.
The bear ran off after her hiking partner used bear spray, according to the news release.
The park said it could not identify the species of bear. It described the incident as follows:

The hiking party of two was hiking westbound near Lake Janet when a medium brown-colored bear with two cubs charged out of the brush, toward the woman. The woman dove off the trail, while covering her head. The bear swiped at her, injuring her shoulder and arm. As this was happening, her hiking partner deployed bear spray, causing the bear to immediately run away. The entire incident lasted fewer than 30 seconds. The hiking party continued toward the Lake Janet Wilderness Campground where they found other hikers with an InReach device, which they used to send an SOS to park dispatch.
At approximately 3:42 p.m. park dispatch received the SOS for a female who had an encounter with a brown colored sow. Park staff and ALERT were dispatched. ALERT quickly got to the patient, finding her in stable condition. ALERT transported the woman to Logan Health in Kalispell.
No action will be taken against the bear at this time; the encounter was a surprise to a sow with two cubs that reacted defensively. The area of the trail the hiking party was on is confined by the lake and dense brush, which the bear came out of. The species of the bear could not be positively identified.

The Lake Janet Wilderness Campground was temporarily closed and will reopen when appropriate, the park said. It said fall is when bears are especially active, eating as much as possible in preparation for hibernation.

Multiple mosquito samples infected with West Nile Virus have led state officials to raise Rhode Island’s risk level from “Medium” to “High,” according to a joint announcement Thursday from the Rhode Island Departments of Health (RIDOH) and Environmental Management (RIDEM). 
The positive cases prompting the raised level of caution were found in Johnston, East Providence, and Cranston. The infected mosquitoes were found in samples collected on Aug. 18. Eighty-six mosquito pools were tested over the time period, totaling 461 mosquitoes in all. The three positive samples were from the genus Culex, which includes a wide variety of mosquito species that can carry West Nile, including the common house mosquito. The mosquitoes were tested at the state health department’s laboratory in Providence.
The state’s highest level of West Nile risk is “Critical,” which is one step above “High.”
East Providence kicked off this summer’s West Nile season when the first positive mosquito sample was collected there on July 21. The second positive sample came from Bristol on July 28. 
So far, the largest collection of positive cases this year was found in the Aug. 12 batch of routine trapping and testing. Two positive samples hailed from East Providence, one came from Westerly, and another positive was found in West Greenwich. The East Providence mosquitoes were both Culex. The Westerly sample was Culiseta melanura, or the black-tailed mosquito, and the West Greenwich mosquito was Coquillettidia perturbans.
Mosquitoes in the latest samples tested negative for other illnesses, including Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and Jamestown Canyon Virus. West Nile remains the only mosquito-borne disease detected in Rhode Island this year.
West Nile Virus is the most common mosquito-borne illness in the U.S. While most people infected never develop symptoms, about one in five experience West Nile fever, which can bring on headaches, body aches, and other flu-like symptoms. 
In rare cases, West Nile Virus can progress to serious neuroinvasive illnesses that involve encephalitis or meningitis. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that about 10% of these severe infections are fatal, most often among people over age 60 or those who are immunocompromised. 
As of Aug. 26, preliminary CDC data shows 433 West Nile Virus cases across the nation, with neuroinvasive illness involved in 257 of those cases. The virus has been recorded in 34 states so far this year.
Because the national database uses data reported by counties, the CDC notes that West Nile cases are often undercounted. The data can skew toward overrepresenting more severe cases because people without neuroinvasive illness are less likely to be reported.  
Between 1999 and 2024, the CDC documented 60,992 human cases of West Nile Virus nationwide, including 3,134 deaths.
Health officials advise Rhode Islanders to safeguard themselves against mosquito bites by using EPA-registered bug repellent and wearing long sleeves and pants, especially at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active. Residents are also advised to remove standing water from yards to reduce breeding sites and to repair holes in window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out.
The Department of Health posts weekly mosquito testing updates on its website. More prevention tips are available at health.ri.gov/mosquito and dem.ri.gov/mosquito.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Amid tense negotiations over the Colorado River’s future, Nevada leaders came together Thursday to focus on the state’s strategy to meet the climate and drought crisis threatening Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam.
Democratic Rep. Susie Lee, whose district falls within the boundaries of Lake Mead and half of the Hoover Dam, brought together regional water and hydropower leaders to highlight mounting needs the state faces during her third annual Southern Nevada Water Summit at the Springs Preserve.
Before water was piped from the Colorado River to Las Vegas, the burgeoning community relied entirely on groundwater from the Las Vegas Springs located on the site where the Springs Preserve now sits.
That water soon dried up after demand from the growing city depleted the aquifer. Now water managers are working to ensure Lake Mead – which provides nearly 90% of the city’s water – does not meet the same fate.

The summit comes at a critical time as states run against a mid-November deadline to reach a consensus on how the river and its reservoirs should be managed after current guidelines expire at the end of 2026. If states can’t reach a deal ahead of the deadline, the federal government will likely step in and make those decisions for them.
“The reality is it’s a really tough set of negotiations right now, so we’re meeting pretty regularly,” said Southern Nevada Water Authority Deputy General Manager Colby Pellegrino.
“There’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. We are nowhere close to agreement,” Pellegrino said.
Still, it’s an improvement from December when representatives from Lower Basin states — Nevada, Arizona, and California — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — left a major water summit in Las Vegas without even speaking to each other.
Upper and Lower Basin states have largely quarreled over which portion of the basin should decrease its water use, and by how much.
States did come closer to a consensus after a breakthrough proposal in July to share the waterway based on the actual flow of the river, as opposed to projected flows and historical agreements. The proposal is still in play, said Pellegrino.
“I personally think it’s really good public policy for us to pursue something like that. It’s very responsive to current conditions. It does a decent job of creating some equity between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin,” Pellegrino said.
“But we’ve got a long way to go to see if we can agree on the details,” she continued.
Water flows in the Colorado River are shrinking due to climate change, and the reality of what that means for states reliant on the river is becoming more stark.
Earlier this month, federal officials announced they would continue water allocation cuts on the Colorado River for the fifth consecutive year following a persistent drought that’s drained Lake Mead.
Lake Mead’s elevation is currently at about 1,054 feet above sea level – 175 feet below what’s considered full. Based on water storage, the reservoir is at 31% of capacity.
Nevada is ahead of the game when it comes to preparing for those reductions, said Pellegrino.
Nevada receives less than 2% of Colorado River water each year, the smallest share of any state in the basin. Those limitations have forced Nevada to become a conservation pioneer.
Navajo Nation pushes for water rights as Colorado River shrinks

Southern Nevada hasn’t used its full allocation of Colorado River water for years. Conservation efforts have helped Southern Nevada use 36% less water from Lake Mead than it did two decades ago, according to the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA).
Even under the most severe water shortage, the Southern Nevada Water Authority would be able to access its share of the river thanks to major infrastructure projects, including Intake 3 — the ‘third straw’ — and the Low Lake Level Pumping Station.
“Our intake and our infrastructure allows us to deliver water to this valley even when water cannot be released from Hoover Dam,” Pellegrino said.
Other water infrastructure projects in Nevada have been funded by the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, which allocated 10% of revenue derived from land sales to the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
To date, SNPLMA has generated more than $368 million to fund Nevada’s water priorities and infrastructure needs. Pellegrino said SNWA will continue leveraging that funding to support water conservation, infrastructure upgrades, long-term drought planning, and environmental restoration.
Additional sources of federal funding have also been a major contributor to water conservation on the Colorado River, said Lee.
The congresswoman highlighted the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $4 billion in investments for drought mitigation along the Colorado River Basin. She also highlighted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which provided $141 million for water conservation projects in Southern Nevada, including funding for the Las Vegas Wash, which carries millions of gallons of treated wastewater to Lake Mead.
That funding allowed California, Arizona and Nevada to collectively reduce water use by at least 3 million acre-feet through the end of 2026, stabilizing Lake Mead for several years.
Upper and lower basin states hit tough impasse at annual Colorado River conference

Another major issue created by lower water levels at Lake Mead is the loss of hydropower productivity. Hoover Dam generates half the power that it did in 2000 due to consistently lower water levels in Lake Mead.
If Lake Mead falls another 20 feet, Hoover Dam’s capacity to generate electricity would be slashed by 70% from its current level.
The break point for hydropower is 1,035 feet. At that level, 12 older turbines at Hoover that are not designed for low reservoir levels would be shut down. Only five newer turbines installed a decade ago would continue to generate power.
There is a way to fix the problem, said the Colorado River Commission of Nevada’s director of hydropower Gail Bates.
Replacing the 12 older turbines would maintain power generation even at low levels, however it would require significant investment.
“We’re really getting to the point where they’re urgently needed. Bad news is the cost. They cost about $8 million each to install. So it’s a very heavy investment,” Bates said.
During the summit, Lee and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said they are working together to advance the Help Hoover Dam Act, a bill that would unlock some $50 million in stranded funding for the dam from an orphaned federal account.
The funds had been set aside for pension benefits for federal employees, but advocates for the bill say Congress funds pension benefits through other means and that the funds could be spent on dam upgrades if the Bureau of Reclamation was given the authority to do so.
“The dam is turning 100 years old in 2035 and the Bureau of Reclamation is estimating that it will require about $200 million in upgrades. This is money that’s just sitting there stranded. It would be so good to free that up so we can make those investments,” Cortez Masto said.

It ended about 90 minutes later with the young choir from St. James Catholic Church in Gulfport joining songwriter Steve Azar in an energetic rendition of “One Mississippi,” the state song.
It was as if the ceremony and the many photographs and memories brought out and examined this week ripped off the bandage to the pain of Katrina and the loss of 238 people. 
Here are the five most memorable quotes of the day from Gulfport:
“We’re so blessed. We’re so fortunate,” said Gulfport Mayor Hugh Keating, whose home was flooded with 8 feet of water during Katrina. “We survived, and we thrived,” he said of south Mississippi. 
He and all the speakers saluted the volunteers who came from across the country and even the world to help with the recovery — “960,000. I had no idea there was that many,” Keating said.
The speaker’s platform, set up where the storm surge rushed in to devastate Gulfport, is close to the Mississippi Aquarium and Island View Casino, which opened since the storm. The State Port of Gulfport was rebuilt and the downtown is revitalized, with a lively restaurant scene and offices.
“We coined a new word after Katrina — ‘slabbed,’” said Haley Barbour, who was governor at the time Katrina struck. From Waveland, where after the devastating storm surge “every structure was destroyed,” he said, to Pascagoula, 80 miles away from the center and still with so many homes lost, “It looked like the hand of God had wiped away the Coast — utter destruction,” he said.
The audience gave Barbour and his wife, Marsha, standing ovations. She was at Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg the day before Katrina and “came down with the troops,” her husband said. She was on the Coast, making sure needs were met, for months.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard shakes hands with Gulfport Mayor Hugh Keating on Friday, Aug. 29, 2025, in Gulfport, Miss.
“We are always better together,” said Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. director of national intelligence, who greeted the crowd with an “Aloha.” Listening to the stories from Katrina on the 20th anniversary reminded her of the fires that destroyed Lahaina on Maui in her native state of Hawaii, she said, when 102 people died and the area was left with total devastation. 
We will always remember those lost, she said, “But my hope is that we remain inspired, as we stand here 20 years later, by what came after, and remember the unity that we felt, remember the strength that came from all of us coming together as neighbors, as friends, as colleagues, as Americans, that allowed us to get through these historic disasters.”
“Together, we proved you should never bet against Mississippi,” said Gov. Tate Reeves. At the time, Katrina was five times the size of any natural disaster to hit the United States, he said. 
People returned home to find nothing but “steps to nowhere,” every other trace of their home gone. Their churches, schools and offices also were damaged and destroyed. 
Sen. Trent Lott and Sen. Thad Cochran fought for federal funds, working with state officials and Gov. Barbour to bring south Mississippi back, he said. “Everyone knew who was in charge, and that was Gov. Barbour,” he said. “He never once wavered. He never once quit.” 
If Mississippi only built the Coast back to what it was, the state would have failed, was Barbour’s mantra after Katrina and the vision for south Mississippi today. The priorities initially were homes, jobs and schools, and in the 20 years since, south Mississippi has seen great business growth. 
“Hurricane roulette,” is how Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann terms it. “Sooner or later it will be our time,” he said, but Mississippi is better prepared than it was for Katrina. Homes and offices were built back stronger and, “We have money set aside in the state,” he said.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state on Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotes. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

,DC,2025-08-29 17:57:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judge in Fed firing case looks to speed proceeding,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-fed-firing-case-looks-speed-proceeding,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge Friday said she would set an expedited briefing schedule for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook’s challenge to President Donald Trump’s attempted firing of her earlier in the week. Cook is aiming to keep her position until her term expires in 2038, arguing that Trump's attempt to remove her has no legal basis. U.S. District of Columbia Judge Jia M. Cobb, whom former President Joe Biden appointed in 2021, gave Cook until Tuesday to respond to the government’s brief that seeks to justify her removal.The deadline is part of a fast-tracked briefing process for the case that could test the ability of the Federal Reserve Board to operate independently. If Cook is removed, Trump would select another member of the seven-person panel, likely meaning a majority of the board would align with the president.The legal challenge is likely to head to the Supreme Court. Cook filed a suit against the president Thursday after he posted to social media Monday that he would fire her over allegations she submitted improper paperwork in order to obtain a favorable mortgage on a second home. She has not been charged with a crime. An attorney for Cook, Abbe David Lowell, argued Friday that the allegations against Cook – that she engaged in mortgage fraud – did not qualify as “just cause” for removal. Trump has argued that under the Federal Reserve Act, he has the authority to dismiss a governor for “just cause,” which is typically defined as gross misconduct, but Lowell argued Trump was simply seeking to install a governor more aligned with his policy views. “Cause for the president means she won't go along with the interest-rate drop,” Lowell said during Friday’s hearing. For months Trump has pressured the Fed to lower interest rates. Cook, the first Black woman appointed to the board, has consistently voted with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell to not lower rates. Justice Department attorney Yaakov Roth, who is representing the administration, argued the statute defined just cause with open-ended language that gave the president broad discretion to fire a Fed member.Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, made the accusations of mortgage fraud. He referred Cook’s mortgage application to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.  In court filings, the Fed did not take a position but pushed for a quick ruling in order “to remove the existing cloud of uncertainty.”",,,,2025-08-29 14:57:52.334829

But President Trump has indicated he wants to pull back on giving states this type of support. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)For years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleanians made the Federal Emergency Management Agency the butt of their bitter jokes.
Anti-FEMA sentiment was so high in Louisiana that local businesses started selling T-shirts a couple of months after the storm lampooning the federal agency with slogans like “Where’s FEMA?” and “FEMA stands for Federal Employees Missing in Action”.
The sentiment is understandable. Almost a half dozen federal investigations launched in the six months after Hurricane Katrina made landfall Aug. 29, 2005 – and turned into the country’s most catastrophic natural disaster – determined FEMA failed in nearly every way to respond to the storm.
“Hurricane Katrina exposed flaws in the structure of FEMA and DHS that are too substantial to mend,” concluded a 2006 U.S. Senate report titled “Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared.”
Yet 20 years after the agency’s feckless Katrina response, some Louisiana leaders find themselves in the awkward position of having to defend FEMA.
President Donald Trump has made it clear he wants the federal government to play less of a role in natural disaster response, raising concerns that state and local governments might need to cover more of their recovery costs.
Such a change would likely affect Louisiana more than almost every other state in the country.
Since Katrina, Louisiana has received more public and individual assistance from FEMA ($12.6 billion) than all states but Florida ($16.6 billion) and New York ($19.4 billion), according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which tracks federal disaster spending.
The money helped Louisiana respond to 25 extreme weather events, including 11 hurricanes, six floods and one ice storm, over the past two decades.
That FEMA figure doesn’t account for all of the money Louisiana has received in the wake of Katrina. There was another $11 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went to the Road Home program to rebuild housing. All told, the federal government put an unprecedented $76 billion toward Louisiana’s recovery from the 2005 storm.
Louisiana simply wouldn’t be able to handle the financial burden of major disaster response without significant support from the federal government, according to several former state officials interviewed. Storms with far less impact than Katrina have the ability to overwhelm the state’s assets, they said.
If Louisiana has to worry about covering more disaster recovery costs, the state will have less money to spend on schools, universities, roads, bridges, and economic development.
“If we didn’t have the federal money, we would be in a terrible mess, and we would have been in a terrible mess from Katrina going forward,” said Jay Dardenne, Louisiana’s former lieutenant governor and state budget chief for former Gov. John Bel Edwards.

Uncertainty at FEMA
To what extent Trump will pull back on federal disaster assistance isn’t clear.
As recently as June, the president said he would push to eliminate FEMA altogether. He then backed off that rhetoric after July 4th weekend flooding in Texas killed at least 136 people, including children attending a sleep-away camp. His administration’s response was directly criticized.
Still, the Trump administration has already made several preliminary changes to FEMA that alarm emergency response experts. The agency has reduced staff and some of those who remain have been asked to help with hiring immigration enforcement agents instead of working on disaster relief.
The FEMA cuts come on top of those to the National Hurricane Center and other federal programs that provide crucial information to hurricane-prone states and help them ready for incoming storms.
Some reforms Congress enacted in the year after Katrina to strengthen FEMA have been ignored. A law requiring FEMA’s director to have experience in emergency response and disaster recovery isn’t being followed. Trump’s acting FEMA administrator David Richardson previously oversaw counter-terrorism programs but lacks natural disaster management experience.
There are concerns about whether a new policy delayed assistance during the Texas flood, similar to what unfolded in the aftermath of Katrina.
Due to a bureaucratic breakdown 20 years ago, FEMA failed to promptly provide boats for search-and-rescue teams in New Orleans, even after federal officials knew flooding was widespread, according to a U.S. Senate report from 2006.
This past July, questions were raised about whether search-and-rescue teams were delayed during the Texas flood because Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem now requires every FEMA contract over $100,000 to be approved personally by her, the Associated Press reported. The Trump administration has denied those allegations.
The ability of Louisiana and other states to respond to catastrophic weather with their own staff would also likely be harmed if Trump changes the traditional funding reimbursements for recovery efforts.
“The federal government will have a lasting role in responding to and funding the impact of disasters; local and state governments simply do not have the resources to do so,” said Paul Rainwater, who was executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority that managed federal funding for state rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina. He went on to serve as former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s chief of staff and budget czar.
“The question the Trump administration faces, given some of its comments about FEMA, is: When will a White House step in and help?” he said.

Presidential discretion
The president has a significant say in when FEMA provides funding to states after natural disasters, as well as how much money states or local governments receive.
When a state is overwhelmed by a catastrophic event, a governor makes a formal request of the president for federal assistance. FEMA starts to provide help to the state authorities after it is granted.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has denied disaster relief that was expected to be approved. His decisions have affected liberal-leaning states such as Maryland and Washington and more conservative ones like West Virginia.
He even stalled for a month on accepting a disaster declaration from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who personally knows Trump and served as his press secretary during his first term as president.
As president, Trump has the ability to not only approve federal assistance, but to also increase the share of the state or local costs that FEMA will reimburse. For example, federal law gives presidents discretion to reduce or waive the requirement for a state or local government to cover 25% of the cost of debris removal after a storm.
Louisiana has benefited from a reduction of these local financial responsibilities for nine weather events in the past 25 years, including for hurricanes Ida (2021), Laura (2020), Ike (2008), Gustav (2008), Rita (2005), Katrina (2005), and Ivan (2004). The 2016 Baton Rouge-area floods and a severe ice storm in 2001 were also approved for enhanced federal assistance, according to a 2023 Congressional report.
But all the upheaval should be a signal to local and state officials to prepare as if that extra FEMA help might not be coming their way, former FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell, who worked for President Joe Biden, said in a call with reporters this week.
“There are, right now, a lot of questions about whether any of those costs are going to be eligible for reimbursement,” Criswell said. “You need to put plans in place to make sure that you can do it, regardless of whether you get federal support.”
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he personally advocated for the federal government to cover more disaster recovery bills after Hurricane Laura, which hit Southwest Louisiana, and the 2016 flooding.
Sometimes a disaster is so profound that local governments have a hard time coming up with the tax revenue to cover their share of the recovery. If people lose their homes and are displaced, as happened after Katrina, cities and parishes won’t have much money to put toward cleanup, Cassidy said.
“When you destroy a community, you destroy their ability to raise tax money,” he said in an interview.
Jindal, who served as Louisiana’s governor from 2008-16 and was a congressman during Hurricane Katrina, said he thinks the federal government will always be an important partner in major disasters. But states and local governments should take on more responsibility for smaller events.
“There are many day-to-day disasters that many state and local governments can handle themselves,” Jindal said. “For the bigger disasters that can overwhelm, you still want to have some federal role.”
It’s also crucial that local and state officials know what to expect from the federal government so they can be prepared, said Jindal, who was governor when hurricanes Gustav and Ike hit Louisiana.
“I think it’s important to have clear rules ahead of time,” he said.

Landry: Don’t worry about FEMA
Trump may have denied disaster relief to other states, but Gov. Jeff Landry said Louisiana has nothing to worry about when it comes to FEMA because of his good relationship with the administration.
“I think it’s all just a bunch of media hype trying to scare people. We’re ready for hurricane season,” the governor told reporters this week.
Landry has a close relationship with Noem and said Trump’s homeland security leader has already responded to requests for assistance for matters in Lake Charles and Terrebonne Parish this year.
“What Kristi Noem has done lately, I mean, we just call her, and we say, ‘These are projects that need to be moved,’” Landry said.
Louisiana is one of only a few states that has a local representative on Trump’s FEMA review council, which is supposed to make recommendations on reforming the agency this fall.
One of the council’s 12 members, who include Noem and Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is Louisiana native Mark Cooper, Jindal’s former head of emergency management and former Gov. Edwards’ chief of staff.
“Obviously, Louisiana is playing a big role in this reimagining for FEMA,” Cooper said this week in an interview from Oklahoma where the review council was meeting. “We’re being heard. Louisiana is being heard as part of this process.”
Cooper said the council already met directly with Louisiana emergency response officials in the Landry administration. It held its second public meeting in New Orleans in July at his suggestion.
The council has made no decisions about whether FEMA’s reimbursement policies for state and local governments should change, Cooper said, but he suggested more might be asked of states.
“We need to do more to help states to be more self-reliant and resilient,” he said.

Middlebury College announced on Thursday it would be closing the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, the school’s satellite campus in California, after its enrolled students complete their degrees in June 2027.
The school’s president, Ian Baucom, said in a press release and accompanying video announcement that continuing operations at the campus in its current state was “no longer feasible.” The college’s Board of Trustees approved the closure of the satellite, which primarily serves post-graduate students, during a special meeting on Aug. 27.
“I recognize the gravity of this moment,” Baucom said in the press release. “I and my senior leadership team made this recommendation after careful deliberation, and the board did not come to this decision lightly.”
The college first purchased the institute and its campus in 2005 from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The school focuses on graduate degree and certificate programs in foreign languages and international policy. Baucom called it a “leading global center of international studies.”
The closure comes as Middlebury College faces severe financial difficulties. In April, facing a $14.1 million deficit, the school announced a number of cost saving measures, including reductions to staff and faculty retirement benefits, which sparked faculty walkouts and protests.
At the time, college leadership said that $8.7 million of the total deficit was due to low enrollment at the Monterey Institute. One faculty member called the institute an “albatross” for Middlebury College that was sinking finances and morale.

Baucom, in the press release, said the decision was “not a reflection on the quality of our programs or our outstanding Monterey colleagues, whose work is far reaching and significant.”
The institute experienced steep declines in enrollment following the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving programs at the campus with “unsustainable operating deficits,” Baucom said in his video announcement.
All currently enrolled students will be able to complete their degrees. The school will not consider repurposing, leasing, or selling the property in Monterey until students complete their programs in June 2027, Baucom said in the release.
“It bears repeating that this was absolutely a financial decision and not a reflection on the quality of our programs or our exceptional faculty and staff,” Baucom said. “It also should not be left unsaid that (the institute’s) work to educate students who go on to work in diplomacy, interpretation, arms negotiations, and other forms of service to humanity has mattered.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s cannabis regulators have yet to announce the date when they will start to accept applications for 24 new retail licenses, but they have now opened up the initial screening process for those seeking to obtain one of the state’s six social equity licenses.
The state’s Cannabis Control Commission on Friday launched its online certification portal for prospective business owners to certify that they are qualified for one of the specialty licenses meant for those who were adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, including residents in five municipalities identified as social equity zones.
“Today is more than the start of an application process — it is the continuation of a system that places safety, equity, and transparency at the center of Rhode Island’s cannabis market,” Commission Chairperson Kimberly Ahern said in a statement. “We are committed to ensuring that this industry not only grows responsibly but also delivers meaningful opportunities to the people and communities who were disproportionately impacted by past prohibition.”
The certification process administered by Massachusetts-based Creative Services, Inc. is open through Sept. 29, according to the commission’s announcement.
Prospective applicants will first have to fill an online form on the commission’s website, before receiving a link from Creative Services to the online certification portal — such forms are available through Sept. 24. 
From there, applicants must provide documentation proving their status.
Regulations approved by the commission earlier in the year require that applicants have at least 51% ownership and control by individuals directly impacted by past cannabis laws or economic disparities or a minimum of 10 full time employees that meet the same criteria.
Qualifying factors include convictions for nonviolent cannabis offenses or residency in disproportionately impacted areas — which can be determined by federal poverty level, unemployment rate, the number of students in a free school lunch program, and historic arrest rates by census tract. 
A preliminary analysis presented to the commission last October found that three of the state’s 39 municipalities met the criteria for a social equity zone set in Rhode Island’s 2022 law: Central Falls, Providence and Woonsocket. Some census tracts in Pawtucket and Newport also met the criteria.
Documentation that can be submitted to prove eligibility include articles of incorporation, proof of residency and payroll registers.
Under the 2022 act that legalized recreational cannabis, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to retailers, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives.
Licenses must be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone.
Regulations enacted in May call for a hybrid selection process in which applicants would first be screened based on qualifications before being placed in a lottery. 
All prospective retailers would pay an application fee of $7,500 and a yearly $30,000 licensing fee. But the application fee will be waived for the first year for approved social equity applicants.
To keep things fair, regulators plan to randomly select which applicants will get a license.
Applicants cannot change their corporate structure after receiving Social Equity Applicant Status Certification unless they obtain a variance from the Cannabis Control Commission.

The university announced online this week money from 32 donors totaling nearly $25,000 will go toward the new lab space alongside other funding sources, where students can learn on and utilize necessary software and equipment to simulate being in a real workplace environment.
“This lab will give our students access to the same tools used by professionals in the field,” said Brett Olsen, head of the UNI finance department, in the release. “It’s a game changer for how we prepare students for internships and careers.”

Housed in the Curris Business Building, the release stated the lab will house 12 double-monitor computer work stations equipped with different software tools used in their areas of study, including real estate market research tool CoStar, real estate transaction modeling and analyzation program Argus and stock and trading analysis platform Eikon.
A ticker tape display and “collaborative seating” will make the lab feel like a finance department where students could find themselves working in one day, according to the release.
Student organizations will be able to use the space, the release stated, as well as those completing research and industry work. UNI spokesperson Adam Amdor said in an email the lab will open for business this fall.
UNI student Kylie Patterson said in a video released by the UNI Alumni Association many entry-level jobs in the finance and real estate industries require at least some experience with the software that will be made more accessible through the new space. Being able to learn these programs while a student will give UNI graduates the “upper hand” in finding their career path, she said.
“Having a finance and real estate analytics lab will really help students be able to grow in their respective fields,” she said.

President Donald Trump emerged as the most common gloom at the top of Source New Mexico readers’ minds, according to a survey we completed Friday ahead of the 101st annual burning of  Zozobra in Santa Fe.
Over the past few weeks, Source asked readers to share their biggest political glooms, with responders offering their political and personal struggles. 
“Trump” garnered notice three times more than the other most-common glooms our readers hope to excise Friday evening.
As promised, we’ll print out the glooms our readers submitted and ensure they’re stuffed in the 50-foot-6-inch tall effigy before the display of collective catharsis.
After “Trump,” other top glooms referenced the recent culling of trees in Fort Marcy Park where the event is held, with respondents repeatedly mentioning “trees,” “park” or “Santa Fe.” The term “denuded” showed up twice. 
Other popular glooms were more interpersonal, with terms like “human,” “school,” “community,” “care” and “love” appearing in multiple entries. 
Even though federal political figures and topics dominated the list, the survey also offered a glimpse into individual struggles and hopes. Here are a few we thought were sad, sweet or both: 

“Lack of confidence for no reason”
“My daughter is not in my life, although we want more closeness, it never happens”
“Knees knees knees …. Hurt”
“My mom, my principal, and fears about loneliness”
“I miss my mother, who died in 2020”
“Crushing student loans”
“The death of my wonderful dog Jasmine”
“The cost of rent in Santa Fe ):”
“Renovating a house is so stressful and I just need something to go smoothly”
“I’m feeling undervalued and underappreciated at work and in some personal relationships.”
“Please burn away this sense of loss and grief”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state on Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
Idaho Department of Lands seeks to balance pending budget cuts with firefighting needs

On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
 Immigrants are ‘integral part’ of wildland firefighting

Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotes. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Please do your part, Idaho. Be smart and prevent wildfires in August.

Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

Andy Beshear)Democratic state officials who sued the Trump administration to block the cancellation of AmeriCorps funding have secured the money, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced Friday. 
The state officials filed a lawsuit earlier this year, saying the abrupt cancellation of funds to the community service and volunteerism program was illegal. AmeriCorps works in close partnership with states. 
An injunction issued in June stopped the federal government from terminating nearly $400 million worth of AmeriCorps programs, says a news release from Beshear’s office. “On Thursday, the Trump administration agreed to release all remaining AmeriCorps money to states rather than fight the multistate team’s lawsuit,” the release says.
AmeriCorps is under siege. What happens in the communities it serves?

More than $9 million previously appropriated by Congress will be restored to Kentucky’s AmeriCorps service commission, Serve Kentucky, the governor said. The commission works on issues like housing development, fighting hunger, disaster relief and more. 
“AmeriCorps and Serve Kentucky make our people, communities and country stronger by providing food, housing support, education, mental health services and more, and it was illegal and short-sighted for the President’s administration to try and dismantle this independent federal agency,” Beshear said in a statement. “Today is a good day for our commonwealth and country, as we once again see that the law – and what’s right for the American people – can rise above any challenge.”
AmeriCorps supported 5,289 members and volunteers in Kentucky in 783 service locations representing an investment of $33.7 million in 2024, according to the federal agency. Since 1994, more than 17,000 Kentucky residents have served approximately 26 million hours and earned education awards totaling more than $66 million through the program.
Beshear has joined other multi-state lawsuits challenging the Trump administration with Democratic attorneys general and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro throughout the year. Kentucky’s attorney general is Russell Coleman, a Republican. 
Earlier in August, Beshear joined Democratic state officials in an ongoing lawsuit seeking to unfreeze billions in federal funds allocated to building a nationwide network of chargers for electric vehicles.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GIaAsgPWQAIciPD-1024x577.jpeg,,,2025-08-29 13:57:26.046071

(Photo illustration by seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty Images)The state Attorney General’s Office is investigating a ransomware attack that interrupted email and phone service for the agency nearly two weeks ago.
Attorney General Dave Sunday said in a statement Friday his office is continuing to recover from the attack, which also took down the office’s website. He said it was caused by a person outside the agency encrypting files in an attempt to force the office to pay to recover the data. 
No payment was made, according to the statement.
“This situation has certainly tested OAG staff and prompted some modifications to our typical routines — however, we are committed to our duty and mission to protect and represent Pennsylvanians, and are confident that mission is being fulfilled,” Sunday said.
Citing an active investigation involving other agencies, the Attorney General’s Office said it was unable to comment further on the recovery process or the incident. It noted it would provide additional updates and would contact people individually if necessary.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The office is the commonwealth’s top law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing state laws, investigating and prosecuting crimes and consumer protection. It receives and investigates complaints from the public ranging from price gouging to financial fraud.
Since the attack, which the office first announced Aug. 18, email access has been restored to the majority of staff. The Attorney General’s Office main phone line and website are online.
The office employs about 1,200 people in 17 offices across the commonwealth. Sunday said they are performing their duties, “albeit parts of their work is being done via alternate channels and methods.”
“You can judge the character of an organization by how it reacts to adversity. I am very proud of our staff who continue to work and find ways to overcome these unexpected hurdles fulfill our duty to the commonwealth,” he said. 
In response to the interruption, some courts have issued orders providing time extensions in criminal and civil cases, the statement said. It notes that continuances are routinely requested by prosecutors and defendants as part of the normal course of business in the courts.
“However, we do not expect — based on what the investigation has revealed so far — that any criminal prosecutions will be negatively impacted solely due to the outside interruption,” the statement said.
“Attorneys have been going to court and agents have been performing investigative tasks over the past three weeks, including multiple public safety initiatives for which we expect to make public announcements in the near future,” the office said.

For more than a decade, the State of Montana has tried to bring itself […]","A homeless man sleeps outside The Billings Gazette in downtown Billings (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan). Social services leaders in Montana say a recent executive order from President Donald Trump would mark a complete reversal of the progress the state has made addressing the needs of people who are houseless and face addiction and mental health challenges.
For more than a decade, the State of Montana has tried to bring itself out of the era of institutions — where imposing buildings usually housed people who had few other options. Galen, Warm Springs and Boulder were all sites of state-run institutions, many of which had notorious stories of people being abused or forgotten, by being institutionalized, or as critics and historians called it “warehousing.”
However, in July, President Donald Trump embraced revamping the idea of large-scale institutionalization, this time targeting those with mental illness, addiction or those who are homeless. In fact, he signed an executive order that would mark a complete reversal of what state leaders have been attempting — to clear out and close statewide institutions and send those who struggle with mental health, addiction or chronic homelessness closer to the communities from which they came. While it’s unclear what effect the executive order will have on Montana — the order was one of many which have come from the White House since he took office — it could point to shift in funding, while the President has already proven he’s willing to leverage federal power to remove homeless people, as he has recently in Washington, D.C.
“The federal government and the states have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats,” Trump wrote in his executive order on July 24. “Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order.”
In Montana during the past two decades, taxpayers and leaders have spent millions on transforming a system of institutional-based care into one closer to communities and less formalized. The state’s largest psychiatric hospital in Warm Springs hasn’t been funded by the federal government of Medicaid in years after a series of abuses surfaced in 2022. Since its earliest days, the Gianforte administration has pledged to restructure, revamp and restore the care there, and officials with the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, which has oversight of the facility, says it may reapply for federal certification in 2026, after years of mostly state taxpayer support.
Furthermore, the Gianforte administration has also stressed that services need to be located throughout and across the state instead of in one location in order to help reintegrate residents struggling with mental health and addiction. Moreover, Gianforte created a special fund, the HEART Fund, which  gives grants to communities throughout Montana to provide local or regional services.
“It’s disappointing to see because Montana has a clarity of vision for community-based services,” said David Carlson, the Executive Director of Disability Rights Montana. “People and leaders have been actually doing it.”
Despite Trump and most of Montana’s leaders sharing the same political party, they don’t necessarily share the same view of how to solve the increasing number of homeless people who also live with addiction or mental illness. And Trump’s move back to institutionalization concerns leaders.
The Daily Montanan reached out to the governor’s office about the executive orders and how they dovetail with the Gianforte administration’s plans, but it received no comment.
“Montana has been thinking hard about theses things, and we’ve inverted it. We’re in the de-institutionalization process. The Legislature gets it,” Carlson said. “You need to send someone from say, Sidney, all the way to Warm Springs.  You shouldn’t have to send them that far from their community to get help.
“And Montana gets that.”
He said that shifting back to a long-term institutional model is “just not supportable as a policy.” He said that the state has seen too many horrible stories of abuse and neglect, and he can’t think of politicians on either side of the political spectrum who support the idea.
“The president can articulate it as an idea,” Carlson said. “But he is not a legislature of one.”
As an attorney and a leader, he said the president’s idea is not supported by the law. He said laws have evolved to add more protections for vulnerable residents, including due-process and health leaders have a much better understanding about mental illness and addiction.
Carlson said Trump’s executive order is a play for “warehousing” — or just herding those with chronic mental or addiction problems into a place that is out of the public’s eye. He said what’s even more concerning is that it could be providing an economic incentive for warehousing where buildings, institutions, jobs and programs are created by private industry to address the president’s executive order, creating a new cottage industry of institutions.
“I don’t think you get the most humane settings with institutional care,” Carlson said. “That model is living with 300 other people and being told what to do.”
Leaders are also concerned that as dangerous as the idea of returning to institutionalization can be, Trump’s order also creates an unwarranted fear of those who are unhoused.
“People who are unhoused are far more vulnerable than dangerous,” Carlson said. “But (the order) gives the impression that downtown Billings or Helena are scary places.”
He said that the growing concern about those who are unhoused or who are mentally ill isn’t necessarily a bad thing.
“If you’re disturbed because you’re seeing unhoused in the community, it’s because your compassionate and asking: Why does it exist in such a rich society?” Carlson said.
Brayton Erickson, the executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission, said that Trump’s suggestion wasn’t clear, and it worries him. His group works nonstop with an unhoused population, many of whom struggle with addiction or mental illness.
“If that means just rounding them and institutionalizing them, that’s not healthy at all,” Erickson said. “If we change some of the way to look at it differently than we did in the past, and we use it as a means to offer more services, then by all means.”
Erickson said he worries about the executive order failing if it’s attempted.
“You can’t outlaw tragedy,” he said.
He said that the federal government down to local leaders have to understand more about the causes of homelessness, addiction and mental illness. Furthermore, Erickson said that changing people’s lives is a matter of breaking a “vicious cycle” of events — from providing housing to more mental health.
“Housing, mental health and addiction is as complex as the individual,” Erickson said. He said while basic shelters may help alleviate pressure, there are other factors to ending homelessness. For example, is there mental health care to help stabilize individuals?
Erickson said that often the largest mental health centers in any city is the local jail.
He said with just a handful of beds for psychiatric needs, the state and federal government need to consider lifting the current cap on the beds so that facilities can support more patients and more resources for those struggling.
“A lot of mental illness starts with trauma. A lot of addiction starts with trauma. A lot of homelessness starts with trauma,” Erickson said.
Carlson said that much of the animosity against those who struggle with addiction, mental health or housing stability comes from underlying beliefs that people have about those populations, for example, that those who are unhoused are loafing or do not work hard.
“The national narrative is that homeless people are the problem — not the cost of housing and not the cost healthcare, not the access to mental health,” Carlson said. “There are so many different variables that are tied to homelessness.”
He said the solution isn’t warehousing or institutionalization, instead Carlson said that communities that have made positive strides in addressing homelessness have moved to a housing-first model, which stresses providing housing without so many administrative hoops or long prescriptive lists of rules.
“If the problem is the unhoused community, then the solution is to give them housing,” Carlson said. “But people get tied up in moral judgment: ‘Oh, they need to work.’”
He said that fiscally conservative Montana should welcome a housing-first model because it’s cheaper and less burdensome than building an entire institutionalized setting with staff and buildings.
“The infrastructure is very expensive. The operation is very expensive — as opposed to a community-based solution,” Carlson said, pointing out that when a person is institutionalized by the government whether that’s a facility or jail, the government then has the economic burden of providing housing, food and healthcare — a more costly endeavor.
He sees what is happening as example of history repeating itself, this time from the Gilded Age.
“The richest have opulent wealth while the rest have nothing,” he said. “It’s unnerving, and I think it has shocked a lot of people. There are not a lot of people that think this way. No one has suggested these as solutions for decades.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG-7487-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-29 13:57:26.046071

(Jessica Tufts for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Longtime Kansas journalist and Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter has been selected for a statewide hall of fame honoring journalists. Reflector opinion columnist, nonprofit executive and author Mark McCormick was also named to the hall.
The Kansas Press Association announced the inductees Friday. Carpenter and McCormick were two of seven additions this year to the Newspaper Hall of Fame, in addition to four inductees for the Kansas Photojournalism Hall of Fame.
Carpenter, 64, has been the senior reporter for Kansas Reflector since its inception in 2020. Previously, he spent 15 years each at the Topeka Capital-Journal and the Lawrence Journal-World. He began his roughly 40-year career with United Press International in Topeka. He earned an agricultural journalism degree from Kansas State University.
“I’m excited to join a compelling group of hall of famers,” Carpenter said. “I’ve looked up to many of them during nearly 40 years of Kansas journalism that felt equal parts grinding work and delightful continuing education for my mind.”
Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith called Carpenter a “generational icon” who has been “revered and feared as an investigative and political reporter.”
The two have worked together for more than 20 years, beginning in the Topeka Capital-Journal newsroom. Smith said he looked to Carpenter for mentorship.

“There was no story too big — an attorney general’s sex scandal, a governor’s ‘prairie hellion’ of a brother — or beneath him,” Smith said. “College professors showed their students the video of Tim’s shakedown of a political candidate who had mocked patients’ X-rays. Some of the state’s most powerful people wouldn’t speak to the editorial board without knowing whether Tim would be there.”
Carpenter has won the Kansas Press Association’s Victor Murdock Award six times. The William Allen White Foundation honored him four times with its Burton Marvin News Enterprise Award. The Kansas City Press Club has twice presented him with its Journalist of the Year Award and, more recently, with its Lifetime Achievement Award.
Tim worked selflessly to advance the skills and careers of numerous reporters. I abandoned my editing post at the newspaper for the opportunity to report alongside Tim from the Statehouse, where he taught me political reporting and helped me understand the bewildering legislative process. And five years ago, when States Newsroom gave me the opportunity to launch a news organization from scratch,
Smith said upon launching Kansas Reflector five years ago, Carpenter was the first person he called to join the team.
“He agreed while other veteran journalists thought it was a crazy idea,” Smith said.
“Here, he has continued to write compelling news stories of public interest — a university president’s academic integrity, the police raid on a small-town newspaper — and helped build Kansas Reflector into a model for a new generation of journalists to do the same.”
 
Pride and sheepishness
McCormick, formerly of the Wichita Eagle, is the second Black man to be inducted into the KPA’s hall of fame.
“The nomination itself feels like an award,” he said, “and winning it is something next level.”
McCormick has spent more than two decades in journalism. He has been a contributing columnist to Kansas Reflector since 2021, writing about humanity, race and politics.
“I am a person who finds it difficult to see other people suffering,” he said. I am most proud of those moments when someone was voiceless and had no hope, and I was able to help them.”
 Mark McCormick, a Kansas Reflector contributor and longtime journalist, credited his family and mentor in his reaction to being installed in the Kansas Press Association’s Newspaper Hall of Fame (Submitted)
McCormick, 57, said he accepts the honor with “a great deal of pride,” but also “a little bit of sheepishness.” He can’t help but recall those who came before him — his mother, his father, his sister, who is the reason he pursued and graduated with a degree in journalism at the University of Kansas.
“My beloved journalism professor doesn’t have this,” he said.
“One of the most consequential people in my life, Samuel Adams, was a Black man who was teaching journalism at the University of Kansas at a time when I don’t think any other Black men were teaching journalism anywhere at a PWI — a predominantly white institution,” McCormick said.
Adams, who died in 2019, was a professor at the university from 1973 to 1999. He was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize. McCormick characterized him as more like a father than a professor. He called him “Daddy Sam.”
Kansas Reflector opinion editor Clay Wirestone praised McCormick’s penetrating perspective.
“Mark’s deep insight, experience and care for his fellow Kansans shines through every column,” he said. “I’m honored to have him as a contributor to the Reflector’s opinion section.”
McCormick has won more than 20 awards, including five Gold Awards from the Kansas City Press Club. He is the co-author of a book detailing the origins and evolutions of Wichita’s African American community, and he has published a collection of his columns that has been used as required reading at Wichita State University. He is executive director of the Kansas Black Leadership Council, chairman of the Kansas African American Affairs Commission and former executive director of the Kansas African American Museum.
He highlighted two stories as hallmarks of his career. One covered the life and death of a man who lived in a halfway house, who died because of delayed medical care. Another revealed poor driving records of public school bus drivers after months of evasion from the private bus company.
McCormick often refers to himself as a “recovering journalist.”
“I’ve always meant that I’m an addict for journalism, and you never get that out of your system,” he said. “You’re always in recovery.”

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)A key Republican bill to define sex as only male or female hasn’t become law months after the 2025 session ended — and that’s on purpose, House leadership said this week.
In a news release, Republican leaders in the House said Senate Bill 437 passed both chambers, but House leadership is holding onto the bill “to prevent it from being immediately tied up with ongoing litigation” over a similar measure passed in 2023.
The similar measure from 2023 is Senate Bill 458, also defining sex.
“Montanans sent us here to make law, not to let activist judges tear it down the moment the ink dries,” said Speaker of the House Brandon Ler in a statement.
Upper Seven, a law firm that fought the similar bill and aims to challenge SB 437, said it was wasteful to keep passing legislation that’s already been thrown out.
“The majority is so hell-bent on discriminating against certain Montanans that they’re willing to waste time and taxpayer money passing the same unconstitutional laws over and over again,” said Upper Seven lawyer Molly Danahy in a statement.
Days before the new bill was introduced this session, a district court judge found SB 458 to be unconstitutional based on its content.
In her order, Missoula County District Court Judge Leslie Halligan said the bill erased some Montana residents from existence, and she warned similar bills would meet similar fates.
“By declaring as a matter of law that a human being can only be ‘exactly’ one of two sexes, SB 458 explicitly excludes (two plaintiffs) from the definition of human beings, causing immediate harm traceable to SB 458,” the decision said.
That ruling on a case filed by Upper Seven followed a previous court challenge that found the bill had violated a constitutional provision based on its title.
Lawmakers amended SB 437, and already had changed its title, but the intent of the bill remains the same.
Soon after the bill was passed, Upper Seven informed the state it would add claims against SB 437 to the existing case once the new bill was signed into law.
With the announcement from House leadership this week, however, the bill has yet to become law.
“We refuse to hand the judiciary an easy path to lump these cases together and stall the will of the people. That’s why we are being deliberate with the timing on SB 437,” said Ler, from Savage.
Ler said the move is aimed at guarding the legislation against “a judiciary that has become more interested in playing politics than upholding law.”
“By holding SB 437, we’re making sure this legislation has the strongest chance to stand,” Ler said. “We will not sit back while partisan judges try to erase what the people’s representatives have enacted.”
Upper Seven, though, said the Montana Constitution “prohibits denying basic rights based on clothes, pronouns, or chromosomes,” and Ler is playing politics.
“Knowing that Montanans are ready and willing to stand up and fight for their rights and the equal application of Montana law to all Montanans, the Speaker would rather engage in political grandstanding and anti-democratic delay tactics than allow them their day in court,” said Danahy, with Upper Seven.
Attorneys’ fees in the case in district court are still playing out, and the judge is considering whether to hold it for SB 437.
In the separate case the ACLU of Montana filed over the bill title, the judge awarded nearly $100,000 to the plaintiffs.
In an email, a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office didn’t weigh in on whether Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte agrees with the strategy by House leadership to hold the bill.
“The governor looks forward to signing the bill when it makes it to his desk,” said spokesperson Kaitlin Price.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-635-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-29 13:57:26.046071

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley announced Friday she will not run for re-election next year. 
Bradley, the most right-wing of the Court’s three conservative justices, has been outspoken in her dislike of the Court’s current liberal majority, regularly complaining in written decisions and the press about the Court’s actions. Bradley is an active member of the right-wing Federalist Society and has been rumored to be interested in a federal judicial seat. 
“For years I have warned that under the control of judicial activists, the court will make itself more powerful than the Legislature, more powerful than the governor,” Bradley said in a statement. “That warning went unheeded, and Wisconsin has seen only the beginning of what is an alarming shift from thoughtful, principled judicial service toward bitter partisanship, personal attacks, and political gamesmanship that have no place in court. The conservative movement needs to take stock of its failures, identify the problem, and fix it.”
Bradley was appointed to the Court by Gov. Scott Walker in 2015 and elected to a 10-year term in 2016. She was part of the conservative majority that upheld the actions by Republican legislators to take power away from the governor and attorney general during the lame duck period after Democrats won those seats in the 2018 election. 
She also authored the Court’s 2021 decision creating the “least change” standard for drawing the state’s new legislative maps. That decision was widely seen as an effort by the Court’s conservatives to ensure that whatever maps were instituted largely kept the Republican’s 2011 partisan gerrymander intact. 
Bradley’s decision not to run comes just 221 days before the April 7 spring election, putting the state’s conservatives, who have lost the two most recent Supreme Court elections by double digits, at a disadvantage. 
State Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor announced her run for the Court in May. Taylor’s July campaign finance report shows she’s already raised more than $580,000.

Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, and Democratic governors across the country issued a statement Thursday criticizing Trump’s policy decisions, saying Americans deserve to feel safe.
“But instead of actually addressing crime, President Trump cut federal funding for law enforcement that states rely on and continues to politicize our military by trying to undermine the executive authority of Governors as Commanders in Chief of their state’s National Guard,” the 19 governors wrote in a joint statement.
The president deployed Washington D.C.’s National Guard earlier this month, which is within his authority, and he has expressed interest in deploying state National Guards to Chicago, New York City, Baltimore and Oakland. Earlier this year, he mobilized California’s National Guard to confront demonstrators in Los Angeles who were protesting the administration’s immigration raids.
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has been vocal in his opposition to Trump’s threats.
“Unlike Donald Trump, we keep our promises,” Pritzker wrote in a Wednesday social media post. “We will not stand idly by if he decides to send the National Guard to intimidate Chicagoans. Action will be met with a response.”
All but four Democratic governors signed on to the statement. Those who did called Trump’s actions “chaotic federal interference.”
“Whether it’s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow,” the governors said, “the President’s threats and efforts to deploy a state’s National Guard without the request and consent of that state’s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members.”

According to DNR, the Zinpro facility released an estimated 700 gallons of a “copper-containing liquid” on Thursday morning due to a broken pipe. 
The liquid flowed into a storm drain on-site and eventually flowed to the drainage ditch, just west of the facility, which was dammed about a mile downstream to contain the spill.

According to Jeremey Klatt, an environmental specialist with DNR, none of the copper substance reached the East Branch Iowa River, where the drainage ditch flows. 
Dead fish have been observed, but Klatt said an official fish kill count has not been completed, as of Friday morning. 
Klatt said the copper substance is used as an algaecide, so algae in the stream will be impacted by the release. 
Klatt said a clean up crew was on site Friday morning and continuing to remove water from the ditch, though it’s uncertain how long the clean up will take. 
DNR has advised residents to avoid the water, which has a bluish hue.

BAYOU LA BATRE — It was already too late.
As Hurricane Katrina blew ashore along the Gulf Coast with winds over 125 miles an hour, Truong Van Dai, an oyster shucker, drove off in his station wagon to help a friend in dire need.
Before he realized what was happening, floodwaters from the hurricane’s storm surge were slapping against the floor of the car. He couldn’t go any further. Soon, he’d realized he couldn’t even turn back. The car would be his family’s first loss to what would become one of the deadliest storms in U.S. history.

Truong got out of the station wagon and started doing the only thing he could—wading through the floodwaters back toward his home.
When he arrived, his family had finished packing their 1988 brown Chevy van. His wife, Ana Chau, and his children, David, Jim and Michelle—ages 11, 9, and 2—were ready to evacuate. Truong, now soaking wet from the waist down, knew the other roads out of town might also be flooded. It was a risk he was willing to take.
Joining half a dozen other Vietnamese families, the Dais attempted to escape Bayou La Batre. None would make it to safety.
The caravan got as far as the intersection of Hemley Road and South Wintzell Avenue, just south of the Bayou La Batre drawbridge that led further inland. There, in the blink of an eye, the floodwaters blocked their way, in front and behind. The families tried a detour, hoping they could take another route back home. No such luck.
“The stormwaters were just too great,” Ana recalled last week, 20 years after the storm, as translated by her son David, now a teacher in Mobile. “There was nowhere we could go.”
The Dais and the other families did the only thing they could. They found an empty parking lot nearby, next to a bank and an old grocery store, and prepared for the worst.
It wasn’t the first time the Dais had faced adversity. Both Ana and Truong had emigrated from Vietnam to the United States in search of a better life. Truong, who left Vietnam in 1980, remembered hiding in the forest as a child to avoid being conscripted into the war. Ana left later, around 1990, and the two met in California before moving to Bayou La Batre, where a small Vietnamese community was growing, centered around a seafood economy that was similar to what they’d experienced in Vietnam.
So the Dais knew resilience and perseverance. But none of that would part the floodwaters blocking their way.
“We couldn’t make it home,” Ana said. “So it was in our best interest to find a spot we could all ride out the storm together—in our cars—in the event that one family or another needed serious help.”

Hurricane Katrina didn’t just batter the Gulf Coast. It exposed how poverty, and government neglect, shape the contours of survival. For families like the Dais, and for mine, the storm never ended.
Today, stronger storms and rising seas show Katrina wasn’t the end.
It was just the beginning.

Grace and grit

My family, several miles away from the Dais, never even attempted an escape. I didn’t know David Dai then, but the two of us would become close friends as freshmen in high school.
I recently asked my mother, Cindy, why we didn’t try to evacuate.
“What do you mean, ‘Why didn’t we evacuate?’” she said, laughing. “We didn’t have no damn money.”
It was true. Even putting aside the long lines and high prices for gas ahead of the storm, my mother—Ma, as I’ve always called her—single and living on Social Security benefits from my father’s death from cancer a decade before, had no money for a hotel or travel expenses. We’d moved to south Mobile County from North Carolina a few years prior, so there was no family on higher ground in Alabama whose home could provide a safe escape.
 (Paul Horn/Inside Climate News)
Our situation wasn’t unique. According to government data, nearly a quarter of Mobile County residents experienced poverty pre-Katrina, a rate well over double the national average. It was likely higher in the county’s coastal communities and among children.
Like the Dais, we were stuck. Poverty had put us in our place, and Katrina’s winds and rain would keep us there.
As the storm barreled toward the coast, Ma spoke to our neighbors in Palmer’s Trailer Park. Some had the means to leave, or family nearby who lived in brick homes, or even friends with trailers on higher ground. Many others—the majority—had nothing but grit and the grace of God.
Before the storm made its way ashore, Ma realized we might not survive in our trailer, though it was one of the newer mobile homes in the park. Its built-on deck looked nice, but as the wind began to stir up, it began pulling against the trailer’s frame, groaning as it lurched to and fro.
“It started creaking and making all kinds of noises,” Ma recalled. “I didn’t know what it was doing—if it would cause the trailer to flip over—so I knew we should probably just go.”
She, my brother and I gathered a few belongings and made our way to where the Marenos lived in an older trailer a stone’s throw away. Their place made me nervous, but Ma had made up her mind.
“I decided that if we die, we’d die together,” Ma told me last week, now two decades since she made that call. “We’d be over there with a crowd.”

On the Beast’s bad side

What came next I’ll never forget. No one who lived through it ever will.
When it comes to hurricanes, meteorologists often repeat a rhyme about where the worst damage is likely to occur: “The east is the beast. The west is the best.” The eastern side of the storm, to the right of the storm’s eye, faces the highest sustained winds and the worst of the storm surge.
Katrina made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, as a major hurricane near the border of Mississippi and Louisiana. The Dai family and my family were riding out the storm about 75 miles to the east of the eye—the side of the beast.
A beast it was.
David, then 11 years old like me, remembered the floodwaters’ slow rise around the caravan of vehicles, parked in loose formation in the Bayou La Batre parking lot. He and his mother remembered debris flying through the air.
“The wind was incredibly strong and the shingles and roofing of neighboring homes and businesses were being ripped off and were being slung into some of the cars,” Ana remembered. “Everyone was concerned that something was going to hit one of the cars and break one of the windows open.”

All of the vehicles, especially the Dais’ large van, were rocking back and forth in the wind. Everyone was afraid they’d soon tip over.
“So they decided to move the vehicles closer together so that the wind wouldn’t catch the sides of the vehicles too much,” David said. “That cut down on the rocking.”
David, who’s interpreted for his parents as long as he can remember, said it was difficult to find English words for his mother’s descriptions of the storm. “She described it as a kind of tornado,” he said, lost in translation.
But he remembers his primary emotion: fear.
“I was definitely scared, definitely worried and anxious about the whole situation,” he said. “As a kid, you just don’t know what was going to happen.”
No one did.
A few miles away from that Bayou La Batre parking lot, my family and the Marenos were riding out the storm.
I, too, remember the rocking—the groans of a mobile home I hoped beyond hope was actually strapped appropriately to the ground.
“You couldn’t help but be scared,” Ma said. “Especially because you can see all of the stuff flying.”
The Mobile International Speedway, a small drag strip and race track, was located just across Highway 90 from the trailer park. As we watched from inside the trailer, much of the speedway blew by us. Everything that wasn’t attached to a foundation—sheds full of tools and car parts, the roofs of gazebos and pavilions—were like leaves in the wind, crashing between our trailers and occasionally finding a fit target.
A metal shed, crumpled like aluminum foil by Katrina’s wind, slammed into the Marenos’ truck. Scott Mareno, a ship welder, wasn’t having it. He and his older boys opened the front door of the trailer and formed a line, holding hands to stop themselves from being blown away. Eventually, they reached the vehicle and were able to push the shed off Scott’s truck.
“Anything could have flew by and hit anybody and killed them right then,” Ma said.
I asked whether she still thinks we had been safer with the Marenos than we would’ve been at home.
“I don’t necessarily think we were actually any safer,” she said. “Nobody was safe.”
She took a brief pause.
“But I’d rather be with people,” she said. “I didn’t want to be by myself.  If something happened to me, and it was just y’all, at least somebody else would be there.”

Sardines

I remember walking around the trailer park with my younger brother Michael, then age 9, after the storm. Looking at the state of things, I was shocked we’d survived.
For me, the aftermath of a hurricane has always felt like the beginning of a fresh fallen snow in the Deep South. There’s an eerie calmness, paired with things scattered across the landscape that shouldn’t really be there. But these weren’t snowflakes.
There were trailers with holes in their roofs. There were others knocked off their foundations, tipped to the side as if they’d been flicked over by a giant. One old trailer a few doors down from us had its entire front ripped open, its yellow aluminum and pink insulation curled up at one end. The trailer looked like a sardine can that had just been opened. To my knowledge, its residents survived.

The roof of the deck attached to our trailer that Ma had been concerned about was gone, as were the wooden railings that had supported it. We looked around the neighborhood to see if we could find it, without success.
But in the end, we’d all made it. We were lucky. Hurricane Katrina would ultimately be responsible for the loss of well over 1,000 lives.
The Dai home suffered damage as well, but it hadn’t blown away or been totally flooded. Many of their neighbors weren’t as fortunate. Across Bayou La Batre, the impacts of Hurricane Katrina and the 14 feet of storm surge that accompanied it were devastating. Research suggests that the storm’s flooding was between 15 and 60 percent higher than it would have been circa 1900, before the impacts of climate change—elevated sea levels and reduced wetlands—took hold.
In some places, whole streets were underwater. Nearby residents launched boats from the grocery store parking lot to retrieve neighbors who’d been forced to ride out the tail end of the storm in their attics or on their roofs. As many as 80 percent of homes in the bayou were deemed uninhabitable, according to government reports. Shrimp boats that had been docked neatly in the bayou’s water now lay sunken in its depths or—worse—lined its streets.
“My brother and I would ride our bikes around the neighborhood just to see what it was like,” David said. “I felt helpless. I’ve always hated that feeling.”
The helplessness wouldn’t soon subside.
Initially, much of south Mobile County didn’t have running water. But even when water was restored, in some places within a few days of the storm’s end, boil water advisories were standard fare. The power was out for weeks in the dog days of Alabama summer. High temperatures remained in the 90s in the storm’s wake, and humidity soaked the air.
I remember the heat the most. It was unrelenting, and there was nowhere to escape. Once the water was turned back on, there was no hot water, but it had become somewhat of a joke—it’s not like you’d need it. Ma, who was going through the early stages of menopause, couldn’t turn on her “hot flash fan”—an oscillating, remote controlled fan she’d bought months earlier to squelch what was then just an internal heat. So she’d find comfort in the cool water of the garden tub in our trailer’s master bath—one of the few amenities of a newer trailer.
Ma eventually loaned her hot flash fan to the Marenos, who were one of the only families in the trailer park to own a generator. They’d run the generator sparingly, given the limited access to expensive gas, but it would allow folks to charge their phones and, at least for an hour or two, provide Scott Mareno with a breeze—from Ma’s fan. I selfishly resented it.
All schools were closed for weeks, along with grocery stores, restaurants and most businesses. Residents hoped for a quick government response, but it was slow to come. It seemed that Alabama—and particularly the small fishing communities lining the coast—weren’t a priority.
In the beginning, help largely came from neighbors. Those who’d stocked up before the storm shared with those who hadn’t or couldn’t, providing lifelines in the government’s absence.
In the days immediately following the storm, some of us ate like kings. Meat and other foods that had been stocked in residents’ deep freezes would soon go bad, so community cookouts became the norm. Some neighbors, particularly the kids, would go from cookout to cookout, gorging themselves before the food ran out. It wouldn’t take long.

Once the government response did begin, it was minimal and left residents scrambling to make sure they could make ends meet.
“We waited in line for hours in the Marenos’ truck to get a single box of MREs,” Ma said, referring to Meal, Ready-to-Eat military rations. “The National Guard wouldn’t let you get out of the vehicles, and we were burning up.”
When they finally got to the front of the line, they received only a single MRE box. One per vehicle, no matter how many people were inside. We split up the box and made do.

Of MREs and M&Ms

In the months that followed, more MREs would be distributed among residents, sometimes to those waiting in line, sometimes handed out through the windows of FEMA trucks to neighbors lining the streets in wait. David and I spent time last week laughing about our memories of those calorie-dense MREs, rations meant for soldiers in combat. He preferred pasta, he told me, and could remember fighting with his younger brother to get one. For me and my brother, it was the sweets we’d fight for, opening all of the MREs when we got them to fish out the molasses cookies or the small bags of M&Ms.
They were small victories—finding the M&Ms in the MREs—but they meant so much at the time.
“We celebrated the little moments like that, but at the same time, reflecting on it now, 20 years later, it’s crazy that it’s something we had to do,” David said. “We survived off MREs as 11-year-olds.”
Even close to a year later, when the immediate impacts of the storm had begun to fade, the poverty stuck around. When the end of each month came around and Social Security survivor benefits had run dry, there were still MREs. We may not have always had a home-cooked meal at the end of every day, but we could hope for M&Ms and a molasses cookie.
For families experiencing poverty along the Gulf, disasters like the aftermath of Katrina expose how little daylight there is between survival and catastrophe—a gap that climate change is widening.
Twenty years later, it would be wrong to say that south Mobile County has recovered from Hurricane Katrina. It’s certain that Bayou La Batre has not. The self-proclaimed “seafood capital of Alabama”—with 80 percent of its economy tied to the water—was already vulnerable to overfishing and global competition.

Katrina’s destruction, worsened by rising seas, shrinking wetlands and warming waters, accelerated its decline. Since Katrina’s landfall, the bayou’s once-bustling small business community has contracted. Shopping centers once filled with Asian restaurants and legacy grocery stores now sit empty. Its population, nearly 3,000 before Katrina hit, is still declining, slowly approaching just 2,000. The environmental and resulting economic effects have left the community reeling, compounded by additional devastation like the 2010 BP oil spill and the ongoing dredging of Mobile Bay, which has continued to reduce oyster harvests critical to the bayou’s survival.
Asked what she wants the world to know about the legacy of Hurricane Katrina, Ana, who, like her late husband, shucked oysters for a living for decades, said that nobody has recovered in the 20 years since Katrina struck.
“There was never a true recovery for those who worked in the seafood industry that were part of the Vietnamese community,” she said. “Even 20 years on, it’s still not what it was. We as a people, as a community, are still trying to recover.”
It’s a challenge, Ana said, but she still has some fight left in her.

A shell of itself

David, who now works as a math teacher in downtown Mobile, worries about whether the community is now better positioned to endure another major hurricane. In 2005, as an 11-year-old, he had to translate weather forecasts and evacuation information for his parents because none of it was in Vietnamese.
“Looking back, it was pretty crazy to be put in situations like that,” he said. “The information I’m sharing is going to be life or death.”
Two decades later, federal, state and local governments have made halting progress in improving access to weather information in languages like Vietnamese.
In April, the Trump administration announced that the National Weather Service would be pausing even Spanish-language translations of weather information because of a lapsed contract. The decision was later reversed, but language access remains precarious, particularly in a time when the nation’s chief executive has declared English “the official language of the United States.”
For David, it all spells potential disaster.
“Every major entity that is charged with providing information that could cost people their lives should have translations in languages that locals actually speak,” he said. “Otherwise, we’re not prepared. There’s no way we can be.”
Twenty years after the storm, families along the Gulf—and those living along coastlines across the world—face a future where intense storms like Katrina are less often the exception and more often the rule.
David says he’s reminded of south Mobile County’s slow recovery every time he visits his mother, who still lives in that same home in Bayou La Batre.
“I drive down to visit my mom, and every time I drive through, I just think to myself, this is such a sad and depressing little city. It was vibrant before Katrina. There was a lot of camaraderie. Now, it’s a shell of itself.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Shrimp-boats-for-Aug-29-2025-story-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-29 13:57:26.046071

Read this story in English.
En 2021, Connecticut se convirtió en el centro de atención nacional con una nueva y ambiciosa política: otorgar a los bebés beneficiarios de Medicaid $3,200 en una cuenta libre de impuestos financiada con fondos públicos. La tesorería estatal mantendrá el dinero en un fideicomiso hasta que el niño cumpla 18 años.
Los funcionarios estatales argumentaron que este dinero podría ayudar a los niños de hogares de bajos ingresos a consolidarse económicamente al llegar a la mayoría de edad, brindándoles dinero que puede ayudarles con el pago inicial de una vivienda, financiar un negocio o cubrir los gastos universitarios. Y debido a las disparidades raciales en la pobreza en el estado, el dinero también podría ayudar a reducir la brecha racial de riqueza en Connecticut.
Tras una disputa política sobre la financiación que retrasó su lanzamiento, el programa de Connecticut — la primera versión estatal de una propuesta de larga data respaldada por economistas, conocida como “bonos para bebés” — entró en vigencia en julio de 2023. El estado estima que nacerán aproximadamente 16,000 bebés elegibles cada año.
Desde entonces, los bonos para bebés han cobrado cada vez más importancia en todo el país. Casi una docena de programas piloto están activos en varios estados. Y tras años sin lograr la aprobación de una propuesta federal de bonos para bebés, defendida durante mucho tiempo por el Senador Estadounidense, Cory Booker, y la Representante Estadounidense, Ayanna Pressley, el Congreso aprobó el mes pasado una versión conservadora del concepto, conocido como “Cuentas Trump”.
Este cambio ha situado a Connecticut a la vanguardia de un movimiento creciente que busca abordar la riqueza generacional, la pobreza infantil y la desigualdad racial.
A continuación, le presentamos lo que debe saber sobre la historia del programa de bonos para bebés de Connecticut, quiénes son elegibles y cómo funciona el programa.
¿Por qué Connecticut creó los bonos para bebés?
El extesorero de Connecticut, Shawn Wooden, ha declarado que el objetivo del programa de bonos para bebés de Connecticut es ayudar a cerrar la gran brecha racial de riqueza del estado.
Ese enfoque, según los defensores de los bonos para bebés, garantiza que los niños más desfavorecidos del estado puedan salir adelante. Un informe de 2024 del grupo de defensa Connecticut Voices for Children reveló que el estado enfrenta persistentes brechas raciales de riqueza e ingresos, con ingresos promedio de $0.63 y $0.61 para los hogares negros e hispanos, respectivamente, por cada dólar que gana un hogar blanco promedio.
El informe agrega que estas brechas probablemente estén contribuyendo al reciente aumento de la pobreza infantil en Connecticut, que según algunas estimaciones ha regresado a niveles prepandémicos.
“Si no abordamos la desigualdad de la riqueza, perjudicamos nuestra economía. Es así de simple”, declaró Wooden en 2021.
Al invertir en los niños más pobres del estado, los bonos para bebés buscan ayudar a equilibrar las condiciones de juego al brindarles a los recién nacidos con cobertura de HUSKY, el programa de Medicaid de Connecticut, una inversión en efectivo que podrán usar una vez que cumplan 18 años. El estado también espera que la inversión, a la que solo pueden acceder los residentes de Connecticut, anime a las familias y a los jóvenes beneficiarios a quedarse en el estado.
El programa de bonos para bebés de Connecticut comenzó oficialmente en 2023, tras la creación por parte del estado del “Connecticut Baby Bonds Trust”. Este fideicomiso se ha financiado con aproximadamente 400 millones de dólares de un fondo de reserva estatal, lo que le permite cubrir 12 años de inversiones.
¿Quiénes pueden optar a los bonos para bebés?
En Connecticut, no todos los bebés nacidos en el estado son elegibles para los bonos para bebés. El programa se centra en los niños nacidos en hogares con cobertura HUSKY, algunos de los hogares con ingresos más bajos del estado. En 2025, los niños de una familia de cuatro que ganen menos de 64,622 dólares serán elegibles para HUSKY. El límite de elegibilidad aumenta a 84,555 dólares para una familia de cuatro con una persona embarazada en el hogar.
Con el programa de Connecticut, las familias no necesitan solicitar bonos para bebés. Si un hogar está inscrito en HUSKY al momento del nacimiento del niño, este queda automáticamente inscrito en el programa estatal de bonos para bebés y recibe el depósito inicial de $3,200.
Los beneficiarios elegibles también deben haber nacido a partir del 1 de julio de 2023 para recibir dinero. Un niño que solo cumpla uno de los criterios anteriores no será elegible para el programa estatal de bonos para bebés.
Basta con que el niño cumpla los requisitos para abrir una cuenta. Si un niño deja HUSKY al crecer, seguirá recibiendo una cuenta de bonos para bebés si era elegible y estaba inscrito al nacer.
Tener una cuenta de bonos para bebés no afecta la elegibilidad para otros programas de beneficios públicos del estado.
¿Cómo funcionan los bonos para bebés?
La Tesorería Estatal administrará las cuentas hasta que el beneficiario alcance la mayoría de edad.
Un beneficiario elegible no puede acceder a una cuenta de bonos para bebés hasta que tenga entre 18 y 30 años. Antes de retirar dinero, el beneficiario debe completar un curso de educación financiera aprobado por el estado y deberá demostrar su residencia en Connecticut.
Los beneficiarios pueden entonces gastar dinero en una serie de gastos aprobados para la creación de activos, como el pago inicial de una vivienda, la creación de un negocio o la inversión en educación o jubilación.
Según la oficina del tesorero estatal, se espera que el dinero invertido en una cuenta de bonos para bebés aumente del depósito de $3,200 a entre $10,000 y $24,000 para cuando se pueda acceder a la cuenta. Próximamente se publicará más información sobre cómo presentar una solicitud de bonos para bebés, a medida que los primeros beneficiarios elegibles se acerquen a la edad adulta.
Mi hijo califica para el programa de bonos para bebés. ¿Cómo puedo obtener información?
Según el sitio web de la oficina de la Tesorería del estado, las familias con un recién nacido elegible para bonos para bebés recibirán información sobre el programa estatal en los paquetes de parto del hospital. El Tesorero Estatal, Erick Russell, explicó que su oficina también está desarrollando numerosos programas de divulgación, incluyendo su ya activa iniciativa de Embajadores de Bonos para Bebés de Connecticut, para ayudar a las comunidades a conocer el programa de bonos para bebés.
Se anima a las familias que deseen mantenerse al día sobre las novedades de los bonos para bebés a que se registren para recibir actualizaciones en la oficina del tesorero. También se anima a las familias con un hijo elegible para los bonos para bebés a mantener actualizada su información de contacto y dirección con el Departamento de Servicios Sociales de Connecticut.
¿En qué se diferencian con las “Cuentas Trump”?
En julio pasado, el presidente Donald Trump promulgó la Ley “One Big Beautiful Bill”. Esta ley de impuestos y gastos también incluye la creación de las “Cuentas Trump”, una cuenta de ahorros de $1,000 para cada hijo con número de seguro social nacido entre 2025 y 2028.
Si bien las Cuentas Trump federales parecen similares a los bonos para bebés, quienes defienden estos últimos argumentan que el nuevo programa federal, que no tiene en cuenta las disparidades de riqueza, ni se dirige de ninguna manera a los hogares con bajos ingresos, probablemente resultará ineficaz para abordar las brechas de riqueza. De hecho, dado que las familias podrán aportar dinero adicional a las cuentas (algo que el programa de Connecticut no permite), es posible que las cuentas puedan, de hecho, ampliar las disparidades de riqueza.
“Es importante señalar que los bonos para bebés buscan realmente abordar la desigualdad de riqueza”, dijo Russell el mes pasado. “Y eso no es lo que las Cuentas Trump están diseñadas para hacer”.

(File/Mint Images/Getty Images)South Carolina’s attorney general has asked the nation’s highest court to ban a transgender ninth grader from using the bathroom of his choice at school.
The request filed Thursday follows a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in mid-August that the student, identified in court documents as John Doe, could use the boys’ bathroom while the case proceeded.
A clause in the state budget, originally passed last year, threatens to revoke state funding from any school that allows transgender students to use multi-stall bathrooms and locker rooms aligned with their gender identity.
The court’s ruling applied only to the student who filed the lawsuit, overturning a federal judge’s earlier decision that kept him from using the boys’ bathroom.
“Doe is a 14-year-old student who simply wishes to use the restroom,” Circuit Judge Albert Diaz wrote Aug. 15 in an opinion explaining the appeals court order several days earlier. “Doing so is a biological necessity. Doing so in restrooms that match his gender identity is his right under our precedent.”
The student withdrew from middle school last September after administrators suspended him for defying them and continuing to use the boys’ bathroom, according to legal filings. He started ninth grade in Berkeley County this month, one day after the appeals court’s decision that he could use the bathroom of his choice.
That was the wrong decision, attorneys for the state attorney general’s office and Department of Education claimed in a request to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Legislators wanted to protect other students who might be using the restroom alongside a transgender student, Solicitor General Thomas Hydrick wrote in the filing.
He questioned what a district should say to a transgender student who doesn’t appear to be transitioning in any way. That student might make other students using the bathroom feel uncomfortable, Hydrick wrote.
The budget clause doesn’t keep transgender students from using a single-stall bathroom. Hydrick said that’s a better choice for students experiencing gender dysphoria, who might be more vulnerable to bullying from their peers.
“What about the rights and safety of all students?” Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement. “Where does it stop?”
The school district is “now stuck between an impossible rock and hard place,” the request reads.
The district must choose between following instructions from the Trump administration requiring children use the bathroom aligned with their gender at birth or the appeals court’s decision, Hydrick wrote.
He argued the appeals court judges should have based their ruling on a decision earlier this year upholding Tennessee’s ban on gender transition procedures for minors.
Instead, they relied on a 2014 ruling by another appeals court that a transgender boy in Virginia had the right to use the boys’ bathroom.
Even appeals court judges reluctant to side with the student decided they must because the Virginia ruling was so clear, Circuit Judge G. Steven Agee wrote about the Aug. 12 decision.
Since the student won’t use the girls’ restroom, he didn’t use the bathroom at all after administrators banned him from the boys’ restroom, according to legal filings.
“To bar him from boys’ restrooms for most of his waking hours is to demean him, day-in and day-out, with no end in sight,” Diaz wrote. “Denying relief in these circumstances would subject Doe to humiliation by a thousand cuts.”
Diaz rejected the idea that allowing the student to use the restroom of his choice would harm other students, a key part of deciding whether to intervene in a case ahead of a decision. No students at the boy’s middle school had complained about which bathroom he used, according to legal filings.
“Doe is a teenager who, during the sturm und drang typical of adolescence, has grappled with extraordinarily complex questions of identity,” Diaz wrote, using a German expression that means “storm and stress.”
“Rather than support Doe, South Carolina has denigrated him, and every other transgender person besides,” he wrote.

,DC,2025-08-29 16:45:21+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump moves to revoke $5 billion of approved foreign aid spending,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-moves-revoke-5-billion-approved-foreign-aid-spending,,"WASHINGTON — The White House budget office moved Friday to yank nearly $5 billion in foreign aid already approved by Congress in a controversial maneuver meant to bypass lawmakers.The so-called pocket rescission, which a top congressional watchdog and the Republican chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee have called illegal, would pull funding that Congress has already approved for the State Department to fulfill overseas commitments.The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has deemed such actions to circumvent Congress unlawful. And Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins said Friday that “any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.”“Given that this package was sent to Congress very close to the end of the fiscal year when the funds are scheduled to expire, this is an apparent attempt to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval,” the Maine Republican said in a statement. According to a summary provided by Senate Appropriations ranking Democrat Patty Murray, the move would claw back $3.2 billion from the State Department’s Development Assistance account that funds food security programs, works to limit irregular migration to the U.S. and to strengthen the market for U.S. companies involved in climate issues to expand overseas.It would also remove $913 million in U.S. treaty dues to the United Nations to support peacekeeping missions; $445 million in security assistance from the State Department’s Peacekeeping Operations, particularly in Africa; and $322 million from the Democracy Fund, according to Murray’s office.The White House Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a message seeking the request. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that President Donald Trump is “using his authority under the Impoundment Control Act to deploy a pocket rescission, cancelling $5 billion in foreign aid and international organization funding that violates the President’s America First priorities.”“None of these programs are in America’s interest, which is why the President is taking decisive action to put America and Americans first,” Rubio said.Frustration from CongressWhen the White House makes a request to Congress to claw back funding already approved, the payments are withheld for 45 days while lawmakers make a decision to approve the rescission or not. Because there are fewer than 45 days before the end of the current fiscal year, funding is essentially paused indefinitely, regardless if Congress approves the move.As lawmakers face an Oct. 1 deadline in order to avoid a government shutdown, the rescission has already drawn frustration on Capitol Hill.

Murray, of Washington state, blasted the rescission request. “Donald Trump wants to zero out more bipartisan investments in our national security and global leadership,” Murray said in a statement. “This time, however, he is attempting to do an end run around Congress altogether. No lawmaker should accept this absurd, illegal ploy to steal their constitutional power to determine how taxpayer dollars get spent.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the Trump administration for withdrawing funds approved on a bipartisan basis. “As the country stares down next month’s government funding deadline on September 30th, it is clear neither President Trump nor Congressional Republicans  have any plan to avoid a painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. Pennsylvania Democrat Brendan Boyle, who is the top Democrat on the U.S. House Budget Committee, said in a statement the rescission wasn’t “worth the paper it’s printed on,” and criticized Trump and White House budget director Russell Vought by name.“It is deeply alarming, plainly illegal, and a blatant abuse of power,” Boyle said. “Congress approved this funding on a bipartisan basis, and the Constitution is clear: it is Congress—not the President—that holds the power of the purse. With this illegal power grab, Donald Trump and Russell Vought are driving us toward a government shutdown.”This is the Trump administration’s second rescissions request to Congress. The first, which Congress approved, yanked $9 billion in congressionally approved funding. That included about $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, such as National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, for two fiscal years. It also clawed back $8 billion of foreign aid.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-08-29 13:01:37.475798

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Two Democrats criticized the use of non-disclosure agreements in a working group focused on studying Applied Behavior Analysis therapy practices, a type of approach commonly prescribed to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. But the leading state agency defended the NDAs as a “standard tool” to insulate members from outside pressure.
Twenty-one agency leaders, health industry professionals, disability advocates and others started meeting earlier this year, with an emphasis on studying the state’s growing Medicaid obligation under a gubernatorial executive order. 
Reps. Maureen Bauer and Victoria Garcia Wilburn shared concerns about the NDAs in a joint press release, urging Gov. Mike Braun to “end the secrecy.” 


Indiana Medicaid spending on ABA therapy over time:
2019: $120 million
2020: $102 million
2021: $276 million
2022: $420 million
2023: $639 million
Source: Indiana Capital Chronicle reporting


“Autism services are too important for closed-door politics,” said Garcia Wilburn, a licensed occupational therapist. “This should be an open, bipartisan conversation, not one limited by NDAs. Hoosier families deserve to know what’s at stake and how decisions are being made. Especially when those decisions are being justified as cost-cutting fiscal conservatism, instead of centered on children’s needs.”
Garcia Wilburn, of Fishers, shared that she’d submitted a formal request to join the group but received no response. 
“Families across Indiana depend on Medicaid services to access life-changing therapies. They deserve transparency and accountability, not secrecy,” said Bauer, of South Bend. 
ABA therapy is commonly used to improve social, communication and learning skills in children and young adults with autism or other developmental disorders. Some critics, however, object to the teaching tool and say it encourages compliance over independence. Additionally, some practitioners coupled it with electroshock therapy as late as 2022.
But a spokesperson for the Family and Social Services Administration defended the use of the agreements, saying the “process has been transparent from the start.”
“NDAs are a standard tool to support honest, solution-focused dialogue. They protect volunteers from political pressure — not public accountability. They allow experts to give honest advice to the Governor without fearing reprisals from their employers, industry, or grandstanding politicians,” said Marcus Barlow. 
All five of the public listening sessions are recapped on the state’s website along with the working group’s six meetings.
“It’s unfortunate that the legislators now criticizing the process chose not to engage when the opportunity was open and ongoing, but we are grateful to the legislators who did participate in the process, two of whom served on the working group,” said Barlow. 
Both Reps. Robb Greene and Lori Goss-Reaves are Republicans. Barlow encouraged the public to reach out with their concerns by emailing abaworkgroup@fssa.in.gov.
A draft report will be circulated among members by mid-September for review. A final report is due to the Governor’s Office by the end of November.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Nearly eight months after U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) left her seat in the Michigan Senate to serve in Congress, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has called a special election to fill the vacant seat. 
According to an announcement from the Executive Office of the Governor, Whitmer sent a letter to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Friday calling for a special election, with the primary set for Feb. 3, 2026 and the general election set for May 5, 2026. 
“Today, I am calling a special election for the 35th Senate District that represents parts of Bay, Midland, and Saginaw counties,” Whitmer said in a statement. “We have a lot of good work to get done before the end of next year. Michiganders want us to create jobs and grow the economy, invest in schools and boost literacy rates, and, of course, fix those damn roads. I look forward to working with the next state senator from this district to tackle these issues and more.”
The 35th Senate District is considered a key target for both parties, with major implications for Democrats’ razor thin majority in the upper chamber. In the months leading up to this announcement, politicians and officials on both sides of the aisle have called for a special election, with some emphasizing the more than 270,000 Michiganders left without representation in the seat.

Prior to McDonald Rivet’s departure, Democrats held a two person majority in the Senate. Should a Republican candidate take the seat in the general election, the chamber would be split 19-19. 
While Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist can break the tie on any 19-19 vote, an absence from either party would result in a 19-18 vote, leaving Gilchrist without a tie to break. In order to pass through the chamber, any policy must receive a minimum of 20 votes. 
With Republicans holding the majority in the House, a split Senate would further complicate the Democratic governor’s ability to advance her policy agenda.

(Photo courtesy of the Muscatine County Assessor's Office) A Muscatine nursing home that has been repeatedly cited for resident-safety violations and short-staffing is now being cited for staffing issues that contributed to a resident’s death.
According to the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which inspects and oversees the state’s nursing homes, on July 24, 2025, the staff at the Lutheran Living Senior Campus discontinued one-on-one supervision of a male paraplegic resident who had been involved in an assault a few weeks earlier.
The move was made, according to inspectors, “to address a staffing shortage.” Shortly after the one-on-one supervision was dropped, and just hours before his forced discharge from the facility, the resident apparently killed himself.

The resident, who had previously been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, was alleged to have assaulted a female resident on June 30, leaving her with black and blue bruising on her leg that was consistent with the victim’s account of the incident. The Muscatine County Sheriff’s Office was contacted and a police report was filed, according to inspectors.
The facility then initiated an emergency discharge of the male resident and hand-delivered him a notice of involuntary discharge on June 30.










If they had just listened to the voicemail, that could have saved his life.


– Relative of man found dead at Lutheran Living Senior Campus


On July 24, the eve of his planned discharge, the resident spoke to the home’s social services director, who had assisted him in his unsuccessful appeal of the discharge. He allegedly told her he did not want her to feel guilty about anything that happened, and that she had done all she could to help him.
Later that same day, a certified nurse aide overheard the man “making a lot of phone calls” — one of which she believed was to a bank. In that call, she later told inspectors, the man informed bank officials that he wanted his money to go to his nephew “if anything were to happen to me.”
At some point that evening, the man contacted a relative and texted her, “It’s check out time.” Concerned the man was contemplating suicide, the woman called Lutheran Living Senior Campus but the phone at the home had been left unattended and so her call was routed to voicemail.
According to inspectors, the woman left a voicemail message asking the staff to keep an eye on the man.
At 10 p.m. that evening, two CNAs failed to report for their overnight shifts so the home discontinued the one-on-one supervision of the resident, allowing the CNA in that area of the building to handle other residents’ needs.
At about 5:30 a.m. on July 25, a registered nurse who was working in another area of the building heard one of the CNAs screaming. Following the sound, she entered the male resident’s room and found the man lying on the floor in a large pool of blood with no pulse and no signs of respiration. Paramedics were summoned, reported there was blood “all over the room,” and pronounced the man dead.
A nurse at the facility later determined the man had used a piece of glass from a broken picture frame and a set of scissors to cut himself, severing an artery in his left arm, according to the inspectors’ report.
The family member who called the facility during the night later told inspectors her relative was supposed to be under 24-hour surveillance and that from what she had gathered, the facility was short-staffed. “If they had just listened to the voicemail, that could have saved his life,” the woman reportedly told inspectors.
Resident-safety violations repeatedly cited
When the inspectors reviewed the man’s care plan on Aug. 7, they allegedly found no status updates regarding the assault, the involuntary discharge, or the one-on-one supervision.
The inspections department cited the home for a failure to have sufficient, competent staff to meet residents’ behavioral health needs, failure to protect residents from hazards in the environment, and violations related to resident rights, care planning, the discharge process and overall quality of care.
State records show that when the inspectors arrived at the home to investigate the death, there was a backlog of seven complaints to be investigated, three of which resulted in citations for deficiencies.
Andrew Harris, the facility’s administrator, declined to comment on the death or the state’s findings when contacted by the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
A $10,000 state fine related to the home’s failure to recognize and address behaviors that suggested self-harm has been proposed but held in suspension so that federal regulators can determine whether a federal fine is warranted.
In addition, a $30,000 state fine for lack of resident safety has been proposed and held in suspension. That proposed fine would have been $10,000 but was tripled due to it being the latest in a series of repeat violations tied to resident safety.
The other incidents were:
— October 2023: The state held in suspension an $8,500 fine related to resident safety, and a $26,711 federal fine was imposed. That action stemmed from incidents in which the home improperly transferred several residents from wheelchairs or mechanical lifts, resulting in hospital visits, increased pain, staples to the back of the head, surgical repair of a hip, a new wound and bruising. At that time, 26 other violations were noted by inspectors.
— July 2024: The state held in suspension a $10,000 fine related to resident safety, and a $134,971 federal fine was imposed. Because that incident represented a repeat violation, the proposed state fine was tripled to $30,000. The action stemmed from an incident in which the staff was unable to respond to a resident who was calling out for help. The resident was later found dead, face down in the bed with their feet on the floor. Workers later told inspectors the home was short-staffed at the time.
— October 2024: The state proposed and held in suspension a $6,750 fine related to resident safety. Because that represented a repeat violation, the proposed fine was tripled to $20,250. That action stemmed from an incident in which a resident wandered from the building without an alarm sounding.
Lutheran Living Senior Campus currently has a one-star rating on the five-star scale used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to measure overall quality of care. The facility is owned and operated by the nonprofit Lutheran Homes Society.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.

Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

The subpoena is part of a “consumer protection investigation into possible foreign spying risks,” according to a news release.
The attorney general’s office is looking into Lorex, a Canadian company that sells home security cameras, often used to monitor a crib, dog, babysitter, or doorbell.
The investigation questions whether Lorex misled consumers about privacy and security of the company’s apps and cameras. 
“Florida families deserve straight answers about who touches their data and who controls the code in the devices they put in their homes,” Uthmeier said. “The Chinese Communist Party cannot be allowed to spy on American children. Florida will not tolerate it, and we will hold bad actors accountable.”
The attorney general wants to learn more about Lorex’s relationship with Dahua Technology, a video surveillance company headquartered in China. 
“What consumers do not know is that data might be shared with the Chinese military. Imagine that, footage of your baby in a crib going to the Chinese government. This is unacceptable, it’s a national security issue and it will not be tolerated in this state,” Uthmeier said in a video uploaded to his social media accounts. 
Specifically, Uthmeier said he is asking for documents related to the corporate structure and ownership of Lorex and how it contracts with third parties involved in its manufacturing and software. 
The subpoena demands the company answers questions related to marketing claims, Federal Communications Commission filings, and contracts with Florida retailers selling Lorex products. 
The attorney general encourages people who believe they were misled by Lorex to reach out to his office. 
Dahua sold Lorex in 2023 after the parent landed on a U.S. sanctions list over alleged ties to human-rights abuses. A number of large retailers stopped selling the brand, but Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jeresey and Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon wrote to Costco demanding to know why it had not, according to a TechCrunch report that year. Lorex products remained for sale on Costco’s website on Friday.

The Vermont Supreme Court ruled Friday that the state has jurisdiction to pursue a case against Instagram for targeting teen users of the social media app, upholding a lower court decision.
The state’s suit, filed by Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark in October 2023, alleged the tech giant had engaged in unfair and immoral practices in Vermont, and violated the Vermont Consumer Protection Act by knowingly misrepresenting the platforms’ potential to cause harm to young consumers.
On Friday, the state Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state regarding the issue of jurisdiction.
“A company that reaches out and purposefully avails itself of a forum state’s market for its own economic gain can expect to be haled into court in that jurisdiction to account for its conduct,” read Friday’s decision.
Meta, for its part, has argued the state lacks jurisdiction for its complaint, and that the company’s contacts with the state were not made in or aimed at Vermont in particular. The company’s motion to dismiss the case in superior court on those grounds was denied, and Meta appealed that decision to the Vermont Supreme Court.
The original suit, which the Vermont Supreme Court did not weigh in on, alleged the company “intentionally designed Instagram to be addictive to teens, that Meta did so to increase advertisement revenue despite knowing the resulting negative effects on teens, and that Meta failed to take meaningful action to mitigate these harms while both actively minimizing and withholding its relevant internal research findings to maintain teens’ engagement with the application.”
“We are suing to hold these corporations accountable for Instagram’s contribution to the mental health crisis that is gripping teens across the country,” Clark said at the time it was filed.

AmeriCorps is a federal agency responsible for administering a network of volunteer programs nationwide. Earlier this year, the Trump administration fired the majority of its workforce and cut its funding.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, New York Attorney General Tish James, and 21 other states filed the lawsuit in April. They claimed the administration’s plans to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in congressionally approved funding were unconstitutional.
The case never made it to court.
“In the face of what would have been a blistering legal defeat, the Trump Administration chose not to defend the indefensible and will now finally release all $184 million in AmeriCorps funding,” Tong said. “This is a good day for programs across Connecticut that have helped stock our food pantries, tutored our kids, assisted homebound seniors, supported our veterans, and helped combat the opioid epidemic.
“These cuts were irrational, cruel and lawless, and deeply hurtful to people and communities across Connecticut,” he continued.
In 2024 in Connecticut, AmeriCorps engaged more than 2,200 volunteers at 250 locations.
“This is an important victory for the dedicated AmeriCorps volunteers across the country and the communities they serve each and every day,” James said. “For decades, AmeriCorps has provided critical programs that provide education, health care, and other vital services to those in need. Thanks to the hard work of this coalition, that work will now continue.”

The Vermont Supreme Court has upheld the murder and attempted murder convictions for a Burlington man sentenced to at least 27 years in prison for killing his wife and seriously injuring her mother with a meat cleaver. 
A jury convicted Aita Gurung following a trial in November 2022 of first-degree murder in the death of his 32-year-old wife, Yogeswari Khadka, at their home in Burlington on Oct. 12, 2017. In addition, the jury also found Gurung guilty of attempted second-degree murder for seriously injuring his mother-in-law, Thulsa Rimal, in the same attack.
Gurung’s attorneys appealed the convictions to the Vermont Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the case in June. 
His lawyers raised several arguments to support their contentions that the convictions should be thrown out, from claiming problems with the jury selection process to disputing whether the Vermont Attorney General’s Office should have been able to refile the charges against their client after they were dismissed by the Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Office.
“Defendant finally argues that the cumulative impact of all the alleged errors amounts to a denial of due process and a fair trial,” Justice Nancy Waples wrote in the 37-page unanimous ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court released Friday. 
“Because we have concluded there are no prejudicial errors presented, there is no basis for such a conclusion,” Waples added. “We thus affirm defendant’s convictions.”
The case has been working its way through the legal system for several years, as issues raised about Gurung’s mental health at the time of the attack, and leading up to it, were examined and litigated. 
In 2019, Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George dismissed the charges against Gurung, as well as two other defendants in high-profile cases. 
George contended that she could not rebut insanity defenses in those cases based on expert opinions. Gov. Phil Scott called on then-Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan to review those cases. Donovan opted to refile charges in each of them.
In the ruling Friday, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled the Vermont Attorney General’s Office did have the authority to refile the charges.
Gurung’s trial largely dealt with the defense contention that he was insane at the time of the attack on his wife and mother. The prosecution challenged that assertion, arguing it was a case of domestic violence and Gurung was fueled by anger after his wife would not get him a beer.
Gurung was later sentenced by Judge John Pacht to 35 years to life, with 27 years to serve and the remainder suspended on probation.

SPLC, an Alabama-based legal nonprofit that specializes in racial justice cases, argues in the Aug. 21 lawsuit that the state discriminated against the majority-Black city in violation of the 14th Amendment.
In 2022, the state awarded the capital city $35.6 million in matching funds from the federal American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA. A little over $23 million was for Jackson’s drinking water, with the remainder for wastewater needs. Both of the city’s systems are now under a federal receivership, headed by JXN Water, after struggling for years. 
But since the state awarded those funds, SPLC argues, the Office of the State Treasurer has withheld Jackson’s allotted amount without explanation. A bill that year — written by Rep. Shanda Yates, an independent in Jackson, and signed by Gov. Tate Reeves — stipulated that matching dollars for the capital city would go into a “special fund” with the state treasurer. For Jackson to access the funds, the law says, the city must submit a plan to the state Department of Finance and Administration.

Despite Mississippi making hundreds of millions of dollars worth of water and sewer funds available to cities and counties across the state, lawmakers only added the extra obstacle for Jackson. Moreover, a SPLC lawyer contends, Jackson had a plan for its ARPA money even before the funds were awarded.
“The city of Jackson had a plan, it had it for decades,” said Crystal McElrath, a senior attorney with the nonprofit. “(The state hasn’t) given them the so-called matching funds, and we don’t know that they have a good reason at this point.”
So far, the suit alleges, JXN Water has only received $3.8 million of the awarded ARPA funds. The 2022 bill also says that any of the $35.6 million unspent by 2027 will go into the state’s general fund.
The defendants in the suit are the state treasurer, DFA, and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. The state treasurer did not respond to Mississippi Today for this story, while DFA and MDEQ declined to comment on a pending legal matter.
SPLC first raised the issue in 2023 in a complaint to the U.S. Department of Treasury, alleging the state racially discriminated against Jackson in its distribution of ARPA funds. The department decided to not investigate the complaint because it doesn’t have jurisdiction over the state’s funding decisions, McElrath said. 
Mississippi Today also reached out to Jackson and JXN Water, and neither responded by publication. JXN Water is in the middle of a months-long effort to raise water bill rates because it lacks funding for daily operations and management. 
The plaintiffs in the case are Jackson residents Doris Glasper and Nsombi Lambright, as well as the Jackson branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/06144843/AP_22245846345915-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-29 13:01:37.475798

Travis Lang, of Irmo, was arrested in March and accused of threatening to kill President Donald Trump, former President Joe Biden, their vice presidents and several South Carolina elected officials. Lang pleaded not guilty of making the threats, which investigators claimed came through direct messages and social media posts.
SC man charged with threatening to kill presidents not fit for trial, psychologist says

Lang will go to a hospital in North Carolina for up to four months, where mental health professionals will decide whether he might become competent to stand trial through medication or other treatments, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie wrote in a Thursday order.
Currie’s decision followed a Wednesday court hearing in which a psychologist testified that Lang had a delusional disorder, causing him to believe the federal government is conspiring against him to keep him from running for president.
Lang filed as a Republican candidate for president in the 2024 election, but he didn’t pay to appear on the ballot in South Carolina. His campaign funds consisted of $6,000 of his own money, of which he spent about $2,500, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
Lang had a good grasp of the legal system in concept, but he couldn’t apply that understanding to his own case because of his belief that his defense attorneys and the judge in his case were part of a larger conspiracy against him, psychologist Lauren Schumacher said in court Wednesday.
Lang also claimed to have secret knowledge from his job at the V.C. Summer nuclear power plant, where he was an inspector until the utility owners abandoned the project in 2017. None of his beliefs seemed to have a basis in reality, Schumacher said.
Many people with similar disorders can become competent after taking medication, Schumacher said.
Lang, who has insisted he is competent, has been adamant that he won’t take any sort of medication for his mental health, public defender Jeremy Thompson said in court Wednesday.
For that reason, the next time Lang appears in court is likely to be a hearing over whether a psychiatrist can force him to take medication, a high bar to meet, Thompson said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_8172-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-29 11:57:12.708320

“After several years of invigorating but grueling work on behalf of candidates at both the state and local level, the time has come for me to take a break,” the statement said. 
Pomeroy-Wallace called her tenure with O’Connell an “incredible honor” and said she has “achieved all I set out to do.”
The resignation comes during a period of scrutiny for O’Connell’s administration. O’Connell’s response to May raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Nashville drew the ire of federal and state Republican officials.

Nashville voters overwhelmingly voted in November for a dedicated tax for transit improvements, but Gov. Bill Lee did not seek input from the city when he recently announced a plan with Elon Musk’s Boring Company to develop tunnels for electric vehicles between Nashville International Airport and downtown. 
Pomeroy-Wallace served as O’Connell’s campaign manager for both the 2023 general election and the runoff between O’Connell and Alice Rolli, before becoming his chief of staff. In July, she transitioned from that role into a position focused on project-based strategy. O’Connell’s administration hired Masami Tyson, formerly of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, as its new chief of staff.
The role with O’Connell capped nearly a decade of political work. Pomeroy-Wallace was Vice-Chair of Women for Tennessee’s Future, former U.S. Rep.

The city of Fitchburg has finally cut the ribbon on a nearly 13-year affordable housing project for artists. The post-industrial era city that suffered from the long-term decline of manufacturing has embraced arts and culture as a way to restore its standing as a vibrant hub of North-Central Massachusetts.
The post Over 10 years in the making: Fitchburg cut[...]","WHEN A LOCAL DEVELOPER came to Fitchburg Art Museum director Nick Capasso more than a decade ago with an idea to create artist-preference housing downtown, he needed little convincing. But the rest of the city, including the Fitchburg City Council, wasn’t as receptive to the concept of a “creative economy.”  
“Initially it was a foreign concept, because no one’s done artist housing here,” Capasso said. “We had spent years systematically educating the Fitchburg City Council to get them to understand that we’re not inventing the wheel here. This has been done successfully in other communities.”  
More than 10 years later, the post-industrial era city that suffered from the long-term decline of manufacturing has embraced arts and culture as a way to restore its standing as a vibrant hub of North-Central Massachusetts.  
Local, state, and federal leaders gathered Thursday to cut the ribbon on the Fitchburg Arts Community, a 68-unit affordable housing project with amenities for artists, designed and developed by Marc Dohan, executive director of the nonprofit Fitchburg community development organization NewVue. 
Not only has the $45 million project brought much-needed housing to the city’s recovering downtown that is affordable to a community that can help drive urban revival, it has also tackled blight by restoring three former municipal buildings once vacant and boarded up. Residents began moving into the FAC in the spring, and nearly all the units are now occupied.

“These homes help create space for musicians, painters, performers, designers and makers of all kinds to live, work, and connect right here in the heart of our city,” Mayor Sam Squailia said at the ribbon-cutting ceremony.  
The community housing has attracted artists from North-Central Massachusetts, as well as other parts of New England, according to Capasso, who called it a “dream come true.”  
“In an economically challenged community, the best projects to invest in are the ones that can address multiple issues simultaneously and successfully, and that’s what this is,” he said.  
NewVue officially purchased the three buildings in 2018 and began construction in 2023. B.F. Brown Junior High School was built in 1923 and sits across from the award-winning arts museum, along with the High School Annex built in 1869 and the City Stables in 1886.  
Capasso said the buildings were abandoned and neglected for years. Now, the 100-year-old museum will benefit from being located near a community of people who enjoy the arts.  
“We can’t have boarded up buildings across the street from the art museum,” Capasso said. “We’re the only tourist destination in downtown Fitchburg … We don’t want people to go home and say, ‘I was scared to get out of my car.’ That’s not going to happen anymore.”

Key historical elements were preserved in the restoration, including several old classroom chalkboards for artists to use in their apartment units. The school’s auditorium has been turned into a gallery space, and residents can enjoy a soundproof rehearsal room and shared art studios. 
What took so long for the project to be completed? Dohan said convincing city government, remediating asbestos and lead paint in the building sites, and piecing together some 20 sources of local, state, and federal funding turned into a nearly 13-year endeavor.  
After a fire destroyed the old school roof in 2016, the city was faced with an insurance settlement and a decision. Instead of tearing the buildings down, Fitchburg decided to reinvest. But while the artist housing project has been supported by the last three mayoral administrations, Dohan said the city, which has shifted its focus on market-rate housing construction, was initially hesitant to allow more affordable housing development.  
He says the affordability component is key for the artist community, but there was also no other way to finance the project without the use of state and federal low-income housing tax credits. The development received over $21 million in federal funding. Roughly 70 percent of the units are deemed affordable, while the other 30 percent are workforce housing units for households that earn too much to qualify for subsidized housing but not enough to afford market rents.

“Young people cannot afford to live within 495,” Capasso said. “The housing market is locked up, the rental market is extreme, and they’re finding Fitchburg, and places like Fitchburg, to be much more desirable.”  
But the project hasn’t just attracted young artists driven out of high-cost Boston.  
A retired Bill Tolos and his wife Nancy moved into the building in May. Tolos was once a student at both the annex building and the junior high school where he went on to teach science for 34 years before it closed. The painter has lived in Fitchburg nearly his entire life, and he is a frequent visitor to the art museum. He said he’s found community at the FAC and feels like he’s “on vacation all the time.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-29 15:28:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut prosecutors will report ICE requests under expanded Trust Act,Jim Haddadin | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/29/ct-prosecutors-ice-requests-expanded-trust-act/,Prosecutors will have new limits on their ability to communicate with federal immigration authorities under an expansion of the Trust Act.,"Connecticut prosecutors will have new limits on their ability to communicate with federal immigration authorities under an expansion of the Trust Act taking effect in October.
Lawmakers this year revised the act, which generally prohibits law enforcement officers from holding someone under a civil immigration detainer, or communicating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) about migrants in their custody.
An expansion of the law will apply those provisions to employees of the Division of Criminal Justice (DCJ), including prosecutors who try criminal cases around the state.
[CT Trust act: What to know about law regulating ICE interactions]
In recognition of the change, the division this month revised its policy on interactions with ICE, updating previous guidelines in place since 2019.
A policy adopted Aug. 13 by the DCJ Advisory Board instructs division staff to direct all civil detainer requests to a supervisor. State’s attorneys in each jurisdiction will determine how to respond. Division employees must also document interactions with ICE agents, including the date, time and nature of the request.
Chief State’s Attorney Patrick Griffin said the policy changes are minimal, as prosecutors rarely have contact with immigration enforcement officers, in large part because they don’t house or take custody of defendants.
Immigration status also has a limited role in the state judicial process, he said.
“We do not have statutory authority over immigration matters, and whether an individual is in this country lawfully or unlawfully, as a matter of course, is really not a relevant factor for the court to consider,” he said.
Nonetheless, immigration enforcement is increasingly occurring around Connecticut courts, sparking controversy and posing operational challenges for prosecutors and officials from the Judicial Branch.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont last week criticized federal authorities for carrying out immigration enforcement at courthouses, saying it undermines public safety in the state.
Data shows migrants in Connecticut with pending criminal charges now comprise the largest share of those arrested by ICE, a shift from previous years.

Advocacy groups in Stamford, Danbury and some other communities say they routinely witness arrests occurring on the premises of court buildings. In one high-profile incident, witnesses saw a group of federal officers apprehend two brothers inside the Stamford courthouse, removing them from a court bathroom.
ICE officials later announced the arrests were carried out as part of a coordinated crackdown on migrants residing in Connecticut. Federal immigration officers took 65 people into custody during the four-day operation, including 29 they said had been convicted or charged in the United States with serious crimes.
In announcing the immigration sweep, dubbed Operation Broken Trust, the acting director of ICE’s Boston field office criticized Connecticut’s Trust Act, describing it as “sanctuary legislation” that “endangers the communities it claims to protect.”
Established in 2013, the Trust Act applied to a narrower group of law enforcement officials for much of its history. Among them are municipal police, Connecticut State Police and school police or security officers. Police at the University of Connecticut and other state colleges and universities are also covered, as are Department of Correction officials, judicial marshals and probation officers.
Revisions this year broaden the scope of the act to include juvenile probation officers, the Board of Pardons and Paroles and DCJ staff, including state’s attorneys.
The law now prohibits state prosecutors and other DCJ employees from expending time, money, equipment or other resources to notify federal authorities someone targeted by an immigration detainer is in custody or set to be released, except in certain circumstances spelled out in state law.
Those exemptions include cases in which migrants are convicted of a class A or B felony, or suspected of links to terrorism. Lawmakers this year added 13 crimes to the list, including certain crimes against children, second or third degree sexual assault and criminal violation of a protection order.
Law enforcement officers are permitted to provide information about migrants convicted of those offenses to ICE, allowing them to be arrested or detained.
For prosecutors, escalating immigration enforcement also presents challenges unrelated to the Trust Act. In numerous instances, defendants in Connecticut have been arrested by ICE and removed from the country before criminal charges are adjudicated in court.
Griffin said in those circumstances, prosecutors will weigh the specific factors in each case.
“If an individual has been removed from the country, and that individual has pending cases, then, quite candidly, it makes it difficult for us to pursue those charges,” Griffin said. “So clearly, that is an issue that we’re going to wrestle with, with probably increased frequency, in the coming time period.”
If a defendant cannot participate in the court process, prosecutors can withdraw the charges, then reopen the case and seek a new arrest warrant. Doing so allows police to take someone who was removed from the country into custody if they reenter.
In cases of lower level crimes, Griffin said prosecutors may take a different approach.
“If somebody got charged with shoplifting and the person has been deported and we have no ability to get that individual back, are we going to try to keep that case open? You know, common sense dictates the answer on that,” he said.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other. 


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

Gretchen Whitmer, April 15, 2020 | Michigan AdvanceRebecca Kasen has seen and heard things in recent years in and around Michigan’s capital city that she never would have expected.
“It’s a very weird time in our lives,” said Kasen, executive director of the Women’s Center of Greater Lansing.
Last November, a group of people were captured on surveillance video early one morning mocking a “Black Lives Matter” sign in the front window of the center, with one of them vandalizing its free pantry. That same fall, Women’s Center staff reported being harassed.
A couple of blocks down East Michigan Avenue, Strange Matter Coffee, which supports progressive causes in the community, has been confronted by “First Amendment auditors” outside its storefront. Some toted guns or cameras, sometimes chanting slogans supporting President Donald Trump, generally unnerving customers and staff, Kasen said.
In many cases, extremist activities and conduct throughout the U.S. over the past few years have been driven by the deepening chasm of political partisanship and disinformation-driven rebellion against responses to the covid-19 pandemic. More recently, backlash against immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has heightened tensions.
Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups nationwide sowing unrest through a wide range of tactics, sometimes violent. Over the last several years, the group writes, the political right has increasingly shifted toward “an authoritarian, patriarchal Christian supremacy dedicated to eroding the value of inclusive democracy and public institutions.”
Researchers at American University’s Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, or PERIL, say that in online spaces, “hate is intersectional.” (For example, Pasha Dashtgard, PERIL’s director of research, explains, platforms dedicated to male supremacy are often also decidedly antisemitic.) Seemingly innocuous discussions erupt into vitriol: The release of “A Minecraft Movie” prompted tirades against an alleged trend toward casting Black women and nonbinary people.
The continued escalations drove staffers at PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center to approach the problem from a different angle: Treat extremism as a public health problem. Community Advisory, Resource, and Education Centers are now operating in Lansing, Michigan, and Athens, Georgia, offering training, support, referrals, and resources to communities affected by hate, discrimination, and supremacist ideologies and to people susceptible to radicalization, with a focus on young people.
The team defines extremism as the belief that one’s group is in direct and bitter conflict with another of a different identity — ideology, race, gender identity or expression — fomenting an us-versus-them mentality mired in the conviction that resolution can come only through separation, domination, or extermination.
Researchers who study extremism say that, as the federal government terminates grants for violence prevention, state governments and local communities are recognizing they’re on their own. (CARE receives no federal funding.)
Aaron Flanagan, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s deputy director of prevention and partnerships, said his organization and PERIL came together about five years ago to examine a shared research question: What would it take to create a nationally scalable model to prevent youth radicalization, one that’s rooted in communities and provides solutions residents trust?
They looked to a decades-old German counterextremism model called mobile advisory centers. The objective is to equip “all levels of civil society with the skills and knowledge to recognize extremism” and to engage in conversations about addressing it, Dashtgard said.
“We’re not about, ‘How do you respond to a group of Patriot Front people marching through your town?’” Pete Kurtz-Glovas, who until June served as PERIL’s deputy director of regional partnerships, explained during a training in January. “Rather, ‘How do you respond when your son or a member of your congregation expresses some of these extremist ideas?’”
 Pete Kurtz-Glovas served as deputy director of regional partnerships for American University’s Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, which has helped launch initiatives in two cities to address extremism as a public health issue. (Taylor Sisk for KFF Health News)
Michigan has long been considered fertile ground for extremism. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted of the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, were associated with a militia group in the state. Some of the men charged in 2020 in the plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had ties to a militia group calling itself the Wolverine Watchmen.
The state’s capital city and adjacent East Lansing, where Michigan State University is, are relatively progressive but have seen conflict.
Will Verchereau has a vivid recollection from the early days of the pandemic: a pickup truck speeding down the street in their Lansing neighborhood, a Confederate flag flying from it, music blasting, later joining a rolling protest that clogged streets around the Capitol to protest Whitmer’s covid lockdown directives.
Incrementally, the community has responded to these expressions of extremism. After the confrontations at Strange Matter Coffee, Verchereau, a board member of the Salus Center, which advocates for and supports the LGBTQ+ community, said people banded together to talk about “how to be safe in those moments; how to de-escalate when and where possible.”
The CARE initiative reinforces such efforts. The centers offer tool kits catered to specific audiences. Among them are a parent and caregiver guide to online radicalization, a community guide to youth radicalization, and “Not Just a Joke: Understanding & Preventing Gender- & Sexuality-Based Bigotry.”
Flanagan said the team views this public health model as separate from but complementary to law enforcement interventions. The goal is to have law enforcement as minimally engaged as possible — to detect nascent warning signs and address them before police get involved.
The resources help identify conditions that can make people more susceptible to manipulation by extremists, such as unaddressed behavioral health issues and vulnerabilities, including having experienced trauma or the loss of a loved one.
Lansing resident Erin Buitendorp witnessed protesters, some of them armed, flooded the state Capitol building during the pandemic over lockdown and masking orders. She’s a proponent of the public health approach. It’s “providing people with agency and a strategy to move forward,” she said. It’s a way to channel energy “and feel like you can actually create change with community.”

Lansing and Athens were chosen for a number of reasons, including their proximity to universities that could serve as partners — and to rural communities.
In the small town of Howell, 40 miles southeast of Lansing, protesters waived Nazi flags outside a production of the play “The Diary of Anne Frank” at an American Legion post.
In nearby DeWitt, the local school district proposed a mini lesson on pronouns for a first grade class that involved reading the picture book “They She He Me: Free to Be!” Threats against school staff followed and officials canceled the lesson. Since then, the CARE team has helped provide support to teachers there in holding conversations on contentious topics in classrooms and in dealing with skeptical parents.
“It’s really important that rural communities not be left behind,” Flanagan said. “They persistently are in America, and then they’re often simultaneously demonized for some of the most extreme, or extremist, political problems and challenges.”
The CARE team hopes to expand its program nationwide. Similar public health initiatives have been launched elsewhere, including Boston Children’s Hospital’s Trauma and Community Resilience Center and the DEEP program, run by New York City’s Citizens Crime Commission.
And in June a new tool, the Reach Out Resource Hub, went live, offering guidance to help prevent violent extremism.
Pete Simi, a professor of sociology at Chapman University and a leading expert on extremism, sees a daunting task ahead, with extremism having become more mainstream over the past 25 years. “It’s just devastating,” he said. “It’s really startling.”
Simi said that while there was previously talk of shifts in the Overton window, the range of ideas considered politically acceptable to mainstream society, “I would say now it has been completely shattered.” Violent extremists now feel “unshackled, supported by a new administration that has their back.”
“We are in a more dangerous time now than any other in my lifetime,” Simi said.
The Rev. Pippin Whitaker ministers the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens in Georgia, which last year received a package of ammunition in the mail with no note included. She embraces framing extremism, and people’s lack of awareness of it, as a public health issue.
“If you have a germ out there,” Whitaker said, “and people aren’t aware that if you wash your hands you can protect yourself, and that it’s an actual problem, you won’t enact basic protective behavior.”

Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.
In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

That includes Hinds County, home to the state capital of Jackson, where the rate was nearly twice that of Washington’s last year.","This article was reported and published by The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom investigating gun violence in America. Click here to subscribe to its newsletters.

When Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves announced he was sending his state’s National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., at President Donald Trump’s request, he framed the move as a matter of public safety. “Crime is out of control there, and it’s clear something must be done to combat it,” Reeves declared.
But several parts of Reeves’s state are worse off than Washington. At least 17 Mississippi counties endured more gun homicides per capita than the nation’s capital in 2024. That includes Hinds County, home to the state capital of Jackson, where the rate was nearly twice that of Washington’s last year.
Reeves isn’t alone. Five other Republican governors — in Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia — also dispatched guard units to Washington in August, echoing Trump’s rhetoric about a city in crisis.
But a Trace analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that most of those states suffer from some of the nation’s highest gun homicide rates, with some areas worse than the capital Republicans portray as especially dangerous.
“Why is there not more outrage in those states about their higher violence rates?” said Shani Buggs, a violence prevention researcher at the University of California, Davis. “Spending state resources to outsource people to other cities doesn’t make sense. If this is supposed to be a strategy for reducing violence, why aren’t they employing it within their own states?”
The Trace reached out to the six governors that have deployed guard units to Washington and asked if they were planning to send troops to violent crime hotspots in their own states. One responded. 
“Ohio has traditionally helped the District of Columbia, Ohio mayors, and other states when they request assistance from the Ohio National Guard or the Ohio State Highway Patrol,” said Daniel Tierney, a spokesperson for Governor Mike DeWine. Tierney noted that the state had deployed the guard to Cleveland and Columbus at the behest of Democratic mayors to help quell protests over the 2020 police murder of George Floyd.
The Data
The nation’s capital has long been a political scapegoat for Republicans, who point to its homicide rate as evidence of Democratic mismanagement. Last year, Washington’s gun homicide rate stood at 18.7 per 100,000. If it were a state, it would have the nation’s highest rate. But Mississippi’s homicide rate was nearly as high — 16.9 per 100,000 — and Tennessee, South Carolina, and Louisiana each ranked in the top 10 states for gun homicides. Ohio and West Virginia fall closer to the national average.

Washington is almost entirely urban, lacking the suburban and rural areas that help pull down most statewide averages. The district’s land area — about 68 square miles — is smaller than most counties but more comparable in scale, making counties a more fitting benchmark than entire states. County-level data also provides consistency, as it is a standard unit in federal public health reporting, unlike city-level data, which can be uneven. 
Our analysis of counties found areas within several Republican-controlled states that face higher levels of gun violence than Washington. Four of the six states that have deployed guard units to Washington have at least one county that’s deadlier. Mississippi has the most counties with gun homicide rates exceeding Washington’s, at 17.

“From a rational perspective, there’s very little to support these states outsourcing people to communities that are not asking for this,” Buggs said. “Meanwhile, there have been cuts to violence prevention strategies, health care, Medicaid, affordable housing, social services, and youth job programs. Those are the things communities are asking for — not this type of intervention.”
Annual gun homicide rates fell by double-digits last year in the three cities Trump has focused most of his attention on: Washington, Chicago, and Baltimore. Meanwhile, at least 31 of 82 Mississippi counties saw their rates increase. In Louisiana, 19 parishes endured increases, and as did 36 Tennessee counties. 
In New York, where Trump has also threatened to send the guard, 66 Mississippi counties, 50 Louisiana parishes, 38 South Carolina counties, and 20 Tennessee counties had more gun homicides per capita last year than the Bronx, the New York City borough with the highest rate. Ohio had eight deadlier counties, while West Virginia had one.
A double standard?
The governors sent troops to Washington, but at home they’ve taken a more subtle approach, coordinating with federal and local law enforcement partners — something the Trump administration reportedly has not done with leaders in any of the states to which he’s mentioned deploying troops.
Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, the only one of the six governors to have served in the National Guard (or in the military at all), has used the guard for security within his state. He deployed the guard to assist police in the aftermath of the New Year’s truck attack and shooting on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, and again a few weeks later for the Super Bowl. 
Four Louisiana parishes — as counties are called there — have gun homicide rates higher than Washington’s, including Orleans Parish and East Baton Rogue Parish, home to the state’s largest city and state capital, respectively, The Trace found. Caddo Parrish, where Shreveport is located, also had a higher rate, as did Rapides, a solidly Republican county that includes Alexandria.
In Baton Rouge, Sateria Tate-Alexander, who runs the nonprofit anti-violence group AGILE, said Landry’s deployment to Washington is a waste of resources that could be used to help reduce violence in her community. AGILE’s violence intervention programs are at risk of shutting down after the city’s new mayor, a Republican, canceled a federally funded grant. “It actually is devastating because we see it all the time, the wasted resources or the displacement of resources,” she said. “It makes me angry.”
She said the Louisiana cities suffering from high rates of violence need more state support for community programs. “Violence is a complex issue, so we have to have an equally complex solution to actually be effective,” she said. “What we’re seeing is the opposite.”
In Memphis, where violence is worse than in Washington, community groups say they’ve also been left in the lurch — even as Tennessee Governor Bill Lee sends guard troops to the nation’s capital. “It makes me feel like they’re ignoring the violence — that they’re not concerned about what’s going on here in the city of Memphis,” said Brian Tillman, a violence interrupter with the 901 B.L.O.C. Squad, a violence prevention team that was recently furloughed after its budget was slashed. 
“If you have resources to allocate to D.C., why wouldn’t you have resources to allocate to the city of Memphis,” he said. “If you’re not addressing the root causes, then you’re not part of the solution, which makes you part of the problem.”

(File/Mint Images/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s attorney general has asked the nation’s highest court to ban a transgender ninth grader from using the bathroom of his choice at school.
The request filed Thursday follows a ruling from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in mid-August that the student, identified in court documents as John Doe, could use the boys’ bathroom while the case proceeded.
A clause in the state budget, originally passed last year, threatens to revoke state funding from any school that allows transgender students to use multi-stall bathrooms and locker rooms aligned with their gender identity.
Transgender SC student can use bathroom of choice, appeals court rules

The court’s ruling applied only to the student who filed the lawsuit, overturning a federal judge’s earlier decision that kept him from using the boys’ bathroom.
“Doe is a 14-year-old student who simply wishes to use the restroom,” Circuit Judge Albert Diaz wrote Aug. 15 in an opinion explaining the appeals court order several days earlier. “Doing so is a biological necessity. Doing so in restrooms that match his gender identity is his right under our precedent.”
The student withdrew from middle school last September after administrators suspended him for defying them and continuing to use the boys’ bathroom, according to legal filings. He started ninth grade in Berkeley County this month, one day after the appeals court’s decision that he could use the bathroom of his choice.
That was the wrong decision, attorneys for the state attorney general’s office and Department of Education claimed in a request to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Legislators wanted to protect other students who might be using the restroom alongside a transgender student, Solicitor General Thomas Hydrick wrote in the filing.
He questioned what a district should say to a transgender student who doesn’t appear to be transitioning in any way. That student might make other students using the bathroom feel uncomfortable, Hydrick wrote.
The budget clause doesn’t keep transgender students from using a single-stall bathroom. Hydrick said that’s a better choice for students experiencing gender dysphoria, who might be more vulnerable to bullying from their peers.
Transgender student sues SC to use bathroom of choice

“What about the rights and safety of all students?” Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement. “Where does it stop?”
The school district is “now stuck between an impossible rock and hard place,” the request reads.
The district must choose between following instructions from the Trump administration requiring children use the bathroom aligned with their gender at birth or the appeals court’s decision, Hydrick wrote.
He argued the appeals court judges should have based their ruling on a decision earlier this year upholding Tennessee’s ban on gender transition procedures for minors.
Instead, they relied on a 2014 ruling by another appeals court that a transgender boy in Virginia had the right to use the boys’ bathroom.
Even appeals court judges reluctant to side with the student decided they must because the Virginia ruling was so clear, Circuit Judge G. Steven Agee wrote about the Aug. 12 decision.
Since the student won’t use the girls’ restroom, he didn’t use the bathroom at all after administrators banned him from the boys’ restroom, according to legal filings.
“To bar him from boys’ restrooms for most of his waking hours is to demean him, day-in and day-out, with no end in sight,” Diaz wrote. “Denying relief in these circumstances would subject Doe to humiliation by a thousand cuts.”
Diaz rejected the idea that allowing the student to use the restroom of his choice would harm other students, a key part of deciding whether to intervene in a case ahead of a decision. No students at the boy’s middle school had complained about which bathroom he used, according to legal filings.
“Doe is a teenager who, during the sturm und drang typical of adolescence, has grappled with extraordinarily complex questions of identity,” Diaz wrote, using a German expression that means “storm and stress.”
“Rather than support Doe, South Carolina has denigrated him, and every other transgender person besides,” he wrote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bathroom-stalls-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-29 10:56:14.913490

They went to work helping themselves and helping their neighbors.""","Editor’s note: Mississippi Today Ideas is publishing guest essays from people impacted by Hurricane Katrina during the week of the 20th anniversary of the storm that hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast on Aug. 29, 2005.

As I flew home from a three-week economic development trip to Japan on  Aug. 24th, 2005, I became aware that a tropical storm was in the Atlantic headed toward Florida. That day it was named Hurricane Katrina by the National Hurricane Center.
It hit southeastern Florida as a Category 1 hurricane on the 25th and then traveled into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico that evening.  
After Hurricane Camille hit Mississippi’s Gulf Coast in 1969, the state had conducted annual drills and practice sessions in preparation for the next major hurricane. Based on those preparations and practices, the Mississippi Emergency  Management Agency (MEMA), the Mississippi National Guard and the Mississippi Highway Patrol joined with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  and the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) along with county and  city responders and private companies in preparing for a serious hurricane.
As Katrina approached, we established a unified command structure that tied the various governmental structures together, which strengthened our operations. This was especially important since the state had more than 3,000 National Guard forces on the ground in Iraq. Private companies such as public utilities, airports, ports and shipyards tied into the command structure.  
By Aug. 27th Katrina had begun to change course, turning north  and gaining strength. Dr. Max Mayfield, head of the National Hurricane Center, called me that evening and told me the hurricane would probably come ashore in  Mississippi and would be worse than Camille.
I asked him to get the government  and the news media to start saying that because our evacuation efforts were too  small. He agreed and once the media started saying this hurricane would be worse  than Camille, our evacuation became much larger. Our citizens knew how terrible Camille had been.
The eye of the storm came ashore early the morning of Monday, Aug. 29th,  where Mississippi and Louisiana come together at the mouth of the Pearl River, with  the strongest part of the storm, the right front quadrant, covering the entire  Mississippi Coast and more. The wind speed, which had been a Category 5 storm  until Sunday, was knocked back to a high Category 3 when the eye passed over the  mouth of the Mississippi River and the Chandeleur Islands.

While the winds were down to 125 mph, the storm surge was enormous. The  storm surge in Hancock County was 30 feet plus the waves on top. At Waveland  that equaled 37 feet!
Afterward at Waveland there were no habitable structures remaining. Seventy miles to the east at Pascagoula the storm surge equaled more than 20 feet on Beach Boulevard.
As it went forward, Katrina threw off 11 tornadoes in southeast Mississippi, including population centers like Laurel and Meridian. Thirty more tornadoes were spread across other Southeastern states.
No airplanes were allowed to fly in the hurricane’s path,  but my office made an agreement with USDOT to allow the governor’s office to fly the state plane to Gulfport-Biloxi airport, provided the Mississippi National Guard cleared  one runway by Tuesday morning.
After I landed, we had a quick leadership meeting; then I saw my wife Marsha, who  had gone down Sunday to Camp Shelby to thank the large elements of the Mississippi  National Guard and Highway Patrol who had sheltered there.
She traveled  to  Gulfport when the convoy was able to clear one lane of U.S. Highway 49 on Monday. It  was a seven-hour trek to cover what was normally less than a two-hour drive. 
After the meeting, the Guard bought up three helicopters for damage assessment. I asked Marsha to go, but she said she had done it earlier that morning  and didn’t want to see it again. My team took up two of the choppers, and I let the  news media take the third. 
The devastation was shocking. There was utter obliteration. As far as the eye could see, it looked like the hand of God had swept away the whole Gulf Coast.
We flew first over Gulfport and then went all the way to the Pearl River. Gulfport had 10 to 15 feet of water flow through it, and much was washed away. As we went farther west, most everything seemed to be covered with several feet of debris and residential neighborhoods were flattened.
A new verb was created: “slabbed,” as in my house was “slabbed,” meaning there was nothing left but the slab. Many thousands of houses and other buildings were “slabbed” in never-before-seen destruction.
And it wasn’t just residential destruction that littered the Coast. Major  industrial sites were badly damaged. As I flew over Pascagoula in the helicopter, I saw that Huntington-Ingalls Shipyard was covered in debris, and Chevron’s largest refinery in the United States was also covered with debris.
It was estimated that Katrina reduced US energy output by 20%, including offshore.
Remarkably, all the damage and debris were not on the beach. Many tons of debris were piled up on the railroad right of way; more were miles past the right of way. In very few places could you even see the grass as it all was inundated under trees, cans, waste from buildings, etc. It was scary.
When we landed at Gulfport at the end of the ride, Bert Case, a leading Jackson television reporter, asked me, “Governor, after seeing what you saw on the helicopter ride, what is your worst fear?” I told Bert my biggest concern was how many bodies will we find under all that debris.
By God’s grace, the number of fatalities we had was 238  – too many for me,  but fewer than expected. And one-third of those were not in the coastal counties. We had a small fraction of the number of fatalities compared to Louisiana, which numbered 1,600 to 1,800, despite the fact that Mississippi bore the brunt of the storm.
While the death toll turned out to be far fewer than feared, the devastation to property and the terrain was beyond anyone’s expectation. And it was not only a coastal calamity. The hurricane force winds extended to north of Columbus in north Mississippi. As I mentioned earlier, a third of fatalities from Katrina were not on the Coast but north of there.
As we united to rescue survivors and to stay conscious of security and looting  (we had very little looting), we laid out our priorities. On Wednesday – two days after the storm – I  shared those priorities with senior staff of the governor’s office.
I laid out the literal goals of our work: return heavy employment to the Coast as very few people would return unless there were lots of good jobs; rebuild or replace the tens of  thousands of homes, apartments or condos because people would not return unless there was ample, good quality housing; and a quick opening of high quality schools for their children’s education.These priorities were pursued from the first week after the storm.
A main method of achieving these goals was the work of the Barksdale  Commission for Recovery, Rebuilding and Renewal, chaired by Jim Barksdale of  Jackson. The 50-member commission was made up of leaders from around the southern half of the state and as far north as Greenwood. The makeup reflected the fact that Katrina was not just a coastal calamity.
The commission was very active, and a highlight of their work was a  “Charrette,” a French word for “cart,” which in this version had morphed into a meeting of a hundred or more professional architects, engineers and other gifted designers who proposed and assessed multiple ways to rebuild and reestablish the Coast area in smart, more livable fashion.
To achieve our goals, we had to clear the debris from all the areas it covered. We removed 47 million cubic yards of debris at a cost of $717 million. More than  57,000 homes, condos or apartments were rebuilt or replaced in the first five years.
From the Charrette ideas were born like the Mississippi Cottage, an improvement over the “FEMA trailer” which was the federal standard but was greatly inferior to the Mississippi Cottage. We were able to provide more than 3,000 families with far superior Mississippi Cottages.
Just before the Charrette began, the Legislature had finished a special session  focused on Katrina and gaming.
Gaming was legal in Mississippi in counties that touch the Gulf of Mexico or the Mississippi River, if citizens chose to have it by referendum. Two coastal counties (Harrison and Hancock) had voted to have casinos in the early ‘90s when the state legislation was passed.
Gaming on the Gulf Coast had become a major industry, employing more than 30,000 citizens directly or indirectly. Before Katrina it generated 6% to 9% of state general fund revenue.
Because of the requirements of the 1990s’ legislation that legalized casinos on the Coast, the casino gaming floor had to float on the Gulf of Mexico. During Katrina every casino gaming floor but one broke away and floated on shore, some by hundreds of feet. The Beau Rivage gaming floors uniquely floated by being strapped down so they could not float away.
A major issue in the special session was whether to allow the casino floors to be built resting on land. Many casino companies insisted they would not rebuild if the casino floor had to float.
Quite a number of legislators, including House Speaker Billy McCoy,  opposed gaming as did most of their constituents.
Even though Coast leaders and their constituents believed the Coast would be decades rebuilding without the casinos, attracting tourists and creating jobs and revenue, allowing the on-shore change was not a sure thing.
The Senate leadership, all Republicans, did not want to go first in passing the onshore casino law. So, I had to ask Speaker McCoy to allow it to come to the House floor and pass. He realized he should put the Coast and the state’s interests first. He did so, and the bill passed 61-53, with McCoy voting “no.”
I will always admire Speaker McCoy, often my nemesis, for his integrity in putting the state first.
Many legislators stepped up strongly, not only during the special session, but  through the Katrina ordeal: such as Bobby Moak, Tommy Robertson and Billy Hewes.
The Legislature could hardly have been better during Katrina. Legislators did not try to take charge. They realized the process and structure we followed was working.
A lot of state legislatures didn’t have that discipline; but led by Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck and Speaker McCoy, ours did.
State employees, from first responders, National Guard, Highway Patrol to  social workers, secretaries and others  were magnificent in adjusting to the remade environment.
My staff was sensational. After Aug.29th everything changed. But they adjusted overnight! They made tough decisions, while taking over new responsibilities. People like Charlie Williams, Paul Hurst, Jim Perry, Marie Sanderson and many others not only led but oversaw senior staff.
The local officials and their employees were strong and smart from the  beginning, making the united command structure work extremely well.
Attached to the unified command structure were federal partners.The Bush Administration got criticized early after the storm, but the federal government did a whole lot more right than wrong. President Bush not only visited many times to check on progress, but he and his administration also favored the states and citizens on every discussion. He bent over backwards to help us, and so did the Congress.
Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran, as chair of the Appropriation Committee of the Senate, was the biggest star for us, but fellow Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott got many crucial decisions  made in our favor. Our members of Congress, both Democrat as well as Republicans, worked tirelessly for us.
And we had support from right and left in Congress, such as Democratic Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank. Similarly, 46 of our sister states sent people or resources to help.
The American people proved again that they are the most generous in the world, and not just with money. Yes, the federal government supplied Mississippi and our companies and citizens with $25.5 billion. Tens of millions  more came from companies, industries, private citizens and charities.
People gave something more valuable than money; something irreplaceable; their time. More than 960,000 people volunteered to help with the recovery; 600,000 in the first year and 360,000 in the next four years. These are the numbers of people who registered  to help, work, rebuild, all of whom registered with churches, charities and organizations.
Finally, the greatest hero of Katrina, the people of Mississippi: who got knocked down flat, got back up, hitched up their britches and went to work. They went to work helping themselves and helping their neighbors. Our people did more in Katrina to improve our state’s image than anything that has happened in my lifetime.
I close by saluting my wife Marsha, who spent 70 out of the first 90 days after the storm on the Coast, helping people who didn’t know how to get help. Marsha was the face that showed the state cared and was doing all it could.

(Screenshot/Kansas Legisltive Budget Committee)TOPEKA — Seventy percent of Kansas school districts are repaying amounts from hundreds to millions of dollars after a Medicaid calculation error by a state contractor, a Kansas official testified this week. 
Secretary Janet Stanek from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment told the Legislative Budget Committee on Tuesday that 153 of the 286 school districts had to repay funds from fiscal year 2016 to 2023.
Kansas school districts owe $11.2 million to Medicaid, with most owing less than $50,000 each, Stanek said. Wichita Public Schools owes the most at $11.3 million and 19 districts owe less than $1,000. 
The $11.2 million was 4.4% of the Medicaid payments made during that time period, Stanek said.
Districts bill Medicaid in two ways, one for claims reimbursement In which providers bill for services like physical or speech therapy, and the other for administrative claims, which cover the cost of providing services at schools, she said.
It was the second method that was incorrectly calculated by Public Consulting Group, a KDHE contractor, Stanek said.    
Gary Menke, chief financial officer for Topeka Public Schools, said the administrative claims calculation is complicated. It involves payments for support services the district provides to students to make sure they receive Medicaid services.
“It takes an army of people to get a student that needs those services pulled away from instruction, ready if they have to move to another building or facility for services, then you’ve got to get them back from those services,” he said. “Those are the dollars they are talking about.”
Topeka Public Schools owed just more than $424,000, which Menke said the district elected to repay in four installments to be deducted from a quarterly Medicaid reimbursement the district receives. 
While the repayment isn’t a hardship for the school district because Menke said he’s wary of budgeting Medicaid funds until final amounts are set, that $400,000 still would have covered multiple special education teacher salaries, which average about $61,000 annually.
Wichita Public Schools owed over $3 million, and the district’s Medicaid coordinator Deanna Beard told the committee that she would like to see more transparency in the process and Medicaid funding expanded for schools. 
“Currently, districts are excluded from key components of the calculation, such as the numerator used to verify Medicaid-eligible students who received services,” she said. “This lack of information from KDHE prevented us from validating data and any ability to identify errors early.”
In an emailed statement, a representative for the Wichita district said it elected to repay the amount in four installments. 
“Unforeseen financial needs such as this are an example of why WPS maintains unrestricted reserves,” the statement said. “These reserves will have to backfill the shortfall the audit finding repayment has created for the 2025-26 budget year.”
Stanek, who said she was offering no excuses, explained that previous administrations had cut staff and the program was “under-resourced.” In addition, schools had quite a lot of turnover at the same time the contractor PCG had turnover. 
“It was a perfect storm,” she said.
Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, asked whether anything in the contract allowed Kansas to hold PCG responsible for the error. 
Stanek said nothing in the contract allows that but the state  isworking with PCG and have asked for a corrective action plan. 
“But I can tell you, PCG has stepped up, and we are holding them more accountable,” Stanek said. “We are going to look at adding positions to manage – even though you have a consultant or a contractor, as you know, somebody’s got to manage them too – and I would say it was loose, and that’s on us.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Janet-Stanek-1024x576.png,,,2025-08-29 10:56:14.913490

Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotes. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.

Nearly 30 others are planned across Ohio, including in each of the big cities. 
“Labor and community are planning more than a barbecue on Labor Day this year because we have to stop the billionaire takeover,” a press release announcing the events said. “Billionaires are converting the government into their private slush fund and just passed the largest wealth giveaway in the history of the US. The money they take from working families, they put in billionaires’ pockets and set aside to fund a private army of ICE agents.”
“Wealth giveaway” was a reference to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which slashed more than $1 trillion from the social safety net over 10 years, while giving tax cuts of similar value to the richest 1% of Americans.

Fitzgerald United States Courthouse and Federal Building is seen on July 8, 2024. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A trial underway in Anchorage this week is challenging the Alaska Office of Children’s Services and the foster care system, with plaintiffs claiming the system is failing Alaskan children and violating their rights. 
“We hope that this trial will lead to significant reforms in Alaska’s foster care system. Alaska’s foster children deserve far better childhoods. It can be done,” Marcia Lowry, an attorney for the plaintiffs and with the nonprofit A Better Childhood, said in a written statement ahead of the trial.
There are about 2,500 children in Alaska foster care, a system that aims to provide a temporary placement environment after a child has been determined to be unsafe or at risk of maltreatment in their family home. Some placements are temporary, and families can seek reunification. If not possible or unsafe, OCS staff are tasked with finding other forms of permanent, safe placement for the child.
Alaska Native children make up a disproportionately high number of those in state custody – in July, the number was two thirds, or 68% of all children in custody, or 1,712 children.
The plaintiffs, who include five foster youths, are representing a class-action case that seeks wide-ranging changes to the system. The lawsuit, first filed in 2022, was brought on behalf of all Alaska children whom OCS has or will have in state custody. 
The suit names Alaska’s Department of Family and Community Services (DFCS) and Office of Children’s Services (OCS) as defendants, as well as agency directors including OCS Director Kim Guay and DFCS Commissioner Kim Kovol. 
The lawsuit, Mary B. et al. v. Kim Kovol, et al., alleges OCS is chronically understaffed and overburdens caseworkers, which poses a risk of harm to children. They argue the agency’s systemic failures include high vacancies and staff turnover, infrequent or poor quality caseworker visits, insufficient caseworker planning, and lack of adequate placements.
“Defendents knew and were aware of the serious harm to children, and ignored that harm,” said Julia Tebor, an attorney for the plaintiffs, during opening arguments on Monday, according to court transcripts. “Defendants have a policy and a practice of maintaining overburdened caseworkers. These caseworkers have 51 to 100 children, sometimes. They cannot do their job. They cannot keep children safe.”
Child welfare advocates, lawmakers, and foster youth themselves have raised alarm at inappropriate placements, including unnecessarily long stays at psychiatric facilities, homeless shelters, hotels with hired security guards and even overnights at OCS offices. 
“Defendents fail to recruit and retain placements. They fail to connect children with services. And this places children at unnecessary risk of institutionalization,” Tebor said.
In defense of OCS, lawyers with the Alaska Department of Law are arguing that the child welfare system in Alaska is a complex network of government agencies and private partners, including Alaska Native tribes, working on children’s behalf — not just OCS.
They argue that superior court judges are routinely reviewing children’s cases and whether families are getting visitation, services and case planning, as required by law. 
They say OCS is not ignoring the challenges presented by a shortage of caseworkers, caseplanning and access to services. But there are difficult logistics related to delivering services in Alaska, due to the vast geography, remote communities off the road system, and weather complications that can delay or complicate OCS staff’s work. 
The lawsuit also alleges OCS overlooks or fails to seek out placements within an Alaska Native child’s family or community, instead placing them in non-Native households, violating their rights under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs are arguing that “deliberate indifference” within OCS poses a substantial risk of harm to all foster children across the state. 
The state rejects the claim, saying there is no deliberate indifference by OCS staff, and they are not violating children’s rights under federal child welfare laws, the Indian Child Welfare Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Foster youth testify in court
A foster youth named Matthew was the first to take the stand on Monday. He entered OCS custody at 15 years old. In three years, he said, he was moved between 13 and 14 placements, including staying at an OCS office.
“Mentally, it took a toll on me because I couldn’t get schoolwork done,” he said. “There was a lot that I could have got done, that I never got done because I was moving around so much, and mentally took a toll on me.”
He described a placement called the “Ramen House” where kids only got two packs of ramen to eat for the entire day. “And if you ate the two ramen packs in the morning, then you’d have no food for the rest of the day,” he said. When he reported it to OCS, there was little response. “I told them multiple times, and they didn’t move me until I sat in the office and was like, I’m not moving until you guys put me in a new foster home, because I couldn’t do it anymore.”
Matthew said during his time in foster care he attended four or five schools in the Anchorage and Matanuska-Susitna Borough areas, and did not have regular access to medical care, like for a potential broken bone or to see a dentist. Now at 20, he’s still working on finishing high school. 
In court on Monday, he recounted sleeping in OCS offices in Wasilla multiple times, where he was sometimes locked in. In one instance, he said “there was no couch — or there were no pillows or blankets or anything like that. They never gave me a pillow or blanket or anything like that.”
He said he had three or four caseworkers, some he never met in person. 
Asked why he chose to testify, he said “so another kid doesn’t have to go through what I went through.”
Social workers’ caseload burden
OCS has five regional offices — Anchorage, Wasilla, Fairbanks, Bethel and Juneau — and 22 regional offices across the state.
Between January 2018 and January 2024, an average of 45% of OCS caseworkers had caseloads with more than 30 children, and an average of 25% of caseworkers had between 51 to 100 children, according to the lawsuit. At one point in 2023, the OCS Western Region had three caseworkers for the 309 out-of-home foster children in the region.
Kim Guay, director of OCS, took the stand on Monday and argued the state is working to make improvements to the system. She said caseworkers often work with partners, including tribal organizations and village public safety officers to make visits in remote locations. She said high caseload data requires context.
“They’re good things to look at, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. More needs to be looked into, what’s going on with the case, that office, the staff. There’s a whole context besides just the data and the numbers,” she said.
Guay herself began at OCS in 2000 as a caseworker. 
“A one-kid case may sound easy, although that child may be extremely medically complex or have behavioral health problems or actively suicidal, and they will spend an enormous amount of time on a one-kid case as compared to maybe a family of six that are in a relative’s home,” Kovol said. 
When asked if a caseworker having more than 100 children poses a “risk of substantial harm,” Kovol replied it depends on the situation. “Would I like to see caseloads lower than that? Sure. I think everyone would. But it, the cases are — you know I don’t like to use the words ‘it depends,’ but it does depend on the situation.”
Kovol also pointed to ongoing challenges with recruiting and hiring OCS caseworkers. “We need more workers,” she said.
Attorneys with the Department of Law and the plaintiffs were not immediately available to comment on Thursday. 
“Defendents will try to argue that there are factors outside their control that affects the child welfare system,” Tebor said on Monday. “But that is not an excuse for failing children and failing to ensure their substantive due process rights and their statutory rights.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC08593-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-29 10:56:14.913490

Mizzou’s Interfraternity Council held an event for fraternity representatives that included a screening of the first episode of “House of Horrors: Secrets of Greek Life.” The A&E documentary details several hazing incidents and focuses on Santulli’s story in the first episode.
In October 2021, at a “Pledge Father Reveal” event at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, Santulli was forced to drink excessive amounts of alcohol with his fellow pledges. His fraternity brothers, worried about legal repercussions, left him on a couch overnight without calling 911. He is now unable to see, walk or speak.
SB 167, known as “Danny’s Law,” guarantees immunity from prosecution to 911 callers in the event of a hazing. The state law went into effect Thursday.
“The event was very moving. There were a lot of non-dry eyes in the building on the Mizzou campus,” said Tom Santulli, Danny’s father.
Each IFC organization had four representatives at the screening. IFC President Wyatt Carlson said the representatives plan to recap the event with all of their members. Additionally, all members of Mizzou’s Greek Life are required to complete a three-part hazing-prevention training at the beginning of each year, Carlson said.
Both of Santulli’s parents were present at the event. The family shared their story with the fraternity members and answered questions from the group.
Some students expressed their wish that Danny’s Law had been adopted years ago, Tom Santulli said.
“It was very powerful,” Carlson said. “They are big supporters of the Mizzou community and did a wonderful job.”
Danny’s Law was passed in the Missouri Senate on Feb. 20 and signed into law by Gov. Mike Kehoe on July 9.
“We’re honored that they have his name as part of something really big in the state of Missouri,” Tom Santulli said, noting he hopes this makes an immediate impact.

(Amanda Loman/Salem Reporter)Oregon will see a two-year budget with a positive $472 million balance evaporate and turn into a $373 million deficit under the Trump administration’s tax and spending policies, economists told state lawmakers.
At the end of the Oregon legislative session in July, lawmakers set aside $472 million from the state’s general fund to help buffer against expected tax revenue losses in the next biennium caused by the Republican tax and spending cut law that President Donald Trump deemed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
That will cover just over half of the $888 million in revenue losses state economists expect that Oregon will endure in the next two years from the bill.
Oregon’s chief economist, Carl Riccadonna, and senior economist, Michael Kennedy, presented the news and the state’s quarterly economic forecast Wednesday to House and Senate revenue committees, and previewed some of their findings on a call with reporters Tuesday evening.
Those include a slightly increased risk of recession in the next 12 months and slowing economic growth from Trump’s tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners that have impacted the state and national labor market. The last time the two met with lawmakers was in May to present a quarterly revenue forecast facing uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policies, which were changing by the day.
“Last time I was here saying, ‘Well, we’ve created 25,000 jobs over the last year.’ Now I have to share the unfortunate news that we’ve lost 25,000 jobs over the last year,” Riccadonna said. “The situation is worse for manufacturing, trade, transportation, professional and business services, construction, categories that you would expect to bear the brunt of an escalating trade tension situation.”
Oregon faces an overall $15 billion shortfall in federal funding in the next several years due to the Republican budget cuts to government-sponsored health insurance, food assistance and education programs, and other services, according to an analysis from Gov. Tina Kotek’s Office.
“With President Trump and Congressional Republicans cutting $15 billion dollars from essential services over the next six years, and being responsible for reducing state funding right now by an additional $888 million, the damage is here,” Kotek said in a statement. “More Oregon families are experiencing tougher financial situations — not by chance, but because of the economic uncertainty coming straight from the Trump Administration.”
Senate Minority Leader Daniel Bonham, R-The Dalles, disagreed with the economists findings that federal policies are the cause of Oregon’s bleak revenue forecast.
“Instead of focusing on Oregon’s problems, today’s forecast spent more time on tariffs and Washington politics,” he said in a statement. “But the truth is, our challenges are not D.C.-grown – they’re Oregon-grown. We are losing ground because of decisions made right here at home. Failed housing policy, hostile business regulations, struggling schools, and rising crime have all driven families and employers away. Tina Kotek and the Democrat supermajority have done this, one policy decision at a time.”
 The “rolling reconnect” problem

Oregon’s state tax revenues are particularly sensitive to federal tax changes because Oregon’s tax code automatically replicates the federal code under a “rolling reconnect” policy. This means all of the Trump cuts on federal income and corporate taxes will apply to state income and corporate taxes, unless the state Legislature intervenes.
The biggest hits to Oregon’s revenues because of this policy would come from new federal rules removing taxes on some overtime hours and tips, and allowing businesses to deduct from their taxes some or all of the costs of qualifying machinery, equipment, property and other “depreciating assets” as well as research and development costs, Kennedy said.
The revenue forecast presented Wednesday is less affected by tariffs, which settled into a somewhat predictable state when they went into effect Aug. 7 for most of the U.S.’s trading partners, Riccadonna said. The average effective tariff rate in May was expected to be about 28%, and is now closer to 18% or 19% on most goods coming into the U.S.
Court cases, including one led by Oregon’s Attorney General Dan Rayfield, could upend them.
The tariffs — a de facto tax on American businesses and consumers — will continue to slow the state’s labor market through 2025, Riccadonna said, and as a result, the amount of income tax the state collects.
“We’ve had a loss of momentum in the labor market nationally. We’ve also seen that here in Oregon,” Riccadonna told reporters.
 Economy slowing everywhere

The national economy is slowing and will continue to slow through the rest of the year, according to Riccadonna. At the end of 2024, the national economy was growing at about 2.5%. It has since slowed to about 2%, and forecasters project that it will drop to about 1% in the next year, sparking recession fears.
“Anytime I see the economy getting close to 1% on GDP growth terms, I become very nervous, and so we will be closely tracking the evolution,” Riccadonna told lawmakers.
National economists forecast a 35% likelihood of a recession in the next year, down from 40% in March, he said. In Oregon, he’s projected a 27% likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 25% in May. In a typical year, the risk is 10% to 15%.
“Oregon, while underperforming the national economy in recent quarters, has shown some resilience,” he said, saying the state’s economy has not slowed as quickly as some other states and nationally.
Among the data points the economists use to weigh the likelihood of recession for the state is “weight-mile tax” figures from the Oregon Department of Transportation, which gives them a sense of container truck traffic through the state. Riccadonna said that data does not indicate truck traffic has slowed.
They also look at the number of people filing for unemployment, which currently is not much higher than it has been in the last few years.
“So that’s not giving us a red flashing light,” Riccadonna said.
 Some losses offset from capital gains

Kennedy said that once the economy moves on from the “shock of tariffs,” and begins responding to tax and interest rate cuts that take effect in 2026, it’s possible things could look up.
For now, some losses to income and corporate revenue are being offset by capital gains taxes paid by wealthy Americans selling stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets at record valuations, Kennedy said.
Financial markets are so far not reflecting the level of economic insecurity and instability around tariffs that the labor market is experiencing, and the S&P 500 today is at an all time high.
Instead, traders are encouraged by the likelihood of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cutting interest rates in September and later this year, Riccadonna said.
“I always caution that the stock market is not the economy. Nonetheless, it’s an important barometer of the economy, and with financial markets showing this robust performance, I think it’s an encouraging signal that we are not in a recession or on the cusp of recession,” Riccadonna told lawmakers.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-29 13:28:19+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: CT has slashed deeply into hefty pension debt,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/29/ct-pension-debt-pew-report/,"In what was called 'an astonishing turnaround,' a Pew report found CT slashed its debt dramatically by pouring surplus dollars into pensions.","Connecticut carries one of the heftiest pension debts of any state, a burden that limits what it can provide its residents in terms of tax cuts and services like education and health care.
But according to new data from a nonprofit public policy group, Connecticut slashed that burden dramatically once it began pouring surplus dollars into its pensions for state employees and municipal teachers.
“If we continue this progress, the state’s pension systems could be fully funded within a generation,” said Chris Collibee, spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget office, which has estimated pension debt — accumulated over seven decades prior to 2011 — could be eradicated by the mid-2040s. “This is an astonishing turnaround from where we were just a few years ago.”
Connecticut’s unfunded pension obligations — what it owes in retirement benefits but hasn’t saved for yet — stood at $40.6 billion and represented almost 148% of its annual revenue in 2022, excluding what it received in federal grants, according to the recent analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. That put Connecticut’s pension burden fourth-highest among all states when compared with its revenues.
But just two years earlier, the state owed almost $43 billion, which represented 186% of its revenues.
Several key changes occurred in that brief time.
General Fund tax receipts grew by nearly 30%, approaching $21.5 billion, according to the comptroller’s office. In other words, the state’s ability to pay grew rapidly as Connecticut’s climb out of the recession of 2007-09 picked up speed.
At the same time, the state, having used aggressive new budget caps to rebuild its rainy day fund, began pouring those surpluses into the pensions. Those retirement programs, which already were receiving more than $2 billion in regular annual contributions, got another $4.1 billion in surplus between 2020 and 2022.
The Pew analysis, which required available pension debt data from all 50 states, doesn’t look more recently than 2022.
But Connecticut deposited another $4.5 billion in surplus into its pensions in 2023 and 2024, combined. And most of the nearly $2.5 billion surplus from the 2024-25 fiscal year, which wrapped June 30, also is expected to go into the pensions after the comptroller’s office completes its regular audit of outgoing state finances.
Not all the dollars the state pours into its pensions can be used to reduce debt. About one-quarter of the required annual payments is saved to cover the future pensions of present-day state employees and teachers. The state also pays millions of dollars out of the pension funds annually to provide benefits to current retirees.
Lamont’s budget office, nonetheless, estimated last November that Connecticut’s unfunded pension obligations were down to $35.1 billion entering the 2024-25 fiscal year. Another update is expected from the administration in this fall.
The governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has been one of the most vocal advocates for Connecticut budget caps and the need to reduce the state’s legacy of pension debt.
A 2015 analysis by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found governors and legislatures that served between 1939 and 2010 left Connecticut billions of dollars in debt by failing to adequately save for these benefits. This deprived the state treasurer of huge assets that otherwise could have been invested and generated billions of dollars in revenue over those seven decades.
And Collibee said that despite the progress made to date reducing that debt, the latest data from Pew “does highlight the need for a continued commonsense approach to budgeting. With ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we must remain vigilant and prepare for a future economic downturn, making strategic investments, securing our social services safety nets and saving for the future.”
But there have been critics, across the political spectrum, of Connecticut’s new approach to savings.
Many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority say Connecticut could temper its savings somewhat, still retire pension debt faster than most other states and preserve deteriorating municipal aid, health care, education and other core programs.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an ad campaign in March attacking Lamont. Though grants to towns, on paper, have risen since he took office in 2019, CCM estimates education funding alone, once adjusted for inflation, has declined by more than $400 million.
Democratic legislative leaders were forced this spring to scrap plans for a state income tax credit for middle-class families with children and dramatically scale back new investments in Medicaid rates for doctors who accept low-income patients. Connecticut hadn’t adjusted its rates in broad-based fashion since 2007, leaving many patients unable to find doctors willing to treat them.
Pew analysts noted in their report that “Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” adding that trying to eliminate this debt “can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
But others argue Connecticut simply should move even faster to eliminate its pension debt.
The Yankee Institute, a conservative fiscal policy group based in Hartford, released a report last fall estimating the problem could be eliminated by 2038, if Connecticut intensifies its savings efforts by another 30%, and if the nation avoids slipping into recession before then.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0207_SR_Budget_082-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-29 09:57:26.064650

Jamie Thompson (R-Brownstown), at left, and Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills) recently introduced House Bills 4790 and 4791 | Photo providedTwo Michigan state representatives from opposing sides of the political aisle have come together to create a legislative package that would ensure residents have better access to education and resources surrounding menopause and perimenopause.
House Bill 4790 and House Bill 4791 were introduced last week by state Rep. Jamie Thompson (R-Brownstown) and state Rep. Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills), respectively. The bills were referred to the House Health Policy Committee, of which Thompson is the vice chair.
The goal of the package is to remove the stigma surrounding conversations about menopause and perimenopause, giving women of all ages and men a better understanding of what occurs during this natural state of life.
“At 48, I can honestly say I’m living through it myself – sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, and sometimes wondering why I walked into the room in the first place,” Thompson said in a statement. “This isn’t just about biology, it’s about real life. Millions of women, including our colleagues, friends, and family members, are going through these changes every day, and it’s time we talked about it openly.”
Steckloff said women juggling careers, caregiving, families and health issues all eventually must deal with menopause and perimenopause “showing up uninvited with no handbook.”
“By increasing awareness and access to information, we can help women navigate this stage of life with confidence instead of confusion,” Steckloff said. “Menopause happens to every woman, but it doesn’t have to be something we whisper about. This legislation makes sure women don’t feel left in the dark.”
Under the bills, schools, health care providers and workplaces would be provided with tools to educate and support women experiencing those changes. 
The Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs would be tasked with offering a continuing education credit course focused on menopause that physicians can take as part of their relicensure process. 
Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Human Services would be tasked with creating a publicly-available menopause transition awareness education program for both physicians and residents.
“Social media is already full of people sharing their hot flash horror stories, funny memory lapses, and midnight fan-club initiations – when you find yourself standing in front of the freezer at 2 a.m.,” Thompson added with a laugh. “If we can laugh about it together, we can certainly legislate on it together.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image002-1-e1756460688356-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-08-29 09:57:26.064650

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

(Photo via Canva; seal courtesy of the Iowa Supreme Court) A former state-employed public defender whose law license has been suspended due to a series of shoplifting incidents says the low pay associated with the job led to her crimes.
Court records indicate that earlier this year attorney Cassi Corinn Wigington, who worked as a public defender in western Iowa, consented to a nine-month disciplinary suspension of her license to practice law in Iowa. She requested a suspension of no more than 30 days.
In consenting to a suspension, Wigington confessed to stealing hundreds of items from a Hy-Vee grocery store but argued that in her position as a state public defender she was under enormous financial pressure. State employment records indicate that in fiscal year 2023, Wigington was paid $76,544 as a public defender.

“When I accepted the position of public defender for the State of Iowa, I did so with a sincere dedication to serving the people of this state,” she stated in a sworn affidavit.  “I understood that it came with financial sacrifice, but I welcomed the opportunity to grow in my profession and fulfill my duty to justice. I did not fully grasp the severe financial impact this decision would have on my ability to care for my four children and my mother, who lives with us.”
Wigington wrote that she had “worked tirelessly” as a public defender, putting in more than 70 hours per week, but was “still unable to meet my family’s basic needs.”
The disciplinary case stems from an Iowa Attorney Disciplinary Board investigation that was initiated in November 2023 when the board was informed that Wigington had been charged with felony theft.
According to the board, Wigington repeatedly shoplifted items from a Hy-Vee store in Gretna, Nebraska, over the course of more than a month. Her actions, the board alleged, “demonstrate dishonesty and reflect poorly on her fitness to practice law.”
In her consent to a license suspension, Wigington admitted that she shoplifted more than 300 items with a total value of $1,500 to $5,000.
“Between Aug. 6, 2023, and Sept. 13, 2023, I shoplifted items by intentionally failing to scan some at the self-checkout,” Wigington stated in her affidavit. “I deceptively passed some items near but not over the scanner to make it appear I was scanning those items. After positioning the bar code away from the scanner, I passed some items over so it would not scan. I moved some items directly from the conveyor belt to my cart without scanning them. I also left some items in my cart and did not scan them.”
Court records indicate that after Wigington was criminally charged, she entered into a diversion agreement with the Sarpy County Attorney’s Office in which she agreed to pay $2,721 in restitution. After she completed the diversion program, the shoplifting charge was dismissed.
The Attorney Disciplinary Board said it considered Wigington’s acceptance of responsibility to be a mitigating factor, but added that it was “lessened by her initial vehement denial of any misconduct — going so far as to claim in her response that she had been ‘falsely accused of knowingly shoplifting groceries.’”
In her affidavit, Wigington said her initial denials were made before she saw “the surveillance footage of my actions. I now acknowledge I shoplifted the groceries.”
The board, which recommended a six-month suspension of Wigington’s license, said Wigington’s claim that she stole items to provide “basic needs” for her family was less than persuasive, noting that she had “shoplifted boxed wine, multiple bottles of liquor and an ice maker,” among other things.
In May, the Iowa Supreme Court suspended Wigington’s license for six months, with the suspension taking effect in early June.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters will be resting for Labor Day weekend and will return to your inboxes on Tuesday.
Concern over the reliability of federal job information has been growing among California economists and policy experts, after President Donald Trump fired the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner earlier this month, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Every month, the bureau releases unemployment numbers and the consumer price index. After seeing a sharp hiring slowdown in July’s jobs report, Trump, without evidence, accused the commissioner of rigging the data. He then nominated the chief economist at a right-wing think tank — one that helped draft Project 2025 — to lead the agency.
Now, economists are ringing the alarm about the possible politicization of data from the bureau, which is used to inform a multitude of things like cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security, funding for food stamp benefits, tax-bracket thresholds and more. Besides potential global implications, state agencies across the country could be undermined. 
Some examples specific to California, include:

The Employment Development Department partners with the federal bureau to release monthly unemployment rate and job estimates. 
The Department of Finance relies on the data for economic and revenue forecasting, and crunching numbers related to the state budget, which includes the minimum wage and cost of living.
California community colleges depend on jobs data and labor market information to help figure out supply and demand in different industries.

State agencies and other groups that don’t use the federal data directly, however, still utilize research that relies on that data to stay informed and gather insight.

Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget & Policy Center: “(That data) allows consumers, investors, people thinking about retirement and businesses to make reasonably informed decisions. If you pull out federal data, we’re left with how people are feeling about things and the stock market, and that’s a big void.”

Newsom assigns CHP to ‘crime suppression’

Amid Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C. and his threats to send more federal troops in other Democratic-led cities, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that he plans to deploy new “crime suppression” teams in six California regions, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
Made up of California Highway Patrol officers, the teams will work with local officials to combat crime in San Diego, the Inland Empire, Los Angeles, the Central Valley, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area. The move is an expansion of similar intervention efforts the state made last year in Oakland, Bakersfield and San Bernardino.
The governor denied that expanding the crime suppression teams was in response to Trump. Instead, he argued that Trump’s deployment of federal troops into cities was “authoritarian,” and that Newsom’s administration was “trying to be responsive to the people we serve.”
Newsom’s court battle with Trump over the president’s deployment of federal troops in L.A. in June is still ongoing.

Efforts to protect renters from heat face uphill battle

After a heatwave scorched Southern California this week, legislators today will decide the fate of a bill that would protect residents from dangerous indoor heat, writes CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
Currently held in the Assembly appropriations committee’s suspense file, the measure would make it a state policy for dwelling units to “maintain a safe maximum indoor temperature.” Though a state report recommended a maximum indoor temperature of 82 degrees, the bill itself mandates no specific temperature.
Landlord groups oppose the measure, arguing that they shouldn’t have to pay to upgrade buildings due to a problem they didn’t cause. Meanwhile, renter advocates are concerned that without specifics, the measure wouldn’t give landlords enough incentive to keep apartments safe and comfortable for tenants. 

Memphis Perez, who lives in L.A.’s Lincoln Heights neighborhood: “The temperatures here in L.A. are rising every year. It’s only fair for (landlords) to do their part and provide a survivable experience in an apartment.”

This isn't about ideology. It's about the process. It’s about democracy. And right now, Massachusetts residents -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike -- are being cheated. 
The post It’s time to open up our notoriously opaque Legislature  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MASSACHUSETTS MIGHT call itself a model of progressive governance focused on different opinions and voices, but if you take a closer look under the hood, you’ll find something far more dysfunctional. Our Legislature is less transparent than any other in the country.  
A one-party stranglehold has created a culture where Democratic leadership makes the rules, doles out the power, and punishes anyone who steps out of line. Bills are written behind closed doors. Votes are hidden from the public.  
Committee work is barely conducted, Republicans are kept at arm’s length with little to no input or information, and the few meetings that do occur often take place without public notice or records. If this were happening in Texas or Florida, the national media would be in hysterics. But because it’s happening in Democrat-run Massachusetts, the watchdogs go silent.  
This isn’t about ideology. It’s about the process. It’s about democracy. And right now, Massachusetts residents — Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike — are being cheated. 
As a member of the steering committee of the Coalition to Reform Our Legislature, I am committed to reforming our state Legislature and raising awareness of the barriers interfering with its effectiveness. The coalition is made up of residents from across the ideological spectrum who believe that the people of Massachusetts deserve a Legislature that is effective, accountable, transparent, and responsive to the will of the people. 
Following inaction by the Massachusetts Legislature, the coalition held a “People’s Hearing” earlier this summer on two important bills to strengthen our democracy.  
One bill would establish an independent, nonpartisan legislative research bureau, which would allow lawmakers to receive unbiased analysis of bills instead of relying on lobbyists or political leadership to explain and push legislation. The second bill would fix the corrupt stipend scheme, where lawmakers pocket thousands of dollars in extra pay to “chair” committees that never meet. It would also require basic accountability: public records, attendance, and proof of actual work. Unsurprisingly, Beacon Hill leadership wants nothing to do with either idea. That has prompted the filing of an initiative petition to take the stipend pay issue directly voters on the 2026 state ballot.  
Just getting these proposals filed as bills on Beacon Hill took months of back-channel negotiation because lawmakers were afraid of being punished for even touching them.  
One lawmaker said she might help now that she’s in leadership and harder to punish, but that’s not insulated lawmakers from such a fate in the past, such as former Speaker Robert DeLeo sidelining Rep. Russell Holmes as vice chair of a committee after he spoke out in favor of more decentralized power in the House.  
However, there is hope. The Massachusetts House and Senate recently adopted joint rules for the 2025-2026 legislative session, the first time they have done so since 2019. Following the adoption of these new rules, the Legislature will begin making committee votes available for viewing online, hearings will become livestreamed, and the public will receive a 10-day notice before joint committee hearings.  
This is just the start; our state Legislature has a long way to go.  
Let’s also not forget: Leadership controls staff hiring and determines which bills move forward. They control who gets a raise and who gets iced out. It’s political patronage dressed up as public service, and while legislators get stipends and perks, basic services across the state are underfunded, bills go unread, and your voice gets drowned out. 
This is how democracies erode, not in one dramatic moment, but in years of quiet dealmaking behind closed doors. It’s not a democratically run Legislature that operates on Beacon Hill. It’s a machine, and if Massachusetts voters don’t demand change, it’s only going to get worse.

The president’s declared crime emergency in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to end after 30 days, unless Congress approves an extension, which many GOP lawmakers say they are ready to vote for when they return from recess next week, if the president says it is necessary.
Democrats, meanwhile, are considering legislation that would end the president’s takeover of D.C. law enforcement, and would give the mayor control over the District’s National Guard.
Republican Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) has proposed legislation to amend the D.C. Home Rule Act, so that a president would be allowed to assert control over D.C. police for 180 days.
“My legislation ensures that President Trump has the necessary time and authority to quell the chaos that has reigned in woke D.C.,” Biggs said in a statement.
Cosponsors of his legislation include Maryland Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st).
Other Republican lawmakers have proposed legislation to extend the federal surge in D.C. indefinitely, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) and Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), who has introduced a competing bill.
Immigration crackdown intensifies in D.C. under Trump order for federal control

Biggs has also introduced a bill that would prohibit the use of cashless bail in D.C., a favorite target of President Donald Trump (R). Cashless bail allows judges to release individuals who are awaiting trial, without the defendant having to post a bond to guarantee they’ll show up.
Trump and the U.S. Attorney for D.C., Jeanine Pirro, have been highly critical of cashless bail and have made it clear they want it eliminated. Trump on Monday signed an executive order threatening to withhold federal funds from any jurisdiction that has a cashless bail policy, although it is unclear if he has the authority to do so.
Democrats have bills to end the crime emergency
Congressional Democrats have proposed their own legislation, seeking to limit the duration of the federal surge.
D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District’s nonvoting delegate to Congress, has introduced a bill to terminate what she calls the president’s “unprecedented federalization of MPD.” She has also introduced a bill that would require National Guard troops deployed in D.C. who deal with crime to wear body cameras.
“President Trump’s decision to federalize MPD and deploy more than 2,000 National Guard troops to D.C. is an unnecessary assault on D.C. Home Rule for purposes that eight out of 10 D.C. residents oppose,” Norton said in a statement to WTOP.
Norton and U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have also reintroduced legislation that would give D.C. full control over its National Guard, as well as the police department. Currently, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser cannot activate the National Guard — that power resides with the president.
While Democrats have pushed back on the president’s deployment of federal agents and Guard troops, they have little leverage given its widespread support among Republicans in Congress, who control the House and Senate.
Democrats may try to oppose extending the law enforcement surge in the Senate with a filibuster.
If they block the extension, the president has suggested he might declare a national emergency to get around Congress, which could lead to a battle in the courts.

(File photo from Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Every teacher in South Carolina is expected to finish a literacy training program this school year in a push the state superintendent says has already led to improved reading test scores.
The training is part of a nationwide push toward teaching “the science of reading,” a strategy focused on teaching children to read by sounding out letters and rhyming sounds. Essentially, it’s a return to the basics: phonics.
For years, South Carolina was among states that largely ditched phonics to instead teach a method called “three-cueing,” which encouraged children to use context clues, such as the surrounding sentence and visual cues, to figure out words. While three-cueing made sense to some students, it relied too heavily on guesswork for many to apply the words they learned in broader contexts, research found.
That practice is now banned from South Carolina curriculum. A state law signed in March 2024 requires districts to ensure the “three-cueing system” is excluded from all instructional materials.
Training on LETRS — short for Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling — began in 2021 in 250 of the state’s lowest-performing elementary schools. In 2023, the Legislature allocated $39 million to expand the training for teachers in kindergarten through third-grade classes statewide.
This school year, every teacher in those “foundational literacy” grades must complete the training, as required by law. For some veteran teachers, it’s a refresher course strengthening their phonics knowledge. Others are newly learning a method not taught while they were in college.
State Superintendent Ellen Weaver credits the two-year training program with fewer students scoring far below grade-level on a statewide test.
“This is the foundation-building, life-changing work on which our entire education system and the success that we see for students going forward in the future is going to be built,” Weaver told legislators Wednesday.
Improving test scores
In spring 2024, more than a quarter of third graders scored in the lowest possible bracket of the state-standardized reading test. That means they were reading on a first-grade level at best, according to Department of Education data.
That number improved to 16% in the school year that just ended, Weaver told a panel of legislators Wednesday in previewing the test results. South Carolina hasn’t had that few students score in the lowest category since 2016, the first year that students took SC READY tests, according to department data.
The switch to phonics was a large part of the improvement, Weaver said.
“Y’all, that is massive, massive progress on behalf of our students and an incredible tribute to our teachers who are doing that hard work on the professional development front with the LETRS curriculum,” Weaver told legislators.
Scores on tests taken at the end of last school year will be publicly released next week, Weaver said.
Until then, the results per grade and school are not yet known.
But they sound promising, said Patrick Kelly, lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. Whether the change was entirely because of teachers finishing LETRS is impossible to say, but the training seems to be helping, he said.
“To view (the test scores) as anything other than encouraging is missing the mark,” said Kelly, who teaches advanced government at a high school near Columbia.
The school year that started this month will be the real test of how well LETRS is working, Weaver said. Students who were kindergarteners in those 250 schools where teachers first completed the training are in third grade, when state-standardized testing starts.
“The fact that we’re seeing such incredible, encouraging progress this year shows us we’re on the right track in terms of the strategies that we are employing to ensure that these children are reading at a proficient grade level,” Weaver said.
How it works
At elementary schools across the state, “word walls,” which show common words students should memorize, have been replaced with “sound walls,” visualizing the noises letters make when combined, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association and a longtime literacy coach at a Florence elementary school.
That’s a result of LETRS training, which emphasizes the sounds of letters and how they work together over memorizing specific words, she said.
LETRS training begins by explaining what the science of reading is and why it works, said Crews, who completed year two of the training in May. Teachers then learn how they can use the concepts they’ve learned in their classrooms on a day-to-day basis.
For instance, the training suggests teachers use handheld mirrors to help students recognize the way their mouths move for certain letters and sounds, Crews said. Those practical lessons are ones teachers can take back to their classrooms and apply right away, she said.
Just under 13,000 teachers have completed this training. Another 11,000 have finished the first half of the training and are expected to complete part two during the coming school year. They will account for every kindergarten- through third-grade teacher in the state, said Jason Raven, spokesman for the state Department of Education.
By law, the training costs are covered by the state. The course counts toward teachers’ required continuing education credits.
As a thank you, teachers receive $500 for completing each year of the two-year program, for $1,000 total. So far, that has amounted to about $18 million since 2021, according to the Department of Education.
Over the summer, teachers complained over social media that they hadn’t been paid.
According to the state agency, teachers should expect their stipends within three months of completing the training, as long as there are no problems with the paperwork submitted by school districts.
This summer, the agency processed about 14,600 payments, which Raven called a recognition of “the time and effort teachers invest in professional learning and student success.”
The training seems to be a big step up from the professional developments under the 2014 Read to Succeed law that first began the push back toward phonics, Kelly said.
Depending on the grade level, teachers had different training requirements, with no clear way to fulfill them. That led to inconsistency and often such basic information that longtime educators felt insulted, he said.
Not only did teachers not receive a stipend to cover the time they spent completing that training, but they had to pay out of pocket for the coursework, he said.
But Crews, while calling the training helpful, said $1,000 doesn’t adequately compensate teachers for the rigorous, time-consuming course. Each of the eight units involved takes as many as eight hours, which teachers are often expected to complete on their own time, she said.
In other districts, teachers can take the training during scheduled work days without students.
In Kelly’s experience, teachers are more willing to dedicate that time and effort to training that gives them actual, practical skills they can use in the classroom, he said.
Teachers and administrators interviewed for a U.S. Department of Education study examining the program said as much. Although some noted the material was dense and questioned when they’d have time to complete it, they also said the training was helpful and enabled them to help their students with reading problems.
“[LETRS] is a gift, and not just a mandate,” one teacher told researchers.
The education department tried to make the program feel less like another mandate added to their workload and more of a chance to learn skills “to ensure these kids have a fighting chance at life,” Weaver said.
“That starts with literacy,” Weaver said.
Crews still worries about getting rid of the previous method of teaching reading. Phonetic learning is a good foundation for many students, but teaching a child to read is so complicated that no single approach is likely to work for everyone, she said.
As a literacy coach, she often works with children who are struggling to read, which means they might need an approach other than the one their teacher was already using, she said.
“We need to figure out a way of bridging everything together instead of one piece over another and saying, ‘OK, this is the only way to do it,’” Crews said.
What’s next
Teachers who have been around for decades have seen methods of learning come and go, making many skeptical about how long this training will last before the next method begins, Crews said. Committing to the program for the long-term will show teachers the state is serious about using this method to teach reading, she said.
“Many of us were happy that we were going back to how we learned how to read, and we’re hoping we will see the benefits of it,” Crews said. “I’m just hoping that we stick with it for a number of years so that we can see the benefit.”
Teaching programs must include phonics under a 2024 law that updated the decade-old Read to Succeed Act and expanded literacy programs. For it to continue helping students, though, the department needs to be diligent about making sure teachers from other states and alternative certification programs learn the same material so that students’ educations stay consistent from grade to grade and school to school, Kelly said.
“This is going to have to be a concentrated, sustained effort over time,” Kelly said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/frustrated-elementary-teacher-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-29 08:56:13.945050
,California,2025-08-29 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,America’s economy runs on data. What Trump’s firing of a top data chief means for California,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/08/bls-commissioner-jobs-data-ca/,Economists and others worry about politicizing jobs and inflation data after Trump firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics chief and nomination of partisan replacement.,"In summary
Economists and others worry about politicizing jobs and inflation data after Trump firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics chief and nomination of partisan replacement.


Unemployment numbers and the consumer price index come out every month like clockwork, giving individuals, businesses and local and state government agencies across the nation critical information.  
Economists and others fear wide-ranging ramifications for California if the reliability of that information is uncertain, calling the data fundamental for making an array of policy and funding decisions.
President Donald Trump recently fired Erika McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, because he didn’t like that the July jobs report showed a drastic slowdown in hiring, and the updated numbers for May and June, after the common process of a revision. He accused her, without evidence, of rigging the data. 
Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni to head the agency. Antoni is the chief economist at the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank, a contributor to the right-wing policy blueprint Project 2025 and a critic of the agency. He said in an interview with Fox News Digital in early August that monthly jobs data is flawed and should be suspended, a notion the White House has already walked back. 
If Antoni is confirmed, economists on both sides of the aisle worry about a possible politicization of jobs, inflation and other data from the agency. That data helps inform cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security, funding for SNAP benefits, tax-bracket thresholds, limits on retirement account contributions and more. Meanwhile, state agencies and others are concerned about possible changes that could affect their work and threaten the continuity of data that is important to many people’s lives, whether they know it or not.
The U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which has been asked to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni, has not said it will do so. The office of committee chair Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, has not responded to a CalMatters email asking about a hearing. But one report says a hearing could be held in September. 
“(That data) allows consumers, investors, people thinking about retirement and businesses to make reasonably informed decisions,” said Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget & Policy Center, a left-leaning research and advocacy group. “If you pull out federal data, we’re left with how people are feeling about things and the stock market, and that’s a big void.”
When asked about Antoni, a Heritage Foundation spokesperson referred CalMatters to the White House. The White House and the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not respond to questions about possible changes in issuing monthly jobs reports or the agency’s data practices.
How California uses the data
At state and local governments, information about jobs and inflation is important for policymakers, lawmakers and the work of California’s Employment Development Department, community colleges, workforce development boards and others.  
“We need to know and have a common base of understanding of how California is faring in terms of jobs, prices, and other economic measures in order to make good policy,” said Sarah Bohn, director of the Public Policy Institute of California’s Economic Policy Center.
Like other states, the California EDD has a partnership with the Bureau of Labor Statistics for release of the monthly unemployment rate and job estimates. 
Monthly jobs numbers are estimates and are revised as payroll data comes in. Additionally, an annual revision, called benchmarking, updates monthly numbers as more information becomes available from tax records. 
“The process, which includes revisions and benchmarking after the estimates, has delivered consistent and reliable results for over 75 years,” said Anne Chapuis, spokesperson for the EDD, in an email. 
The data also is crucial for the Finance Department’s economic and revenue forecasting, as well as for its work on the state budget, which includes calculating the minimum wage and cost of living. 
“If the BLS data disappears tomorrow, we wouldn’t be able to say, ‘Let’s pick up and use this other source,’” said Somjita Mitra, chief economist for the finance department. She pointed to the payroll company ADP’s regular releases of jobs data, noting that it’s only for the private sector so it’s not comprehensive. And Mitra said there is no alternative at all for inflation data.
“It would be almost impossible” for her to do her job without the federal data, she said.
Community colleges also rely on jobs data from both the EDD and the federal government.
Laura Coleman is statewide director of the Center of Excellence for Labor Market Research, which is part of the community college system’s Workforce & Economic Development division and serves eight different regions in California. The regional centers use labor market information to help figure out supply and demand in different industries — some federal funding is tied to and state rules require that information. The centers work directly with colleges and even K-12 schools, she said.
“We’re trying to help with anticipating needs by understanding where jobs are going and what the trends are,” Coleman said. “We talk about a living wage and expectations of earnings when a student goes into a career pathway.”
Even state agencies that don’t use federal data directly use research that is underpinned by it. Daniel Lopez, spokesperson for the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, said the division pays close attention to employment and workforce trends. That includes receiving briefings and using insight from the EDD.
‘They would not get very far’
Experts say the infrastructure around the data collected and disseminated by the federal bureau is robust and has been around for a long time.
“It would be very hard for political appointees to manipulate or to meddle with official statistics,” said Jed Kolko, former Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs who oversaw the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis under President Joe Biden. “They would not get very far without help from career civil servants who are technical experts. They would blow the whistle.”
But Kolko added that despite what he calls “checks and balances” both internal and external, “it doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen.” 
The risks of manipulated economic data run the gamut. More broadly, the experts CalMatters spoke with say the loss of trust in U.S. employment and inflation numbers could affect investment in the nation.
“We can’t keep throwing uncertainty and instability at the U.S. economy on so many fronts and have it hold up,” said Hoene of the California Budget & Policy Center, referring to the president’s constant changes to tariffs and the pressure he has been putting on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. “If you then undermine the reliability of data coming from the world’s biggest economy, global actors have no reason to have confidence about whether their money is safe here,” Hoene said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082825-BLS-DATA-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-29 08:56:13.945050

Christina Patel is the lead pharmacist at CVS Specialty in San Francisco.


As a lead pharmacist in San Francisco, I see firsthand how the cost of medications can be as overwhelming as the diseases they’re supposed to treat. 
Every day, my team of pharmacists and technicians helps patients navigate complex conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disorders and multiple sclerosis. A cancer diagnosis is difficult enough; but for many patients, the challenge is compounded by the soaring price of their oncology medications, which can cost thousands of dollars a month.
While pharmacy teams can often provide some relief by connecting patients with financial assistance programs, so-called pharmacy benefit managers work to bring down prescription costs by negotiating directly with drug manufacturers.  
Earlier this year, California enacted new transparency requirements across the prescription drug supply chain, including enhanced reporting standards for benefit managers, also known as PBMs. 
Before fully understanding the effect of these changes, California is now considering new legislation that would limit pharmacy benefit managers’ ability to negotiate lower drug prices. Senate Bill 41 would eliminate one of the most effective tools pharmacy benefit managers have for controlling prescription costs, potentially devastating patients, who rely on the savings pharmacy benefit managers help secure and which employers and unions pass on. 
Rather than rushing to adopt additional restrictions, California lawmakers should take time to accurately assess the impact of this year’s transparency reforms. They should realize that effective cost controls require all parties of the health care system to work together.  
Over my career, I’ve watched countless patients rely on their pharmacists for help. Many patients have serious concerns about their prescriptions, including potential side effects. Patients deserve to focus on their health, not on whether they can afford their medication. California’s legislators must proceed carefully. If done improperly, additional pharmacy benefit restrictions could prevent patients from accessing the life-saving medications they need.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/092619_laclinica_AW_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-29 08:56:13.945050

Sonya Frausto is a pharmacist and owner of Ten Acres Pharmacy in Sacramento.


When I opened Ten Acres Pharmacy in Sacramento during the early months of the pandemic, I wasn’t thinking about profits or policy. I was thinking about people. Our community needed a trusted place to ask questions, get tested, vaccinated and feel cared for, especially when health care felt out of reach or overwhelming.
Just five years later, I closed my pharmacy. It kills me to say that it no longer made financial sense to keep serving patients. While rising costs and inflation certainly played a role, the driving factor is harder to explain and much more troubling.
As an independent pharmacy, we paid out-of-pocket to stock the essential medications our patients needed, with the understanding that we’d be reimbursed for our costs. Unfortunately, we were routinely reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers for less than what we paid — not just pennies less, but hundreds of dollars less.
I’ve taken $150 losses on a single prescription, and I’ve counted it a good day when I’ve made $1 on a $5 tube of cream. This is not a sustainable way to do business, nor is it a sustainable way to deliver care.
Independent pharmacies are closing across California and nationwide at an alarming rate. Chain pharmacies aren’t far behind. Rite Aid and Walgreens have both announced widespread closures, forcing more communities to become pharmacy deserts. Patients, particularly those in predominantly Black, Latino and rural neighborhoods, are being left behind. Lifelines are being cut.
If California doesn’t reform how pharmacy benefit managers operate, these powerful and largely unregulated middlemen will keep a chokehold on the way prescriptions are priced and reimbursed.
Pharmacy benefit managers dictate how much pharmacies are paid, which medications patients can access and whether community pharmacies can afford to stay open. Year after year, they’ve found new ways to cut costs on the backs of small pharmacies, while boosting their profits.
It’s not just me saying this. It has been proven time and again, including by the Federal Trade Commission. Meanwhile, my staff and I are left to explain to patients — people we’ve known for years — that we can’t fill their prescription because we’d lose too much money on it.
I didn’t open a pharmacy to turn people away, but that’s what pharmacy benefit managers are essentially forcing me to do. It’s heartbreaking and it’s wrong.
I’m urging Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Legislature to stand firmly behind Senate Bill 41. This bill would bring much-needed transparency to pharmacy benefit managers’ practices, stop their most exploitative reimbursement schemes and give community pharmacies a fighting chance.

When Newsom vetoed a similar bill last year, he said he believed pharmacy benefit managers must be held accountable but he wanted more data. We don’t need more data. We know what we need to do. The pharmacy benefits bill is our chance to get it right, and it couldn’t be more urgent.
If we don’t act now, the map of California’s pharmacies will keep losing pins.
Some may argue that the future of pharmacy is online, but I’ve seen firsthand what’s lost when care is outsourced to algorithms. The elderly patient who relies on us to explain her new blood pressure medication doesn’t take it as prescribed. The mom who walks in worried about side effects no longer feels reassured. The man picking up his first prescription for diabetes can’t talk through the next steps after a scary diagnosis.
These are not just patient-provider interactions; they are human moments. This is what health care looks like in a community. These pharmacies might be the only accessible option for people without a car, a computer or the time to wait for mail-order medication.
I shut my doors, but I’m speaking up in hopes that I can help prevent my peers from closing theirs. California has a chance to be a leader in protecting access, fairness and community-based care. The pharmacy bill is a necessary step. Our community pharmacies are counting on it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/112123_Medicine-Falvoring_FG_CM_09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-29 08:56:13.945050

Susie Lee's congressional district includes half of the Hoover Dam. (Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Amid tense negotiations over the Colorado River’s future, Nevada leaders came together Thursday to focus on the state’s strategy to meet the climate and drought crisis threatening Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam. 
Democratic Rep. Susie Lee, whose district falls within the boundaries of Lake Mead and half of the Hoover Dam, brought together regional water and hydropower leaders to highlight mounting needs the state faces during her third annual Southern Nevada Water Summit at the Springs Preserve.
Before water was piped from the Colorado River to Las Vegas, the burgeoning community relied entirely on groundwater from the Las Vegas Springs located on the site where the Springs Preserve now sits.
That water soon dried up after demand from the growing city depleted the aquifer. Now water managers are working to ensure Lake Mead – which provides nearly 90% of the city’s water – does not meet the same fate.
The summit comes at a critical time as states run against a mid-November deadline to reach a consensus on how the river and its reservoirs should be managed after current guidelines expire at the end of 2026. If states can’t reach a deal ahead of the deadline, the federal government will likely step in and make those decisions for them.
“The reality is it’s a really tough set of negotiations right now, so we’re meeting pretty regularly,” said Southern Nevada Water Authority Deputy General Manager Colby Pellegrino.
“There’s a lot of work that still needs to be done. We are nowhere close to agreement,” Pellegrino said.
Still, it’s an improvement from December when representatives from Lower Basin states — Nevada, Arizona, and California — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — left a major water summit in Las Vegas without even speaking to each other. 
Upper and Lower Basin states have largely quarreled over which portion of the basin should decrease its water use, and by how much.
States did come closer to a consensus after a breakthrough proposal in July to share the waterway based on the actual flow of the river, as opposed to projected flows and historical agreements. The proposal is still in play, said Pellegrino.
“I personally think it’s really good public policy for us to pursue something like that. It’s very responsive to current conditions. It does a decent job of creating some equity between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin,” Pellegrino said.
“But we’ve got a long way to go to see if we can agree on the details,” she continued.
Water flows in the Colorado River are shrinking due to climate change, and the reality of what that means for states reliant on the river is becoming more stark. 
Earlier this month, federal officials announced they would continue water allocation cuts on the Colorado River for the fifth consecutive year following a persistent drought that’s drained Lake Mead.
Lake Mead’s elevation is currently at about 1,054 feet above sea level – 175 feet below what’s considered full. Based on water storage, the reservoir is at 31% of capacity.
Nevada is ahead of the game when it comes to preparing for those reductions, said Pellegrino.
Nevada receives less than 2% of Colorado River water each year, the smallest share of any state in the basin. Those limitations have forced Nevada to become a conservation pioneer.
Southern Nevada hasn’t used its full allocation of Colorado River water for years. Conservation efforts have helped Southern Nevada use 36% less water from Lake Mead than it did two decades ago, according to the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA).
Even under the most severe water shortage, the Southern Nevada Water Authority would be able to access its share of the river thanks to major infrastructure projects, including Intake 3 — the ‘third straw’ — and the Low Lake Level Pumping Station.
“Our intake and our infrastructure allows us to deliver water to this valley even when water cannot be released from Hoover Dam,” Pellegrino said. 
Other water infrastructure projects in Nevada have been funded by the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, which allocated 10% of revenue derived from land sales to the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
To date, SNPLMA has generated more than $368 million to fund Nevada’s water priorities and infrastructure needs. Pellegrino said SNWA will continue leveraging that funding to support water conservation, infrastructure upgrades, long-term drought planning, and environmental restoration. 
Additional sources of federal funding have also been a major contributor to water conservation on the Colorado River, said Lee. 
The congresswoman highlighted the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $4 billion in investments for drought mitigation along the Colorado River Basin. She also highlighted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which provided $141 million for water conservation projects in Southern Nevada, including funding for the Las Vegas Wash, which carries millions of gallons of treated wastewater to Lake Mead.
That funding allowed California, Arizona and Nevada to collectively reduce water use by at least 3 million acre-feet through the end of 2026, stabilizing Lake Mead for several years. 
Another major issue created by lower water levels at Lake Mead is the loss of hydropower productivity. Hoover Dam generates half the power that it did in 2000 due to consistently lower water levels in Lake Mead.
If Lake Mead falls another 20 feet, Hoover Dam’s capacity to generate electricity would be slashed by 70% from its current level.
The break point for hydropower is 1,035 feet. At that level, 12 older turbines at Hoover that are not designed for low reservoir levels would be shut down. Only five newer turbines installed a decade ago would continue to generate power.
There is a way to fix the problem, said the Colorado River Commission of Nevada’s director of hydropower Gail Bates. 
Replacing the 12 older turbines would maintain power generation even at low levels, however it would require significant investment. 
“We’re really getting to the point where they’re urgently needed. Bad news is the cost. They cost about $8 million each to install. So it’s a very heavy investment,” Bates said. 
During the summit, Lee and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said they are working together to advance the Help Hoover Dam Act, a bill that would unlock some $50 million in stranded funding for the dam from an orphaned federal account.
The funds had been set aside for pension benefits for federal employees, but advocates for the bill say Congress funds pension benefits through other means and that the funds could be spent on dam upgrades if the Bureau of Reclamation was given the authority to do so.
“The dam is turning 100 years old in 2035 and the Bureau of Reclamation is estimating that it will require about $200 million in upgrades. This is money that’s just sitting there stranded. It would be so good to free that up so we can make those investments,” Cortez Masto said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC07694-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-29 08:56:13.945050

After that demonstration ended with a “peacekeeper” shooting and killing Afa Ah Loo, an innocent bystander, the city is changing its permitting application requirements. The change is meant “to support public safety, minimize impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, and further protect all individuals’ First Amendment rights,” according to a news release from the city.

“Our City is one where our right to free speech and peaceful assembly is both celebrated and encouraged,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said in a statement. “The permitting process is not about reviewing an organizer’s message or purpose — it’s a way for the City to better understand what will occur on its streets and in its public spaces. These updates will strengthen that process and give the City clearer information to support public safety.”
Starting in 2026, applicants for permits will have to answer additional security-related questions, in addition to providing a day-of-event point of contact and attesting to the truthfulness of the application, the release says. 
Under the new process, applicants expecting to have their own event security will also be required to submit a security plan in advance to allow for better coordination with the city’s police department. And, any false information provided in the application could result in criminal charges.
Utah50501, the group that organized the protest, has denied requesting that its volunteer security team carry weapons during the demonstration. After Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said the state’s Department of Public Safety warned organizers against using “peacekeepers” in the protest, the organization said Cox had been misinformed.



Let us know what you think...


 


“The organizers of Utah50501 are not aware of anyone having such a conversation with DPS in which they were ‘warned’ against having a volunteer safety team at events,” Utah 50501 organizers said in a July statement. “At no time did Utah50501 request or require any safety and de-escalation volunteers to carry weapons. No organizers in Utah50501 ever said to DPS, ‘we think it’s a good idea’ for our safety volunteers to carry weapons, and any claim to the contrary is false.”
According to the Salt Lake City Police Department, the shooting happened when two volunteer “peacekeepers” confronted 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa after seeing him openly carrying an AR-15-style rifle, which, according to the organization, made them believe “there was an imminent threat to the protesters.” 
One of the volunteers fired three shots with a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting Ah Loo, who was pronounced dead at a hospital.  
Both openly carrying weapons at protests and using force in self-defense are allowed under Utah law.

,California,2025-08-29 12:02:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why California backed down from forcing landlords to keep residents cool,Alejandra Reyes-Velarde,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2025/08/renter-protection-heat-cooling-standard/,"Lawmakers will again fail to set a safe indoor temperature standard for housing, as builders and tenant advocates battle over the cost of retrofits.","In summary
Lawmakers will again fail to set a safe indoor temperature standard for housing, as builders and tenant advocates battle over the cost of retrofits.


During the most recent heat wave in Los Angeles, Memphis Perez, his wife, three children and elderly mother crammed into a bedroom, the only room in their apartment with air conditioning. He paid for the air conditioner himself, but thinks his landlord should have provided one instead.
“It’s like being inside a toaster,” Perez said. Temperatures reached the upper nineties; it was sweltering for days. “It’s only fair for them to do their part and provide a survivable experience in an apartment,” he added. 
But it is unlikely the state Legislature will make that happen this year, despite a report from the California Department of Housing and Community Development recommending that the state set a maximum indoor temperature standard of 82 degrees for all homes.

Sen. Henry Stern, a Los Angeles Democrat, authored a bill that would make it a state policy that residents must be afforded comfortable temperatures in the dwellings they rent. The bill, however, was amended to remove any specific temperature goal. A second bill by Assemblymember Damon Connolly, a San Rafael Democrat, would have prohibited mobile home landlords from banning air conditioners. 
Both measures face a final hearing today, as they come out of suspense files. If they fail to pass today, they are dead for the year. 
The two proposals are the latest battlefronts in the ongoing conflict over how California adapts to climate-driven heat in homes. Housing and environmental advocates want the state to set a standard that will offer immediate relief, especially for low-income renters, who tend to live in older and less-efficient buildings.

Landlords argue that it’s not fair to force them them to pay the cost of upgrading existing buildings to solve a problem they didn’t cause. Their opposition has blocked action toward a policy in the past.  
“There’s a lack of political will, and also [the landlord groups] do hold a lot of influence,” said Jovana Morales-Tilgren, housing policy coordinator for Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability. “They have a lot of funding to, in not so many words, kill a bill. That really limits what advocates can do.”
Landlords “aren’t opposed” to rules – but still block them
Lawmakers tried before to address rising heat with a temperature-specific cooling standard for homes and apartments. 
In 2022, former assemblymember Richard Bloom tried to set rules mandating cooling standards for new and existing units. Stern was a co-author of the bill. 
Fighting the bill aggressively, the California Apartment Association spent $1.2 million, and the California Building Industry Association spent $1.6 million on lobbying overall that year. 
Both the apartment owners and the building association want more research and smaller steps toward upgrading decades-old housing stock, said Bob Raymer, a lobbyist who represents them. The groups also don’t want the full responsibility of paying for it. 
“Let me be clear. We’re not opposed to cooling standards,” Raymer said.  
But three years ago, Bloom and his co-authors amended the bill to request $5 million to have the state housing department study the potential for rules, incentives and other forms of relief. The apartment association and the building association opposed that, too. After the bill passed, they wrote a letter asking Gov. Gavin Newsom to veto the proposal.

That study resulted in the report that influenced Stern’s bill. He said he introduced a follow-up proposal he felt at the time might be easier to attain – one that only included a temperature standard for newly built housing. 
Renter advocates call the original language of Stern’s current bill misguided. New homes and apartments are built to more energy-efficient codes, so they have less of a cooling problem. 
That wouldn’t protect the low income renters who need cooling the most. 
“In conversations with (Stern) and his staff we were able to amend it to force the state to start looking at this in a broader way,” said Morales-Tilgren.
Stern acknowledged his amendment replaced a rule with a more aspirational policy. 
“I will concede it’s a little less pointed and heavy handed than past efforts,” Stern said. “But we thought it’s something we can pass this year.” 
Unlike 2022, the major apartment and building associations aren’t formally opposing Stern’s current bill. 
Debra Carlton, a spokesperson for the California Apartment Association, says the group “has been in conversations with the senator.” While apartment owners “understand the importance of addressing extreme heat, we think it feels unnecessary,” she said. 
The Southern California Rental Housing Association, however, is formally opposing Stern’s bill. Spokeswoman Molly Kirkland said the organization sees the bill as a potential precursor to a retrofit mandate, one that rental owners fear could lead to unexpected costs.  
“It’s not just putting in air conditioning or a cooler,” Kirkland said. “If it becomes a really substantial remodel as a result of the retrofit, then it could mean terminating tenancy to accomplish that.”  
Stern still wants a temperature-based cooling standard, and believes his bill will guide state policy in that direction. “These are the political realities of how big of a fight you want to pick with the landlord lobby right out the gate,” he added. 
Living in a crowded, old, and uninsulated Lincoln Heights apartment with his extended family, Perez is tired of waiting for help.
“The temperatures here in L.A. are rising every year,” he said.
Cost, complications and fairness
Protecting renters from heat would require a thorough statewide analysis of the housing stock and significant funding help for landlords, says Stephanie Pincetl, director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities at UCLA. 
Pincetl says it’s not really fair for a state policy to shift hold building owners responsible for upgrading old buildings to meet new state building codes.  
“Simply requiring landlords to make these buildings more thermally performing is kind of a cheap way to do this, relative to the responsibility of the state, which has only recently had better building codes,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation that has no easy answers at all.” 
Passing an indoor maximum temperature standard statewide would require installing cooling systems like heat pumps, or building upgrades like adding insulation or cool roofs. 
It could cost between $6,000 and $13,000 per unit to install heat pumps, not including upgrading electrical panels if it’s needed, said Maya Ofek, a research analyst with the UCLA Center for Sustainable Communities. 
“The point is people do need cooling, there’s no question,” Pincetl said. “But how you get there in a fair way is really tough.”  
Negotiating costs for a complicated solution 
As landlords, renters and the state tussle over who pays the cost of adaptation, experts agree the solution likely will include a mix of strategies. 
Advocates and landlords acknowledge that cooling all of California’s homes would be extremely expensive, and would require the state to offer financial incentives to make it possible. But facing a $20 billion state budget deficit, lawmakers may be hesitant to spend the money.
It could cost between $6,000 and $13,000 per unit to install heat pumps, not including electrical panel upgrades if needed, said Maya Ofek, a research analyst with the UCLA Center for Sustainable Communities. 
With the state’s help  through no interest loans, grants, or tax credits – landlords might be able to cool one room in every residential unit in the state, said Raymer, the lobbyist for the landlord and building groups. But requiring landlords to cool every building in the state without any help is unrealistic, he said. 
Stephanie Pincetl, director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities at UCLA, doesn’t have a position on Stern’s bill. But she agrees with Raymer on that last point. The state needs more data about the housing stock and energy efficient cooling to create a strong policy, she said. 
“Simply requiring landlords to make these buildings more thermally performing is kind of a cheap way to do this, relative to the responsibility of the state, which has only recently had better building codes,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation that has no easy answers at all.”
Locals lead, with the state left behind
Five years ago, during a brutal heat wave, Maria Serafin set up a portable air conditioner in her living room to cool her family. The next month, after a $500 electricity bill, she gave the air conditioner away; she’s a renter in an affordable housing community. She just has fans now. 
Serafin is one of the many Californians who overwhelmingly support setting a statewide cooling standard, according to a 2023 UC Berkeley poll.
In the absence of a statewide rule, cities and counties have begun to take action on residential heat problems. Two years ago, Palm Springs required property owners to provide cooling to maintain a maximum temperature of 80 degrees. 
Earlier this month Los Angeles County passed an ordinance requiring large landlords to maintain homes in unincorporated areas of the county at or below 82 degrees starting in 2027. Local leaders defied opposition from landlord associations, who made many of the same arguments they made to the state. 
Serafin lives in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Wilmington. L.A. has studied the possibility of requiring air conditioning in homes, but the city has no temperature-specific standard. Serafin said if city officials made such a rule, it would help. 
“It’s like hell,” she said. “My head hurts. I feel fatigued and anxious. I can’t cook or do housework, because I start to feel desperate and irritable.”
Stern said he hopes that local action builds momentum as the state tries to figure out its strategy. 
“There’s so many other things we’re dealing with: wildfire, utilities, oil, the cap and trade program,” Stern said. “This is the silent killer. And it always gets left behind.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Alabama legislators are exploring alternative methods of funding higher education months after making changes to the way K-12 funding is distributed.
The Joint House and Senate Education Committee met Thursday to learn more about a model that partly funds colleges and universities based on predetermined metrics decided by the Legislature in collaboration with institutions of higher education.
“I have heard for years from members, ‘We give the higher education colleges and universities all this money, and we get no say on the outputs or what happens, or what they are doing for our state,’” said Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur during the meeting. “Sometimes that may be a little bit of a knee-jerk comment, but I hear time and time again, ‘This is a way for the Legislature, working with the institutions, to better fit the needs of our state as defined by those elected here in the Legislature to help move our state down the road in a positive way.”
Lawmakers are examining whether the outcomes-based funding model could help address issues that are affecting workforce and career readiness issues, particularly the state’s decades-old struggles with workforce participation. Alabama’s rate is lower than the country’s and has been so since 1976. Some of the possible reasons include child care and transportation.
“We need to do things that are going to help increase that workforce,” said Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, who spoke with reporters after the meeting. “We have too many students graduating college who are leaving the state. We have a migration of students. We attract a lot of in-state students, but they go back and leave the state.”
Garrett also said that students in Alabama who are graduating from colleges and universities can pass their certification requirements for their chosen professions.
“We have a teacher shortage, and we have colleges of education who are graduating teachers who can’t pass the praxis,” Garrett said. Praxis is an assessment that graduates must pass to eventually receive their teaching license.
He also said that many of the degrees that students obtain do not fit with the needs of the state.
Will Carroll, managing director of strategic finance & student success for HCM Strategies, a consulting firm with offices in Texas and Colorado, said the approach aimed to ensure “the state is investing its dollars in a way that advances and aligns the state goals.”
“Maybe a state has a completion goal, so rewarding the completion of a degree is a way of making sure those dollars are paying for the success of students reaching that attainment goal,” he said.
States can use various models to fund their respective higher education institutions, from those that apply the prior year’s funding that is adjusted slightly, to others rooted in enrollment numbers or weighted enrollment.
Alabama uses a traditional model to fund its four-year institutions and applies a hybrid model that considers some measures of performance at the two-year colleges.
Using a funding model based on performance aligns investments by the state to the state’s priorities and incentives institutions of higher learning to focus on student success. However, if the metrics are not adjusted, it can reduce access for students who are less likely to succeed. The state must also provide the necessary resources so that colleges and universities can implement the programming needed to adhere to the metrics.
Carroll provided examples of possible metrics to meet workforce goals or increase the efficiency of the operations of the college or university. These could be benchmarks for the cost of operating or the cost of serving students.
The performance metrics could also target specific groups, such as students who are the first in their families to attend college or students who are veterans.
The Legislature also has the option to split the funding and provide colleges and universities with some to help with their operations expenses and an additional amount if they meet specific benchmarks that are tied to metrics.
Legislators are still considering which to use. Some want to focus on degrees that will provide the workforce with a set of skills companies require.
“The outcome-based funding will be what the market says,” Garrett said. “We are certainly not trying to undermine any of those programs because liberal arts programs are very important. In a well-rounded state, we want that, but, I think, at the end of the day, the market is going to drive that.”
Others cautioned against it.
“We can’t write off the other comments about art, and other areas,” said House Minority Leader Rep. Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, said to reporters after the meeting. “I know there are conversations that they don’t want to have publicly about liberal arts degrees. There is value in those degrees.”
Legislators are reviewing possible changes to funding higher education one year after they began to investigate alternative funding for K-12 education using a similar process, which, in the end, led to the RAISE Act.
“As the State of Alabama begins the process of understanding outcomes-based funding for higher education, the Higher Education Partnership welcomes the chance to share the multitude of exciting, difference -making stories of the impact of public universities,” said Gordon Stone, executive director of the Higher Education Partnership, an advocacy organization representing students, faculty, staff, alumni at Alabama’s public universities.
Alabama Commission on Higher Education Executive Director Jim Purcell called the meeting informative.
“The key will be to develop a performance funding rubric that encourages institutions to meet the state’s educational needs while not inadvertently penalizing those whose mission is to serve at-risk students,” he said in a statement after the meeting.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Danny-Garrett-April-24-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-29 08:56:13.945050

Hoskins is currently facing two lawsuits alleging he crafted deceptive ballot language for public-education initiative petitions (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Two initiative petition campaigns seeking constitutional protections for public education are suing Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins alleging he crafted “deceptive and prejudicial” summaries that will appear on the ballot.
One campaign, called “the Missouri Right to Education Initiative,” hopes to amend the state constitution to declare education a “fundamental right.”
The other, filed by an attorney with the public education law firm EdCounsel, would amend the constitution to prohibit public funding of nonpublic schools except for when it benefits disabled students. It also would label new charter schools as nonpublic.
Both believe Hoskins’ summaries were written to deceive voters and sink their chances on the ballot next year.
“It is so far away from what we proposed that it really seems like they went to great lengths to try to bring something into the conversation that is not part of this amendment,” Spencer Toder, treasurer of the Missouri Right to Education Initiative, told The Independent.
Hoskins’ office did not respond to a request for comment.
In addition to declaring education a “fundamental right,” Toder’s  proposed amendment would require state lawmakers to maintain “adequate, thorough and uniform high quality free public schools.”
The summary from the Secretary of State’s Office describes the initiative as an attempt to dismantle the state’s private-school voucher program. It specifically says the initiative petition would “eliminate existing state scholarship programs that provide direct aid to students with disabilities and low-income families” and “prevent the State from supporting educational choices other than free public schools.”
Toder says the petition doesn’t touch the state’s private school scholarship program, MOScholars.
“Our intent is not to get involved in the voucher dialog. It is to ensure that no matter if vouchers exist, it doesn’t come at the expense of public school students’ quality of education,” he said. “All (the amendment) says is that the students have a guaranteed right to a quality public education.”
The second initiative petition does train its sights on MOScholars.
“We’re watching the statewide elected officials from Missouri slowly dismantle public schools, this public school system that Missourians have built,” Duane Martin, a public education attorney who filed the initiative petition, told The Independent.
Hoskins’ summary describes the proposed amendment as “eliminating existing programs that provide direct aid to students with special education needs.” 
“It did not look to me like they had carefully read the initiative petition because some of what they summarized is the exact opposite of the language of the initiative petition itself,” Martin said.
Both campaigns are hoping to get on the ballot in 2026 and are in the early stages of organizing.
“I’m optimistic that a judge will look at this and see that some of the false statements that are made by the Secretary of State’s office can be corrected pretty readily,” Martin said.
Both Martin and Toder said they have not had contact with the Secretary of State’s Office other than receiving their petitions’ certification letters and serving the office with the lawsuit.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/032625_RighttoLifeHoskins-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-08-29 08:56:13.945050
,California,2025-08-29 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Nine years later, California court saga over $23,420 housing fee remains unsettled",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/housing-impact-fee-legal-dispute/,George Sheetz could never have imagined a routine administrative transaction levied on a home-building project would turn into a legal dispute that reached the U.S. Supreme Court and remains unresolved almost a decade later.,"Nine years ago, in preparation for his retirement, engineer George Sheetz bought a plot of rural land in El Dorado County and applied for a county permit to place a manufactured home on his parcel.
Little did he know that what he thought would be a routine administrative transaction would turn into a legal dispute that would wind its laborious way through California courts, reach the U.S. Supreme Court — where he won a unanimous ruling — and is now back in California’s judicial system with the eventual outcome still uncertain.
El Dorado County was willing to give Sheetz his permit but only if he paid a $23,420 fee to offset the home’s supposed traffic effects along county roads and Highway 50. The levy resulted from a general plan adopted by county supervisors in 2004 and amended two years later to impose a “traffic mitigation fee” as a condition for receiving a building permit.
Sheetz paid the fee under protest but sued the county, contending that it violated the state’s Mitigation Fee Act, which requires that such fees have reasonable relationships to both the proposed development and its impact on public facilities, such as roadways. He also alleged that the fee violated U.S. Supreme Court rulings on property issues, declaring that excessive fees can be a form of extortion.
Sheetz lost in the trial court, which said the laws and rulings governing mitigation fees didn’t apply when they are enacted by legislative action, such as the El Dorado County’s traffic fee. In 2022, a three-member state appellate court panel unanimously agreed that the fees were legally valid. The state Supreme Court declined to take the case.
Sheetz’s attorneys and the Pacific Legal Foundation, a Sacramento organization that specializes in property rights issues, among other things, took his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Last year, it unanimously rejected lower courts’ contentions that legislatively imposed fees are exempt from the Mitigation Fee Act and earlier Supreme Court rulings.
“There is no basis for affording property rights less protection in the hands of legislators than administrators,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote in the decision, referring to the Fifth Amendment prohibiting arbitrary “takings” of property. “The Takings Clause applies equally to both — which means that it prohibits legislatures and agencies alike from imposing unconstitutional conditions on land-use permits.”
Pacific Legal Foundation hailed the ruling as closing a loophole through which governments, claiming an exemption for legislative acts, could impose fees without restriction.
“The government’s fee was nothing more than an exorbitant ransom to pay for permission to build a small, manufactured home,” the foundation said at the time. “It unfairly imposed costs that had nothing to do with his project.”
One might think that a unanimous decision by an often-divided Supreme Court might have settled the issue, but it didn’t.
While the Supreme Court rejected the California appellate court’s decision, it sent the case back down for “further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.” That opened the door for the state appellate court to have another go.
Last month, it grudgingly acknowledged the Supreme Court ruling that legislatively imposed fees are not exempt from scrutiny, “contrary to settled California law.” However, it declared that the fee imposed on Sheetz “is not an unconstitutional condition imposed on land use in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s takings clause. Accordingly, we again affirm the judgment.”
In other words, the case is back where it started nearly a decade ago with the $23,420 traffic mitigation fee being upheld by three state court judgments, notwithstanding what the U.S. Supreme Court declared.

Currently, a judge may grant youthful offender status after an investigation to defendants who are younger than 21 years old and charged with crimes that are either considered crimes of moral turpitude or those that can lead to incarceration for at least a year, according to the legislation.
Afterward, the defendant can then be charged as a youthful offender and are subject to lighter penalties than adults charged with the same crimes.
Pettus’ bill would require any defendant over the age of 16 charged with murder or capital murder to be tried as an adult. A person could apply for youthful offender status if the charge was reduced.
Pettus introduced the bill in 2024 and 2025. The House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee passed his measure in February despite strong objections from Democrats on the committee. The House of Representatives then approved it one month later, but the legislation stalled in the Senate and was not enacted.
Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform organization, said that most crimes in the state go unsolved, and addressing that would enhance public safety more than the harshness of the punishment.
“This legislation seems to envision sending younger and younger people into Alabama’s dangerous, drug-infested prisons, where more than 100 homicides have occurred in the last few years. Alabama’s youth deserve better than this,” she said in a statement.

“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”

Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.

Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.

‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) and her fellow Democratic House representatives are calling on EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to reinstate more than $7 billion in terminated grants.
The Solar For All program was established under former President Joe Biden through funding in the Inflation Reduction Act. The effort was intended to help lower energy bills for low-income households by providing them with access to solar energy. 
While Michigan was obligated $156 million for its own solar for all program, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the federal Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which included Solar For All funding. Zeldin later announced the end of the program in a social media post, saying the agency no longer had the statutory authority to administer the program, nor the funds to keep it alive.

In the letter to Zeldin, Scholten, alongside Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City), Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) noted the program’s intent in lowering energy costs for families burdened by energy costs and its support for jobs in renewable energy.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The Solar for All program is nowhere more important than in Michigan, where average residential electricity rates are among the highest in the Midwest and the nation.…With this federal investment, Michigan sought to reduce costs for an estimated 16,300 low-income households, providing an average benefit equivalent to a 20% reduction on residential electric bills, or around $400 per family per year,” the representatives wrote. 
Without this funding, Michiganders could be saddled with increased energy costs and stifled economic development, they warned. 
“The urgency and need for savings from Solar for All projects are clear. We stand ready to work with the EPA and the Trump Administration to reverse these terminations and ensure that Michiganders can benefit from lower utility costs, continued economic development, and heightened energy resilience,” the representatives wrote. 
Michigan had already announced $13.9 million in awards to 13 pilot projects across the state, including projects in Berrien, Chippewa, Delta, Kent, Oakland, Ottawa, Washtenaw, Wayne and Wexford counties. The future of those projects remains uncertain, though Phil Roos, director of the Michigan Department of  Environment Great Lakes and Energy, said the department is  working with Attorney General Dana Nessel to determine the next steps. 
EGLE’s Director of Communications, Dale George, told the Michigan Advance in an email Thursday that the department had notified staff and contractor groups to stop work on issuing awards and asked awardees to cease work on drafting grant agreements as EGLE consults with the attorney general.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8734-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-29 07:56:22.138296

Not only has Scott failed to condemn the outrageous excesses of the federal administration, but he has also readily acquiesced.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Larry Satcowitz: An open letter urging Gov. Phil Scott to stand up to the Trump administration.","This commentary is by Larry Satcowitz, of Randolph. He is a Democrat representing the Orange-Washington-Addison District in the Vermont House of Representatives and is the ranking member of the House Environment Committee.


Every day I look at the headlines with a sense of dread. Every day, it seems, the oligarchs and authoritarians gain a bit more control of our country. 
As I was writing this commentary earlier this month, President Donald Trump ordered the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and threatened to do the same to other major U.S. cities. It was just one of a long string of abuses of his power as president. 
It is hard to overstate how unprecedented and dangerous our situation is, and it is horrifying to think that they are just getting started. Resistance right now is critical. 
In Vermont, our resistance ought to be led, at least in part, by Gov. Phil Scott. Our governor, however, has done little to resist the bully in Washington. Not only has he failed to condemn the outrageous excesses of the federal administration, but he has also readily acquiesced. 
In winter, while hundreds of Vermonters protested, he welcomed JD Vance to the state. In April he rejected a call from Vermont state senators to cancel contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies that have been illegally snatching people off the streets. 
Last month, his administration failed to provide evidence to the courts that would have allowed Vermont to obtain funds which had already been committed to help us with our electric vehicle charging infrastructure, undermining the efforts of our attorney general.  
Earlier this month Scott met with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, who I think is doing everything he can to undermine the rules and laws that keep our nation’s environment clean and safe. Shortly after the visit, Zeldin canceled $62.5 million of already appropriated funding that would have helped low-income Vermonters get energy from solar power projects. 
A few days later, and perhaps most egregiously, Scott saw fit to release the personal information of more than 140,000 Vermonters to a federal government that has no legitimate purpose for it. Governors of other states rejected the demand for this information, but our governor capitulated. 
Again, the Trump administration is just getting started. There will be more assaults on our liberty and civil institutions. How many more times will Scott disregard Vermonters’ values, safety, livelihood and privacy in favor of taking the easy path?
As we all know, appeasing bullies gives them more power. Our governor either does not understand this or supports Trump’s actions. Either way, he’s dramatically failing us. We need to stand up to the cruel, inept and corrupt administration in Washington. Instead, he’s helping to pave the way for its continued consolidation of power. 
Scott is only part of the way through his current term. He still has plenty of time to join other Vermont leaders in resisting Trump. I urge him to do so.

Map courtesy of the Indiana Secretary of State's Office. Illustration by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)I’m on my third decade covering the Indiana General Assembly, so I’ve seen a lot. But a mid-cycle redistricting will be a new one.
I say “will” because it seems like an inevitability at this point. So, I researched the history of apportionment and redistricting in Indiana.
What I found is that the partisan fights about gerrymandering are as old as Indiana.

The 1825-26 apportionment “embroiled lawmakers in a bitter struggle even though members had not yet divided into political parties,” according to the Centennial History of the General Assembly, 1816 to 1978.
In 1832, residents of Cass County complained because they were placed in the sixth congressional district, composed of Marion and surrounding counties in the central part of the state, even though Cass was separated from the rest of the district by the Miami Reservation. This made Cass the only county that did not enjoy contiguity with its district.
A Whig newspaper warned early in 1845 that if the opposition won a majority, the state would be “gerrymandered in all unseemly shapes, without, the least regard to equality.”
In 1879, one representative suggested dividing the state into equally populated districts without regard to politics. His motion was tabled.

We should all be glad we don’t live in the early days of statehood, when the population was growing rapidly and new counties were created regularly. Double districts and floterial districts were downright crazy.
The cycle of counting people and drawing boundaries was originally every five years. The Constitution of 1851 changed redistricting and apportionment to every sixth year.
Bolting
Bolting — or leaving the state to break quorum — was a regular feature.
In 1861, Republicans introduced a congressional districting bill and Democrats walked out.
“The bolters typified the cavalier attitude of both parties,” the centennial history book said.
GOP legislative leaders break redistricting silence as opponents deliver signature-backed petition

“I saw them pretty nearly all in a batch, and the answer was ‘tell them to go to hell,’” said the Republican doorkeeper who tracked down the absentees. The bill was dropped.
In 1871, Democrats tried to redistrict early, and 34 Republicans resigned to prevent a quorum.
“The most spectacular party bolt” occurred in 1925. Republicans had huge majorities in both chambers, so Senate Democrats took a bus to Ohio.
“For the next two days, U.S. 40 between Indianapolis and Dayton was jammed with process servers and Republican politicos trying to coax, cajole, or coerce the fugitives back to their seats in the Indiana Senate,” the history book shows.
Eventually, the Ku Klux Klan’s Grand Dragon, D.C. Stephenson, went to Ohio to break the deadlock.
Sometimes the redistricting happened after new counts. At other times, the General Assembly skipped it for years, especially if the party in control liked the districts as they were.
Maps were found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court multiple times.
Modern times have been more a little more orderly — but not always neutral. Lawmakers have only redistricted after the decennial census, though Republicans did briefly try a mid-decade maneuver in 1995 before abandoning it.
“The most successful exercise so far in all-out partisanship occurred in Indiana,” The New York Times wrote in 1981.
“Republicans used their majorities in both State Houses, the governorship and the computers of Market Opinion Research, a Detroit company that works for Republican districting efforts, to take maximum advantage of the shrinkage of the Indiana delegation to 10 members from 11,” the paper continued. “As a result, a delegation that now has six Democrats and five Republicans could easily become one with seven Republicans and three Democrats.”
Even when Democrats controlled the Indiana House in 1991 and 2001, Republicans controlled the Senate, so the affair had to be bipartisan. The GOP has had complete control of apportionment and redistricting after the last two census counts in 2011 and 2021.
Nothing is forever
Remember — though the current use of algorithms and computer programs is much harder to overcome — that ultimately, voters still decide.
“The history of state apportionment and congressional redistricting shows clearly that partisanship was the foremost consideration at each session where such laws passed. Gerrymandering by the majority always governed the drawing of district boundaries in the congressional elections between 1890 and 1930 illustrate both the efficacy and danger of the device for party advantage,” the history book said.

In 1892, Democrats elected 12 of 13 congressmen with only 41.1% of the vote due to the Democratic districting act of 1891. But under the same bill in 1894 Republicans elected 11 congressmen.
Under the Republican act of 1901, however, Democrats elected 11 and 12 congressmen respectively in 1908 and 1910. Democrats remained almost totally dominant in 1912 and 1914 under the redistricting act of 1911 but in 1916 Republicans began 14 years of dominance under the same bill.
“So, while both parties succeeded in making districts safe for themselves temporarily, in the long run popular sentiment prevailed, proving that in Indiana, there was no such thing as a gerrymander in perpetuity.”

The map was approved by a federal judge on Friday, March 15.A controversial, court-ordered redrawing of Washington’s political maps has survived another round in a lengthy legal fight. 
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this week that the revised legislative district maps, which sought to enhance the political voice of Latino voters in the Yakima Valley, “did not discriminate on the basis of race.” 
In a 31-page decision issued Wednesday, the panel of three circuit judges affirmed the process followed by a lower court in penning new boundaries in central Washington, rejecting a Republican-led challenge to erase the lines and start over.
“The district court’s thoughtful attention to the details of the maps, population and voter numbers, and viable alternatives does not furnish evidence of racial predominance. Instead, it confirms that race was not the predominant factor in shaping the map,” Judge Margaret McKeown wrote in the opinion.
Wednesday’s ruling likely ensures the reworked contours of several legislative districts will remain in place for next year’s elections.
But it is unclear if it will end the legal battle, as lawyers for those seeking to overturn the maps could not be reached for comment.
Meanwhile, an attorney for Latino voters whose lawsuit forced the redrawing applauded the outcome.
The decision assures Yakima Valley’s Latino voters can “elect state legislators who best serve their community” and makes clear protections provided in the federal Voting Rights Act “should not be undermined by third parties with no skin in the game,” Simone Leeper, senior legal counsel for redistricting at Campaign Legal Center, said on Thursday. 
“This victory is the result not just of this case but of decades of work by this community to secure their right to fair representation,” she said.
The state attorney general’s office, which did not defend the boundaries adopted by the Legislature or contest the judicially-redrawn map, was pleased with the outcome.
“We appreciate the court’s careful consideration of this matter,” a spokesman for Washington Attorney General Nick Brown wrote in an email. “We believe that the map ordered by the district court and used in the 2024 statewide election remedies the Voting Rights Act violation while respecting the rights of all Washington voters. We are glad to see the Ninth Circuit has agreed.”
A four-year tussle
The fight centers on a lawsuit filed by Latino voters, arguing the 15th Legislative District borders adopted by the state’s bipartisan Redistricting Commission and approved by the Washington Legislature in early 2022.
The lawsuit contended the final map violated the federal Voting Rights Act because it impaired the ability of Latino voters to participate equally in elections. The case included a trial in June 2022 featuring testimony from commissioners and voting experts.
Plaintiffs argued that while Latinos were a slight majority of the district’s voters, the final contours included areas where their turnout is historically lower and excluded communities where Latinos are more politically active. 
This fracturing can depress Latino turnout and weaken their voting strength, they argued.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert Lasnik agreed, ruling in August 2023 that the configuration of the district diluted the Latino vote. In early 2024, Lasnik approved a new district map covering communities from East Yakima to Pasco and including Wapato, Toppenish, Grainger and Sunnyside. Nearly all of the historic lands of the Yakama Nation Reservation are in the district.
As part of the solution, he renumbered the 15th district as 14th, ensuring legislative positions, including the state Senate seat, were on ballots in presidential election years starting that year. 
Plaintiffs argued that the Latino community will have a better chance to elect a candidate of their choosing in these years because that is when turnout of Latino voters is historically higher. Last November, in the first election in the redrawn district, Republican candidates won all three legislative seats.
Three registered voters — Jose Trevino, state Rep. Alex Ybarra, R-Quincy, and Ismael Campos were allowed to enter the case as intervenors. 
They argued race was given too much weight in the drawing of boundaries and that the map should be redrawn with a focus on compactness and communities of interest. They also contended that the appeals court, not Lasnik, should have handled the original challenge.
A decision in three parts
The appeals court dismissed the argument that the case started out in the wrong court. 
Intervenors also argued that they suffered harm as a result of the new map. On this point, the court first had to decide if each one had standing to make the argument. Judges decided one did and two didn’t.
Trevino could because he is the only one who lived in the old 15th district and wound up in the newly drawn 14th. However, they said he would not see his vote diluted “merely because he is Hispanic and will now vote alongside fewer Hispanics.”
But for the three Intervenors, the primary target was the map approved by Lasnik. They asserted it is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. To prove that, they had to show that race was the predominant factor in Lasnik’s decision on where to draw the lines.
The appeals court judges said there was no evidence that this was the case and, as McKeown wrote, that nothing in the court record “supports a claim that race predominated in the redistricting process.”.
Opponents also argued that too many Washingtonians were moved into new districts, that the new partisan composition favors Democrats, and that incumbents were harmed as a result. 
Lasnik redrew boundaries for 13 legislative districts across 12 counties in central and southwest Washington, and the Puget Sound region. More than 500,000 voters wound up in new districts, state election officials said. Five Republican legislators found themselves in new districts while no Democratic lawmakers were displaced.
Judges said those arguments “are objections based on partisanship, not race,” and not relevant.

(Getty Images)Some Hoosiers are sounding the alarm about what could be a harsh COVID-19 and flu season — particularly following a significant change in federal vaccine rules this week.
“Many people are going to encounter barriers in getting a COVID shot,” said Indiana Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany. “That is unfortunate and likely to to make things worse as we get into the fall and winter.”
 He was clear that he doesn’t support mandates.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday rescinded the Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines and issued marketing authorization focused on “high-risk” Americans. Patients must consult with doctors before being able to get vaccinated.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an avowed anti-vaccine activist, spearheaded the changes.
“People who wish to receive a vaccine should continue to have easy access … That’s in everyone’s interest,” Clere added.

RFK promised- under oath- that anyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one. Now he says you can only get one if your doctor says so. To be frank and objective, unless he’s also giving everyone access to free healthcare, he seems to be reneging on his promise.
— Jerome Adams (@JeromeAdamsMD) August 27, 2025

The virus’ presence in Indiana wastewater has already spiked in recent weeks, according to the state’s wastewater dashboard.
“Wastewater testing is useful in understanding the spread of COVID-19 since it does not depend on people heaving access to health care, seeking health care when sick or getting tested for COVID-19,” the dashboard notes.
Former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams — also previously Indiana’s top health official — posted on X that he’s “deeply concerned about the new FDA move limiting COVID vaccines only to ‘high-risk groups.’ CDC data shows those 50+ face rising risks, with 65+ at up to 340x higher death risk. Add in those with chronic disease and 71% of U.S. adults are at elevated risk!”
People who aren’t considered “high-risk” can still experience severe illness and “deserve the chance to protect yourself,” he added.
Adams served as surgeon general during President Donald Trump’s first administration. As head of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps., he was among the country’s top public health spokespeople. Before his appointment, he was Indiana’s health commissioner.
He remarked that many Americans don’t have insurance or access to doctors.
“RFK promised — under oath — that anyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one. Now he says you can only get one if your doctor says so,” Powell wrote. “To be frank and objective, unless he’s also giving everyone access to free healthcare, he seems to be reneging on his promise.” 
State approach
Indiana also has a shortage of health care providers, Clere observed.
He tested positive for the virus two weeks ago. The experience was “relatively mild” but “very unpleasant,” with chills, congestion, a fever and irregular heartbeats.
“It remains a scary disease, and that’s why we need to continue to take it very seriously,” Clere said.

He described a “disconnect” and a “complete lack of awareness campaigns” from state and federal sources.
Indiana’s main vaccine webpage still refers to last year’s COVID-19 vaccine formulation, as well as the now-rescinded Emergency Use Authorizations.
Asked if the Indiana Department of Health would recommend any vaccines, spokeswoman Greta Sanderson said the agency “will send communication about staying healthy during the respiratory illness season” with a focus on preventative measures.
“That includes talking to your provider about what vaccines are recommended for you based (on) your individual risk factors and practicing the three ‘C’s of covering a cough; cleaning and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces; and containing the spread of the virus by staying home when you’re sick.”
She didn’t detail when or where those communications would be released.
“While I was down with COVID, I was … trying to make sure I was up to date on the isolation protocol, because I wanted to … make sure I wasn’t exposing other people,” Clere said. His online searches turned up “scant and conflicting information.”

Fewer than half of Minnesota public school students are meeting grade-level expectations on math and reading exams given in May — 43% in math and 48% in reading, staying roughly the same from 2023 and 2024.
The data comes from the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments, exams given to students in grades 3-8 in reading and math, with additional reading and math exams in grades 10 and 11.


This year’s results show students have yet to recover from the pandemic’s profound interruptions to learning in the form of school closures and remote classes. Proficiency rates this year are 10 percentage points lower than they were in 2019, the last year for state assessments before the pandemic closed schools, when 54% of students were proficient in math and 58% in reading.
Wide gaps in proficiency persist between white students and students of other races and ethnicities. While about 52% of white students in Minnesota met grade level standards in math, just 21% of Black students reached grade level proficiency, for example. Similarly large gaps exist in reading proficiency.




Test scores are stagnant despite nearly $2 billion in federal pandemic aid that Minnesota districts could spend between 2020 and 2024, plus historically large increases in state education funding in recent years.
On the bright side, slightly more students are consistently attending school. In the 2023-24 school year, 75.5% of students attended at least 90% of school days, up 1 percentage point from the 2022-23 school year. Minnesota reports attendance data on a one year lag so the 2024-25 data won’t be available until next year.
In the 2024-25 school year, the state allocated $5 million in the 2024-25 school year to 12 districts to pilot programs to combat chronic absenteeism. No additional funding for the program was included in the biannual state budget approved in June.
The state is in the midst of a multi-year effort to transform the way students are taught to read through improved teacher training and evidence-based reading curriculum. The state does not expect those efforts to improve test scores until some point in the future.
Education Commissioner Willie Jett said the state’s investments in universal free meals are also part of investments in education that the state expects to lead to improved outcomes for students in the future.
“While standardized test scores are valuable for measuring progress, they are just one piece of the puzzle. True success is seen in the resilience, creativity, and critical thinking our students show every day,” Jett said.

State won two games last season. USM won one. Neither won a conference game.
The good news: Somebody has to win this one.
Oddsmakers believe State is the likely victor, installing the Bulldogs as 13.5-point favorites. That seems about right. In this era of NIL and the wide-open transfer portal, the college game has become all about the dollars. From all reports, State likely spends at least 10-fold what USM spends on its football payroll, a word I hate to use in college football but it is what it is.
Nevertheless, this is an intriguing way to start the football season. We’ve got two in-state rivals who used to play every season but now get together much less frequently. We’ve got two teams with totally revamped rosters. Even the most diehard of Bulldog and Golden Eagle fans will need a program to know who is who.
Only one NCAA Division I team brought in more transfers than Southern Miss, and that was Marshall, which had to do so, mostly because Charles Huff, the new USM coach, brought so many of his Thundering Herd players with him from Marshall. Perhaps, this season, they should be called the Thundering Eagles. At last count, USM’s roster includes a whopping 63 transfers in all, 21 from Marshall.
Four of the USM transfers came from Mississippi State, including running back Jeffery Pittman and linebacker Avery Sledge, who were Bulldogs the last time these two teams played. In fact, Pittman ran 10 times for 98 yards and a huge touchdown against USM on Nov. 18, 2023, in Starkville. The final score was 41-20, but USM had closed the gap to 26-20 in the fourth quarter when Pittman took off on a 59-yard dash to the end zone to pretty much seal the deal.
At last count, Jeff Lebby and State lead the SEC in portal transfers this year with 37, including several highly rated defensive linemen and linebackers expected to plug the many holes in last season’s porous defense. We shall see.
State leads the series with USM 18-12-1, having won the last six meetings. Older fans will remember a time when the Golden Eagles were every bit as dominant if not more, winning seven straight between 1977 and 1983 and 10 of 12 between ’77 and ’88. 
None of those games – before or after – was more meaningful than the 1981 game played at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium before a equally divided crowd of more than 64,000. State was ranked No. 15 in the country. USM was ranked No. 20 and about to zoom higher. There was serious talent on display on both sides of the field. There was some violent hitting. Orley Hood, the Mark Twain of Mississippi journalism, later referred to it as the “limp off game” because so many players on both teams had to be helped off the field.
Emory Bellard’s Bulldogs included the late, great linebacker Johnie Cooks, who would be the second pick of the 1982 draft and who would knock you into next week. Glen Collins, another first round pick, anchored the defensive line that also included Tyrone Keys on one end and the great Billy Jackson on the other. Kent Hull, one of the great centers in football history, blocked for Michael Haddix, still another first rounder. Two-time All-SEC wide receiver Mardye McDole was another remarkable talent, the first receiver in MSU history to account for 1,000 yards receiving in a single season. And there were more. Said Reggie Collier, the truly great Southern Miss quarterback, “I have never been hit so hard in my life as I was in that game. I thought they were going to kill me.”
The Southern Miss offense featured Collier – who was Lamar Jackson before Lamar Jackson existed – and future NFL stars Sammy Winder and Louis Lipps. Defensively, nose tackle Jearld Baylis dominated the line of scrimmage on a line that also included future NFL star Richard Byrd and under-sized sack specialists Rhett Whitley and George Tillman on the ends. 
Southern Miss, in a defensive struggle, prevailed by a final score of 7-6. That Southern Miss team tied Bear Bryant’s sixth-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide 13-13 earlier in the season. They ransacked Bobby Bowden and Florida State 58-14 the week after the State game. They would rise to No. 8 in the nation at one point.
It’s difficult to imagine Saturday’s State-USM matchup will equal that one for brutality or significance, but it is interesting nonetheless. And, as previously noted, somebody who really needs a victory is going to win.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28125335/AP23322769880696.jpeg,,,2025-08-29 07:56:22.138296

Alex Wong/Getty ImagesAs a scholar who studies media coverage of gun violence, my first thought upon hearing the horrifying news of the mass shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis wasn’t shock. 
After all, as Americans, these shootings make up the background radiation of our lives. It wasn’t even a pang of fear for the safety of my own school-aged kids, although surely any Minnesotan with a beating heart read about this brutal attack on innocent children with a heavy, fearful weight in our chests.
No. It was: “How is the far-right outrage machine going to hastily pivot away from gun policy this time?” 
Over 25 years ago, in 1999, the Columbine school shooting horrified and captivated the nation. Cable news coverage of the Columbine shooting is credited with inventing the term “mass shooting” — and many of the now-familiar tropes and myths that accompany it. 
The mass shooters at Columbine obtained their guns using the American gun show loophole, which allows private citizens to sell guns to buyers on the spot with no background check. But did media coverage of this attack lay the blame on this unusually permissive American gun policy? No. Instead, we scapegoated bullying, violent video games, and even the music of Marilyn Manson, although it later became clear that the two shooters were not bullied — they, unsurprisingly, were bullies. 
Twelve years later, in Tucson, a local man opened fire at an event for U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. The shooter legally bought a Glock 19 after passing a background check, despite a significant personal history of mental instability. Again, did we grapple with the enormous holes in our federal gun policy that allow even men with documented histories of threats, violence and delusion to access deadly weapons? No, this time, inexplicably, we pivoted to blaming incivility in American politics.
It doesn’t matter the year or the context — we’ll blame anything but guns. After the Newtown and Virginia Tech shootings, we blamed the abysmal mental health of the shooters. But people experiencing mental illness are actually far more likely to become victims of violence than perpetrators. Further, while every country on the planet is home to people with mental illness, the United States is the only county in the world that experiences near-constant mass shootings. 
This time? Right on cue, a ready-made hook for the screeching hatred and bleating ignorance of the Trump era — this time, apparently, we’re blaming the fact that the shooter was transgender. Mass shootings carried out by transgender shooters are about as common as mass shootings carried out by women, which is to say they are rare, comprising less than 2% of all mass shooters. Meanwhile, the cisgender, white, and most crucially, male identity of thousands of other mass shooters is ignored, forgotten or unnoticed in most media coverage.
The mass shooting phenomenon in the United States stem from a crisis of both masculinity and gun policy. These two facts are inescapable.
Personally? I don’t care what motivates mass shooters. It doesn’t matter if they’re motivated by far-right white nationalism, QAnon, radical Islam, delusion, sexism or revenge. Without access to guns, these motives won’t result in mass shootings; it’s that simple. Further, giving these murderers a platform to explain or justify their actions, even posthumously, only inspires other young, radicalized men to seek infamy in exactly the same way. 
The solution is twofold: stop sensationalizing and glamorizing these crimes in the media, and — most crucially — change the law to significantly overhaul access to guns so that no other parent ever loses their beloved child at school or church again. 
The U.S. can look to the example of other countries to determine what works to reduce this risk. 
In 1996, shootings a month apart in Scotland and Australia prompted sweeping sets of gun reforms in those countries, including buyback programs, increased background checks, and new bans on previously legal weapons. 
In comparison to the hundreds (conservatively) of mass shootings that have taken place in the U.S. in the years since 1996, there has been only one mass shooting in the U.K. during that period, and zero in Australia. Following the gun buyback program in Australia, the rate of gun suicides dropped 65% in the decade after the reforms, while gun-related homicides decreased 59%, according to a 2010 study. And in the U.K., every year but one since has seen successive drops in the rates of gun crimes.

A server at a Springfield-area restaurant, the single mother of four finally has a job allowing her to financially support her family. But if she or one of her children falls ill, that financial security goes out the window. 
“When you miss a shift, that’s a big deal,” she said. “You lose that money and that could be an entire bill.”
That’s one of the myriad reasons she was among the 58% of Missouri voters last year who supported Proposition A, an initiative petition that vastly expanded access to paid sick leave. 
Workers across the state began accruing the new paid sick leave benefits in May. 
“It was a huge relief to know that there was going to be that cushion,” she said, “and that protection.”
But it all came to an end Thursday. 
That’s when the Republican-backed repeal of the law — passed in May and signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe in July — officially went into effect.
“It’s just sickening and insulting to every worker in our state,” Phillips said of the repeal. 
The repeal has set off an avalanche of reactions, with activists pondering another ballot push next year to place the paid sick leave law in the state constitution. Others are pushing a constitutional amendment limiting the legislature’s power to overturn the will of the voters. 
Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers may try to get out in front of any response with legislation making it harder for voters to amend the state constitution. 
“This has shown Missourians just how out of touch our legislature is with the way the economy works for most families and their vision of how democracy should work in this state,” said Richard Von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the campaign for the paid sick leave law. 
“And so it’s made it pretty clear to most Missourians,” he added, “that there’s a number of things that need to be fixed. At this point, we’re just trying to decide what comes first and what’s the path forward.”
‘Kicked a hornet’s nest’: Missouri GOP repeal of voter-approved laws inspires backlash

Under Proposition A, workers at businesses with receipts greater than $500,000 a year could accrue at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Workers could earn up to 40 hours of leave a year at smaller businesses and 56 hours at larger companies. 
The measure made sick leave guaranteed for 728,000 workers who lacked it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project.
Paid sick leave laws covering private employers have been enacted in 18 states, with voters in Nebraska and Alaska joining Missouri in November in approving the new benefits. 
Missouri is the first state to fully repeal a voter-approved paid sick leave law. 
At a recent speech in Springfield, Kehoe panned Proposition A, denying it was a grassroots campaign because it received campaign contributions from out-of-state organizations. He urged workers who are upset with the lack of paid sick leave to  find another job.
“If an employee doesn’t feel like they’re getting the right benefit,” he said, “there’s a business down the street that might have a better package for them, and that’s how the process should work.
That push for repeal was backed by business groups like the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who called the mandated paid sick leave a “job killer.”
“Missouri employers value their employees and recognize the importance of offering competitive wages and benefits, but one-size-fits-all mandates threaten growth,” Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, when the repeal was signed into law. 
But that’s simply not true, said Gina Meyer, owner of J E Meyer Construction Co.
Meyer currently has four full-time employees, and even though Proposition A is officially repealed, she has no intention of rolling back her workers’ newly acquired benefits. 
“It’s a completely false narrative,” Meyer said. “You don’t have to choose between people and profits.”
Businesses benefit by having healthy workers, Meyer said. And implementing the law has not had any negative impact at all on her business. When she learned lawmakers were planning a repeal, she knew immediately that she would not follow suit.
“It never occurred to me that I would take away this benefit from my employees,” she said. “Because my employees are equal partners in my company. I mean, you can’t have one without the other.”
Von Glahn said he’s hearing from employers around the state reacting just like Meyer. 
“I have the sense that a lot of businesses are not necessarily pulling back these benefits,” he said. “They don’t want to be in the position of telling workers, ‘Well, you know, now that I don’t have to treat you in this more dignified way, I’m not going to.’ That’s a very hard message for an employer to deliver.”
Von Glahn said his organization is seriously considering another initiative petition next year putting sick leave into the state constitution — a move that would make it much harder for lawmakers to reverse. 
Missouri Jobs with Justice is also watching another initiative petition campaign, called Respect Missouri Voters, which is hoping to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot making it harder for the legislature to overturn voter-approved laws. 
At the same time, the legislature is likely to reconvene next month to redraw Missouri’s congressional maps and debate a constitutional amendment targeting the initiative petition process. The goal of the new amendment would be to make it much harder for voters to change the state constitution. 
As for Phillips, she’s not sure what her employer will do now that the law has been repealed. But she says she’s furious that lawmakers would overturn the will of the voters to strip benefits from workers. . 
“This should scare the hell out of every voter,” she said. “We voted for this. If they can look us in the eyes and tell us we’re not worthy, we should be scared. And pissed off.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525_workersrally8-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-29 07:56:22.138296

They said they are shattered by unspeakable grief, and said they hope her “memory fuels action.”

Mikie Sherrill (D-11) campaigns for governor at Death of the Fox Brewing Company in Clarksboro on Aug. 28, 2025. (Nikita Biryukov | New Jersey Monitor)Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli made their pitches to disparate groups of voters Thursday in their bids to be the Garden State’s next governor.
Ciattarelli, the GOP’s nominee for the second consecutive gubernatorial cycle, spoke at a Moms for Liberty Rally in Jersey City, where he renewed his opposition to state guidance that allows school districts to accept students’ asserted gender identities without notifying parents.
“That policy is immoral, it’s indecent, it’s wrong, and it’s dangerous. Our students are best served when school districts and parents work in partnership, not in secret,” Ciattarelli said.
The policy, called for by a 2017 law signed by Gov. Chris Christie, was a major focus for Republican candidates and groups in 2023’s legislative races. Ciattarelli pledged he would end the policy shortly after taking office if elected.
“Over the last eight years, parental rights have been under assault here in New Jersey. This is why we have elections,” Ciattarelli said. “It all ends January of 2026 when we win this election.”

Sherrill’s stops focused on economics. At businesses in Edison, Clarksboro, and Haddonfield, among others, she discussed the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs on New Jersey businesses.
At Death of the Fox Brewing Company in Clarksboro, a craft brewery and coffee roastery, she noted how the tariffs on Brazil, a major exporter of coffee and beef to the United States, were affecting New Jersey businesses.
“The frustrating part for the business owner is these political fights. It’s not necessarily ‘here’s why’ or ‘here’s the targeted plan and here’s how it’s going to impact us,’” she said. “It’s all passed along to small businesses.”
Tariffs are a type of tax on foreign goods paid by importers. When tariff rates rise, U.S. businesses must pay more to import goods from other countries. The United States levies a 50% tariff rate on some goods from Brazil, one of the steepest rates levied on any economy in the Trump administration’s trade war.
The costs added by tariffs would soon be passed down to consumers, Sherrill warned.
“The thing I’ve been most concerned about — what I’ve been hearing from economists and now I’m hearing on the ground — is we’re going to start raising prices. We’re already in an affordability crisis, and worse is coming thanks to the federal government.”
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is barred from seeking a third term in November. Public polls of the race to succeed him show Sherrill, who first joined Congress in 2019, leading Ciattarelli.

To put it mildly, this is not exactly the future most Montanans envisioned for our incredible state.  Only a few years earlier a new constitution had been adopted to finally throw off the “Copper Collar” the Anaconda Company had so firmly fixed around the neck of our legislature, judges and newspapers while it ran rampant and totally unregulated.
Indeed, the almost unimaginable environmental destruction and corruption spawned by Butte’s Copper Kings finally became so vast that the delegates to the Constitutional Convention felt they needed to enshrine certain rights and requirements to ensure that Montanans would no longer fall victim to the desecration of our state as a resource colony by rapacious corporations.
Those constitutional guarantees include the inalienable right of every Montanan to a “clean and healthy environment”; the assurance that all government actions must be open to the public through our Right-to-Know provision; the mandates that: “The state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations”; and that “All lands disturbed by the taking of natural resources shall be reclaimed.”  Their words have been lauded and copied worldwide.  
While it seems like we had turned the corner on corporate “rape and scrape,” we still struggle with what the Copper Kings left behind when they took their wealth and fled to the East Coast.  It’s no great honor to have the nation’s largest Superfund site stretching from Butte to Missoula, including 100 miles of ravaged river at the very headwaters of the mighty Columbia.  And that’s just one of the hundreds of toxic results from a century of exploitation under the Copper Kings.
When the Anaconda Company was purchased by ARCO in the mid-’70s and they shut down the Butte mine and Anaconda smelter, that “clean and healthy” future for Montana seemed imminent.  
But then came the Montana Power — a scion of the Anaconda Company and inheritor of the political and monetary power it so brutally wielded.  Having ravaged western Montana, they turned their ever-greedy eyes to capitalize on yet another underground resource — coal.  
For half a century they’ve burned coal to generate electricity.  In the process, they’ve spewed a host of pollutants, poisoned the area’s groundwater with leakage from their ash ponds, and continue to exacerbate the ever-more damaging climate crisis with enormous carbon dioxide emissions.  
Of the four Colstrip plants, two have been shut down and two continue to operate, well beyond their original projected lifespan of 40 years, and are now the dirtiest coal plants in the nation.  
When fracking and renewable energy came along, it looked like the economics of coal-fired generation would finally retire Colstrip for good and bring remediation to its significant pollution footprint. 
But then along came Donald Trump — and his crazed claim of “beautiful clean coal” that was immediately embraced and endorsed by Montana’s governor and congressional delegation.  N
ow NorthWestern Energy, Montana Power’s successor, intends to merge with the Black Hills Corp. to provide electricity and gas to at least eight states.  
From the looks of it, the “Coal Collar” is back big time with it’s climate killing fossil fuels to fulfill the long-ago nightmare of turning Montana into “the boiler room for the nation” — and leaving Montana’s energy future black as coal.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-9915-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-29 06:56:29.587459

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski told attendees at the annual Indiana Water Summit on Thursday that a pending statewide water plan must be “transparent, data-driven and developed collaboratively” in line with Gov. Mike Braun’s recent executive order.
“When I stepped into this role in January, the governor really painted a vision for his Freedom and Opportunity agenda, which includes delivering a more responsive, efficient state government, and a government that improves the quality and quantity of life for Hoosiers,” Jaworowski said. “That includes affordable and clean energy and water.”
She cited an executive order signed by Braun in April, which directs state agencies to create a statewide water inventory and management plan by the end of 2026. The planning framework is supposed to align utilities, industries, municipalities and other water users. 
The executive order also mandates creation of a real-time, publicly accessible online data platform for water usage, infrastructure status and future demand projections.
“In essence, it means we’re coming together to collaboratively create an inventory of our current water usage, the future of water domains, and to better understand the availability of groundwater and surface water in all regions of Indiana,” Jaworowski continued.
Focusing on Indiana’s water resources
Braun’s order came amid growing concerns about Indiana’s water vulnerabilities. 
A report released last week by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, for example, warned that Indiana’s water supply could soon face strain due to compounding demands from residents, agriculture, manufacturing,  water-intensive data centers and climate change.
Environmental agencies, advocates respond to Braun executive orders 

Indiana additionally grapples with nutrient and sediment pollution; wetlands losses; and waterway contamination.
The Hoosier State has historically lacked a comprehensive statewide water policy, unlike neighboring states, including Ohio, Michigan and Illinois — all of which have long-standing frameworks to guide water quality and usage management.
Jaworowski emphasized that water planning in Indiana should not come from “top-down mandates,” but instead be “a conversation that’s regionally driven.”
She said, too, that population growth is adding new pressure on resources, noting that Indiana gained more than 44,000 new residents in 2024 — marking the state’s fastest increase since 2008.
Involving ‘all stakeholders’
On flooding and wetlands, Jaworowski further acknowledged concerns about changing projections, though she emphasized that “the governor is extremely dedicated to preserving our wetlands and preserving our conservation areas.”
When asked for any standout solutions that have so far offered by stakeholders, Jaworowski specifically praised ongoing work with the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership but said that, “being able to look at what other states have done with policy … and regional water planning … has been most impressive to me.”
The secretary also made clear that local watershed commissions won’t be left out of the statewide planning process and are instead “key stakeholders in this discussion.”
“Our door’s open to all,” Jaworowski told the summit audience. “‘Stakeholder’ is not a hollow term. I recognize how important grassroots is in water planning.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.

Second of two parts
Macy Buhler, a DeForest child care provider, has spent the last several years grappling with the challenges to her business. At the top of the list: hiring and keeping qualified teachers.
Adequate pay is important, of course, but Buhler says good health benefits are as well.  
She would like to offer health insurance, but the margins make that unsustainable. The majority of her employees either have their health insurance on a spouse’s plan or through their parents if they’re younger than 26 — or they go uninsured.
About one-third of her employees are able to get covered through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the ACA’s health care marketplace, HealthCare.gov.
HealthCare.gov was the first-ever national marketplace for people without health insurance to buy coverage for themselves and their families. The law also set standards for what plans sold through the marketplace must cover.
To make insurance more affordable, the ACA included tax credit subsidies tied to the consumer’s income and available for people with household incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines. 
Those subsidies were substantially increased in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), then extended in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But without another extension, they’ll disappear at the end of 2025.

Buhler says the enhanced tax-credit subsidies have helped make it possible for her employees who use HealthCare.gov to afford their health insurance, Buhler says. 
“I’m thinking I’m very concerned for them next year,” Buhler says of her employees who have been covered under the ACA. “My staff is exposed to everything,” she adds. “Can I keep my staff healthy? … There’s some definite fears going forward.”
For Sydney Badeau, health insurance through the ACA made it possible for her to work two part-time jobs, neither offering health coverage. She does outreach and advocacy working 20 hours a week for The Arc-Wisconsin and 20 hours a week for People First Wisconsin, both of which serve people with disabilities
Badeau has long-term disabilities and was on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which ended when a review found that she would be able to work.
Being on SSI qualified her for Medicaid. Neither of her jobs provided health benefits for part-timers, but Badeau was able to buy her own through HealthCare.gov, with the enhanced subsidies keeping it affordable for her.
Her premium is expected to increase 30% next year, beyond what she can afford, Badeau says. She has an option — one of her two jobs could take her full time, qualifying her for that employer’s health plan.
But for many people with disabilities who have gotten coverage through the ACA, the options are more difficult. “There’s going to be a lot of people panicking probably in the next six months to a few years, and not insured, because it’s like a giant mess right now,” Badeau says.
 Since 2020, the year before the enhanced subsidies went into effect, the number of people with ACA Marketplace coverage has grown by 88% from 11.4 million to 21.4 million.
Amanda Sherman, a Mequon real estate broker’s assistant, says her current health insurance policy would cost her about $550 a month without the enhanced subsidies, instead of the $300 she’s paying now.

Sherman gets weekly shots for lupus, an autoimmune disorder. Without insurance the injections would cost $4,000 a month. Her plan has brought that down to $500 a month, and the medication’s manufacturer has a program to help cover her copayments and lower that cost further.
Sherman requires monthly bloodwork and sees five different specialists. She’s undergone a bone marrow biopsy, MRI exams and CT scans.
The annual deductible for Sherman’s health insurance is $7,500. She reached that limit in February. Her out-of-pocket expenses are capped at $9,500; she reached that in February as well.
Sherman’s medications reduce the power of her body’s immune system, making her more likely to get infections. Earlier this year she got walking pneumonia and was hospitalized for sepsis. Three days in the hospital would have cost $20,000 without her insurance, she says.
“If I didn’t have the Affordable Care Act I wouldn’t be able to afford health insurance,” Sherman says. “It’s still very hard for me to afford all my medical expenses — even just the copays are a lot.”
Sherman has asked her health insurer how much her premium will increase next year, but the answers have been vague
Pondering her alternatives, “I’m honestly really scared,” Sherman says.
It bothers her when she hears assumptions others make about the people who will be affected as safety-net programs are slashed.
“I just think it’s gotten really ugly the way that people are looking at each other and dehumanizing different groups of people,” Sherman says.
She has heard others assume that people “are just leeching off the system” if they use Medicaid or have relied on the ACA subsidy to afford health insurance.
“Anybody can get a chronic illness. Anybody can end up with a job where they don’t offer insurance, and that doesn’t make them less of a person,” Sherman says.
“Health care should be something that everybody has access to,” she adds. “It shouldn’t be that hard.” 
If coverage declines
When Republicans and President Donald Trump enacted the tax-cut and spending cut reconciliation bill in July, the measure placed new limits on who can qualify for the ACA’s premium tax credit subsidies. The bill also included provisions that will cut Medicaid enrollment and put new barriers to enrollment in federal nutrition aid programs. 
When drawing up the bill, the authors declined to include a provision that would have extended enhanced subsidies based on a person’s income on health plans purchased through HealthCare.gov.
 William Parke-Sutherland, Kids Forward
William Parke-Sutherland, government affairs director of Kids Forward, says that the combination of Medicaid cuts and ACA changes could lead as many as 18 million people to lose health care coverage.
“This will mean America will get sicker,” Parke-Sutherland says. “Individuals and families and everybody will have less regular and affordable access to primary care. Uncompensated care is likely to go up. Taking people off of health care coverage doesn’t make their health care needs go away.”
Those factors are likely to drive up health costs and health insurance costs for the rest of the public, according to health care and insurance experts.
Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance Nathan Hodek says insurers have filed their rate plans for the marketplace with the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI), and while the new rates won’t be announced until early this fall, “what we are seeing is a trend of higher rates.”
The changes are also likely to show up in the Wisconsin Health Care Stability Plan, Hodek says.
The stability plan provides reinsurance to help absorb the risk for insurers and has helped keep rates 13 to 19 percentage points lower than they would have been without the stability plan, he explains.
State lawmakers and the state budget have given the plan full support, Hodek says. Federal support, however, is based on a formula that includes the size of ACA marketplace enrollment in the state.
If enrollment goes down because of the ACA changes this year, “we are concerned that we’ll also see decreased federal funding” for the stability plan,” Hodek says. If so, the plan will need more from the state “to make sure that program is fully funded and continuing to keep rates more affordable.”
Dr. Jill McMullen, a Tomah family practitioner, says that as insurance rates are driven up, people will be driven out of the insurance marketplace.
“Anything that makes it more expensive to get insurance on the health insurance marketplace means that higher percentage of healthy people, younger people will opt out of getting insurance,” McMullen says.
One consequence is that the people who do buy insurance are likely to be sicker, with higher health care costs, she adds — driving up the cost of insurance premiums even more.
The impact on people’s health may take longer to show up — in the form of uncontrolled, chronic illness such as high blood pressure or diabetes.
“That may not show up in terms of what we call poor outcomes, complications, or difficulties for a few years,” McMullen says. “But then when they do come into place, then they will be more expensive because it’s much more expensive to fix the problem than to prevent it.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map earlier this month, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.
But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

Empowering states to oversee federal environmental regulations is part of the Trump administration's goal to advance ""cooperative federalism,"" EPA Administrator Zeldin said.
The post Feds to hand Wyoming control of coal ash oversight appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Wyoming regulators will assume oversight for toxic coal ash storage and remediation at coal-fired power plants in the state — a role historically handled by federal regulators.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced his agency’s proposal to grant primacy of the Coal Combustion Residuals program to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality at a press conference Thursday at the Capitol.
“Wyoming has been trying very hard for years to be able to take primacy, to take control over its own destiny in overseeing coal combustion residuals,” Zeldin told a roomful of reporters, EPA staffers and a handful of Wyoming lawmakers. “One of the principles at the EPA is advancing cooperative federalism. It is our desire to improve our relationship with states [and] local governments.”
Zeldin was joined by a trio of Republicans — EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western (a former Wyoming lawmaker), Gov. Mark Gordon and Wyoming U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis — along with Wyoming DEQ Director Todd Parfitt. Each praised Zeldin and the rest of the Trump administration for putting states in charge of federal environmental programs and for rolling back federal regulations on fossil fuel industries — most of which were an overreach by Democratic administrations that stifle innovation and the U.S. economy, they said.

“I couldn’t believe that Lee Zeldin was willing to take the EPA on,” Lummis said. “What a heavy lift, because it had been used in this country to thwart economic activity and to second guess the experts in this deal, and it changed in a heartbeat. It changed the minute that Lee Zeldin became the administrator.”
Gordon concurred.
“You are a marvelous breath of fresh air,” he said. “We dealt with an administration that used regulation to frustrate progress, and I think, today, it is a remarkable moment to talk about how regulation, in Wyoming, is about doing things the right way.”
Coal ash
When power plants burn coal, heavy residues, known as clinker and slag, accumulate within the exhaust systems. It also produces a finer ash, most of which is captured via various filtration methods. All of those residuals are toxic. The substances are typically stored in coal ash ponds, and federal regulations — specifically, the Coal Combustion Residuals program — require that the sites be lined with materials to prevent seepage into surface waters or aquifers.
The program also requires monitoring to ensure containment.
There are only four active and two legacy coal ash sites in Wyoming that fall under the federal program, according to Wyoming DEQ. The only change in granting the DEQ primacy over the management of those sites, Parfitt told WyoFile, is that the state agency will add environmental stipulations to ensure protections.Zeldin’s declaration on Thursday kicked off a 60-day public comment period on the proposal. The EPA will also hold a public hearing on Oct. 30 in Cheyenne. For more information about how to comment, and about the public hearing, go to the EPA’s Wyoming CCR permit program webpage.

The post Above the plains, under the clouds appeared first on WyoFile .","Even as a new wildfire raged on the west side of the state, the air cooled in eastern Wyoming.

A WyoFile reporter and his longtime friend, a hobby pilot, saw no other aircraft as they motored across Wyoming in a Cessna 172RG Cutlass built — disconcertingly to the amateur airman reporter — in 1980. They passed east of Lusk, over Fort Laramie, over the curves of the North Platte River and the cliff lines, rock fins and swathes of plains that make up the largely empty southeast quarter of the state.

Nearing Cheyenne, they also approached storm fronts moving east. The featured photograph shows the most intimidating cloud front of the trip. To the reporter, anyway. The pilot, Andrew Gordon, appeared unperturbed as they approached the great inverted wall of storm cloud, with its flat dark bottom and a grey buttress soaring out of sight above.
The plane motored steadily under the front. Rain spattered the windshield. Gordon announced all was well. The reporter clutched the side of his seat and looked down the long line of the cloud. The plane pushed through. Sunlight again streamed into the cabin. 
It is now, in memory, a gleaming celestial moment.

By dragging a muzzled wolf into a bar, Cody Roberts also dragged Wyoming’s outdated treatment of wildlife into broader public view, writes Wendy Keefover.
The post The wolf-killing case that could change Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by Writers on the Range.
The Wyoming man who deliberately ran down a wolf with his snowmobile in 2024 didn’t face any consequences, unless you count a $250 fine for “possessing a warm-blooded animal.” But as graphic photos of the wolf’s suffering spread across the nation, public reaction could be summed up as “horrified.”

Opinion

Still, the Wyoming state Legislature failed to make illegal what Cody Roberts did. After running over the young female wolf with his snowmobile, Roberts paraded the dazed animal — its mouth muzzled shut — through a bar in Daniel. Then he shot the wolf dead.
In reaction, Wyoming’s governor and Legislature passed a bill with no substance, House Bill 275, blandly labeled “Treatment of animals.” An earlier version of that bill proposed explicitly sanctioning running over predators with vehicles, a practice that was already legal and remains so in Wyoming.  
At a hearing before the vote, representatives of Wyoming’s agricultural community defended the practice. One argued that without access to M-44 sodium-cyanide bombs that are now virtually prohibited, they needed to run over wolves and other wildlife with vehicles to protect their livestock.
For a while, it seemed that the old ways of the Cowboy State would persist without question. But over a year later, an attorney for Sublette County convened a grand jury to examine Cody Roberts’ actions, and last week it indicted Roberts on “felony animal cruelty,” an offense punishable by up to 2 years in prison, a fine of $5,000, or both.
Wyoming’s decision leaders may not realize it, but this indictment means that they face a new landscape, which increasingly demands responsible, nuanced responses, as well as humane policies involving animals. This ethic has already emerged in the West. For the most part, Wyoming leaders seem to be taking bad advice from the wrong people and find themselves badly out of step with the rest of the nation.
In a better world, those who work with animals — whether wild or domestic — would use ingenuity to prevent negative interactions with wildlife. Using the blunt force of a snowmobile to “manage” wildlife isn’t wildlife management at all: It is state-sanctioned cruelty.
Roberts needs to be punished. But what’s really at stake is achieving a changed relationship with wildlife in Wyoming. Ethics, not indifference, and a responsible attitude should prevail. And the state’s politicians and leaders need to be at the head of the parade on passing and enforcing laws that reflect the values of their fellow citizens.
In two separate polls, an overwhelming majority of Wyoming residents — including 74% of sportsmen — agreed that running over animals with vehicles is neither ethical nor “fair chase.” Our poll showed 71% of Wyoming residents do not approve of animal cruelty.
The coming years could pose a rare opportunity for sportsmen, conservationists — and also the agricultural community — to find common ground, building a future where humane wildlife stewardship is the norm.
I believe this can happen because precedents exist. Simultaneously with the passage of its HB 275 wolf bill this year, another nightmare had been brewing: Seven legislators proposed a bill to allow year-round hunting and trapping of mountain lions. But hunters and wildlife advocates stood together and shouted a collective “No!”
The Legislature listened. That moment proved something important. When we rise above division and focus on fairness and respect for wildlife, we can protect what makes Wyoming wild and wonderful, and we can do it together.
By dragging that muzzled wolf into a bar, Roberts also dragged Wyoming’s outdated treatment of wildlife into broader public view. In the harsh glare of what became a global spotlight, he may end up having done Wyoming a strange kind of favor. His grotesque actions exposed to the world what many here already knew — that cruelty to wildlife is not tolerated by most Wyoming residents, even if it happens to be protected by law. Those who might think the state should ignore such cruelty grow ever fewer in number.
If there’s any justice to be found in the matter, it rests with the prospect that Roberts’ brutality could spark real change for the better for wolves and other wildlife, for ethics and for Wyoming’s future.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

A law requiring parental consent for almost any medical treatment provided to minors went into effect in Idaho in July 2024, and it has been hampering children’s access to care in unintended ways. 
One of the affected entities is the Idaho 988 Crisis and Suicide Hotline. 
More than 1,500 Idahoans between the ages of 5 and 17 contacted the hotline between when the parental consent law went into effect on July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025, according to data provided by the Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline. 
Some of those young people can’t move forward in their call without a parent giving permission. 
Sometimes, a parent or guardian can get on the phone, according to Idaho 988 Director Lee Flinn, “but in most situations, the minor hangs up because they tell us they feel like they can’t do that.”
“We really do want and hope that minors have a parent or two parents that support them, but one of the things that we hear sometimes is that they don’t have a parent they can talk to,” Flinn said. 
She emphasized that the hotline still accepts calls from anyone, and encourages people of any age to call, text or chat online if they are in crisis. 
 Definition of emergency can complicate how Idaho hotline staff handle call from minor 

The law, Senate Bill 1329, passed in 2024, requires that a provider receive consent from a parent or legal custodian to perform any “health care service,” which is defined as “for the diagnosis, screening, examination, prevention, treatment, cure, care, or relief of any physical or mental health condition, illness, injury, defect, or disease.” 
Providers do not need parental consent if they’ve been given blanket consent by a parent already or the provider “reasonably determines that a medical emergency exists and furnishing the health care service is necessary to prevent death or imminent, irreparable physical injury to the minor child.” 
Lee said many of the calls received by hotline staff members are “really serious, they are in crisis,” but the situation doesn’t meet the high bar defined in the law. 
The law has also impeded the hotline’s ability to follow-up with young people, which is considered a best practice regardless of the severity of the situation, she said. 
“If a teenager tells us they are suicidal but they’re not at imminent risk, meaning they may not have a plan, they may not have access to lethal means, they’re still feeling suicidal and it is best practice … to offer a follow up call the next day within 24 hours,” Flinn said. “And we’re not able to offer that follow up call or support to minors because of this law.”
If there is imminent risk determined, the call will continue and the responder will try to ensure the minor’s safety, she said. 
Alexander Copple, who worked at the hotline as a responder as part of a master’s of social work internship between July 2024 and May, 2025, said the law made it difficult to do what he felt was right. 
“We can hear a little bit, and then we would basically say, ‘we can’t continue the conversation  unless you have a parent there who can give consent,’ and then we’d have to end the call,” Copple said. “And we have no way of knowing or following up to know if there was any help or support that was received.” 
Flinn said young people can call for a variety of reasons, often stemming from a difficulty managing strong emotions related to bullying, their relation with their parents, pressure to succeed, or a breakup. 
“A young person’s brain is not fully developed into their 20s, so when a young person is in crisis, it’s important to remember that they can be very impulsive sometimes, so the best support that any of us can provide a young person, early on in the crisis, is best.” 
 Idaho lawmakers say they intend try again to clarify the law

The bill sponsors, Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, and Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, were aware of other ways the law was impeding access to care, and Anthon during the 2025 legislative session proposed a bill to clarify language in it, but the bill did not advance in the House. 
Ehardt told the Idaho Capital Sun on Wednesday that she hadn’t heard of the law’s impact on the hotline.

“The one thing I’ve said from the beginning, is that we wanted to keep an an eye on things pertaining to suicide,” Ehardt said. “… I think that’s worth looking at.” 
Anthon’s bill proposed this year would have created a specific exception for the 988 hotline, allowing for services without parental consent if the child is “is accessing the services of the Idaho crisis and suicide hotline or experiencing a mental health crisis and presents an imminent risk of serious injury to self or others.” 
The law as it’s written had also caused problems for those providing sexual assault exams on young people under 18. Under the law, a health worker would need to get consent from a parent to do the exam, but in some cases the perpetrator of the assault may be that parent or another family member, Idaho Reports previously reported. 
The law also gained national attention when the Washington Post reported on a 13-year-old pregnant girl from McCall who could consent to her baby’s care but not her own. 
The law came up at a recent legislative Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force meeting, during which advocates disagreed as to whether the law, as written, hampered abuse investigations and treatment, the Sun reported. 
Before the passage of Senate Bill 1329, teenagers 14 and older could seek contraception or other family planning services outside of abortion, treatment and testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and inpatient care for mental health, the Idaho Press reported. Those 16 and older may consent to treatment or rehabilitation for substance abuse.
Children’s advocates at the time of the bill’s passage expressed concern it would have a “chilling effect” on young people’s access to health care, the Idaho Press reported. 
Ehard’t seatmate, fellow Idaho Falls Republican Marco Erickson, had originally raised concerns about the impact on crisis and suicide centers when the bill was introduced in 2024. Erickson is a program director at Community Youth in Action, which works toward substance abuse and suicide prevention.

He told the Sun that he had heard the bill had been impacting services at the hotline, and he’s been advocating for those who are affected to bring potential solutions to the bill sponsors. 
Erickson did not sponsor the bill, and although he expressed concerns about the mental health aspect of the bill, he voted for it on the floor. 
“I’m just, in good faith, hoping they take care of it,” he said. “… (Ehardt) assured me that these issues would be addressed.”
Ehardt has said she believes the law has been “misconstrued” and overly broadly interpreted in a way that doesn’t allow for some basic services to be provided, such as a Band-Aid at school, but said she’s open to trying to clarify it. 
The bill last year passed the Senate but never went anywhere in the House. Ehardt said it came too late in the session. She hopes to have a bill ready early in the 2026 session. 
“Some of those things are being worked on as we speak,” she said.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
Idaho workers’ average hourly wages grew 5.1% last year

In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.

Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
 Federal government’s policy changes have brought challenges to contractors

For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
HUD secretary, Crapo emphasize deregulation and tax incentives in housing roundtable 

“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.

 Wobbly state finances and unemployment rates

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).

“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.












State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media




In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 Jobs in California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

But President Trump has indicated he wants to pull back on giving states this type of support. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)For years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleanians made the Federal Emergency Management Agency the butt of their bitter jokes. 

Anti-FEMA sentiment was so high in Louisiana that local businesses started selling T-shirts a couple of months after the storm lampooning the federal agency with slogans like “Where’s FEMA?” and “FEMA stands for Federal Employees Missing in Action”. 
The sentiment is understandable. Almost a half dozen federal investigations launched in the six months after Hurricane Katrina made landfall Aug. 29, 2005 – and turned into the country’s most catastrophic natural disaster – determined FEMA failed in nearly every way to respond to the storm. 

“Hurricane Katrina exposed flaws in the structure of FEMA and DHS that are too substantial to mend,” concluded a 2006 U.S. Senate report titled “Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared.” 
Yet 20 years after the agency’s feckless Katrina response, some Louisiana leaders find themselves in the awkward position of having to defend FEMA. 

President Donald Trump has made it clear he wants the federal government to play less of a role in natural disaster response, raising concerns that state and local governments might need to cover more of their recovery costs. 
Such a change would likely affect Louisiana more than almost every other state in the country. 

Since Katrina, Louisiana has received more public and individual assistance from FEMA ($12.6 billion) than all states but Florida ($16.6 billion) and New York ($19.4 billion), according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which tracks federal disaster spending. 

The money helped Louisiana respond to 25 extreme weather events, including 11 hurricanes, six floods and one ice storm, over the past two decades. 
That FEMA figure doesn’t account for all of the money Louisiana has received in the wake of Katrina. There was another $11 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development went to the Road Home program to rebuild housing. All told, the federal government put an unprecedented $76 billion toward Louisiana’s recovery from the 2005 storm. 
Louisiana simply wouldn’t be able to handle the financial burden of major disaster response without significant support from the federal government, according to several former state officials interviewed. Storms with far less impact than Katrina have the ability to overwhelm the state’s assets, they said. 

If Louisiana has to worry about covering more disaster recovery costs, the state will have less money to spend on schools, universities, roads, bridges and economic development. 
“If we didn’t have the federal money, we would be in a terrible mess, and we would have been in a terrible mess from Katrina going forward,” said Jay Dardenne, Louisiana’s former lieutenant governor and state budget chief for former Gov. John Bel Edwards.

 Uncertainty at FEMA

To what extent Trump will pull back on federal disaster assistance isn’t clear. 

As recently as June, the president said he would push to eliminate FEMA altogether. He then backed off that rhetoric after July 4th weekend flooding in Texas killed at least 136 people, including children attending a sleepaway camp. His administration’s response was directly criticized. 
Still, the Trump administration has already made several preliminary changes to FEMA that alarm emergency response experts. The agency has reduced staff and some of those who remain have been asked to help with hiring immigration enforcement agents instead of working on disaster relief. 
The FEMA cuts come on top of those to the National Hurricane Center and other federal programs that provide crucial information to hurricane-prone states and help them ready for incoming storms. 
Some reforms Congress enacted in the year after Katrina to strengthen FEMA have also been ignored. A law requiring FEMA’s director to have experience in emergency response and disaster recovery isn’t being followed. Trump’s acting FEMA administrator David Richardson previously oversaw counter terrorism programs but has no natural disaster management experience. 
There are also concerns about whether a new policy delayed assistance during the Texas flood, similar to what unfolded in the aftermath of Katrina. 

Due to a bureaucratic breakdown 20 years ago, FEMA failed to promptly provide boats for search-and-rescue teams in New Orleans, even after federal officials knew flooding was widespread, according to a U.S. Senate report from 2006. 
This past July, several questions were raised about whether search-and-rescue teams were delayed during the Texas flood because Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem now requires every FEMA contract over $100,000 to be approved personally by her,  the Associated Press reported. The Trump administration has denied those allegations.

The ability of Louisiana and other states to respond to catastrophic weather with their own staff would also likely be impacted if Trump changes the traditional funding reimbursements that state and local governments use for their recovery efforts. 

“The federal government will have a lasting role in responding to and funding the impact of disasters; local and state governments simply do not have the resources to do so,” said Paul Rainwater, who was executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority that managed federal funding for state rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina. He went on to serve as former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s chief of staff and budget czar. 
“The question the Trump administration faces, given some of its comments about FEMA, is: When will a White House step in and help?” he said. 
 Presidential discretion

The president has a significant say in when FEMA provides funding to states after natural disasters, as well as how much money states or local governments receive. 
When a state is overwhelmed by a catastrophic event, a governor makes a formal request of the president for federal assistance. FEMA starts to provide help to the state authorities only after it is granted. 
Since returning to office in January, Trump has denied disaster relief that may have been approved previously. His decisions have affected liberal-leaning states such as Maryland and Washington and more conservative ones like West Virginia. 

He even stalled for a month on accepting a disaster declaration from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who personally knows Trump and served as his press secretary during his first term as president.
As president, Trump has the ability to not only approve federal assistance, but to also increase the share of the state or local costs that FEMA will reimburse. For example, federal law gives presidents the discretion to reduce or waive the requirement for a state or local government to cover 25% of the cost of debris removal after a storm. 

Louisiana has benefited from a reduction of these local financial responsibilities nine times in the past 25 years, including for hurricanes Ida (2021), Laura (2020), Ike (2008), Gustav (2008), Rita (2005), Katrina (2005) and Ivan (2004). The 2016 Baton Rouge-area floods and a severe ice storm in 2001 were also approved for enhanced federal assistance, according to a 2023 Congressional report.
But all the upheaval should be a signal to local and state officials to prepare as if that extra FEMA might not be coming their way, former FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell, who worked for President Joe Biden, said in a call with reporters this week.
“There are, right now, a lot of questions about whether any of those costs are going to be eligible for reimbursement,” Criswell said. “You need to put plans in place to make sure that you can do it, regardless of whether you get federal support.”  

U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he personally advocated for the federal government to cover more disaster recovery bills after Hurricane Laura, which hit Southwest Louisiana, and the 2016 flooding. 

Sometimes a disaster is so profound that local governments have a hard time coming up with the tax revenue to cover their share of the recovery. If people lose their homes and are displaced, as happened after Katrina, cities and parishes won’t have much money to put toward cleanup, Cassidy said. 

“When you destroy a community, you destroy their ability to raise tax money,” he said in an interview. 

Jindal, who served as Louisiana’s governor from 2008-16 and was a congressman during Hurricane Katrina, said he thinks the federal government will always be an important partner in major disasters. But states and local governments should take on more responsibility for smaller events.  

“There are many day-to-day disasters that many state and local governments can handle themselves,” Jindal said. “For the bigger disasters that can overwhelm, you still want to have some federal role.” 

But it’s crucial that local and state officials know what to expect from the federal government so they can be prepared, said Jindal, who was governor when hurricanes Gustav and Ike hit Louisiana. 

“I think it’s important to have clear rules ahead of time,” he said.

 Landry: Louisiana shouldn’t worry about FEMA

Trump may have denied disaster relief to other states, but Gov. Jeff Landry said Louisiana has nothing to worry about when it comes to FEMA because of his good relationship with the administration. 

“I think it’s all just a bunch of media hype trying to scare people. We’re ready for hurricane season,” the governor told reporters this week. 

Landry has a close relationship with Noem and said Trump’s Homeland Security leader has already responded to requests for assistance for matters in Lake Charles and Terrebonne Parish this year. 
“What Kristi Noem has done lately, I mean, we just call her, and we say, ‘These are projects that need to be moved,’” Landry said. 

Louisiana is one of only a few states that has a local representative on Trump’s FEMA review council, which is supposed to make recommendations on reforming the agency this fall. 

One of the council’s 12 members, who include Noem and Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is Louisiana native Mark Cooper, Jindal’s head of emergency management and former Gov. Edwards’ chief of staff. 

“Obviously, Louisiana is playing a big role in this reimagining for FEMA,” Cooper said this week in an interview from Oklahoma where the review council was meeting. “We’re being heard. Louisiana is being heard as part of this process.”
Cooper said the council already met directly with Louisiana emergency response officials when it held their second meeting in New Orleans in July at his suggestion. 
The council has made no decisions about whether FEMA’s reimbursement policies for state and local governments should change, Cooper said, but he suggested more might be asked of states.

“We need to do more to help states to be more self-reliant and resilient,” he said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FEMA-trailers-Arabi-Katrina.jpg,,,2025-08-29 06:56:29.587459

(Wisconsin Examiner photo) “This fight is all of labor’s fight,” Kevin Gundlach, president of the South Central Federation of Labor, declared at a “solidarity dinner” for 43 immigrant workers who recently lost their jobs at a Monroe, Wisconsin cheese factory. “Even Wisconsinites who don’t know about the story, should know in a cheesemaking state we should support cheesemakers.” 
The workers, some of whom labored for more than 20 years at W&W Dairy, were told in August they would have to submit to E-Verify screening and confirm their legal status in order to continue their employment after a new company, Kansas-based Dairy Farmers of America (DFA), bought the cheese plant. They walked off the job to protest, hoping DFA, which has a policy of subjecting new hires to E-Verify screening, would exempt them because of their many years of service. The company declined, but asked the workers to return to help train their replacements, one worker said. 
The cheese plant employees I spoke with said they were still in shock, worried about supporting their families as they face the loss of pay and benefits at the end of the month.
Workers who pulled long shifts, kept the plant going through the pandemic and took pride in producing high quality, Mexican-style cheeses — queso fresco, queso blanco, quesadilla and panela — now feel betrayed. 
Their goal is no longer to return to their old jobs. Instead, they are focused on getting severance pay from W&W Dairy, which is still technically their employer until Sept. 1 — Labor Day — when DFA assumes control of the plant.
On Thursday, Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the immigrant workers’ rights group Voces de la Frontera, wrote to W&W president Franz Hofmeister to ask that the dairy show appreciation for its longtime workers by offering them a severance package. A Labor Day picnic organized by community members to support the workers, “would be an excellent opportunity to announce that the workers and the company have resolved their differences and that workers are being given some compensation,” Neumann-Ortiz wrote. “This would give the workers a chance to thank you publicly and provide some healing and closure.”
W&W’s success was propelled by its loyal workforce — fewer than 100 people who knew how to do multiple jobs in the plant and switched roles to keep things running smoothly. The quality of the product attracted a high-profile buyer. 
“The growth trajectory for the Hispanic cheese market is more than three times that of the cheese category,” Ken Orf, president of DFA’s Cheese, Taste and Flavors Division, told the trade publication Cheese Reporter, in an article about the benefit to the company of its “strategic acquisition” of W&W, which puts it in a “stronger position for growth with this important dairy category.”
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Hispanic employees of the plant.
Bibiana Gonzalez, a child care provider and community leader in the Monroe area, said she liked the term “essential workers” when she first heard it. The W&W workers felt they were essential to their employer’s success, and put in long hours during the pandemic, when other people were staying home to protect their health. But “unfortunately, people confuse essential workers with workers who can be exploited,” Gonzalez said.
“They want to toss these workers in the street just for being immigrants,” said Voces de la Frontera organizer Pablo Rodriguez.
DFA wants to distance itself from any thorny political issues around immigration. In a statement to WKOW Channel 27 news, the company asserted it had a goal “to retain 100% of the W&W workforce,” but that “as part of the hiring process to become DFA employees, all W&W workers and other applicants were notified of the need to provide documents to complete both an I-9 form and the E-verify process.” Failing to produce the proper documents, unfortunately, would mean “DFA’s ability to offer employment was impacted.”
Using cold, passive bureaucratic language, DFA casts it as a regrettable accident that its E-Verify policy rendered nearly half the cheese plant’s employees ineligible to continue working there. But as a cooperative with 5,000 dairy farm members, it’s impossible DFA leadership is unfamiliar with its industry’s heavy reliance on workers who don’t have papers.
In Wisconsin, where DFA has 399 member farms and four dairy manufacturing plants, an estimated 70% of the dairy workforce is made up of immigrants who cannot get E-Verifiable legal work papers.
In dairy, as in other year-round, nonseasonal industries, immigrants who make up the majority of the work force are ineligible for U.S. work visas. Congress has simply failed to create a visa for year-round jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, food service and other industries that rely on immigrant labor.
Far from being a drag on the economy, immigrant workers who lack legal authorization are heavily recruited by U.S. employers and “supercharge economic growth,” according to a new Center for Migration Studies research brief. The research brief shows that 8.5 million undocumented workers in the U.S. contribute an estimated $96.7 billion annually in federal, state and local taxes, “filling roles vital to critical industries.”
The brief also warns that mass deportations could cause critical workforce shortages. No one knows that better than Wisconsin dairy farmers, who would go out of business overnight if their mostly immigrant workforce was deported.
Union members who came out to support the W&W workers Tuesday night embraced the idea that all workers are in the same boat, are ill served by an authoritarian, bullying Trump administration, and will do better if they band together.
That’s the whole idea of solidarity: Working people need to unite to protect their common interests against the rich and powerful, who will run roughshod over all of us if they can. Expanding on that unifying message, Al Hudson, lay leader of the Union Presbyterian Church in Monroe, whose congregation supports the W&W workers, brought his social justice gospel to the union hall.
“We are proud to be a gathering place for the Green County Hispanic community,” Hudson said of his church. “We’re proud to do our part to be a Matthew 25 church,” he added, referring to the Bible verse in which Jesus calls on the faithful to clothe the naked, feed the hungry, care for the sick and visit those in prison. “This is what churches are supposed to do,” Hudson said. “I admire your courage,” he told the displaced W&W workers, pledging to continue to “walk with you and support you in your struggle as long as you want us there.”
The union members in the hall cheered. They applauded the W&W workers, they applauded speeches about solidarity among working people of every race and ethnic background. They seemed enlivened by the chance to do something to help.
The warm feeling of pulling together to resist the violent bigotry of the anti-immigrant Trump administration, recognizing the common struggle among all working people, was uplifting.
“Solidaridad!” shouted Gundlach, and the mostly gringo crowd of unionists shouted back, “Solidaridad!”

But thanks to major therapeutic advances, many of my patients are now able to live active, fulfilling lives.
Unfortunately, that progress is now at risk.
Washington is again considering a “Most Favored Nation” (MFN) model — a scheme that would link U.S. medicine prices to the lowest price paid by other industrialized countries. On paper, it may sound like a good way to level the playing field. In reality, it threatens the ability of community-based physicians like me to continue offering essential medical treatments.
The federal government’s own analysis of a previous MFN proposal in 2020 projected that patients could lose access to their medications — not as a side effect, but as a built-in source of savings to the federal government. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) warned that care impacts could mean “having to travel to seek care from an excluded provider, receiving an alternative therapy that may have lower efficacy or greater risks, or postponing or forgoing treatment.”
In rheumatology, many of the most effective treatments are infusions or injections — complex medications that must be administered by trained healthcare providers in a clinical setting. These therapies aren’t interchangeable with over-the-counter drugs and, for many patients, they’re the only way to keep the disease stable and prevent long-term damage.
At my practice — and clinics across Michigan — we purchase these medicines upfront, administer them to our patients, and are reimbursed by health insurance plans using a market-based formula. Through Medicare, the current reimbursement for physician-administered therapies includes the Average Sales Price (ASP) and a marginal add-on payment, minus government sequestration, to help cover overhead, including staff salaries, rent, and supply and intake costs. In the commercial market, insurers often take cues from the ASP rates when setting their own.
Margins are already tight to operate a safe infusion suite and manage complex patient care. But MFN would slash those ASP-derived payments further, pushing many practices to the brink.
The policy would tie reimbursement to the lowest prices set by government-run foreign health systems that bear little resemblance to our own. These systems rely on discriminatory cost-effectiveness thresholds and centralized price-setting agencies to ration care and control access to innovative therapies. Importing those pricing benchmarks would have severe consequences.
We know what happens when reimbursement is slashed. Providers take on unsustainable losses. Clinics are forced to cut services or close. Patients are pushed to hospitals, where care is harder to access and significantly more expensive. In fact, hospitals charge up to 200-300% more to administer a drug than independent physician practices.
The burden falls hardest on rural and lower-income patients, who already face long travel times and limited options. That’s especially concerning in Michigan, where more than 60% of our 83 counties are rural and there are over 250 designated “Health Professional Shortage Areas.”
Preserving and expanding access to local infusion sites is the best way to ensure timely care.
But MFN would make it even harder for providers like me to stay afloat under mounting financial pressure. One recent survey found almost all practices that directly administer drugs to patients are already “underwater” on several medications, struggling with reimbursement far below acquisition cost.
MFN could accelerate clinic closures, retirements, and the sale of independent physician practices — fueling further health system consolidation, driving up costs, narrowing patient choice, and disrupting essential treatment for autoimmune diseases.
We all want to lower drug costs. But this policy isn’t the answer.
Michigan’s own Senator Gary Peters has long led patient-centered healthcare reforms — a commitment that has made a real difference. I hope he will continue that leadership by asking the administration to pursue solutions that protect both affordability and access.
As someone on the front lines of patient care in the Wolverine State, I see how high the stakes are — and I know we can do better than a policy that puts essential treatments out of reach.

Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple wants to make a state roof fortification grant program available to more low- and moderate-income homeowners. (Wes Muller/Louiisiana Illuminator)Louisiana’s program that gives selected homeowners money to install a fortified roof that can resist hurricanes will open registrations for its next grant lottery next week for coastal homeowners and residents in the southeastern region of the state.
Registration for the Louisiana Fortify Homes Program opens at 8 a.m. Tuesday and continues until 5 p.m. Sept. 12. Qualifying homeowners will be randomly selected through a lottery system. 
The Louisiana Department of Insurance, which administers the program, is offering 500 grants this round. Applications will only be accepted from homeowners in Lake Charles, Sulphur, Westlake and what’s described as Louisiana’s Coastal Zone, according to a news release from Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple. 
The Coastal Zone also encompasses many of South Louisiana’s disaster-prone areas such as New Orleans, Jefferson Parish, Houma and some of the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, among others. Homeowners can check if they reside in Louisiana’s Coastal Zone through the Insurance Department’s online map. Click the magnifying glass icon in the bottom right corner of the map and enter an address. Homes within the blue-shaded area of the map are eligible. 
A fortified roof, according to Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety standards, is built with improved materials and techniques that can prevent leaks and withstand winds of up to 150 mph, lowering the risk of storm damage and typically leading to lower homeowner insurance rates. 
Homeowners who registered for the roof grant lotteries in September 2024 or February 2025 will be automatically registered for this new round. Anyone who registered for a grant lottery before last September must sign up again to participate, Temple said.
To register, homeowners must create a profile on the Fortify Homes website by clicking the “Login” button. Homeowners who previously created a profile can use it for this and future rounds. After creating and logging into their profile, homeowners must register during the registration period, Sept 2-12. 
People who register on the last day of the registration period have the same chance of being selected as those who register on the first day, so there is no need to rush to register as soon as the period opens, Temple said.
Each grant provides up to $10,000 toward the purchase and installation of a fortified roof. Unlike a loan, a grant is a sum of money that does not need to be paid back. The Louisiana Legislature has funded the program in an effort to reduce the skyrocketing cost of homeowner insurance in the state. 
The insurance department has issued more than 3,700 grants since launching the program in 2023. Louisiana Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack reviewed the program and found the grants directly reduced insurance costs at a median rate of 22%.
Homeowners would still need to cover any costs that exceed the grant amount. They also might need to pay for some of the work upfront because the state issues the grant checks directly to the roofing contractors only after they complete the job. Only approved contractors from a list the insurance department maintains are eligible to perform the work.
A full list of homeowner rules and requirements can be found at the department’s website, fortifyhomes.la.gov or by calling (800) 259-5300.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A federal judge on Thursday dismissed claims in a lawsuit filed by Cherokee Nation Entertainment LLC over a voter-approved constitutional amendment that hindered its efforts to build a casino in Pope County. 
Cherokee Nation Entertainment, Cherokee Nation Businesses LLC and Jennifer McGill sued the state and members of the Arkansas Racing Commission in November after voters approved a statewide ballot initiative that repealed Cherokee Nation Entertainment’s casino license and requires countywide elections for future casinos in the state.
The lawsuit argued the new Amendment 104 “unconstitutionally violates” plaintiffs’ rights under the due process clause, the contract clause, the equal protection clause and the takings clause of the United States Constitution. 
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge D. P. Marshall Jr. dismissed claims under the contract clause and the bill of attainder clause with prejudice, which means those claims cannot be refiled. Marshall dismissed the remaining claims, including under the takings clause, without prejudice. 
Cherokee Nation Entertainment sues Arkansas over passage of anti-casino amendment

“I applaud today’s ruling, which sided with the State of Arkansas and the Arkansas Racing Commissioners on all issues,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement. 
Meanwhile, plaintiffs are considering their options.
“We are reviewing all aspects of the judge’s ruling and considering next steps in the legal process,” Cherokee Nation Businesses spokesperson Allison Brum said in an emailed statement. 
Thursday’s ruling is the latest chapter in a yearslong saga over the Pope County casino. Approved by Arkansas voters in 2018, Amendment 100 authorized four casinos in the state — the two existing in Crittenden and Garland counties (Southland and Oaklawn) and two new ones in Jefferson and Pope counties. 
While the other three casinos have been operating with no issues, issuance of the Pope County casino license has been tied up in litigation for years.
After the Arkansas Racing Commission awarded the casino license to Cherokee Nation Entertainment in June 2024, Gulfside Casino Partnership, another license applicant, filed a lawsuit challenging the issuance of the license. 
The issue was further complicated when voters approved Amendment 104 last November, which repealed the Pope County casino license and requires new casinos in the state to be approved by a countywide special election.
Cherokee Nation Entertainment purchased 325 acres northeast of Russellville for the construction of Legends Resort & Casino. The group also had a $38.8-million economic development agreement to be distributed to Pope County. 
Plaintiffs’ attorneys argued in court documents that Amendment 104 interferes with contracts associated with the casino project, which violates the Constitution’s contract clause.  
While the other casino licenses issued under Amendment 100 have remained valid through Amendment 104, plaintiffs’ attorneys argued the Pope County license is being treated differently and therefore violates the equal protection clause. 
Regarding the takings clause, plaintiffs’ legal counsel argued that the new amendment illegally takes property from Cherokee Nation Entertainment by voiding its casino license. Additionally, Amendment 100, the casino license and Cherokee Nation Entertainment’s contract with Pope County all create property rights, according to court documents.
In addressing allegations of violating the contract clause, Price argued in Thursday’s 32-page memorandum and order that Amendment 104 doesn’t interfere with Cherokee Nation’s ownership of the hundreds of acres it purchased.
“The land is no doubt much less valuable now that Amendment 104 has scuttled casino gaming in Pope County,” Price wrote. “But the Cherokee took a calculated business risk.”
Price also said that Amendment 104 is not a bill of attainder because it did not single out Cherokee Nation Entertainment for punishment. A bill of attainder means it imposes a legislative punishment without due process.  
On the takings claims, Price notes that Cherokee Nation is seeking just compensation for the total value of its casino license and the reduced value of the 325 acres purchased in Pope County. That just compensation can be sought from the Arkansas State Claims Commission and the General Assembly, he said.
“That the available other way is administrative and legislative, rather than judicial, does not render it inadequate … The Court is not persuaded that, at this point, the Cherokee can seek takings damages here,” Price wrote.

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
Midwest farm economies suffered while some Sun Belt states kept rolling in early 2025

The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Officials predict only 5% of North Dakota Medicaid recipients will be impacted by program changes

Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

Ilhan Omar (right) call for a ban on assault rifles and high capacity magazines at a news conference with fellow Democrats and gun safety advocates in Minneapolis City Hall on Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Federal, state and city Democratic lawmakers joined gun safety advocates to call for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines on Thursday, a day after a shooter killed two children and injured 17 others during morning Mass at a Catholic school in south Minneapolis in one of the worst mass shootings in Minnesota’s history.
The shooting at Annunciation Church and school set off a morbidly familiar routine in the United States, where firearms are the leading cause of death for children and teens: candle light vigils, thoughts and prayers from politicians and partisan deadlock over how to prevent the next massacre.
“Thoughts and prayers are not going to cut it,” said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey at a news conference in City Hall flanked by more than two dozen lawmakers and scores of supporters. “We need action at the federal level. We need action at the state level. We need coordination with the cities around the country.”
Thousands of Minnesotans mourn the death of two children after Annunciation Church shooting

Law enforcement said the shooter used three legally purchased firearms to carry out the attack — a shotgun, a handgun and a semiautomatic rifle. In a now-deleted YouTube video, a person police believe to be the shooter shows a handwritten notebook entry saying it was “shockingly easy” to obtain a firearm at a pawnshop, according to the Star Tribune.
The shooter fired more than 100 rounds into the church from the outside while children and parishioners ducked for cover under church pews.
“A 10-year-old boy had more courage hiding in a church pew while his friend shielded him with his body than I have seen from far too many lawmakers more beholden to a gun lobby than a child,” said Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of the national gun safety advocacy group Moms Demand Action.
The injured included 15 children ranging in age from 6 to 15 and three parishioners in their 80s. As of Wednesday evening, one adult and five children were in critical condition at Hennepin Healthcare with four other victims receiving treatment for non-life threatening injuries. Three children were still being treated at Children’s Minnesota as of Thursday morning with four victims discharged.
Minnesota Republican House Floor Leader Harry Niska criticized Democrats for diminishing the power of prayer in their calls for action.
“Some people have said thoughts and prayers aren’t enough. Well I believe in the power of prayer. Prayer is such an important part of what we start with,” Niska said in a video posted to X. 
Niska voted against the state’s red flag law and background check requirement for private gun sales.
Gun violence has come shockingly close to the lawmakers tasked with whether or how to regulate it. Earlier this summer, a gunman killed Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband and wounded Sen. John Hoffman, DFL-Champlin, and his wife in a politically motivated attack.
Assault rifles and high capacity magazines were banned in the United States from 1994 until 2004, when the ban expired after Congress chose not to renew it. Available research, while limited, shows there is evidence that bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines decrease mass shootings like the one at Annunciation Church. Former President Joe Biden urged Congress to renew the ban, but was unsuccessful.
“This is not a big issue for us to solve, like curing cancer or AIDS,” said U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar. “This is something that is simple — a simple ban to make sure people who should not have access to these weapons do not get them.”
State legislators vowed to introduce a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, though the chances of such a bill passing in a divided Legislature seem dim.
Democrats had control of the Legislature for two years and failed to pass a statewide ban. Democratic House Floor Leader Jamie Long of Minneapolis said he had the bill drafted but didn’t introduce it because he didn’t think they were ready.
“We’re ready now,” Long said. “It shouldn’t have taken tragedy coming to Minnesota to be ready.”
Democrats did pass a slate of gun control laws when they held power in 2023 and 2024. They instituted an extreme risk protection order, or “red flag,” law that allows family members or police to ask judges to take guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.
They also passed universal background check requirements on private gun sales as well as increased penalties for possession of converted machine guns and “straw purchases” when people buy guns for someone not legally allowed to possess them.
One gun safety measure — a ban on binary triggers which increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons  — was recently struck down by a judge because it passed in a monster, 1,400-page bill that violated the state Constitution’s requirement that laws are confined to a single subject.
“We cannot become numb to this… There is more we can do,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who represents Annunciation Church. “Everyday people need to be safe doing everyday things.”

Gino Bulso, right of Ogles, are tied in one poll for the GOP nomination in Congressional District 7. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District seat is heating up – or turning weird – depending on your perspective.
Responding to a poll this week that proclaimed a four-way tie in the crowded Republican primary, state Rep. Lee Reeves’ congressional campaign issued a statement calling the Spry Strategies survey a “totally fake ‘poll’ with less credibility than the Robert Mueller Report and the Steele Dossier,” referring to allegations of Trump-Russia connections a decade ago. 
Reeves’ group further said it was run by a “fake Never Trumper firm” connected to former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, both of whom were convicted this year on federal corruption charges.
Reeves’ campaign sent out the missive after the conservative advocacy group, Americans for Prosperity – Tennessee, released polling results showing Reeves and state Rep. Gino Bulson tied with 19.9% each, Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson with 18.6% and former General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps at 15.9%. All were within the 4.4% margin of error for the survey conducted from Aug. 19-23 for the 7th District race to replace former U.S. Rep. Mark Green.
While Reeves’ people were belly-aching, Bulso’s campaign claimed he “surged” into a tie for first in the AFP poll after entering the race just weeks ago, enabling him to take part in an upcoming debate.
Poll shows dead heat between top four Republicans in Tennessee special congressional election

Both candidates claim to be the one most capable of carrying out President Donald Trump’s agenda. In fact, every Republican candidate in the country is saying the same thing.
Bulso, who spends most of his energy driving a stake into the heart of the LGBTQ+ community, said he gained momentum from endorsements by state Rep. Jay Reedy and NASCAR Hall of Fame racer Darrell Waltrip.
Barrett, the target of a dark money group called the School Freedom Fund over opposition to private-school vouchers, also is promising to “stand with President Trump and fight the liberal elites trying to destroy our way of life.” He touts himself as Tennessee’s first lawmaker to earn a “perfect conservative voting record” on a report connected to Williamson County-based Tennessee Stands and posts a picture of himself with country music star John Rich, an ultra-conservative voice on state issues.
Van Epps, a West Point graduate who served multiple tours of duty, received the endorsement of Green, also a West Point guy who served as an Army physician and interviewed captured Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
It should be noted that Spry Strategies touts a 93.7% accuracy rate within margins of error and 94.5% rate in predicting key primary and general election outcomes. The firm also posts a testimonial on its site saying its services are “essential” to Tennessee’s House Republican Caucus and Speaker Cameron Sexton.
Wait a second. Hold on a minute. Isn’t Reeves a member of that caucus? Don’t they hang on AFP’s every word?

Oh well, this election wouldn’t be any fun if candidates weren’t beating each other over the head.
In the Democrats’ column, state Rep. Vincent Dixie of Nashville landed an endorsement this week from Square One, which looks for “the most promising” people of color, women and LGBTQ+ community to run for Congress in red districts and states.
State Rep. Bo Mitchell of Nashville touted endorsements by four unions, including Teamsters Local 480, Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 572, Iron Workers Local 492 and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Division 129.
State Rep. Aftyn Behn of East Nashville landed an endorsement from Indivisible Tennessee, a grassroots organization that focuses on progressive issues.
Tunnel vision
It appears Elon Musk is going to bore his way into the brains of Americans.
Not only is his Boring Company building tunnels under Las Vegas for Tesla service from one casino to another, the company plans to dig a series of tunnels in Nashville, possibly from the state Capitol to the Music City Center and the airport to ensure tourists don’t further clog the interstate system. As if they’re the culprits for Nashville’s traffic terror.
Besides the Tesla tunnels, Musk wants to build a system of tunnels around a large watershed in Houston, Texas as part of a plan to avert flooding after a 2017 storm killed dozens of people there. ProPublica, the Houston Chronicle and The Texas Tribune combined to report on Musk’s push for the project with U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, banking on the claim that Boring could lower the cost for a key segment of the project to $760 million from $4.6 billion. The entire system is estimated to cost $30 billion, according to the report.
The catch is that Musk wants 15% of the expense up front from local and state governments.
The other problem is that, despite claims by Tennessee officials that Boring has the expertise to dig tunnels, its record in Vegas is spotty. Another ProPublica report showed the company built tunnels without permits for work on country property, dumped untreated water into storm drains and sewers, then was fined over workers’ complaints about severe burns and muck spills. The  company is contesting those violations.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee continued to defend the project and Boring Company this week when asked by WPLN – Nashville Public Radio about the “Music City Loop” cutting through the Mill Creek area, home to a federally-protected crayfish, as well as the potential for affecting sinkholes in that part of Nashville.
Calling it a “highly-professional, global company,” Lee said Boring understands that environmental permitting is required.
“They’ve shown that they have a great desire to follow the process as laid out by the state to work with our agencies,” Lee said.
The remaining question is whether Boring will have to abide by Metro Nashville permitting and emergency services requirements, since the tunnels are supposed to run on state right of way underneath state-owned roads and highways. 
All we’re waiting for is a Trump endorsement.
Back in the saddle
Former Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell is resurfacing on the board of the Sycamore Institute, an independent, nonpartisan public policy research center that provides information on critical topics. 
Harwell, a distinguished visiting professor at MTSU and former Tennessee Valley Authority board member, will be joined by Garnett Decosimo of Decosimo Corporate Finance, who has worked for Gov. Lee and former U.S. Sen. Bob Corker. 
Giving “a voice to the voiceless”
Fresh off a presidential pardon on a federal fraud conviction, former state Sen. Brian Kelsey received newfound hope from the Tennessee Supreme Court to come to a courtroom near you.
The court recently ruled that Kelsey, despite pleading guilty to a felony, could start practicing law again, the Tennessee Journal reported.
According to the article, Kelsey said he’s “excited” to be defending people who need representation. “We should try to give a voice to the voiceless,” he said.
Sounds as if he’s doing a 180 from the days he blocked expansion of Medicaid to some 300,000 underinsured, working Tennesseans. 
Judge’s ruling turns spotlight on Tennessee’s worn, torn safety net

But there’s a tiny sticking point. The Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility will have to give its stamp of approval. The prediction here is he will practice law again in Tennessee. The question is: Who will hire him?
Readers might recall he tried to renege on his guilty plea, claiming he didn’t understand the intricacies of criminal law, even though he was a lawyer who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee.
He represented plaintiffs who favored private-school vouchers, but that legal fight is done. Before his conviction, he worked as a senior counsel for Liberty Justice Center, a national law firm that litigated constitutional questions, often taking on unions. 
If he’s interested in representing the “voiceless,” he should be able to find plenty of clients. But do those really include private-school students and anti-union folks?

(Getty Images)The news is filled with stories of how the Trump administration and its so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have fired thousands of federal employees who work for our public land agencies. Though Trump had been talking about gutting the federal workforce, the way it was done without regard for how it would affect the agencies’ ability to carry out their responsibilities came as quite a shock.
As one U.S. Forest Service wilderness ranger wrote in a recent Wilderness Watch blog: “The dust has had time to settle, and we can now assess the damage. All probationary Forest Service employees in ‘non-fire’ positions were fired. There are almost no wilderness rangers left in my state and many of my neighboring states. Beyond Wilderness, there are almost no field-going recreation employees left. The temporaries are gone, the permanent seasonals are gone. Without staff, many ranger districts will struggle to even utilize volunteers.”
‘Crafting a compromise’: Idaho’s Boulder-White Clouds celebrate 10 years of wilderness protection

In a recent meeting that Wilderness Watch attended, the Forest Service described the impacts of cuts to the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in central Washington. The popular and spectacular Enchantments area of the Wilderness typically has 10-12 wilderness rangers each summer who patrol and clean up after the 100,000 visitors that descend on the area each year. This year there will be only one wilderness ranger, who will have to share their time between the Enchantments and another 150,000 acres of Wilderness on the ranger district. It’s an utterly impossible task that will result in significant damage to these priceless lands. Similar stories are playing out in other Wildernesses as the Trump cuts kick in.
The layoffs, firings, and forced early retirements didn’t just hit field-going crews. For the Forest Service, the national program leader has left, and eight of the nine regional offices are now without wilderness staff. Major cuts have hit Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service programs as well. The combination of chaotic firings and early retirements means the most experienced agency wilderness people are now gone.
Yet the untold story is that the downfall of wilderness programs has been a long time in the making. By the time Trump and Musk started recklessly eliminating jobs, Wilderness was one of the areas already hardest hit — not because of sheer numbers laid off or fired, but because there were already relatively few wilderness staff left. This is especially true for the Forest Service, which historically had far and away the most robust wilderness program, but has been gradually shrinking its wilderness crews for years.
The Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness straddling the Bitterroot Mountains along the Montana-Idaho border is a case in point. At more than 1.3 million acres, the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness is the third largest national forest Wilderness in the entire country. In the early 1990s, it had nine permanent wilderness rangers, eight seasonal wilderness rangers, an entire ranger district — the Moose Creek Ranger District — dedicated solely to the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, and a wilderness coordinator for the wilderness programs across the six ranger districts and three national forests that oversee it. By 2019, however, this robust wilderness program had dwindled to just three permanent and one seasonal wilderness rangers. The coordinator position was gone, and the Moose Creek District had been merged with an adjacent multiple-use district.
Last fall, things got even worse, even before DOGE and Trump, when then-Forest Service Chief Randy Moore announced that in 2025 there would be no hiring of temporary (seasonal) employees — a group that has historically made up a significant number of wilderness rangers and trail crew. For many Wildernesses, Moore’s edict was going to result in no field presence at all. And numbers tell only part of the story. What was also being lost was decades of institutional knowledge, the traditional skills necessary to steward Wilderness, and a voice within the agencies standing up for Wilderness when harmful projects are planned.
Wilderness Watch had raised this concern for decades, but it had been ignored by agency leaders, Congress, and the media. The Forest Service, and to a lesser extent the BLM, tried to cover up their lack of commitment to their wilderness programs by bringing on volunteers to replace professional, seasoned rangers. But now there aren’t enough rangers to even manage the volunteers, so in most cases much of that help is now gone too.
So, what can be done? In the short term, we can hope that the recent DOGE firings will be reversed, either by the courts or by urging our elected officials to restore funding for the agency programs. That could help hold off some of the damage that will undoubtedly occur over the next few years. And we must all redouble our efforts to push back against destructive proposals we know are headed our way.
Longer term, we need a durable response to the decades-long neglect and animus toward Wilderness that, for many years, has been the hallmark of the four agencies that manage Wilderness. We need a fundamental change to how Wilderness is administered and safeguarded across the land.
Twenty-five years ago, the four federal land agencies commissioned the Pinchot Institute for Conservation to do an assessment of their wilderness programs. The panel consisted of a number of wilderness luminaries, and it took input from wilderness conservationists and wilderness critics around the country. But it spent most of its time talking with federal agency wilderness leaders themselves. The report recognized the unique challenges of protecting and preserving Wilderness and the dedication of many of the staff involved, but nonetheless concluded that the agencies’ collective lack of commitment would lead to the eventual loss of the Wilderness System.
One of the panelists, former Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall, who served in both Congress and the Cabinet (as well as on the Wilderness Watch board of directors), was unequivocal in his conclusion that the four land management agencies weren’t up to the task. He urged the panel to recommend that the overarching responsibilities for Wilderness be placed in a new agency, one dedicated solely to the wilderness task. In calling for creating a new “National Wilderness Service,” Udall wrote:
“We must show the courage to suggest and promote alternatives that will create real change. We should pursue them with the energy and boldness of people like Bob Marshall and Howard Zahniser, who promoted an idea that seemed extreme in their day, but that most Americans now take for granted.”
When the dust settles, attempting to recreate the situation that existed prior to the Trump raids would be a fool’s errand, destined to condemn our precious National Wilderness Preservation System to the dustbin of history. Rather, we should see the near total elimination of the current failing programs as an opportunity to create something much better, a new entity that is passionate about the challenge of protecting and preserving our incomparable National Wilderness Preservation System. Udall’s call for a National Wilderness Service totally dedicated to that cause, and filled with public servants truly committed to that charge, is a great place to start.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Sept. 5 hearing at the Nebraska Capitol will offer state lawmakers opportunity to listen to concerns and rationale about new and higher Medicaid reimbursement rates the state has implemented for services to young people with autism.
Advocates for young Nebraskans with autism have expressed worry that access to services will suffer because the state on Aug. 1 implemented new reduced reimbursement rates for applied behavioral analysis services.
Cuts range from 28% to as much as 79%, advocates have said. Also known as ABA, the therapy and support helps youths with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental and social communication delays function better in society.
Advocates fear for autistic Nebraska youths as cuts come to Medicaid reimbursement rates

Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data indicates that about one in 31 children is affected by autism spectrum disorder.
Set to begin at 9 a.m., the Sept. 5 hearing before the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee in Room 1525 is limited to invited testifiers only. 
But the public is welcome to attend to hear the conversation, said Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, committee chair. 
The hearing was called as part of a legislative study authorized by Legislative Resolution 191, which allowed the committee to examine issues or topics that arise between legislative sessions.
The topic has heated up since the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services announced the ABA rate adjustments.
 State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. July 31, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“Legislative offices throughout the state, including Sen. Hardin’s office, have heard from families and providers about ongoing access to ABA services,” said a media statement from the HHS Committee.
Hardin said that ABA therapy plays a vital role for Nebraska families and children.
“With this service drawing attention from the media and concern from families, it’s critical that the HHS Committee hear directly from stakeholders and work towards a sustainable solution,” he said.
The goal, according to the statement, is to gather data about access and costs, analyze potential solutions and develop recommendations that could include the introduction of new legislation or changes to existing law. 
DHHS officials have said that rising costs of the ABA program could threaten service sustainability. They say Nebraska currently has the highest reimbursement rates of any state ABA program — leading to an increase in state expenses of more than 2,000% since 2020. 
Five years ago, Nebraska Medicaid paid about $4.6 million for ABA services. Last year, the amount soared to $85.6 million.

That changed in 2004 when FBI agent Dale Killinger began reinvestigating Till’s lynching.
The longtime owner of the weapon, who asked not to be named for fear of harassment or retribution, said the FBI kept the gun “for a year almost to the day.”
On Thursday, the .45-caliber pistol that J.W. Milam is believed to have used to pistol-whip and shoot the Black Chicago teen became part of the Emmett Till Exhibit at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. 
In World War II, Milam served as a lieutenant in the Army Air Force and brought back the Ithaca Model M1911-A1 .45-caliber pistol.
Milam and his half-brother, Roy Bryant, abducted Till from his great uncle’s home in the wee hours of Aug. 28, 1955. The white men heard that Till had reportedly wolf-whistled at Bryant’s wife Carolyn.
They took Till to a barn, where Bryant, Milam and others brutally beat him. Witnesses heard Till’s screams.
Till was beaten so badly there was talk of dropping him off at a hospital, but Milam killed him with a single bullet.

An all-white jury acquitted the half-brothers of Till’s murder. They later admitted to Look magazine they had indeed killed Till, who had just celebrated his 14th birthday.
During the FBI’s investigation of the Till murder, authorities exhumed his body. X-rays revealed extensive skull fractures and metallic fragments in the skull. There were also fractures to the left femur and the left and right wrist bones. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office in Illinois concluded that Till died of a gunshot wound to the head.
During the autopsy, doctors found four lead fragments that experts determined were consistent with lead shot pellets. The FBI learned that the size of those pellets matched the size of the lead shot manufactured for the Army Air Force.
The longtime owner said his father was a gun collector and a friend of one of the lawyers who defended the half-brothers. He said his father got the gun from one of those lawyers around 1959 or 1960.
Years after his father died, he said his mother announced that she wanted the gun out of the house. She gave it to his sister, and from that moment on, the siblings became the gun’s owners.
The longtime gun owner said the family knew they had something of historical value, but “none of our children cared about or wanted the gun.”
In recent years, they had offers from private collectors to sell the gun, but “we didn’t want to go that route,” he said.
Instead, they decided to make the gun available to the foundation for the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, which in turn has added the weapon to the Civil Rights Museum.
The gun makes a lighted appearance during a 6-minute film about the case, narrated by Oprah Winfrey.
It’s the second such weapon in the department’s possession. The first is the .30-06 rifle used in 1963 to kill Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers, which can also be seen at the museum.
The FBI’s borrowing of the gun proved fortuitous. During the year the FBI had the weapon, the longtime owner said his sister suffered a break-in during which guns were stolen.
The thief never got a shot at the .45 that changed the course of history.
From that moment forward, the gun spent its days in a safety deposit box in a bank in Greenwood, the longtime owner recalled. “It could have been lost, but the truth is, it was never hidden.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/26093056/Emmett-Till-grave.jpeg,,,2025-08-29 06:56:29.587459

Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
Jasmine Bernard, a 16-year-old Memphis-Shelby County Schools student, remembers gaps in ceiling tiles and constant lighting issues at her middle school.
Like many other schools in the district, Bernard said, John P. Freeman Optional is “critically underfunded.”
“I can’t deny that the school definitely needs renovations,” she told Chalkbeat Tennessee. “And the Memphis education system needs funding.”
But Bernard, now a junior at University High School, doesn’t think turning to Elon Musk’s xAI for help is the answer.
In July, the MSCS school board voted to accept an unspecified amount of money from xAI to fix deferred maintenance issues at John P. Freeman Optional as well as Fairley, Mitchell, and Westwood high schools in Southwest Memphis. It’s not yet clear how much money the district will accept from the company, though a 2024 facilities report estimated those four buildings need $61 million for repairs over the next decade.
Bernard and a small group of student activists say xAI’s funding comes with a moral and environmental cost. She leads Youth Minds United, a climate justice group for Memphis-Shelby County students that helped organize protests and community meetings against xAI in the spring.
“xAI isn’t giving the schools a gift or an innocent ‘here you go; we’re helping the community,’” Bernard said. “It’s part of a bigger scheme to hide how they’re inherently disrupting the futures of the young people who go to those schools and live in those communities.”
Student and community activists say the AI company is contributing to toxic air pollution in historically Black Memphis neighborhoods. Research links supercomputer sites like the one in Memphis to premature deaths for neighboring residents and increased asthma and disease risk from gas turbines that the centers use for power.

xAI did not respond to Chalkbeat Tennessee requests for comment. But the company has previously denied contributions to environmental pollution in the area, saying in a July statement on X that its turbines are “equipped with state-of-the-art emissions control technology, making this facility the lowest emitting of its kind in the country.”
Watchdog organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency and American Lung Association already report high rates of pollution in Shelby County, citing toxic emissions from factories in Southwest Memphis. Local residents also face high rates of respiratory illness and other adverse health effects.
“You can give the school $100,000 for a smart board, but that doesn’t erase the fact that when [students] go home, it smells like gas,” said Rubi Salgado, a junior at Frederick Douglass High School who leads the Shelby County High School Democrats.
But MSCS is in need of funding, with school buildings districtwide needing over $1.6 billion in maintenance repairs over the next decade.
A committee of local officials is just starting to create a plan to mitigate rising costs, which is expected to include some school closures. During its first meeting in early August, students said that deteriorating building conditions are negatively impacting their ability to learn.
xAI is pledging to fix many of the specific concerns raised by those students, such as HVAC and plumbing systems. The AI company is focusing on four schools with some of the most dire facilities needs in the district, according to The Daily Memphian.
Bernard says that just shows xAI is “really good at propaganda.”
“They are focusing on things that historically, the community has needed and they have not received,” she said. “But I don’t want to frame it in a way that makes them seem like saviors or anything, because they’re not.”
Bobby White, policy advisor for the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce, has been a community advocate for xAI officials in school board meetings and community hearings. He said the district is currently finalizing a memorandum of understanding with the company.
White said xAI is “doing everything within their power to ensure that they are as environmentally conscious as they can be.”
The company received approval from the Shelby County Health Department in early July to operate 15 methane-fueled gas turbines, after the city found no early evidence of increased air pollution. But some community members and experts question the validity of those results, saying the testing didn’t measure key pollutants or follow Environmental Protection Agency standards.
White said he commends students for paying attention to issues affecting their schools.
“I think the unfortunate part is that we’ve had a community that has been whipped into a frenzy, thinking that officials have not done their jobs by holding a company accountable,” he said, “when, in fact, officials have done their job by ensuring they’re applying the law.”
MSCS board member Natalie McKinney said she wants to see xAI commit to being a “collaborative partner” with the district, not a one-time donor. Part of that, she said, includes addressing the “valid and legitimate concerns” about potential air pollution.
“As long as they are here and are expressing they want to be good neighbors, then let’s figure out what that looks like,” McKinney said. “We have obligations, I think, to ask these questions and figure out how we can potentially mitigate some of these concerns.”
White contends that xAI leaders aren’t trying to win the public’s favor and the donation to schools is a “gift” for neighbors living near the company’s second facility, which is still under construction in Southaven.
Earlier this month, the company purchased over 60 gas turbines to be delivered to the Colossus 2 site – but it’s unclear whether they will actually be used to power the facility there.
Rubi Salgado, the Frederick Douglass junior, said she doesn’t believe it’s possible for xAI to establish a trusting relationship with the community.
“People are getting hurt due to the increase in pollution, and I don’t think that anything that they do except stopping is going to make up for what they’ve done,” they said.

Dr. Rana Alissa hears it daily in the clinic.
“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Later on Thursday, the Trump administration named one of Kennedy’s top deputies, Jim O’Neill, to serve as the CDC’s acting director.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.
Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Trump’s bid to support coal could cost ratepayers billions, report finds

Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.

 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.

“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
California and Texas
California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.

One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
Federal vaccine guidance is changing, but Colorado was prepared to push back

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)FREDERICKTOWN — Democrats all over America are trying to fix their party. Last weekend, in 30 hours in the heart of rural Kentucky and its largest city, crowds of 200 Democrats came together, and they had many ideas, from fighting to talking to listening.
On Saturday in downtown Louisville, amid buildings where he once ruled, former Mayor Harvey Sloane, 89, headlined a rally for Medicaid and Medicare. On Sunday in Fredericktown, Democrats from Washington, Marion, Nelson and other counties heard local party leaders and 2026 candidates in the three congressional districts (1st, 2nd and 4th) that adjoin four miles southwest.
The fate of the Democratic Party in Kentucky lies in places like Fredericktown, which was Fredericksburg until World War I, but the old nickname lives on; hence the three-county “Rally at The Burg,” now in its fourth year under leadership of Bardstown’s Kenny Fogle.
“If we revive the Democratic Party, it won’t be from the national level. It won’t be from the state level. It’ll be county by county by county,” Fogle said to applause. Other lines that got a hand:
“You were born for a time like this,” said state Rep. Pam Stevenson of Louisville, running for U.S. senator. “Find one thing you can do, and do it.”
 “Donald Trump’s use of the National Guard and federal troops is not in keeping with our long history nor with the traditions of our Constitution,” said George Wright, head of the Kentucky Democratic Party Veterans Council.
 “What we’re up against is not just one politician. It’s the rise of Christian nationalism and white supremacy,” said Monica Dean, a 4th District candidate. “Christian nationalism is not Christianity. Christianity teaches love, compassion and justice. Christian nationalism preaches power, fear and exclusion, and it’s being used as a weapon to divide our communities and take away our freedoms.”
Former 3rd District U.S. Rep. Mike Ward of Louisville, the Burg keynoter, also won applause in Kentucky’s Roman Catholic heartland with a Christian theme. Quoting a hymn that says “We are called to love . . . one another,” Ward was among those at both events who urged Democrats to witness to friends and neighbors about Medicaid restrictions and other issues.
Kentucky still has many religious people willing to vote Democratic, as shown by Gov. Andy Beshear’s routine references to his faith, but religious-related issues are the main reason he’s the only independently elected Democrat in statewide office. The party’s 40-year decline can be dated to 1980, when Republicans put opposition to abortion rights in their platform.
Then came other social issues, some noted by Avral Thompson, president of Teamsters Local 89, which helped pay for the Burg rally: “People like to pick out one subject that they don’t like and forget about everything else important to them and vote just on that, whether it’s gay rights, where it’s guns, whether it’s God – you know, the three Gs always hang up everybody, right?”
That was the plainest public talk on a picture-perfect Sunday afternoon. The crowd seemed to get less energy from the rhetoric than from the event’s camaraderie. Democrats are now in a political minority in their rural counties, and that has made many of them reluctant to speak up locally.
“It feels good to be with people of like minds,” said Jim Coffey, who came from Liberty in heavily Republican Casey County.
James Spragens of Lebanon in Marion County, once one of the state’s most Democratic, told me, “People just gotta feel better. They need to lift their spirits. It’s pretty depressing every day.” 
His neighbor, Steve Brady, cited the new “Alligator Alcatraz” prison in the Everglades: “That’s inhuman. That’s not American.”
In Louisville, heath care was the focus. Third District Rep. Morgan McGarvey told the Jefferson Square crowd, “This is not some political rally. This is life or death. . . . Medicaid isn’t a budget line, it’s a lifeline.” He said Democrats must go beyond online comments and “Get out there and talk to people.”
But Carpenters Union leader Steve Barger cautioned in an interview, “I think we ought to do a little more listening and a lot less pontificating.” And former state House Speaker Pro Tem Larry Clark told me the party must stress pocketbook issues and find good candidates. “They can’t run on a national ticket,” he said. “It’s gotta be a local race, tied to the local issues, and it’s got to be somebody that they can connect with.”
Louisville lawyer Steve Miller gave me a broader view: “There needs to be a plan that is compelling and understandable to the vast majority of American voters about how American government, business and the social contract can be rewritten to make this nation competitive and compassionate for the future.” Miller, raised in Owenton and Bardstown, said rural voters are key: “Democrats have to move past the mere words and get into the real work of connecting with people outside of metropolitan areas.”
Former Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who ran for senator in the 2008 Democratic primary, implicitly offered ways to bridge the rural-urban divide: “We need to be reminded of what we’re supposed to be as a country and get people who are unabashed to stand up and say that; not just what we’re against, but what we’re for,” he told me. “We’re supposed to be a country that gives everyone an opportunity. We’re supposed to be a country that embraces our potential, which only comes through diverse thought and hustle and entrepreneurship. . . .

Soon after: a host of retaliatory tariffs passed by Canada against American goods. And then, in late August, a new pledge by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to remove most — but not all — of those counter-tariffs by Sept. 1.
The trade policies between the U.S. and its northern neighbor have careened in recent months, sending businesses into uncertainty as President Donald Trump pushes through aggressive and evolving negotiating tactics. 
In New Hampshire, they appear to be having an impact. By June 2025, exports to Canada for the year were 42.6% lower than at the same point in 2024, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Foreign Trade Bureau.
But this fall, lawmakers and state officials are hoping to push past the chaos and make a simple pitch: The Granite State is still open for business. 
Over multiple days in early September, New Hampshire leaders will carry out a trade mission with Canadian and American businesses to try to strengthen cross border ties. The efforts will culminate in Quebec City, when Gov. Kelly Ayotte will participate in what has been billed as an “intimate reception” for politicians and business leaders at a Hilton hotel.
Plans for the trade mission, which are still under development, include a Sept. 8 bus tour to Nova Scotia — by way of Littleton — with business leaders from both countries, according to Sen. Tim McGough, a Merrimack Republican and the chairman of the New Hampshire Canadian Trade Council. That will be followed by a journey to Quebec ahead of the event with the governor, 
“We’re pretty happy to have a good contingent of significant business leaders joining us on the bus,” said McGough during a council meeting Monday.
“They’re a captive audience,” he added, speaking of the Canadian business representatives. “And they’re looking forward to the captive audience too.”

The effort comes as New Hampshire’s economy has shown signs it has been affected by the trade war between Washington and Ottawa. 
Canada is still New Hampshire’s No. 2 export country, bolstered in large part by sales of aircraft and spacecraft parts from companies such as Marmon Aerospace & Defense and GE Aviation. The state also sends machinery and fabricated metal products, according to a 2019 fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Commerce. But while in the full 2024 calendar year, the Granite State sent $1.2 billion worth of products over the northern border, it had only sent about $400 million by June of this year.   
In contrast, exports to New Hampshire’s leading export country, Germany, were 3.2% higher in June 2025 than in June 2024. And exports to Mexico, the state’s third highest importer, were up 14.9% in June. 
Overall, New Hampshire’s exports to all countries, which totaled $7.1 billion in all of 2024, were down 4.19% in June. 
Uncertain times
The state’s Department of Business and Economic Affairs is watching those numbers. 
The department cannot be certain the drop in exports to Canada was caused by the tariffs; it could be supply chain changes that are unrelated, said Adam Boltik, program manager of the department’s Office of International Commerce. 
“But with something like a 40% drop, that does make you look,” he said in an interview. 
To help businesses keep up with the changing conditions, the BEA has regularly posted the latest tariffs on a page on its website. But Boltik said companies must make their own decisions over what to do with that information. 
“We are here to be a resource,” he said. That can mean helping businesses affected by the tariffs to find “mitigating measures” such as alternative sources for their materials. The department can also help companies look for new markets to sell their products if the Canadian tariffs are hurting their business, he said.
The department is limited in what it knows. While some top line economic figures exist, much of the BEA’s understanding comes from anecdotes. “When companies will come to me and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got this coming in from Country X and all of a sudden, there’s a tariff on it. What happens?’” In many cases, there is no way to collect the aggregate data needed to better understand those anecdotes, he added.
Carney’s announcement that Canada would be lifting many of its retaliatory tariffs is good news for many New Hampshire businesses, Boltik said. Still, there is a new worry. On Friday, Trump’s executive order ending the “de minimus” tariff exception for U.S. imports will take effect. That change will mean that goods coming into the U.S. worth $800 or less, which were previously exempt from tariffs, will suddenly be subject to the taxes.
That, Boltik fears, could lead Canada to retaliate by imposing tariffs on small-dollar imports from the U.S. as well. 
“There may be enough of an outcry from those Canadian producers and small businesses that Canada does something,” he said. 
An enduring relationship
René Sylvestre, Québec’s delegate to New England, is optimistic the longstanding ties between the two geographic reasons can survive the tumult.
“Our economies are so intertwined that we’re still looking to do business and work with companies and folk in New England,” he said in an interview. 
Despite the tariffs, Sylvestre said he hasn’t seen major changes in operations by Québécois companies, partly because the supply chains are so established. That includes aerospace companies.
One source of that optimism: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, passed during the first Trump term as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement protects a swath of products from tariffs, including agriculture, automobile products, textiles, machinery, and digital products. 
“Pretty much most of our products are under the USMCA,” Sylvestre said.
That agreement did not stop the Trump administration from adding 25% tariffs to automobiles, steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, which the White House has said is allowed by security exceptions. 
Sylvestre said trade missions such as the one in September are intended to reassure businesses.And the idea has precedent: In April, soon after the tariff standoff kicked off, a delegation of Canadian businesses visited Portsmouth for a similar trade mission. 
Tourism decline
If businesses are staying the course, tourism is a different story. The number of tourists visiting New Hampshire from Canada has dropped around 30% this year, BEA Commissioner Taylor Caswell said earlier this month. 
Animosity toward the United States, in addition to economic anxieties and fears about having trouble at the U.S. border have helped to contribute to the drop in tourism, Sylvestre said.
Before the trade war, there was “a kind of unconditional trust and love” between the countries,” he said. Now, feelings are unsettled.
“It’s really a perfect storm,” he said.

During Monday’s meeting, some said they have seen the effect of the drop in tourism. Janet Wall, a Madbury Democrat, noted that the Seacoast usually sees a late-summer burst of tourism from Canadians. This year, she said, beachside parking lots are not full, and business owners say there has been a “huge decline” in Canadian visitors.
McGough had a different take. Browsing the parking lots of the Merrimack Outlets this year, he has seen plenty of Québec license plates, he said.
The dip in tourism comes after New Hampshire and Canada were only just rebounding from the setbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the land border between the two countries was largely closed. In February 2024, Canadian Consul General for New England Bernadette Jordan paid a visit to the New Hampshire House to tout that turnaround. 
“Whether it’s tourism, whether it’s trade, whether it’s people visiting families: We can’t impede that,” Jordan said in an interview with the Bulletin then. “But we still have to make sure that what we’re doing is still working. It does seem to be working.”
Today, under very different circumstances, Slyvestre hopes that that relationship will endure.
“I see this as one corridor,” he said. “Even though it’s two countries, there are so many things that we’re doing together.”

According to Chalkbeat, “In Denver Public Schools politics, pro-charter organizations like Denver Families Action are on one side and the Denver Classroom Teachers Association union is on the other.”
In the 2023 Denver Public Schools school board race, Denver Families Action spent nearly $1 million through its independent expenditure committee Better Leaders Stronger Schools, outspending “the Denver teachers’ union 5 to 1.” That election nearly tied the record for all-time spending in a DPS school board race at $2.2 million. For the first time, Denver Families Action also paid for TV ads with dark money that featured Denver Mayor Mike Johnston supporting their endorsed candidates.
The money paid off, and all three won.

The Denver Classrooms Teachers Association is rooted in a local, democratic labor process since its funding comes from nearly 4,000 educators. 
Denver Families Action, however, is the “political arm” of Denver Families for Public Schools, an organization whose name might suggest local representation yet it is funded by billionaire donors from outside Denver.
The near-historic spending by Denver Families Action in 2023 has its roots in a national strategy spearheaded by billionaires Reed Hastings and John Arnold. In 2018, a leaked presentation described how their new organization, City Fund, planned to invest $200 million to “increase charter school representation up to 50% in over 40 cities.” Denver has been one of their prime targets. 
City Fund’s investment highlighted the DPS “portfolio model” which closes or replaces neighborhood schools that fail to meet standardized test-score benchmarks and then reopens them as charter schools. Since implementing the portfolio model in 2007, DPS closed or replaced dozens of neighborhood schools. Today, DPS has more than 50 charters. The model also weakens union influence “by reducing the number of schools whose teachers belong to the union, diminishing the union’s membership — and thus its power and its money.”  
City Fund’s strategy has met with some resistance. In 2021, school board members from six cities criticized City Fund and their locally funded “activist groups” writing they “present themselves as local grassroots organizations when nothing could be further from the truth.” They warned that the billionaire-driven privatization erodes local control, divides school districts, and undermines democratic ideals.
Denver’s experience reflects similar concerns. In Denver, financial backing from wealthy advocates of charter schools ensured that pro-charter school board members dominated the board for over a decade. But in 2019, three teacher union-backed candidates unexpectedly won. This raised alarm among charter school advocates who worried the new board might dismantle past reforms, and ongoing enrollment declines also raised concerns.
In response to these events, City Fund helped launch Denver Families for Public Schools with backing from four Denver charter networks: DSST, STRIVE Prep, Rocky Mountain Prep, and University Prep. DFPS’s executive director, Ray Rivera, acknowledged their goal was to elevate the “voices of families who attend these charter schools in Denver and making sure they’re part of the public policy that gets made.” 
DFPS received nearly $4 million from City Fund’s political arm, Campaign for Great Public Schools, and in 2024, they merged with another activist group, RootED, which had received over $34 million from City Fund for charter expansion and grants to community organizations. Their combined resources now total about $8 million, allowing DFPS to hire staff, fund charter schools and community groups, pay canvassers up to $36 an hour, and organize advocacy campaigns to elect pro-charter candidates.
DFPS is led by Pat Donovan, the former managing partner with RootEd, who also chairs the board of Rocky Mountain Prep, a charter network with twelve DPS schools. In addition, Donovan serves on the boards of the Colorado League of Charter Schools and KIPP Colorado. City Fund CEO Marlon Marshall also serves on the board of Rocky Mountain Prep. These overlapping roles highlight how interconnected the interests of City Fund and Denver Families for Public Schools are, and how DFPS is integral in the school privatization movement in Denver.
DCTA’s funding is transparent and tied directly to local educators. By contrast, DFPS’s money originates from a national network of wealthy donors whose priorities do not necessarily align with the entire Denver community. This imbalance means one side can dominate the narrative, drowning out authentic community voices. 
When voters receive glossy mailers or see a targeted ad, they may believe they are hearing from grassroots “families” or “students.” However, the spending often comes from the billionaires who fund Denver Families for Public Schools. This is where democracy is at risk. Without transparency, voters cannot fully assess the motives behind the messaging.
Denver’s school board should prioritize issues like equitable funding, strengthening neighborhood schools, and supporting educators. If the dark money spending levels are repeated, or surpassed, in the 2025 races, local priorities risk being overshadowed by billionaire-backed agendas.
The question for Denver voters this fall is straightforward: Will they allow outside money to dictate the future of their public schools, or will they insist on authentic local voices leading the way?

(Photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Earlier this year, Wit Tuttell and his colleagues at North Carolina’s Visit NC tourism office were carefully watching a key metric in their monthly surveys: how many tourists weren’t coming to the mountains because they thought they weren’t accessible.
North Carolina had for months been blasting out marketing under a campaign designed to bring business back to the area after Hurricane Helene. “The best way for us to get back is for you to come back,” ads pleaded to potential visitors.
Finally, a survey showed less than 10% of people sharing that sentiment — a key watermark. Visit NC pivoted and launched a new campaign: “Rediscover the Unforgettable.”
“We want people to remember what a great experience going to the North Carolina mountains was,” Tuttell told NC Newsline in an interview. “We want them to feel like they can rediscover that. Now is the time they can go back out there.”
In the first full year since the deadliest storm in North Carolina history, tourism has been overall “sluggish,” Tuttell said. He estimated that to date, 2025 spending was “about on par” or “down anywhere from 1-3%” from 2024.
That’s not solely because of the Helene recovery or a slowdown in visitors to the mountains. But those concerns have added yet another layer to a complex tourism landscape, increasingly driven by social media chatter and an uncertain economic future.
North Carolina’s tourism office has responded with almost $14 million in custom advertising campaigns over the past year. They’ve relied on data to adjust “delicate” messaging, luring visitors back while tapping a network of influencers to boost the region across social channels.
Now, even in a “softening” market for leisure travel, Tuttell said, North Carolina as a whole is “faring better than other destinations.”


How VisitNC has pitched the mountains in the year since Helene
Just weeks after Helene flooded western North Carolina, some storefronts and communities — if they were able — opened back up for business. It wasn’t a choice so much as a necessity, in a region so heavily driven by tourism.
Visit NC’s first post-Helene tourism campaign was a cautious one, urging visitors to return and spend money in communities that needed it. But they were careful “not to overpromise.”
“It wasn’t going to be the typical mountain vacation,” Tuttell said. “People felt that they wanted to help, but they didn’t want to interfere. So we had to get the message across that going there wasn’t going to interfere.”
Those early months of advertising were targeted as much at in-state residents as visitors from across the country. That was by design: The state wanted to remind North Carolinians of their fondness for the region — and that their neighbors needed their help.
“We sort of played on their heartstrings with the first few messages,” Tuttell said. “Knowing that people love this area, and have an affinity toward it.”
After about six months, they pivoted to “Rediscover the Unforgettable” and blasted out images of Asheville’s breweries and restaurants, cycling and rafting in the Smokies and wineries in the High Country. The idea, Tuttell said, was to shift away from a recovery-focused message to a more inspirational one.
When all is said and done, the state is hoping to be able to use their current campaign for the Piedmont and the coast: “For Real, Visit North Carolina.”
“Elsewhere, kids are watching reels on a phone,” a narrator says in one ad for the campaign, as a young girl casts a line into the water at the Outer Banks.


Visit NC’s western marketing has been paid for almost entirely through money allocated by the legislature across multiple hurricane relief packages. That allowed the agency to shift money for their “inspirational campaign” to the Piedmont and the coast.
In 2024, 71 counties saw increased visitor spending from the year before, the Department of Commerce announced Wednesday. Among the counties that saw the biggest boosts: those neighboring Helene-impacted counties, where hundreds of workers and volunteers aiding in disaster relief stayed for weeks to months.

Social media tourism — and its pitfalls for western NC
Earlier this summer, tourism officials met with a group of influencers and social media personalities in Asheville.
Ahead of “leaf season,” they’re hoping a steady clip of posts on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms will help spur more trips, from both returning and new visitors. Visit NC has formally contracted with a few creators through its advertising agency, while others are considered more informal partners.
But they’ll all be competing with a deluge of other posts and chatter, that Tuttell says have made selling a dominant tourism-focused message harder than ever.
“In the past, what we worried about was the Weather Channel sending a team out and Jim Cantore scaring people away on your TV screens,” said Tuttell, referencing the now-retired meteorologist who reported from the field during various hurricanes and disasters. “What we really saw with this storm is that there were 1,000 different people on their phones, posting videos to social networks, that had the most influence on people and visitation.”
The state saw a dip in sentiment about visiting the mountains around the six-month anniversary of Helene. Tuttell believes that was fueled in part by old videos of flooding and destruction that resurfaced online. And he’s expecting a similar dip next month, around the one-year anniversary.
Tourism officials have, however, been able to count on one prominent person to continue boosting the region: Gov. Josh Stein.
Stein has made the recovery and revitalization of the mountains a centerpiece of his first months in office. He’s made frequent visits out to impacted communities, shaking hands with local officials and business owners. And he made an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” in June.
“The governor and the First Lady have been the biggest cheerleaders we’ve had for western North Carolina,” Tuttell said. “And boy has it been beneficial.”
Stein’s office has also leaned into more casual, social media-focused promotions.

The interim rate was put into place in January 2025 to help the company keep operations going amid demand increases and other investments. Now the company is proposing the rate be made permanent to help them keep the lights on as business grows.
The gas utility’s original proposal asked the State Corporation Commission to allow them additional revenue of over $60 million that would have added an average of $11 to residential gas users’ bills. A stipulation was proposed earlier this month to lower that to $40 million, bringing the average bill increase to $8, which the SCC will have to approve. 
Since the interim rate has been put into place, however, consumer advocates said they have learned of major increases for some households.
“One resident in Williamsburg said their bill went from $29 to $202 one month after the rate change went into effect,” said Elizabeth Putfark, an associate attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “That average is just such a poor metric to show what people are experiencing, both because of the monthly difference in temperature, but also because somebody that has a 1400 square foot home or condo that’s using gas for all of their major appliances (will be affected differently than) someone who’s got a different style home and just gas logs or just has a grill.”
VNG has been working to make upgrades to their pipelines through the Steps to Advance Virginia’s Energy initiative to the tune of $16 million and other efforts to meet growing energy demands.
“VNG’s requested rate increase is driven by the substantial investments needed to improve the operations, safety, reliability and resiliency of its system to meet growing energy demand. These investments are essential to maintaining a modern and secure natural gas infrastructure for customers,” said Morgan Chase, a spokesman for VNG.
The SELC is representing Appalachian Voices, Virginia Majority, and Virginia Organizing in the case. They believe VNG has not fairly calculated how this rate change will impact low-income households, which stand to take the brunt of the impact, and should have implemented payment plans or invested in weatherization funds to help manage the costs for those homes.
“Utilities have bills. They have to occasionally, sometimes raise rates to keep reliable service going. We’re arguing that they should not be raising bills without having taken a hard look at the impacts on their customers and trying to mitigate those impacts where they would be disproportionate,” Putfark said. “Both because of the just and reasonable ratemaking obligation, which is about striking a balance between customers and shareholders.”
The company, which covers gas service for many of Virginia’s coastal counties, has been advertising its use of new generation gas, which they claim is cleaner. This is drawing in new customers, the utility said, and driving the need for more revenue to make sure service is sustained.
The SCC will receive legal briefs from the parties and then consider their approval or denial of the rate increase later in the year.
The company’s infrastructure is expanding in other ways that might levy a cost on ratepayers. Recently, VNG proposed a new compressor site in Chesapeake that would provide more gas from pipelines to corporate and residential users farther from the source. The project was championed by a paper manufacturer who wanted to pay to have reliable service at all times.

DACA populations, the children of undocumented immigrants popularly known as “Dreamers,” are now excluded from enrolling in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, following the effects of a new U.S. Health and Human Services rule. Meanwhile a recent federal court ruling has paused a few other potential changes to how people can purchase health insurance. 
Formally known as Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals, the decades-old U.S. immigration policy grants children of undocumented immigrants protection from deportation and the ability to work in the country. A President Joe Biden-era policy also allowed these populations to be able to enroll in the ACA marketplace, but as of Aug. 25, they are no longer eligible. 
The court ruling also eliminated a special enrollment period for low-income people while granting a stay to other pending changes, like stricter eligibility verification for special enrollment periods and requiring enrollees to pay past-due premiums before enrolling in new coverage. This means those changes won’t take effect yet, but the court case is still ongoing. 
“We’re still waiting to see what the actual outcome of this court case will be,” said Louise Norris, a health policy analyst with Healthinsurance.org. 
While HHS Secretary Robert F. Kenedy Jr.’s rule is meant to eliminate coverage for some, particularly people who might not need to use the ACA Marketplace; the crux of the case had argued that the changes spur eligible people to fall off getting health insurance. 
“The marketplace rule was designed to tighten things up and make it harder for people to enroll,” Norris said. “But what the plaintiffs in this case are saying is ‘yes, but also, people will fall through the cracks.”
The case, brought forward by a coalition of various U.S. cities, health care organizations and small businesses, alleges that President Donald Trump’s administration is limiting enrollment opportunities, raising consumer costs and adding administrative burdens in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. 
In tandem, the federal government has handed down a slew of pending administrative changes to states and prompted uncertainties within private health insurance markets through the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBA), which did not address the renewal of tax credits that help lower-income earners purchase health insurance. 
Additional eligibility requirements for Medicaid recipients and adjustments to hospital funding mechanisms are looming. Medicaid, the program that helps states provide health insurance to the disabled, pregnant and financially-struggling, also represents a big chunk of federal spending.  In order to achieve certain tax cuts and bolster federal spending on immigration enforcement and military efforts, Republicans in Congress zeroed in on Medicaid as a place to trim the national budget. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates about 10 billion people nationwide could fall off Medicaid once the changes take effect. 
Virginia’s Medicaid director, Cheryl Roberts, told state lawmakers this summer that she expects the extra verification work to be a challenge for various state departments and local governments. 
Of Virginia’s roughly 1.9 million people on Medicaid, over 600,000 of them are estimated to be most affected by the changes, she added. 
Meanwhile, hospitals argued in a letter to Congress that eventually additional costs they absorb to care for people without insurance will lead to tough choices. Those include  potentially reduced services and staff, negotiating higher rates with private insurers  — a cost that will be passed on to consumers — or in some cases, hospital closures.  
While marketplaces gear up for open enrollment periods towards the end of this year, the lack of renewal of ACA Marketplace tax credits has healthy consumers wondering if they should forego health care next year and hope they don’t get injured or sick. 
“It’s sort of like three big puzzle pieces that are all driving premiums higher for next year,” Norris said. 
Preemptively, Aetna has already announced it’s pulling out of the ACA Marketplace, though it didn’t say why when theyMercury asked. Norris surmises that a variety of factors are at play for companies as they weigh matters, too. 
“These three issues are definitely causing instability in the marketplace,” Norris said, noting how the changes create “hoops” that not everyone can jump through. 
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, has emphasized that uninsured people will still need care. That care might be put off until emergencies arise and then it becomes more expensive. She is pressing her colleagues to renew the ACA tax credits and wants to work with others on undoing parts of the OBBA. 
“With open enrollment coming, we really need to act quickly,” McClellan said.

New data show Rhode Island spending on child welfare is proportionately the highest rate in the nation — well over triple the national average.
The amount is equal to $11,244 for every impoverished child in the state. Rhode Island’s children would be far better off if the state could simply give every impoverished family $11,244 per child.
Rhode Island’s foster kids struggle to graduate high school. 17 people hope to fix that.

The amount itself isn’t even the problem. I’m a tax-and-spend liberal and proud of it. If Rhode Island had the best child welfare system in the country it might be worth it. But most of this money is wasted on all those needless removals of children and unnecessary foster care. (The great paradox of child welfare is: the worse the option, the more it costs; places like the now closed St. Mary’s Home for Children in North Providence don’t come cheap.) Rhode Island is spending a fortune harming children. 
If nothing else, anytime anyone in government says of a new prevention or family preservation program, or a program to provide family defense, that “We can’t afford it,” they are, at best, ill-informed. 
The money is right under their noses, being thrown away. (Yes, some of it is restricted, but there are all sorts of ways to get creative with some of those funding streams if you put your mind to it.)
The data come with a whole lot of caveats – including the fact that data for six states are missing. Here’s the into-the-weeds part:
Every few years, Child Trends, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research center with offices in Maryland, Minnesota, and North Carolina, attempts the Herculean task of trying to figure out how much every state and the District of Columbia spends on “child welfare” and where the money is coming from. That’s 51 jurisdictions X roughly 32 funding streams = 1,632 cells on a spreadsheet.
So, it takes a while. Child Trends just released its most recent version — the data are from fiscal year 2022.
It does not attempt to do a state-by-state comparison. So we do at the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform. Here’s our latest Rate-of-Spending Index.
As you may know, the coalition also does a Rate-of-Removal Index, comparing the propensity of states to take away children.










If nothing else, anytime anyone in government says of a new prevention or family preservation program, or a program to provide family defense, that 'We can’t afford it,' they are, at best, ill-informed. 


Comparing the two produces what one would expect: Of the top 15 spenders, all but two take away children at a rate at or above the national average – in Rhode Island’s case, far above. (The exceptions are New Jersey and D.C.) Seven of the top 15 spenders also are in the top 15 for rate of removal – including Rhode Island.
It’s not just the high rate of removal. It’s also the fact that Rhode Island is so reliant on the form of “care” that is both the worst for children and the most expensive — group homes and institutions.

Wildfire veterans say an immigration raid earlier this week targeting fire crews in Washington state was an alarming development that could threaten the nation’s wildfire readiness. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state on Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotes. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public — including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

Buena Vista's Labor Day Festival dates to the mid-1960s, when the city bought the Glen Maury farm, planning to convert it to a community park. To celebrate the work done by the many volunteers who cleared the land, built picnic shelters, and hiking trails, a Labor Day parade was organized to march from downtown Buena Vista to new Glen Maury Park. It attracted thousands of people from the region; its success ensured the event would become a Buena Vistan tradition. Local politicians invited governors and Senators (both state and national) to participate, and the festival began to serve as the kickoff for Virginia's fall political campaigns. (Photo by Jahi Chikwendiu/TWP/Getty Images)I’m glad I did it for all those years. But I’m also glad I won’t be doing the reporting gauntlet of Labor Day political parades, picnics and speeches on Monday, starting well before dawn and lasting into the night.
The political landscape has changed radically since then. These kickoff events for the sprint to Election Day were once command appearances for statewide office seekers. Now, they’re optional at best, depending on a campaign’s needs and the best venues for achieving them.
Festivities such as Wakefield’s Shad Planking each April, Acres of Democrats in Wytheville the Sunday before Labor Day, and the Labor Day morning parade in lovely Buena Vista, nestled along the western slope of the Blue Ridge, and an afternoon one in Covington, a manufacturing city near the West By-God border, have lost prominence. Even the Virginia Bar Association’s summer debate, held since 1985, was cancelled this year after gubernatorial candidates trampled tradition and declined invitations.
The atrophy of Virginia’s political press corps, which once felt a slavish obligation to cover the annual end-of-summer pageantry, bears much of the blame.
It’s been a dozen years since I last went through the daylong drill on the first Monday of each September. It was a chore we political correspondents greeted with a mix of resignation and adventure, particularly for writers based in Richmond.
Those days began at 5 a.m. Many of us traveled together, in a car that The Associated Press allowed me to rent for the trip. Park at my house by 5 a.m., riders were told, or miss out (though we left no scribe behind).
We would arrive in Buena Vista in time for the party breakfasts, greeted by tens of thousands of campaign yard signs bristling like a dog’s hackles from every spare swatch of soil along the parade route, backdrop for press cameras.
We tracked candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general every other odd-numbered year. On most even-numbered years, we would follow U.S. Senate candidates. Skillful candidates spent their time on the curbs and sidewalks, shaking hands, back-slapping, kissing babies and posing for snapshots and Polaroids — forerunners of smart phones.
Regardless of the year, candidates would sweat their long-sleeved dress shirts completely through in mere minutes. I pitied the occasional neophyte who attempted the sweltering 1 1⁄2-mile march in a new worsted wool suit, a tie and wingtips.
Their reward for completing the parade? Sit in an open-air pavilion in a city park and wait in a queue to rouse crowds of mostly their supporters and volunteers while reporters scrounged for a morsel of news to lead their stories.
When that was finished, wily Buena Vista parade veterans changed into fresh clothing and were whisked west on Interstate 64 for Covington’s parade, culminating in speeches under the midday sun on a high school football field. After that, some Democrats would climb into a waiting plane bound for Scott’s picnic.
The more technically adept reporters attempted to write and transmit stories via hard-to-find telephone land lines before wireless data service was widespread. Traditionalists, such as the Richmond Times-Dispatch’s late, legendary Tyler Whitley, dispensed with the gadgetry and dictated notes and quotes by phone to the rewrite desk.
Once the stories were filed, we sweaty, nomadic newshounds feasted on our companies’ dime at one of the nicer eateries in Lexington, a fashionable two-college community convenient to the day’s events. Then came the dog-tired drive back to Richmond in a car filled with chatter about the day — at least among those who remained awake.
Today, candidates and the press have dialed it back.
“So much has changed in Virginia politics over the last 25 years, and those changes all work against events like Buena Vista,” said Stephen Farnsworth, political science professor and director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington.
“For the dwindling Richmond press corps, it’s a very expensive proposition to make the trek. For the candidates, it’s not clear there’s a lot of value in going if there’s no coverage,” said Farnsworth who, before his 32 years as a professor, reported for the Kansas City Star.
He also noted the demise of competitiveness in GOP-red southwestern Virginia the past two decades further diminishes their value. Republicans aren’t compelled to gild the lily. Democrats have trouble finding a reason to even bother, especially if their message has at most local reach.
“There aren’t many persuadable voters out there,” Farnsworth said, noting that the last Democratic gubernatorial nominee to meaningfully compete in Virginia’s mountainous southwest was Mark Warner in 2001.
It meant something then to residents of an area closer to capitals of several other states than they are to Richmond’s Capitol Square, where they feel forgotten. Warner won 23 localities in the region over Republican Mark Earley, 13 by double-digit percentage point margins — including Buena Vista and Covington.
For that campaign, Warner went whole hog, contesting the GOP in hills and hollers it considered its own. The multimillionaire businessman had already spent years seeding start-ups across rural Virginia. In 2021, he sponsored a car in a NASCAR event in Virginia. He commissioned a bluegrass band to record a campaign song to the tune of “Dooley” with lyrics retooled by adviser David “Mudcat” Saunders, hired to give the Alexandria city slicker some good-ol’-boy cred.
A grassroots group calling itself Sportsmen for Warner sprung up to calm anxious gun-rights voters and helped Warner persuade the NRA not to endorse Earley. And when Saunders took Warner on his first turkey hunt, the candidate asked him for guidance. “Don’t shoot Mudcat,” Saunders drawled in response.
Twenty years after that campaign, Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, seeking a second term, won just two southwestern localities — the cities of Roanoke and Lexington — in his upset loss to Republican Glenn Youngkin.
The only other Democrat to make a dedicated outreach in Virginia’s southwest was author Jim Webb, a Democrat who had written about Appalachian people of Scots-Irish heritage in his nonfiction book “Born Fighting.” He carried 10 localities in the region in narrowly unseating Republican U.S. Sen. George Allen.
U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott’s Labor Day Cookout in Newport News, held annually since 1977 except for the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, has held its own. Because of Scott’s tenure and his standing in Congress, senior Democrats find a way to attend. Last year, Doug Emhoff, husband of Vice President (and Democratic presidential nominee) Kamala Harris was the headliner, yet media coverage of it was sparing.
“Events that are still big are not the bipartisan ones but partisan ones,” Farnsworth said. “When a top partisan figure encourages you to show up, you’re wise to make an appearance. But even those events, where there are a lot of political officeholders present at one place at one time, still don’t draw that many reporters.”
I suppose not.
Today’s press corps is stretched painfully thin. It is composed of technically adroit multitaskers who work at least as hard and probably smarter than we did. But something has to fall by the wayside, and those Labor Day totems drew the short straw.
Our dispatches from Labor Day venues weren’t breaking news, but Virginians will learn a little less about the candidates, especially in unscripted moments when they interact with everyday people whose votes they seek.  
Today’s correspondents don’t endure those steamy, 18-hour Labor Days spent reporting, writing and traveling. Nor will they have those memories to share decades from now, either.

Cases of Measles are on the rise in West Texas as over 150 confirmed case have been seen with one confirmed death.(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Dr. Rana Alissa hears it daily in the clinic.
“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

The Ohio Capital Journal talked to two parents who send their children to private school — one who uses school vouchers and the other who refuses to use vouchers.

Micah Berman does not use a school choice voucher to send his fifth grade student to the Columbus Jewish Day School in New Albany. 
“I think it’s critical for us to have a strong public school system and it certainly seems to me that universal vouchers are undermining that,” he said. 
The Berman’s sent their son to kindergarten during the COVID-19 pandemic, at a time when most schools were doing remote or hybrid learning. But the Columbus Jewish Day School was going back to in-person learning and they liked the school’s commitment to Jewish values. 
“We were trying to find the right option for each kid and part of the decision making was affected by COVID,” Berman said. 
The Bermans enrolled their son in Columbus Jewish Day School back in 2020 and were eligible for the Educational Choice Scholarship because Columbus City Schools was their home district, but they were not interested.
“We were very clear with (the Columbus Jewish Day School) from the beginning that … we were not going to take the voucher,” he said. “We’re not going to be part of taking those resources away from the Columbus district.”
Ohio lawmakers expanded the Education Choice-Expansion eligibility to 450% of the poverty line through the 2023 state budget — creating near-universal school vouchers. K-8 students can receive a $6,166 scholarship and high schoolers can receive a $8,408 scholarship in state funding under the expansion. 
Tuition at the Jewish Day School is $19,184 a year. The Ohio Capital Journal sent questions to the Jewish Day School, but they did not respond.  
The Jewish Day School has about 60 students and Berman said the school originally mandated families getting financial aid to apply for the vouchers after the EdChoice-Expansion in 2023. 
“We were definitely troubled by the idea of either encouraging or mandating parents to take the voucher,” Berman said. 
Berman and another parent at the school sent a letter to the Jewish Day School school board expressing their concerns over the policy and how it does not match up with the school’s Jewish values.

“We chose to send our children to CJDS in large part because of its commitment to tikkun olam, the Jewish obligation to build a better and more equitable world,” they wrote in the letter, dated Oct. 3, 2023.
The parents outlined two main concerns with the policy.
“The Board’s policy puts pressure on CJDS families to betray their own values by requiring them to seek out vouchers that they may be morally and ethically opposed to in order to obtain any financial aid; and sends a message to the parents, the public, and other private and public schools that CJDS endorses and is willing to benefit from the EdChoice program, even though the program runs counter to core Jewish values and basic tenants of social justice.”
The school rescinded their policy and no longer requires families to apply for the vouchers, Berman said. 
“I think parents, understandably, if there’s money that’s going to reduce the cost of private education, there’s very strong incentives to take that,” Berman said. “But as you’ve seen, most of the people getting the vouchers are families who are already sending their kids to private schools.”
Ohio nonpublic school enrollment increased about 2% from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024 and public school enrollment declined slightly — dropping about 6,000 students from the 2022-23 school year to the 2023-24 school year, according to data from the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. 
Part of the reason the Bermans moved to Columbus was to pay taxes to Columbus City Schools and their third grader goes to an elementary school in Columbus City Schools. 
“I think you have to kind of be blinding yourself to the broader reality to accept that vouchers don’t have an impact on public schools,” Berman said. 
Ohio spent nearly a billion dollars on private school scholarship programs for the 2024 fiscal year, the first full year with near-universal school vouchers. Well more than a third that money ($406.7 million) was from Education Choice Expansion scholarships.
“There’s no way you can take that much money and transfer it to private schools without having an impact on public schools,” Berman said. 
Nearly 90% of Ohio students attend public schools, according to the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. 
“Private schools are just not going to be able to serve the needs of most Ohio kids,” Berman said. “There are all sorts of language needs and learning needs and health needs that the public school system can address that the private schools can’t.” 
A Franklin County judge recently ruled that Ohio’s private school voucher system is unconstitutional, but Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost plans on appealing the decision. 
“(Faith) was an added bonus”
Sarahann Tiner uses school vouchers to send two of her children — a third and first grader —  to Toledo Christian Schools. Her oldest son, a fifth grader, goes to Hope Learning Academy, a Toledo charter school, but all three of her children previously attended Emmanuel Christian School.  
“The only way that we’re able to do that was with the school vouchers,” she said. 
Her oldest son first went to kindergarten at Whittier Elementary School in the Toledo Public Schools, but the Tiners started exploring Emmanuel Christian after hearing about it from a co-worker.  
“I had never even had a private school on my radar because I don’t have to pay anything out of pocket (with public school),” she said. “… I was never opposed to it because I grew up in church.”
Emmanuel Christian’s curriculum ended up being the deciding factor for the Tiners.
“We ultimately sent our kids to a Christian school because we liked the curriculum and it had nothing to do with (faith),” Tiner said. “That was an added bonus. … it wasn’t even anything to do with the fact that it’s a faith-based school.”

The Tiners qualified for the traditional EdChoice scholarships before the expansion. They refuse to send their three boys to Toledo Public Schools and the EdChoice vouchers are the only way they can send their children to private school, she said. 
“I will either quit my job and homeschool — and that will be a nightmare, but I would do it — or my husband’s just going to be working a lot of over time (if it weren’t for the vouchers),” Tiner said. 
Tuition at Toledo Christian Schools costs $8,650 a year and K-8 students can receive a $6,166 scholarship through EdChoice, so the Tiners pay some tuition.
“If you’re on the higher end of the income bracket, you’re not really benefiting anyway,” she said. “People aren’t quitting their jobs … so that they could get more money from a voucher that they didn’t get beforehand anyway. … It literally only helped families maybe take $1,000 or $2,000 off of their tuition. That’s it. It’s not like EdChoice is paying full tuition.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)An American flag has been strategically placed on one of the massive beams supporting the Lake Borgne Surge Barrier, part of the New Orleans region hurricane and storm damage risk reduction system. 
Completed in 2009 to close off the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, the barrier is designed to decrease damage to the metropolitan area when a major hurricane pushes water from the Gulf of Mexico into the lakes that surround the city and neighboring parishes.
The flag on the wall symbolizes pride and mourning, a reminder of the people it protects and a memorial for those who died 20 years ago when Hurricane Katrina hit. The failure of the federal levee system Aug. 29, 2005, claimed more than a thousand lives, displaced nearly a million people in the region and left permanent scars on New Orleans.
A go-to term emerged to praise New Orleanians and their neighbors who persevered through the catastrophe and took part in the unprecedented rebuilding: resilient. But as various recovery programs faltered and efforts to ensure disaster history would not repeat itself stalled, “resilient” or “resiliency” now elicit bitter feelings among locals.
“I think people have gotten tired of the word. Not just because it’s become cliché, but because people have begun to understand it as an excuse for lack of preparation or execution, lack of planning or execution,” said Michael Hecht, CEO and president of Greater New Orleans Inc., a regional economic development group.
Hecht came to Louisiana in 2006 from New York, where he led a 9/11 small business recovery program for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. After directing the state’s post-Katrina business recovery efforts, he was chosen to lead GNO Inc. in 2008.
“We had been knocked down by an unprecedented event,” Hecht said. “It was either be resilient or die, so we were resilient.”
The world has watched as New Orleans fundamentally changed, having lost a significant portion of its Black working class and attracting an upsurge in mostly white transplants from out of state. With more than 484,000 residents before Katrina, the city’s population plummeted below 344,000 in the 2010 census. The number climbed above 391,000 in 2020 and has since fallen about 4% as of 2024, according to various estimates.
Most who have stayed are ardent defenders of the city’s culture, of which resiliency fatigue is quickly becoming a feature. It’s reflected in Louisiana’s slow progress to rebuild coastal land and improve the adaptability of cities to match what post-Katrina boosters envisioned.

Restoration resistance
After Katrina, more emphasis was placed on rebuilding Louisiana’s vanishing coastal wetlands to protect residents from the increasing threat of hurricanes. A state Coastal Master Plan has taken shape over the past two decades, gaining official approval in 2023, to tie together restoration efforts and shield wetlands from sea level rise, subsidence and worsening hurricanes.
“We learned from Hurricane Katrina that levees alone aren’t enough,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with National Wildlife Foundation. “We also need a healthy natural ecosystem sitting out in front of those levees to protect the structures that protect our communities.”
But the master plan encountered a huge setback in July with the end of what had been its keystone project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project. Gov. Jeff Landry led pushback against the project for its feared impact on fisheries and nearly $3 billion price tag.
So far, the state’s Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority has spent $600 million to harness the power of the Mississippi River to bring fresh water and sediment to wetlands in the Barataria Basin – only to shelve the diversion.
“It was probably one of the most innovative, forward-thinking things in terms of being a resilience hub for the world,” said Amanda Moore, senior director for the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf program.
A lifetime Gulf Coast resident, Moore moved to New Orleans from the Tampa, Florida, area in 2009 to take a job as a community organizer with the National Wildlife Federation. She joined the wave of thinkers, scientists and planners who came to the city after Katrina with the hope of bringing relief from the constant threat of flood.
“For people who live on the Gulf Coast – and especially South Louisiana – it’s exhausting,” she said.
The federation was among the voices that influenced upgrades to the region’s storm risk reduction system in the years after Katrina. Moore led efforts such as the MRGO Must Go Coalition, advocating for reversal of wetlands damage attributed to saltwater intrusion from the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet.
“You’re helping to alleviate maybe some of that exhaustion that people are personally feeling when you do the coastal restoration,” Moore said. “You’re adding this layer of protection, you’re helping it create a healthier environment that’s safer, so that does help people really be more resilient and not burnt out.”
Funding momentum peters out
As Katrina and its aftermath garnered worldwide attention, the recovery money streamed in from Washington and charitable foundations. The federal government directed $76 billion to Louisiana projects.
But keeping up the pace of investment after post-disaster attention spans waned became a problem for state and local leaders. Even with billions of dollars put into infrastructure, billions more would be needed for upkeep and replacing outdated systems. Stormwater drainage and drinking water in New Orleans, for example, rely on a power supply and mains that, in many spots, are more than a century old.
Charles Allen, Gulf Coast community engagement director for the National Audubon Society, recalls the vast amounts of federal and philanthropic dollars directed to the region in the years immediately after Katrina – and the dropoff that followed. It revealed the inability of state and local governments to sustain the level of rebuilding needed.
“It’s like anything in life, you know?” Allen said. “We gotta maintain our bodies, and we have to invest in whatever it takes to do that.”
The 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon just off the Southeast Louisiana coast reopened wounds in the region that had yet to heal from Katrina’s trauma. Like the levee failures after the hurricane, It was considered another manmade, preventable disaster. Eleven crew members were killed, and the catastrophic oil spill tainted wildlife and habitat in all five Gulf Coast states. Livelihoods that depended on the Gulf were sidetracked for months, if not ended entirely.
Petroleum giant BP, which contracted the drillship, reached a $20 billion settlement with the federal government and impacted states. In Louisiana, it provided the long-sought financial foundation for its coastal master plan.
But with the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion shelved – and seemingly no other major restoration projects in the queue – Allen and others with vested interest in coastal flood protection fear Louisiana has become dependent on disaster recovery funding to pay for critical infrastructure that should already be in place.
“Let’s not wait for another storm because then it’s always too late when that happens,” Allen said  “You gotta invest in it, you gotta support it, you’ve got to fund it.”
“It’s a lot of reactive disaster-related funding that’s allowing Louisiana to do this work,” Moore said. “We’ve got to figure out how to get out of that cycle.”

‘People can just be people’
Katrina recovery funds paid for upgrades to the massive pumping stations at the end of New Orleans’ outfall drainage canals that pump stormwater into Lake Pontchartrain. Beyond that, however, the city hasn’t engineered a way to handle street flooding from routine heavy rainstorms.
One project was held up as a way for New Orleans to adapt to the regular influx of rainwater, rather than fruitlessly attempt to pump it away. The Gentilly Resilience District called for turning neutral grounds in the neighborhood into retention areas. Residents would be encouraged to add features such as rain cisterns and permeable driveways, with grants to cover their cost.
The centerpiece of the district was the Mirabeau Water Garden, planned for 25 acres of land that were once home to a Catholic convent. The Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph donated the land to the city in 2015 on the condition it be used to enhance and protect the neighborhood. It was designed to divert and hold up to 10 million gallons of stormwater in ponds and constructed wetlands, with a pedestrian path and other amenities to invite the public into the space.
The architecture firm Waggonner and Ball designed the water garden using best practices for how to integrate water into a coastal urban setting. The idea came out of a trans-Atlantic collaboration after Katrina called the Dutch Dialogues, in which New Orleans experts tapped into the Netherlands’ experience living with water.
The federal government provided $141 million to the city in 2017 to bring the Gentilly Resilience District to life, with a completion date set for September 2022. But as of 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development noted that only 15% of the money had been spent. The water garden remains largely unfinished.
HUD’s inspector general designated the city a “slow spender” in a project audit, noting that its elements “did not always improve the program participants’ ability to withstand future extreme events.”

In addition to his role with GNO Inc., Hecht was named chairman of the governor’s committee to prepare New Orleans for the 2025 Super Bowl, played in February at the Superdome. Part of Hecht’s charge was to track progress on city infrastructure projects. And while the Gentilly Resilience District is well outside the city’s tourist zone, its lack of progress was noticeable.
“It’s happening. It’s been accepted as a concept, but it’s been extremely slow,” Hecht said. “And that’s just been execution failure, oftentimes on the part of the city.”
The communications team for the city of New Orleans did not respond to a request for comment on the timeline of finishing the Mirabeau Water Gardens.
The Mirabeau Water Garden’s status is considered by residents to be symbolic of New Orleans falling well short of the post-Katrina vision that boasted resilience as a key component of its new economy. Much like the Netherlands, it was thought that the Crescent City could become a beacon of expertise for how to adapt to climate change.
“We thought we were going to be able to really build a sector around selling our experience post Katrina with water management and environmental management around the world,” Hecht said. “If we’re being honest, it has not materialized much as part of our economy.”
It has happened in a small way, he said, citing the Water Institute in Baton Rouge. The independent research center focuses on the Mississippi River Delta and Gulf Coast, and it has applied its expertise to several projects in the region.
“But I think there’s still a lot more,” Hecht said.
Allen believes the opportunity to make Louisiana that hub of water management and resilience still exists, but he acknowledged it is still far from materializing 20 years after Katrina.
“This story of restoration, it’ll never end, which is a good thing,” Allen said. “This kind of work fuels jobs, environmental research and teaching.”
Until or unless that sector develops, the vulnerability of southeast Louisiana to future disasters will continue to place a strain on its residents, observers say, and climate change only heightens that risk.
“That is the goal … building structures, either literally or metaphorically, strong enough so that in a world with climate change and weather volatility, when things happen, either natural or man made, we don’t have to be resilient,” Hecht said.
Renfro, the coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation, said it’s wrong to keep placing the same burden of recovery on a population forced to accept conditions beyond their control.
“Asking the same people again and again to be resilient … it feels unfair,” she said. “People can just be people, and infrastructure can be resilient.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAt the third meeting of a House study committee dedicated to examining Georgia’s election procedures, state legislators sought out testimony from the State Election Board, a panel which is tasked with overseeing cases involving potential violations of election laws and issuing nonpartisan guidance to help elections run more smoothly. 
The goal? To repair the fraying relationship between the board and the secretary of state’s office.
It’s no secret that the board has been facing some internal divisions in recent years. Last year, the little-known board gained national attention after President Donald Trump — who falsely stated that the ​​election was stolen from him in Georgia and several other swing states — praised three members of the board at a campaign rally who attempted to implement election rule changes that could have benefitted Trump. Those changes were invalidated ahead of the 2024 election by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr., who said members of the board were illegally usurping legislative authority.
More recently, board member Janelle King has come under fire for serving as a board member as her husband campaigns for secretary of state. 
Though the board has resumed hearing elections cases this year rather than promulgating election rules, its current members frequently cast votes along party lines, and public meetings are often openly antagonistic.
At the study panel’s Thursday meeting in Clarkesville, legislators emphasized the need for a change.

“We’ve seen grandstanding, bombastic rhetoric and public disputes that have done little to serve voters and have, at times, undermined the confidence in the system itself,” said state Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican who chairs the committee and who is running for secretary of state. “This cannot continue. The state elections board must find its way. If it cannot find the way, then this committee and the broader legislative branch will step in and provide the direction that is needed for them to move forward.”
The committee also solicited testimony from members of the board on ways the Legislature could improve the current system. But members of the board presented competing visions for the best way forward.
Chairman John Fervier, who has led the board since his appointment in 2024, urged the committee not to take drastic measures overhauling Georgia’s election system.
“My belief is that Georgia already has the best and most reliable procedures for voting,” Fervier told the committee.
“We don’t have a broken system,” he continued. “It doesn’t need to be fixed. I would urge the General Assembly to continue to fund the ballot image audit for upcoming elections. The cost would be a fraction of replacing what we currently have or going to hand-marked, hand-counted paper ballots.”
Board member Sara Tindall Ghazal, the sole Democratic appointee, also highlighted what she sees as an increasing number of activists on the board, as well as a lack of consistency in decisions that she says diminishes trust with voters.
“For the most part, the vast majority of our cases are decided unanimously,” she said. “But increasingly, we’re seeing more and more politicized cases where the outcome appears to depend on the party involved.”
King, who spoke in place of board member Rick Jeffares, criticized what she called a lack of transparency from Fervier and members of the secretary of state’s office who still oversee the board’s website. She called for greater funding as the board works to further separate itself from the secretary of state’s office.
“We need to be properly funded, where we have control over all the funds. . . so that it can actually benefit us, and we can stand on our own two feet,” she said.
King also deflected criticism that her husband’s campaign presented a conflict of interest.
“It becomes a conflict if there were decisions that I was making that will directly benefit my spouse,” she said in response to questions from state Rep. Saira Draper, an Atlanta Democrat. “There is no decision that I make as a member of the state election board that directly benefits any candidate.”
She also said she would recuse herself from any potential State Election Board cases that involved her husband.
The elections committee, which will pull together a report with recommendations from all its meetings, is scheduled to meet next on Sept. 18 in Savannah.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump might not have liked the numbers on Aug. 1, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy had added just 73,000 jobs in July and downwardly revised the two previous months by a combined 258,000. 
But his reaction — to fire the head of the agency that reported those numbers — will have a bad effect on the Ohio economy, a big majority of a panel of economists said.
Some economists had worried that massive tariffs levied by Trump, combined with mass deportations and deep cuts to the federal workforce and the social safety net would drag down the economy. That appeared not to be happening, possibly because those potential drags were being offset by the growth of efficiency due to artificial intelligence.
Then the brutal Aug. 1 jobs report hit. Days later, core inflation was reported to have grown in July by 3% — the biggest jump since March 2022.
Upset that his government wasn’t reporting economic numbers that made him look good, Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. 
At least on an acting basis, he replaced her with E.J. Antoni, an economist with the right-wing Heritage Foundation who in the past has been critical of the methods used by the bureau.
Some experts expressed alarm that Trump appeared not to understand how the bureau’s reports are assembled. They also worried that he is working the ref when the world needs to have faith in U.S. economic data in order to have faith in the dollar. 
“The president’s belief that the BLS commissioner personally ‘produced’ the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,” Heidi Shierholz, president of the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, said in a statement. 
Its website said, “Trump’s move also risks politicizing the office of Commissioner in the future, by threatening their removal if any economic statistical data released does not seem favorable to the White House.”
Most Ohio economists surveyed by Scioto Analysis agreed. 
A panel was asked whether it agreed that “Reduced trust in Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates will hurt economic development in Ohio.” 
Ten agreed, three disagreed, and one was uncertain.
Several of those who agreed said businesses need solid numbers in order to plan.
“​​Uncertainty is generally bad for businesses,” Kathryn Wilson of Kent State University wrote in the comments section of the survey. “If business owners don’t feel confident in economic data from the (Bureau of Labor Statistics), they may be hesitant to respond to real changes in the economy.”
One economist who disagreed said it’s incorrect to assume that Antoni will lead an agency that simply reports what Trump wants.
“I disagree with the premise,” wrote David Brasington of the University of Cincinnati. “If the new director makes the (Bureau of Labor Statistics) use more updated models, trust in the numbers could increase. Current BLS surveys have a 45% completion rate compared to 95% in the past.”
There is a precedent for a country juking its economic stats. The results were not good. 
In 2007, Graciela Bevacqua was removed from INDEC, the agency that tracks economic statistics for the Argentine government. In charge of tracking inflation, Bevacqua faced intense pressure to report numbers that were much lower than they actually were. She refused.
Her firing was followed by severe government underreporting of inflation and a backlash from the international community. The International Monetary Fund threatened to cut off Argentina’s access to critical loans and to expel Argentina altogether if it didn’t clean up its data.
Economist Jonathan Andreas of Bluffton University said things haven’t gotten that bad in the United States — yet. But he said Trump’s firing of McEntarfer could lead down a slippery slope.
“Fortunately, I don’t think trust has fallen much yet, but the unjust firing was a bad omen and IF this signals a shift towards Argentinian/Venezuelan-style governance, then America will suffer those kinds of outcomes,” he wrote. “It hasn’t happened yet, but as the (Martin) Niemöller poem goes, ‘First they came for (the Bureau of Labor Statistics), and I did not speak out… Decreased trust in the basic macroeconomic functions of government depresses investment across the nation because investors hate uncertainty.”

Thanks to the federal “motor voter” law, car registration agencies around the U.S. have offered voter registration services to applicants since the early 1990s. New state law in Ohio requires applicants provide proof of citizenship before the bureau registers them or updates their registration.
Red Wine and Blue argued the change, passed as part of Ohio’s two-year transportation budget, “makes it harder for lawful, eligible Ohio citizens to exercise their fundamental right to vote.”
“Frank LaRose and Republicans in the state legislature should not be able to disenfranchise anyone,” she continued. “Especially not the rural Ohioans, elderly voters, students, and women who have changed their legal names through marriage and divorce who are disproportionately affected by this legislation.”
In a press release LaRose dismissed the case as a “baseless” and “activist” lawsuit. He added the state of Wyoming instituted similar changes and courts there have already upheld the policy.
“It’s common sense that only U.S. citizens should be on our voter rolls,” LaRose said. “I won’t apologize for, or back down from the work we do to ensure the integrity of our voter rolls.”
“We will win this case,” he insisted, “just like we’ve fought off the other baseless actions that such groups have brought against us.”
At root, the changes shift the burden from state agencies to individuals.
Under prior law, registrants had to attest under penalty of perjury that they are a citizen. Verification then happened behind the scenes with elections officials at the state and local level.
On the one hand, drivers renewing their license who previously proved their citizenship shouldn’t have a problem. On the other, it’s not hard to imagine ordinary people showing up to the BMV without a marriage abstract or divorce paperwork; or a senior letting their license lapse and then losing the ability to renew without tracking down a birth certificate.
Researchers at the University of Maryland have found more than 21 million Americans — about 10% of the eligible voting population — don’t have ready access to proof of citizenship.
The complaint
The Red Wine and Blue complaint focuses on attestation requirements in prior law. A sworn state statement was good enough in Ohio for decades, and it’s the standard many other states and the federal government rely on, too.
“Indeed,” the complaint adds, “Ohio currently allows residents to register to vote based on an attestation of citizenship — so long as they register somewhere other than the BMV.”
The problem with imposing proof of citizenship requirements, the group claims, goes back to the motor voter law. That measure states registration agencies may only require the minimum amount of information necessary to determine a voter’s eligibility.
“Because the (National Voter Registration Act) separately requires that all applicants must attest, under penalty of perjury, that they are United States citizens,” the complaint states, “requesting any ‘proof’ of citizenship beyond that attestation goes beyond the ‘minimum’ amount of information that is ‘necessary’ to determine an applicant’s eligibility.”
In short, Red Wine and Blue contends that Congress said a sworn statement is fine and that states aren’t free to go further.
Attorneys for Red Wine and Blue warned the secretary about that point in a letter prior to filing their lawsuit.
In a response, LaRose’s general counsel, former Senate President Larry Obhof, dismissed them out of hand.
The U.S. and Ohio Constitutions bar noncitizens from voting, he wrote, and Ohio law bars them from registering.
“When a license registrant does not present proof of United States citizenship and has not done so in the past, Ohio does not have ‘the minimum amount of information necessary’ to assess whether the registrant is eligible to register to vote,” Obhof said.
The broader context
In recent years, right-wing organizers have grown increasingly insistent that noncitizens are flooding the American electoral system.
Republican officials including Donald Trump and JD Vance have fanned those flames, and in the final weeks of the 2024 election, Ohio boards of elections were flooded with thousands of bogus registration challenges.
LaRose himself has made a point of pursuing alleged voter fraud aggressively. Ahead of last year’s election, his maintenance efforts erroneously swept in naturalized citizens.
LaRose’s office has flagged hundreds of individual registrations for review since taking office.
As part of a 2023 investigation, Ohio Capital Journal spoke to dozens of county prosecutors about those cases. Many described a similar pattern: ineligible people received a form and filled it out thinking it was required. In some cases the applicants even checked a box stating they aren’t a citizen but county officials registered them anyway.
Those cases are about confusion rather than fraud, the prosecutors claimed. Ohio’s new proof of citizenship requirements might limit those cases, but Red Wine and Blue contends many more Ohioans will be harmed in the process.
And for all the fear mongering about noncitizen voting, no one has been able to show it’s a substantial problem.
Following a more thorough review of LaRose’s flagged cases in 2024, Attorney General Dave Yost turned up a grand total of six cases of voter fraud. The 2024 post-election audit came back with an accuracy rate north of 99% yet again.

The new rules in Question 1 would be in place by next year’s pivotal U.S. Senate race.(John Moore/Getty Images)Sarah Trites, who is approaching her 60th birthday, has made a point to vote in every federal election since she turned 18. She worries her streak will end soon.
That’s because of Question 1, a conservative-backed ballot measure this November that proposes a series of barriers to voting, and particularly to voting by mail, in her home state of Maine. The measure would roll back key voter conveniences, forcing new burdens to ballot access on huge swaths of the state electorate.
Trites lives a 10-minute drive from her local elections office, an easy trip for some, but she is disabled and cannot drive a car, and there is no public transit in her town. That local office, she said, “might as well be miles away from me.” Her vision is also impaired, and so for years she has made use of the fact that Maine law allows any voter to request a mail ballot by phone or online—an accommodation that has helped Trites and many others handle voting affairs from home.
Here are the big questions that will appear on Maine’s November ballot

Question 1 would repeal the option to request a mail ballot by phone or online, requiring all voters to visit an elections office in person or physically mail in an application in order to receive one. All mail voters, of which there are many in Maine (nearly half of the state voted that way last fall), would have to repeat this process for each election.
“What a pain, to have to do that every single time,” Trites told Bolts. She says activities that might be easy for most—like traveling to an elections office, or printing out the physical application—are more complicated for people with disabilities.
These proposed new requirements figure to be especially relevant in Maine, where the average age is the highest of any state in the country, coinciding with a high incidence of disability.
“This would affect a lot of people,” Trites said. “People who cannot drive, who are physically unable to read for whatever reason.” She added, “I know people like that on both sides of the aisle, and this will be a big burden on all of us.”
Sixty-one percent of Mainers over 65 who voted in 2024 did so by mail, according to an analysis of state voting data by the Save Maine Absentee Voting Coalition, a group of 27 organizations in the state that oppose Question 1.
To help older folks and those with disabilities vote, Maine last year established a specific accommodation to allow anyone over 65 or with a disability to make a one-time request to receive a mail ballot without needing to ask again for all future elections. This policy, which the state calls “ongoing” absentee voting, would also be repealed by Question 1.
“We’re not even a voting rights advocacy organization, but we’ve had to become one,” Jess Maurer, executive director of the Maine Council on Aging, told Bolts.
Maurer is also concerned about other provisions of Question 1 that’d require all voters, including those voting by mail, to present a state-issued ID before casting a ballot. Maine does not currently require voters to show ID when voting.
National studies show that elderly voters and voters with disabilities are more likely than others to not have a state ID, in part because they may no longer keep an up-to-date driver’s license. Maurer says research shows Mainers very often stop driving altogether by the time they turn 80, and that a third of people in Maine over 65 have a disability.

“Ageism and ableism walk hand in hand,” she said of Question 1. “There will be people who, a year after this passes, if it passes, will go to vote and they won’t be able, and then they’ll be really mad. Or they’ll request an absentee ballot and get denied and not understand how they’re going to be able to vote.”
Question 1 comes as President Donald Trump renews his call to eliminate mail voting, and as many red states, including Utah and Kansas this year, have passed various measures to restrict the accessibility of mail voting. Trump earlier this month was open about his motives: If the country bans mail voting, he said, “you’re not gonna have many Democrats get elected. That’s bigger than anything having to do with redistricting.”
Question 1 follows this broad trend. It’s a citizen-initiated measure backed by a conservative PAC called The Dinner Table, which says its mission is to elect a Republican majority in the Maine House.
The PAC was co-founded four years ago by a Republican activist named Alex Titcomb, whose work is funded in part by Leonard Leo, the architect of the right-wing takeover of federal courts, and by Republican state Representative Laurel Libby, who was recently censured by her colleagues for doxing a transgender student and who has floated running for governor of Maine in 2026.
“My question to naysayers,” Libby said of Question 1, in an interview with Bolts, “would be: What’s the downside to ensuring our elections are as strong as they can possibly be and as secure as they can possibly be?”
Libby, who offered no evidence of fraud or misconduct to suggest Maine elections are insecure, said that “ongoing” mail voting—the service that allows Trites and others to automatically receive mail ballots each cycle—cannot be trusted.
“People move or they die, and this will ensure that only folks who have requested a ballot will receive a ballot and then vote in that election, rather than automatically sending ballots out when someone could no longer be at that address, for whatever reason,” she said.
The official campaign for Question 1, Voter ID for ME, has—as its name makes clear—emphasized the parts of the measure that specifically concern voter ID.
Voter ID laws, though proven to reduce turnout, are often popular with voters, and rarely fail when put on the ballot, though Arizonans rejected such a proposal in 2022. The most recent such measure, in Wisconsin in April, passed by about 25 points.
Opponents in Maine are concerned about the voter ID aspects of Question 1; besides the effects on older voters, the measure does not allow voters to use student IDs, even when they’re issued by a state university, or tribal IDs. But they tell Bolts they’re even more worried that voters will miss the fact that the measure contains so many other barriers.
In addition to forcing new burdens on how would-be mail voters can request ballots, Question 1 also proposes to limit towns and cities to one ballot dropbox apiece; to move the deadline to request a mail ballot from three business days before an election to seven; and to prohibit towns and cities from covering the cost of postage on mail ballots.










We’re not even a voting rights advocacy organization, but we’ve had to become one.


– Jess Maurer, executive director of the Maine Council on Aging


“Your voting rights are actually on the line,” said Jen Lancaster, spokesperson for the League of Women Voters of Maine. “This is far from just a very restrictive voter ID law; it will do so much more.”
Changes to absentee voting would affect not just older and disabled voters; overall, 43 percent of Mainers voted by mail in 2024.
If Question 1 passes, its changes would be implemented by the 2026 midterms, when Maine will elect a new governor and every seat in the state legislature will be up for election. Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins is also up for election in 2026, in a race that could determine the balance of power in Congress.
For conservatives, Question 1 is the culmination of several years of work in the legislature to try to tighten voting rules. Republican Maine lawmakers, facing a Democratic trifecta in the state government, have failed repeatedly in recent years to enact new voter ID requirements.
By qualifying their measure for the ballot, proponents skirted that trifecta. They submitted 170,000 petition signatures, more than double the amount required—a strong statement, given Maine has only about one million adult residents. “In a small state like Maine, that’s pretty much a mandate,” Libby said. “Folks want to see voter ID as the law of the land.”

In an interview, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows—a Democrat who opposes Question 1, is running for governor in 2026 and may end up facing Libby in a general election—told Bolts she hopes people will consider the entire measure, not just the voter ID angle.
“Question 1 is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” she told Bolts. “Reasonable people can agree to disagree on the merits of voter ID. But if Maine voters understand everything that this measure will do, they will reject it.”
“Eliminating the convenience of absentee voting,” Bellows said, “would make it far more difficult for working people, seniors, and people with disabilities to participate in our elections.”
Voter ID effort likely heading to voters after lawmakers decline to advance bill

Bellows and other opponents of Question 1 have noted how it happens to come at a time when Maine is excelling at voter turnout, ranking second among all states in the 2022 midterms and fourth in last year’s presidential election. And officials are hopeful that the state can keep improving; the program allowing “ongoing” mail ballots for older and disabled voters, so they don’t have to request a new one each cycle, only went into effect in February 2024.
Sarah Trites thinks this has been a critical change. “I was having to call up every single time and request a ballot,” she said. “That was becoming very difficult to do, to have to remember when every election is and to make a call every single time. To have it sent automatically has been great, but now that could go away.”
Question 1’s proponents have downplayed the changes to mail voting while professing outrage at the wording of the measure, which Bellows approved: The official language that voters will see on their ballots notes five different policy changes proposed by Question 1 before mentioning voter ID, the issue that proponents think should lead the description of the measure.
Titcomb, the co-founder of The Dinner Table, has called this ballot language “a partisan editorial” from Bellows. The Voter ID for ME campaign argues that the secretary should have approved a ballot measure that specified the voter ID aspect and referred to everything else simply as “other changes.”
Bellows defended the ballot language as faithful to the measure, and said that it’s important for voters to understand Question 1 completely.
Maurer, of the Maine Council on Aging, said she fears the November outcome if the electorate misunderstands the measure as being strictly about voter ID.
“We have to make this real for people,” she said, “and we don’t have much time.”

His latest book is titled ""Everything Is Tuberculosis."" (Eric Thomas illustration for Kansas Reflector)Author John Green is most famous for his book, “A Fault In Our Stars,” a crushing and delicate book about two teenagers love-locked as they struggle through cancer. 
He will be welcomed to the University of Kansas (where I work) on Sept. 2 to speak about his book of essays, “The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet.” That book is the university’s common book for this academic year.
But I am most interested in Green’s unlikely connection to Kansas through his most recent volume, “Everything Is Tuberculosis.” Released in March, it describes how TB persists as a rampant killer throughout much of the world, but seldom in the United States and wealthy countries. 
Seeing the overlap between Green’s book and Kansas is simple, if you were monitoring Kansas news at the start of this year.  An outbreak of TB in the eastern corner of the state — close to Lawrence, where Green will be speaking — made international news. 
At its peak, the outbreak included 67 Kansans, two of whom died.
Dr. Ryan Kubat, an assistant professor in infectious diseases, worked with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, to contain the TB outbreak in Wyandotte and Johnson counties. Kubat’s clinical work includes tuberculosis.
According to Kubat, only a handful of active cases remain in Kansas this week, perhaps only two. 
The outbreak “was primarily community based,” Kubat said. “The majority of our patients were exposed within the Kansas City, Kansas Wyandotte County community.”
Most of the Kansas patients have completed treatment — but that doesn’t mean that they have not been harmed. 
In “Everything Is Tuberculosis,” Green describes TB’s statistical weight: 1.25 million dead each year, for instance. He writes movingly about how each life contained in that number represents so much: lost dreams, a lost loved one and human suffering from a brutal disease. 
The numbers from the outbreak in Kansas were much smaller, of course. But each case represents community strain and individual suffering.
“Some of these (Kansas patients) have lifelong adverse effects as a result of the TB,” Kubat said before listing many of the challenges: long-term pulmonary effects, the isolation of TB treatment, the family financial stress and the stigma associated with the disease. 
In writing “Everything Is Tuberculosis,” Green brought his best-seller megaphone to the issue. Kubat noted that Green’s advocacy has helped lower the price of TB treatments. 
“In global health circles, I know his advocacy has been much appreciated in terms of bringing attention to some of these issues of drug and diagnostic pricing for TB and trying to bring those costs down, especially for these low-income countries,” Kubat said.
Much of what I learned through reading Green’s book makes an outbreak in Kansas surprising but not impossible. In recent decades, the disease has been rare in the United States compared with many nations: In 2022, 565 Americans died compared with an estimated 1.25 million worldwide. 
““TB has not gone away,” Kubat said. “It’s certainly been prevalent in the United States and across the globe. It has an increased focus here in Kansas, and I think that’s beneficial overall.”
As TB becomes antibiotic resistant and as it is given time to evolve, the risk of a superbug TB increases. Some point to this as the prime motivation for Americans to care about bringing an end to TB globally. 
In his book however, Green points out that there is current suffering — rather than hypothetical suffering — that can be addressed.
“I think John Green said it appropriately,” Kubat said. “It’s quite privileged just to be kind of worried about the superbug. There are people that are suffering and dying daily, and it’s not just across the globe. It’s here too. It’s everywhere. And I think we should acknowledge that.”
Responding to the Kansas outbreak involved work from health authorities at many levels, Kubat said. Following work at the county and state levels, the CDC was involved to assist with management. 
Recent federal funding cuts worry some, who feel that essential community health resources are being shaved too thin. 
Kubat imagined a scenario without the support in place for the Kansas outbreak. 
“In a situation where we have a lack of resources, there’s an inability to manage this aggressively up front,” Kubat said. “We would see more spread of tuberculosis. We see a larger outbreak. We see more people infected. Having those resources available to be able to respond promptly to an outbreak like this is imperative in order to control the damage.”
Green’s book glows with compassion for people who must live in situations that put them at risk for TB. His nonfiction hero in “Everything Is Tuberculosis” is Henry, a teen from Sierra Leone who struggles with many risk factors: migration; living in tight, multi-generational housing; malnutrition; communities without reliable health care; national governments with slim budgets for community health. 
To a lesser extent, people living in Wyandotte County, Kubat said, are more likely to live in communities that put them at risk for TB.
“It’s kind of a culmination of several factors that I think makes this particular area have a higher propensity for TB,” Kubat said.
Dr. Dana Hawkinson is the medical director for the Infection Control and Prevention Program at University of Kansas Health System. He said it’s vital to understand that infectious diseases like TB will not stay in one community. 
“It’s not going to adhere to borders,” Hawkinson said. “It’s not going to adhere to economic classes. We have to understand that all of these diseases have the potential to infect everybody.  
“Until it is really viewed as that in the global sense, we will continue to have deficiencies in a lot of these programs or methods to help protect everybody.”

In Washington County, Marietta area residents have been meeting with local city and county officials about concerns their drinking water could be contaminated by toxic, radioactive gas and oil wastewater brine migrating from nearby injection wells.
And in much-fracked Harrison County, 3,000 Cadiz residents have been unable to drink local water off and on since June. 
One citizen complained of “slimy, oily crud” and a rainbow sheen in his and his parents’ tap and shower water. 
Two months after the June boil advisory was first lifted, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency claimed water main breaks from recharging the system and turbulence in Tappan Lake — which provides water to Cadiz — were to blame. 
Yet at press time, water concerns continue.
These issues should be of great concern to lawmakers and Ohioans. But the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, which mandates and monitors oil and gas fracking — along with storage management of its toxic, radioactive wastewater brine — just keeps fracking along.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Public comments to frack three Ohio Department of Transportation rights-of-way are due by Sept. 8.
If the Ohio River, and Ohio groundwater and aquifers become contaminated by toxic, radioactive oil and gas wastewater brine or PFAs, how do we make it drinkable again? 
Or can we? 
Texas and Pennsylvania are examples of what could be in store for Ohio water 
The state of Texas has 2,870 cases of contaminated groundwater from gas and oil production and wastewater brine management, affecting half its water supply. 
In June, Coterra Energy, Inc.  in Lenox Township, Pennsylvania was fined $299,000 and ordered to replace the water supply for 13 private residential homes. It’s located just a few miles from Dimock, Pa.
Dimock was the focus of the 2010 award-winning documentary ‘Gasland,’ that showed residents setting fire to polluted water flowing from their kitchen faucets.
Cabot Oil and Gas company was finally ordered in 2022 to pay $16 million to build a public water system to replace contaminated rural drinking supplies and pay residential water bills there for 75 years. 
But on the very same day that decision was announced, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection lifted a ban on fracking Dimock that had been in place since 2010. 
As Texas and Pennsylvania go, will Ohio go, too?
Ohio, with its many beautiful lakes, rivers, and streams, the Ohio River on our southern border and Lake Erie to the north, was supposed to be a climate oasis as the world heats to 1.5° Celsius and beyond.
If we lose our drinking water, we’ll be refugees instead.
Ethical energy policy means phasing out fossil fuels and ramping up renewables
The most recent state budget is so dripping with gas and oil that it makes the ODNR dependent on fracking leases for half of its future budget next year. 
This means ODNR must continue fracking public lands it’s supposed to protect in order to maintain staff and operations.
All this despite the fact that wind and solar energy are cheaper than natural gas and the rest of the world is moving rapidly to renewables. 
If you want to drain a swamp, here is likely the largest one too few people are discussing: without the U.S. government’s annual subsidies, such as the $760 billion it gave the gas and oil industry in 2022, could fossil fuels even survive in a free market?
The little chicks that fracking bore are maturing into demanding, cackling hens. But the eggs they’ve laid over the past 15 years haven’t been good for Ohio. 
We all need to talk more about fossil fuel fracking under public lands and energy in Ohio. We need to talk about their relationship to climate change and democracy, too. 
That conversation could help voters choose lawmakers based on issues, like dedication to good health, clean air, water and land, biodiversity, and a livable planet — instead of political party loyalty and fossil fuel industry spin.

Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Trump’s bid to support coal could cost ratepayers billions, report finds

Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
Midwest farm economies suffered while some Sun Belt states kept rolling in early 2025

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
Medicaid cuts could mean hundreds of thousands of job losses annually, study finds

“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

(File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)Gary Hodge’s piece, “Virginia’s proposed extension of Beltway toll lanes into Maryland won’t solve our mobility crisis,” is loaded with inaccuracies.
First, the Interstate 495/270 widening project is not “Virginia’s project,” but was spawned by former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan after he was elected in 2014. The Beltway and I-270 in Montgomery County are heavily congested because of insufficient road capacity, stemming from the very bad decision Maryland has made through the years to not add additional Potomac River crossings north and south of the Greater D.C. region.
Let me remind readers that Maryland controls the Potomac River to the Virginia shore, so any transportation facility must be supported and built by Maryland, as was the case with the $2.5 billion Wilson Bridge replacement in the 2000s.
So, Hogan and his transportation people had no choice but to add lanes on I-495, the Beltway – which is now carrying 250,000 vehicles a day – and I-270, which is carrying almost as many vehicles.
In addition, the Maryland Department of Transportation forecasts the overstressed Legion Bridge on I-495 needs to be replaced due to wear and tear – as early as 2030, just five years from today.  This means lanes will need to be closed, thus making traffic congestion worse.  There are no other highway bridge alternatives.  Currently, delays in rush hour can be 30 minutes or longer, so imagine what will occur if the Legion Bridge goes from eight to six lanes?
So, not having any tax money for this $6 billion project, Republican Hogan decided to create a public-private partnership so a company could add capacity via high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes.  We have used HOT lanes in Virginia for more than a decade, and they enable motorists to pay market rate for using them and get a congestion-free ride in return.

The MDOT plan called for widening the 270 split and part of 495 near Bethesda and most important, rebuilding the Legion Bridge and adding a new span to bring capacity to 12 lanes.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, agreed with Hogan to extend our beltway’s hot lanes to the Legion Bridge and widen them to 12 lanes to match what Maryland would do with 495 and the Legion Bridge.  But in Montgomery County, it garnered immediate opposition from the NIMBY culture and Democrat politicians, notably County Executive Marc Elrich, who never met a highway he ever liked.
MDOT went ahead with its solicitation and Fluor/Transurban won the job in 2021.  Virginia broke ground on its portion in 2022 and it’s due for completion in December.
But Elrich and Company colluded with political appointees in the Federal Highway Administration under Joe Biden to stop the 495/270 project by rejecting the Record of Decision in 2022.  Maryland Democrats in Congress worked to change that ruling with then-DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
Transurban was prepared to break ground on the Legion widening and replacement in 2023 to meet up with Virginia’s widening when newly elected Gov. Wes Moore announced he wanted to rethink the project because tolls were not “equitable,” and seek a federal  grant to build it – some $6 billion.
As a result, Fluor/Transurban pulled out of the project in early 2023.
The Biden administration ended up rejecting Maryland’s request for a grant to widen and replace the Legion Bridge, and Maryland now has no money to do anything.
Meanwhile, Virginia’s Beltway widening to 12 lanes is moving along, but because the Legion Bridge has only eight lanes, it renders the project almost useless.  And, Maryland will likely have to close lanes on 495 to make repairs around 2030.  Moore, Elrich and other transit fanatics clearly screwed the D.C. area.
As for the I-495 Southside Express Lanes project Hodge mentions, he derides it as “outsourcing our state highway network to unaccountable privateers and their shareholders.”  Another inaccuracy.
When the Wilson Bridge was replaced around 2006, only 10 of 12 lanes were opened to traffic.  The other two were reserved for transit, high-occupancy vehicles (HOV) or general-purpose lanes.  That’s what the Southside Express Lane project is studying.  In my view, those two lanes should be opened to traffic immediately because the Wilson is horribly congested, too.
Transit boondoggles like Hodge mentioned will take years to complete and cost billions that neither Maryland nor U.S. DOT has to spend.
I hope Moore comes to his senses and reissues the public private partnership that Hogan worked so hard to achieve.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/American-Legion-Bridge-June-14-2022-1024x742.jpg,,,2025-08-29 03:57:33.659060

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Tens of thousands of retirees could learn that their current health care plan will no longer be available in Maryland this fall, as major insurance providers consider ending their Medicare Advantage plans for next year.
About 25% of Maryland Medicare recipients use a supplemental Medicare care program that helps low-income retirees use a private insurer for health coverage that often provides additional services such as vision, dental and transportation assistance.
State officials and people in the health care industry say the Medicare Advantage market in Maryland has long been more expensive than in most other states because of a unique hospital payment system in the state. But the state has offered insurers a grant in recent years to help cover some of their costs and encourage them to keep offering the coverage in the state.
That grant is going away, however, and some companies are considering terminating their Medicare Advantage plans in the state as a result.
“Over the last five years, Medicare Advantage has seen its challenges in Maryland, and those challenges resulted in health plan exits and disruptions for beneficiaries who rely on Medicare Advantage for their supplemental benefits,” says Mark Puente, CEO of Alterwood Health, an insurance carrier focused on Medicare Advantage plans.
At issue is a disconnect between Maryland’s hospital rate-setting system and federal calculations to reimburse health care provided under the Medicare Advantage plans.
“Given the uniqueness of the Maryland system, there is pressure on Medicare advantage,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society.
Part of the issue comes from Maryland’s unique Total Cost of Care hospital payment model, in which a state board called the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) sets hospital rates. Under the current system, insurance carriers pay higher hospital rates than in other states and get reimbursed by the federal government for Medicare Advantage services at lower rates than elsewhere. Meanwhile, insurance carriers are unable to negotiate hospital rates under their plans.
Bumps AHEAD: Trump administration evaluating Maryland’s authority to set Medicare rates

As a result, it’s more expensive to use Medicare Advantage in Maryland than in other states, and Maryland seniors aren’t getting the same quality of benefits, a spokesperson for CareFirst said in a written statement.
“We remain concerned that Maryland seniors don’t have access to the same affordable, high-quality Medicare Advantage plans available to seniors all across the country, making it difficult for them to afford healthcare at a time when they need it the most,” the statement said. “Maryland seniors deserve access to the same robust, low-cost benefits available to their neighbors in other states.”
There are 1.1 million Medicare recipients in Maryland, with about 295,000 participating in a Medicare Advantage plan, a participation rate of under under 27%. That was one of lowest rates in the nation, ahead of only North Dakota (25%), South Dakota (20%), Wyoming (19%) and Alaska (2%). Most states have at least 50% of their Medicare recipients taking part in Medicare Advantage.
“The losses that the Medicare Advantage plans have incurred over the last couple of years have continued to grow,” Puente said.
In previous years, the HSCRC has offered grants to help encourage insurance companies to continue providing Medicare Advantage in the state. Former HSCRC Commissioner Adam Kane, who chaired the commission at the time it operated the grant program, said the grants were supposed to be a temporary fix to a longstanding problem.
“At the time, we created the grant program in an effort to stabilize the Medicare Advantage market in hopes that there would be a federal solution permanently” Kane said. “At this point, we still don’t not have a permanent resolution with the federal government on how to harmonize the Maryland hospital model with Medicare Advantage reimbursement.”
As a result, analysts say companies are looking to get out.
“We’re hearing that a couple of the large, publicly traded Medicare Advantage plans are going to exit the Maryland marketplace, creating further disruption for the beneficiaries who are either going to have to select another Medicare Advantage plan … or relinquish those supplemental benefits,” Puente said. “Those supplemental benefits include dental, vision, transportation, hearing aids that traditional Medicare fee-for-service doesn’t cover.”
Some of the large, publicly traded plans in Maryland are Aetna, Humana, Cigna and United Healthcare, though it’s not yet clear what plans those companies will offer for the upcoming enrollment period.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We’ll be happy to share more when 2026 MA benefits and markets become public in early-October,” a spokesperson for United Healthcare said in a statement.
“We can’t comment on our 2026 MA offerings until the launch of the Medicare Annual Enrollment Period in October,” Mark Taylor, communication director for Humana, said in a statement.
It would not be the first time carriers trimmed their Medicare Advantage plan coverage in the state. In 2021, Johns Hopkins Medicine terminated plans for Baltimore City residents, kicking 5,000 seniors off their plans and sending them searching for new coverage, according to reports at the time.
Andrew Rosenberg is president of Health Resource Advisors, an insurance broker company that helps seniors weigh their health care options. He’s said that losing health care coverage can be very disruptive for seniors, who often rely on regular and consistent health care services for significant health needs.
“Any type of change is not good for seniors, even a change in pharmacy. They may need to change doctors,” Rosenberg said. “When you bounce around plans … It’s changing a lot in their continuity of care.”
Meanwhile, the Maryland model is undergoing a major transition in the coming weeks, as state health officials and federal officials finalize new terms of the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model.
Current negotiations appear to prompt the state to offer solutions to the stabilize Medicare Advantage. There may also be significant changes to the state’s Medicare rate-setting authority.
“I am hopeful that the state and federal government are diligent in coming up with a solution that protects the Maryland Medicare beneficiaries,” Puente said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hospitalbed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-29 02:57:16.468239

(File photo Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters.)Maryland’s top election official said he is concerned about a Justice Department demand for state elections data including sensitive information for more than 4 million state voters.
State Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis said his agency has been working with Justice Department investigators under the state’s Public Information Act after they demanded voter information last month. But he said the office balked at a recent demand for an unredacted database that contains protected personal information that could not otherwise be released.
“Handing over a list of 4.3 million people to find something seems to be an overreach,” DeMarinis said Thursday. “It casts aspersions on all Maryland voters, and tries to sow doubt, or some sort of fear that the lists are inaccurate, and that’s just not the case.”
The discussion during Thursday’s meeting of the Maryland State Board of Elections highlighted some deep partisan divides.

Diane Butler, one of two Republicans on the five-member board, said she “absolutely shocked” by DeMarinis’ response to the Justice Department.
“The response was incomplete, it was unprofessional, and it was actually quite rude,” Butler said. “And I think the Justice Department agreed by the tone of their second letter, and I think that’s where they jumped up and wanted even more.
“I think fighting the Justice Department instead of working with them was not the way that we need to be behaving,” she said.
Maryland was one of a number of states that received letters this summer from the Department of Justice seeking voter registration information.
The July 14 letter requested voter registration data from November 2022 to November 2024. The state was asked to provide “the number of voters identified as ineligible to vote” during that period because they were a “non-citizen … adjudicated incompetent” or had a felony conviction.
The letter referenced a 2023 state audit that had raised questions about the accuracy of the state’s voter rolls.
DeMarinis responded to the request by providing investigators with the process and application  that could be used to obtain some of the information.
Under state law, some voter information is available for electoral purposes only. Democratic and Republican central committees routinely request such information.
DeMarinis said he offered to work with the department if they had concerns about specific voters.
What Jstice Department officials wanted went beyond that which DeMarinis said was available under Maryland law.
 Maryland Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis said a Justice Department request for voter records including sensitive information “seems to be an overreach.” (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
“They filled out the application. I then wanted to inquire as to … how it was related to electoral purpose, electoral process in the state of Maryland,” DeMarinis said. “They’ve responded back by saying, ‘We demand the voter registration list and all fields in it,’ including” personally identifiable information.
DeMarinis said the agency demanded the information by Aug. 25.
Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann, one of three Democrats on the board, said it was important to work with law enforcement officials, but to do so within the confines of state and federal election laws. The request made by the federal government this summer “is far outside the scope” of what the agency has requested in the past, he said.
“This is a new era for the DOJ, it seems,” Weissmann said, adding that the state elections board should not turnover “Marylanders’ personal information, the last four digits of Social Security, their date of birth, their home address, without any sort of rational explanation.”
Jim Shalleck, a Republican and vice chair of the board, praised DeMarinis for the state’s board’s efforts to maintain accurate voter registration lists.
“I see you doing everything you can to maintain our lists, which is a very difficult task,” he said to DeMarinis.
Butler disagreed.
“I tend to disagree with Jim. We’ve had problems with the list maintenance,” she said. “We failed some of the audit concerning some of these issues, and when I read our response to that, our response was a bunch of excuses as to why we didn’t get it done. We know we’ve had this problem, and then, like I said, we’ve had complaints about it, so I’d like to see solutions instead of excuses.”

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Agriculture)Democrats in Maryland’s congressional delegation are pushing back against the Trump administration’s recent decision to shutter a Prince George’s agricultural research facility, arguing that the closure would not only hurt American farmers and agricultural research, but could be illegal.
A recent U.S. Department of Agriculture memo announced that the agency is undergoing a reorganization to “achieve improved effectiveness and accountability, enhanced services, reduced bureaucracy and cost savings for the American people.”
Part of that plan calls for closing the 6,500-acre Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Prince George’s County, which would be “deeply harmful to American farmers and a waste of taxpayer dollars,” according to a letter submitted by nine of Maryland’s 10 members of Congress, as part of the 30-day public comment period on the proposal.
Both senators and seven of the states’ eight House members signed the letter urging the USDA to keep the center open. Only Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the sole Republican in the delegation, did not sign the letter, which was submitted last week.
“We also have significant concerns about the lack of transparency and the legality of USDA’s proposed plan,” the letter said. “We urge you to keep BARC open and to provide a detailed accounting of the full impact of the proposed reorganization plan.”
Maryland officials vow to fight Trump plans to relocate FBI to another site in D.C.

The reorganization was outlined by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in a July 24 memo that said several USDA agencies in and around Washington, D.C., would be moved to other parts of the country to be “located closer to the people it serves while achieving savings to the American taxpayer.”
Because of Washington’s cost of living, the 4,600 USDA workers here get higher pay than they would i other cities. The plan calls for moving all but 2,000 of those workers to one of five regional hubs to reduce salary costs, and to close the Beltsville center “over multiple years to avoid disruption of critical USDA research activities.”
But the Maryland lawmakers say moving the BARC would not actually yield savings the department claims. The cost of living in Prince George’s is “estimated at $121,972 per year for a two-parent, two-child family,” significantly lower than in the District, the letter said.
“The new hubs you propose are in counties that have costs of living that range from $124,856 in Larimer County, CO (Fort Collins) to $101,965 per year in Marion County, IN (Indianapolis),” it said. “The cost of living in Prince George’s County clearly falls within the cost-of-living range of the proposed hub locations.”
But that’s just one of several reasons cited by the delegation, which also said that closing the Beltsville site requires congressional approval. Movinig forward without that approval, or moving personnel from one office to another without authorizing legislation, is prohibited by law, they said.
Meanwhile, the move would “waste” some $174 million in recent upgrades and repairs to the Beltsville facility, lawmakers said.
“Abandoning a facility right after USDA has made such significant upgrades to it is illogical and wasteful,” the letter says. “As one of the world’s largest agricultural research complexes, relocating personnel, as well as all the lab and research equipment, will undoubtedly be a major expense.”
Besides, the location in Prince George’s has benefits that “cannot be replicated elsewhere.”
“Located close to freshwater and saltwater, mountains and coastal lowlands, and situated within the fertile Piedmont Plateau, BARC is within reach of diverse landscapes and a range of climatic conditions,” the letter says. “This geography makes it an ideal location for an agriculture research station and its proximity to the nation’s capital allows BARC to take advantage of several key efficiencies.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The letter specifically notes the BARC’s “regionally-tailored” research in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Eliminating BARC would “eliminate the research hub serving the entire Northeast Region – from Virginia to Maine.”
The potential loss of BARC is just the latest in a string of federal announcements that have been bad news for Prince George’s County this year.
In January, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing announced that it was canceling plans to move its printing operations from its current plant in Washington to a new facility planned for Beltsville, a move that would have brought about 1,400 jobs to the county. And in July, the FBI reversed more than a decade of study and planning and said it would not be building its new headquarters in Greenbelt but would remain downtown in the Ronald Reagan Building.
County, state and federal officials have vowed to fight for the FBI building, saying Prince George’s County is the best location. The same is true for agricultural research center, they said.
“BARC’s excellence in agricultural research is of enormous value to the nation, and so we urge you not to close this critical facility,” the letter says. “We also urge USDA to ensure full transparency in any potential reorganization and to follow the letter of the law.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/k9638-2.jpg,,,2025-08-29 02:57:16.468239

(Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.
Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

 ‘Hold people accountable’

Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.
The Florida Legislature voted this year to exempt from public disclosure of personally identifying information about members of Congress and the Legislature, plus governors and Cabinet members, and also local officials including city and county commission members and members of school boards.
During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said, he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
 ‘What is your why?’

Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said, it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

But if they truly want to honor the labor movement and the many contributions of working people who make our economy run, politicians must do more than attend a parade or put up a post on social media.
More than ever, we need policies that empower the working class and protect their rights. And we need leaders who will fight to make that a reality.
As the top officers of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, a federation of unions representing 250,000 workers across the state, we know that unions are the most powerful voice for economic justice in our country. And not just for union workers. Labor unions help raise wages and standards for all workers. When unions are strong, every worker does better.
That’s why 7 in 10 Americans approve of labor unions – the second highest level of support in 60 years. This approval even crosses political lines with half of Republicans approving of unions.
When workers have a voice on the job and a seat at the table, they can finally negotiate on a more level playing field rather than relying on the whims of their bosses. They can negotiate better wages, safer working conditions, a secure retirement, affordable health care, and job security.
And that’s exactly why corporate CEOs and the billionaire class hate unions.
Without a union, workers are at the mercy of their boss. Not only that, but on average, they are paid less, have weaker and more expensive benefits, and they are treated as an “at will” employee.
That means you can be fired for any reason except for those explicitly prohibited by law. In one glaring example of this in Iowa, a dental assistant was fired for being too attractive and “irresistible” to her boss. The State Supreme Court ruled that the employer was within his legal rights when he fired her.
What working people need here in Connecticut and across the country is elected officials who will unapologetically stand with us not just for a Labor Day photo op, but every day. They need to stand with the working people of this state, so workers actually have a chance to not just survive but thrive.
As we gear up for the municipal elections and prepare for the critical 2026 midterms where nearly every state office will be up for election, working people in Connecticut want elected leaders who will:

Protect and expand the right to organize without fear of retaliation;
Raise wages and support strong labor standards;
Fund public services at levels that reverse historic underfunding and build equity;
Protect workers and their jobs from unregulated and unchecked AI;
Commit to reversing a tax structure that disproportionately burdens working people and adversely impacts their ability to thrive while allowing the wealthiest in our state to not to pay what they owe;
Invest in infrastructure, including strengthening prevailing wage, licensing standards, and apprenticeship programs;
Adjust our state’s overly restrictive “fiscal roadblocks” that impede our ability to fully invest in high quality public education (pre-K through college), healthcare, affordable housing and other critical programs and services, many of which have been decimated by federal cuts to fund billionaire tax breaks; and,
Consistently listen, learn and engage with working class people.

These are the principles by which we will determine support for any candidate for office whether they’re running for town council or governor.
As a labor federation made up of a diverse membership, we are proud to have endorsed and campaigned for both Democrats and Republicans. We will stand behind any candidate who is willing to stand with working people.
This Labor Day, don’t just thank a worker. Stand with us. Fight for us. And do it each and every day.
Support our right to organize, fight for fair wages, and build an economy where no one who works has to live in poverty.
Unions built the middle class. And when you hear people harken back to the economic prosperity of the 1950s, remind them that is when union density was at the highest level in this country.
As we look to the future, the labor movement will continue to fight so that every job is a good job and every worker is treated with dignity and respect.

Three senior leaders walked out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday in Atlanta after resigning over their opposition to the Trump administration’s political interference in the agency’s science-backed work.
Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Dr. Deb Houry, chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science; and Dr. Dan Jernigan, director of the National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases, emerged from the CDC campus greeted by a crowd of supporters and employees.
“I hope this is a tipping point to where we get our public health back, that we get the trust of the nation back, we get the trust of our leaders back, and that public health does the work they’re meant to do on the ground, saving lives,” Houry said.
The three resignations – along with that of Dr. Jennifer Layden, director of the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology — announced late Wednesday, came after news that CDC Director Susan Monarez was being ousted after only three weeks on the job.
A week ago, Monarez stood amid shattered glass on the floor of a CDC building where a gunman had fired into the windows and said she wanted to restore trust in the agency and support its workers, whom she called family.
This week’s developments are the latest in a series of blows to the beleaguered agency since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term and the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary. The CDC has faced several rounds of mass layoffs, funding cuts, and the Aug. 8 shooting that resulted in the death of a police officer and the gunman.
Monarez’s attorney, Mark Zaid, said in a post on X that Monarez had “refused to rubber stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire public health experts” and said Kennedy had weaponized “public health for political gain.” She is fighting her dismissal.

In a resignation letter posted on X, Daskalakis said political interference in the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a part of the CDC, drove his decision to leave.
In June, Kennedy removed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with his own appointees. That move, as well as the new committee’s decisions about vaccine policies have drawn criticism from scientists and many professional medical organizations.
The committee is expected to rule soon on policies for the latest Covid vaccine, raising fears that many Americans would lose insurance coverage for the shots or be unable to access them altogether. Advocates also worry that the committee will change recommendations for long-established childhood vaccines.
More than 100 CDC supporters and current employees turned out in support of Daskalakis, Houry, and Jernigan. Many workers crossed the street from the agency’s headquarters near Emory, while others drove from other locations in Atlanta to show their support. Several said they and their fellow employees had taken leave so they would not get in trouble for attending the event during the workday.
With many top roles vacant, the CDC is facing a leadership vacuum. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to an inquiry about who is the current acting director, or who has taken over the positions of the four other leaders who resigned. The Washington Post reported late Thursday that Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O’Neill would act as interim director.
Houry, Daskalakis, and Jernigan adopted a defiant tone, vowing to fight for remaining CDC employees and scientific integrity.
“America needs to see that you are the people that protect America,” Daskalakis said. “We are going to be your loudest advocates.”

All three criticized political interference in science and public health.
“What makes us great at CDC is following the science, so let’s get the politics out of public health … because that’s how we get to the best decisions for public health,” Jernigan said.
Houry said the three had agreed to act in concert after “talking about it for months.”
“We need to get our people back. We’ve terminated, RIFed, valuable people. We need to support our labs. We need to get our budget for appropriate programs. We can’t lose our chronic disease center,” Houry said, referring to multiple “reductions in force” at the agency over the past few months.
The leaders said the work CDC employees do is important in protecting American health, with Daskalakis pointing to the work the agency has done to “stop Ebola at its source” and Houry pointing to this year’s measles outbreak.
“We have unvaccinated populations and a secretary that promoted vitamins over vaccines,” Houry said.
HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The instability has disrupted work at the agency, said Dr. Elizabeth Soda, a current CDC employee.
“RFK has created so much chaos,” she said. “I’m not sure what he expected in terms of getting work done.”
CDC retirees who worked at the agency for decades said they are concerned about the impact on Atlanta’s economy and reputation.
“This has been one of the crown jewels of Atlanta. … It’s a point of pride,” said retiree Marta Gwinn.
She doesn’t think the local job market can absorb all of the laid off workers, and Atlanta will lose brain power as professionals and students drawn to the city’s public health institutions, from the CDC to universities like Emory and Georgia State, look elsewhere.
She and fellow retirees Joanne Mei and Laura Fehrs said they also want to hear from state political leaders.
“It’s been pretty much silence, and I don’t understand that,” Mei said. “Where’s our governor who wants to attract all this new science and all these tech companies?”

(Screenshot from court documents)A federal judge Thursday evening ordered the Conway School District to remove Ten Commandments posters from classrooms and libraries, less than 24 hours after the district was added to a lawsuit challenging a state law requiring the displays. 
Act 573 of 2025 requires public schools to “prominently display” a 16”x20” poster or framed copy of a “historical representation” of the Ten Commandments. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks issued a preliminary injunction earlier this month that blocked enforcement of the law at four Northwest Arkansas school districts — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Springdale and Siloam Springs. 
Seven multifaith families who filed the lawsuit against the four districts in June allege the new law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
Supporters of the law argue the Ten Commandments are a historical document because they influenced the nation’s founders and their creation of the country’s legal system.
Central Arkansas school district added to Ten Commandments suit

Brooks granted a request from plaintiffs’ attorneys Wednesday to add the Conway School District as a defendant to the case and families from the district who allege they’ve been injured by the district hanging Ten Commandments displays in their children’s schools. 
Plaintiffs’ attorneys filed a supplemental complaint adding the new parties to the case Thursday and filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on behalf of two Conway School District families. Brooks granted the temporary restraining order later on Thursday and held the request for a preliminary injunction in abeyance. 
“Conway Plaintiffs are identically situated to the original Plaintiffs: They advance the same legal arguments, assert the same constitutional injuries, and request the same relief,” Brooks wrote.
School districts named in the lawsuit and Arkansas attorney general’s office, who intervened in the case, may submit briefs no later than Sept. 8 to address why the current preliminary injunction should not be modified to include the Conway School District, according to the order. 
Brooks also temporarily enjoined the Conway School District from enforcing the law and directed the district to remove all the Ten Commandments posters by 5 p.m. Friday. 
“Conway School District had every opportunity to do the right thing and respect families’ constitutional rights, but instead chose to defy a clear federal ruling,” ACLU of Arkansas Legal Director John Williams said in a statement. “The court has now made it crystal clear: forcing the Ten Commandments into public school classrooms is unconstitutional. We stand ready to defend the rights of every Arkansan against this kind of government overreach.”
The ACLU of Arkansas is representing the plaintiffs along with the national American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett is serving as pro bono counsel. 
“I am disappointed in the ruling but will continue to vigorously defend Act 573,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement.

(Photo courtesy of Charitie Ropati/KYUK Public Media)Twenty-four-year-old Charitie Ropati is Yup’ik and Samoan, and has roots in the Bering Sea coastal village of Kongiganak. She said that the community has inspired her.
Following a flood event in 1966, many members relocated from the village of Kwigillingok to higher ground, a settlement which would become known as Kongiganak. Now, the permafrost under the village is thawing and Kongiganak is facing its own set of climate impacts.
“It really started with the story of my community,” Ropati explained. “And it’s because of that story of survival, I think, that brought me to where I’m at now.”
“Now” for Ropati means working in New York City as an engineer designing public housing infrastructure for Indigenous communities across the country. Ropati has also started her own nonprofit education organization called LilnativegirlinSTEM and was recently named to the Forbes 30 under 30 list.
Ropati said that she was back in Alaska, driving around Anchorage with her mom and her partner, when she got the news that she’d been selected as a youth climate advisor to the United Nations (U.N.)’s secretary general.
“It really meant a lot to be there, especially with my mom where these stories of survival really originated from her and specifically that story of relocation,” Ropati said. “Just our ability as Yup’ik people to do these type of things. Not only for survival, but for the love of each other and community.”
As a youth climate advisor, Ropati will be part of a cohort working with United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres to provide “practical and outcome-focused advice, diverse youth perspectives” around climate action, according to a press release from the U.N.
The youth advisor roles are pretty new to the U.N. In 2025, the number of selected advisors doubled from seven to 14. According to the press release, that’s to help support young people who don’t often have a seat at the table. Ropati is one of the first Alaska Native youth to be appointed as an advisor.
“I think this is a huge win, especially for youth in the Arctic,” Ropai said. “Because I don’t think we’ve ever been given this type of platform before.”
It’s a big year to be involved. The United Nations’ annual climate conference will take place this November in Brazil. Also this coming year, countries in the U.N. are required to submit new climate plans.
The plans will follow the Paris Agreement, a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep the global surface temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius. It’s a figure the U.N. has emphasized as a tipping point for damaging climate impacts, a point Ropati said affects the human rights of Indigenous people in the Arctic.
“We know that if that happens, and if our world does do that, that’s going to have devastating impacts, not only on these nations or states, but it’s going to have devastating impacts on Indigenous peoples, and especially on us, on Yup’ik, on Inuit, on Inupiaq, on all of us in our state,” Ropati said.
Ropati said human rights form the foundation of her climate advocacy. She said that Indigenous people on the front lines of climate change are often left out of the discussion when it comes to climate solutions. But she said they’re a group well-equipped with answers.
“When we talk about the climate work we’ve been doing, this is work that has been carried on through generations,” Ropati said. “This is work that didn’t start with me. It started with my great grandfather, to my grandmother, to my mother, and now me.”
Ropati said that climate conversations in the Western world often involve looking for quick fixes. But in Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta villages facing relocation, Ropati said that it’s understood that climate solutions can take generations. The recent relocation of the village of Newtok to a new site, Mertarvik, was one that was decades of planning and discussions in the making.
“It’s not just up to our youth to do this, and it needs to be intergenerational,” Ropati said. “I think this is something we as Indigenous people have always understood and continue to do, especially in our communities.”
In her capacity as a U.N. youth climate advisor, Ropati will work for the next three years alongside appointees from around the world, including Kenya, Sweden, and Indonesia.
Ropati said that she’s looking forward to bringing Indigenous perspectives to the forefront of the international climate discussions.

Wildfire veterans say an immigration raid earlier this week targeting fire crews in Washington state was an alarming development that could threaten the nation’s wildfire readiness. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state on Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotes. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

But they still went ahead with it. The board voted 7-1 to approve the plan, which was released Monday afternoon by Gov. Dan McKee and RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand. The plan calls for reducing service on 46 of its 67 bus lines, primarily impacting weekend and off-peak hours. 
But it will avert bus driver layoffs that would have been necessary under a plan originally proposed July 24 to address a $10 million budget deficit. That earlier plan called on the agency to cut or reduce 58 routes.
“We can’t pass an unbalanced budget here,” Chairman Peter Alviti Jr., who also heads the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, said ahead of the vote. 
The agency’s board was scheduled to approve those deeper cuts Aug. 7 in order to make up for the $10 million budget deficit, but tabled the decision after McKee sent a last-minute letter asking to hold off until the agency could draft a less severe plan.
The result was the “budget framework” announced Monday when McKee offered $3 million in federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality funds that RIPTA would later have to pay back. McKee also called on the agency to eliminate 13 vacant administrative positions and look at increasing the bus fare, which has been $2 per trip since 2010.
“Not only does the decision protect core ridership services, but also it prevents future wide-ranging tax increases on Rhode Islanders,” McKee and Durand said in a joint statement Thursday afternoon. “This decision provides a foundation for RIPTA to build a more modern and financially sustainable transit system.”
Though the service reductions are less extensive than what the agency initially considered, advocates argue the plan does little to actually help the agency.
“Make no mistake, the proposed cuts before you right now remain among the largest in RIPTA’s 59-year history,” John Flaherty, senior adviser for Grow Smart RI, told the board. “It will inflict severe hardships on many people, businesses, and institutions while undermining the value of public transit.”
Daniel Blanchette of Pawtucket said he regularly uses the 35 and 76 buses to get to the VETS Auditorium in Providence, where he works as an aisle captain. Under RIPTA’s service plan, the 76 would no longer run on Saturdays and the 35 would not operate on Sundays.
“A lot of our events happen on the weekends in the evenings,” Blanchette said. “How am I going to get to work when those buses are not there and I need them?”
Jeanelle Wheeler, a Providence resident who said she relies on 20 bus routes per month, warned the board that reducing service will only hurt ridership in the long run.
“This proposal is not a victory,” Wheeler said. “Wounding RIPTA wounds all of Rhode Island, our citizens, our economy, and our future.”

Could the legislature do more? 
Only one board member voted against the new plan. Normand Benoit, the panel’s former chairman,said he was leaning toward approving the cuts. But wanted the board to have the option to rescind the vote if McKee were to asks the General Assembly to allocate additional funding for RIPTA in a supplemental budget.
“I think we have tremendous support if the governor puts a supplemental budget up,” Benoit said.
It’s certainly true for Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat who petitioned the board Thursday to instead pass a resolution to call for a special session.
“While it’s true RIPTA has been dealt a hard hand of being underfunded this last state budget, I want us to recognize there are still other opportunities that exist to prevent these service cuts,” Morales said. 
Rep. Tersa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, also expressed support for getting additional funding for the agency.
“It’s time that we as a state make the determination as to whether or not we are going to be the provider of predictable public transportation, plain and simple,” she told the board.
Tanzi told reporters after the meeting she texted House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi to commit to more funding for RIPTA. Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi’s office, acknowledged a request for comment but did not immediately send a response.










This proposal is not a victory. Wounding RIPTA wounds all of Rhode Island, our citizens, our economy, and our future.

Board member Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said he would support holding a special meeting to revise the cuts, but said he doesn’t see a supplemental budget becoming reality.
“If someone in the government gives us the budget to undo [the cuts], sign me up and we’ll get there and undo them,” He said. “[But] one of the frustrating elements of being on a board like this is much of our decision-making processes are determined by other people. 
“If every month this gets delayed without some kind of agreement, the agency is going deeper and deeper into deficit,” he continued.
But Alviti called Benoit’s move “improper.”
“We can’t just go back to them as we have historically and say, ‘We just want more money,’” he said. “How has that worked over the last 40 years?”
No other board members seconded Benoit’s motion. McKee’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment on whether the governor would recommend the General Assembly look into a supplemental budget.
After the meeting adjourned, transit advocates booed the board.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

Neither the Dauphin County Public Defender’s Office, nor Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office, immediately responded to requests for comment.
Balmer faces 50 felony and misdemeanor charges in connection to the firebombing of the Governor’s Residence.
Early in the morning on April 14, state police allege he hopped the fence of the Governor’s Residence in Harrisburg, broke a window in the home with a hammer and set off multiple Molotov cocktails in a reception room. Balmer was able to evade security and exit the property.
Shapiro and members of his family were asleep inside the residence after celebrating the first night of the Jewish Passover holiday. The room that was primarily damaged was set up for a Seder the following night.
Shapiro is the highest ranking Jewish official in Pennsylvania.
Balmer was arrested after turning himself in later that same day. He told police that he “harbored hatred towards Governor Shapiro,” according to documents released by the Pennsylvania State Police.

He also told a 911 dispatcher he wanted Shapiro to know he “would not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
Shapiro has drawn some criticism for his support of Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas that began the ongoing war in Gaza, and his efforts to quell campus protests in Pennsylvania that followed. He’s also been critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the country’s conduct during the war.

Cindy Hyde-Smith launches reelection bid with visit from U.S. agriculture secretary,Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/28/cindy-hyde-smith-reelection-mississippi-agriculture-brooke-rollins/,"Hyde-Smith highlighted her close relationship with Trump, but also  touted some policies that likely don't align with Trump’s agenda, most notably her disagreements with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.","U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith on Thursday launched her reelection campaign for a second full term by highlighting her advocacy for Mississippi farmers, fighting to overturn abortion rights and having a strong relationship with President Donald Trump. 
The state’s junior U.S. senator was greeted by about 150 supporters at the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum in Jackson. They cheered when she promoted the passage of the “one big beautiful bill,” President Donald Trump-backed legislation that expanded some tax cuts and spending and slashed social safety net programs. 
“The past eight months, we have delivered for the American people,” Hyde-Smith said. 
The senator was flanked by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who spoke in support of her. The pair visited Mississippi State University earlier in the day to announce new policy addressing the state’s veterinarian shortage. 
Rollins said Hyde-Smith fights daily on Capitol Hill for farmers and the agriculture industry by ensuring federal agency leaders understand how federal regulations impact Mississippi farmers. 
“She is a warrior’s warrior,” Rollins said of the senator. “She will never rest until she serves this state and this country to the very best of her ability.” 
Hyde-Smith also praised the Trump administration’s stance on tax policy, heralded its efforts to increase oil drilling, and promoted her own efforts to fight for conservative social policies in Congress. 
A key message she delivered on Thursday is her close relationship with Trump, who has already endorsed her reelection bid. 
“I can send a text to President Trump, and he responds,” she said. 
But at the event, Hyde-Smith touted some policies that likely don’t align with Trump’s agenda, most notably her disagreements with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
“Bobby Kennedy is going to do some really good things,” she said. “I think that he’s going to do some things that are beneficial. But when he crossed over into the line of production agriculture, we had a little dustup. I’ll be honest with you, we had a pretty big dustup over it. I told him in the beginning that when you come after the American farmer and the products that we have depended on for 50-something years, and you think you’re going to take them off the market, I’m going to be the first one through your door.”

While the senator was not specific about the disagreement with Kennedy, she seemed to be referring to a back-and-forth she had with Kennedy in an Appropriations Committee meeting about the Cabinet secretary’s fight against certain pesticides. 
According to the New York Times, Hyde-Smith told Kennedy not to interfere with the livelihood of American farmers by suggesting certain pesticides are unsafe. 
Hyde-Smith also stated that the state’s agriculture sector needs to be bolstered by migrant farmworkers, as the country would “starve to death” without them. However, she emphasized that the workers should enter the country legally. 
The senator also joked about riding in a truck with a member of the audience and “spotlighting” deer along a trail, something that is illegal in Mississippi.  
“We didn’t spotlight that night, did we? Oh, we didn’t shoot anything. That’s it,” Hyde-Smith said. 
Spotlighting is an illegal hunting technique where a hunter shines a high-powered light at a deer, causing the animal to freeze and making it easier to kill. If someone is caught shining a light at the deer at night, it can result in a hefty fine and the loss of hunting privileges. It is also illegal to intentionally shine lights at deer without shooting them.
Hyde-Smith said the audience member had a large flashlight with a “spinner” on it.  
“I said, ‘I probably need to get out of this truck right now,’” Hyde-Smith said. 
Even though the U.S. Senate race won’t occur until 2026, it appears Hyde-Smith’s Thursday event is a signal that she’s taking a likely competitive reelection campaign seriously.
Scott Colom, a district attorney in north Mississippi, is widely rumored to be considering a run for the Democratic nomination. U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said he’s looking for ways to break the GOP’s grip on Mississippi in 2026. 
Ty Pinkins, a 2023 unsuccessful candidate for Mississippi Secretary of State and a 2024 unsuccessful Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, is running as an independent. 
Before she faces Colom and Pinkins, though, Hyde-Smith will have to capture the GOP nomination. 
Hyde-Smith has attracted two Republican primary challengers, neither of whom has held elected office before. One of the challengers entered the race at a press conference hours before Hyde-Smith announced her reelection bid.

Andrew Scott Smith, who has a pork rinds business, calls himself the “Pigskin Politician.” The 29-year-old Florence resident announced his bid for the U.S. Senate on Thursday behind a podium set up between the William F. Winter Archives and History Building and the Two Mississippi Museums in Jackson.
Smith said he was challenging Hyde-Smith because she has become disconnected from her constituents.
Smith, who considers himself a monopoly-busting conservative in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt, said he hopes to address consolidation in the American economy through index funds. He also wants to focus on the “fiscal future” of the country by phasing out social security and federalizing the national debt.
Smith took a swipe at Hyde-Smith’s other Republican challenger: Sarah Adlakha “or however you pronounce her last name,” as Smith said in his speech.
Adlakha had already entered the race before Thursday. A physician, Adlakha says on her campaign website that she is running “to protect the values that raised her—faith, family, freedom, and hard work — by securing the border, stopping reckless spending, improving healthcare, and putting Mississippi first.”
Hyde-Smith, a Brookhaven resident, previously served in the Mississippi Senate before being elected to the statewide post of commissioner of agriculture and commerce. In 2018, former Gov. Phil Bryant appointed her to the U.S. Senate to replace Thad Cochran, who opted to retire. She has since been elected to the U.S. Senate twice. 
In 2018 and 2020, Hyde-Smith defeated Democrat Mike Espy, an attorney, a former congressman and former U.S. secretary of agriculture in the Clinton administration.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
A Q&A with New Hampshire’s state epidemiologist, Dr. Benjamin Chan

Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.
Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
New Hampshire Republicans introduced several vaccine bills during their legislative session this year. One, which would have allowed parents to opt out of vaccines that have not been shown to prevent transmission, died in the Senate. Another would have allowed the legislature to choose which vaccines to make mandatory but id not progress in the Senate. And yet another, which would have made it easier to get a religious exemption, was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte. However, parents can still claim a religious exemption in New Hampshire.
Bills targeting childhood vaccine and mask requirements advanced by NH House Republicans

Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

The latest in a string of court losses clears the way for a class action lawsuit against the state’s only wine and spirits retailer. A Lancaster County restaurant filed the suit on behalf of other businesses and consumers who were improperly charged a $1.75 per-bottle handling fee.
Philadelphia attorney John Papianou, who has been pursuing the case since 2020, said the state could be on the hook for more than $50 million in damages for ignoring a statutory mandate that should have made it easier and cheaper to order rare wines and liquor.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s not often that the state so clearly violates the law,” Papianou told the Capital-Star, adding that it’s even more unusual for substantial monetary damages to be involved. 
“If a state’s not doing something that it’s supposed to do, it might affect somebody or a group of people, but typically you don’t see an unlawful taking,” he said.
A spokesperson for the PLCB said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.
Papianou said the case stems from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the PLCB’s Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores were closed under then-Gov. Tom Wolf’s pandemic emergency order.
Under a 2016 change to the state Liquor Code, the PLCB was supposed to set up a system allowing out-of-state distributors to deliver orders directly to buyers by June 2017. Previously, the law required special orders to be shipped to a state liquor store for pick up where the PLCB collected the handling fee.
As part of the change, the agency was also required to stop collecting handling fees. 
But it continued to require special orders to go to stores and collected handling fees until it finally established a direct-delivery process in 2022. 
When the pandemic hit, a friend of Papianou’s who owns a New York-based wine import and distribution business saw his revenue in Pennsylvania drop to zero. 
With the stores closed indefinitely, out-of-state  distributors had nowhere to ship orders and were losing sales, Papianou said. And with his calendar empty because courthouses were closed too, Papianou and his friend decided to sue the agency to force it to follow the law.
They won a Commonwealth Court ruling in May 2020 that the changes in the Liquor Code were mandatory and required the PLCB to implement the special order direct shipment process required by the 2017 legislation. The state Supreme Court affirmed the decision on appeal.
In an Aug. 21 decision, Commonwealth Court Judge Anne Covey rejected the PLCB’s claim that the lawsuit was barred by a statute of limitations that required any lawsuit to be filed within six months. She also ruled against the agency, finding that the plaintiffs have a claim for damages against the state for failing to perform a duty required by law.

Papianou said the decision means the lawsuit filed by The Log Cabin Restaurant in Leola and a separate lawsuit by Philadelphia wine bar Bloomsday Cafe can move toward a trial. Papianou said he has requested and expects the two cases will be merged.
Data kept by the PLCB shows that consumers chose direct delivery for special orders nearly exclusively as soon as it was available. The same data provides a record of every business and individual who paid the handling fee.
“We believe we’re in the right and we’re not going to stop until [the money] is returned,” Papianou said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20191002_142653-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-28 19:57:43.456195

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)   The first official visit to Rhode Island by a member of President Donald Trump’s cabinet turned out to be a largely private affair. 
U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer met with Cranston firefighters at their Pontiac Avenue headquarters Thursday afternoon as part of her “America at Work” listening tour. 
The secretary’s staff and security detail drove directly into the fire department’s bay-windowed garage shortly before 1 p.m., closed the doors, then opened them once she was inside. Reporters were kept at a distance, and the secretary was kept out of sight. Firefighters then ran through demonstrations in baggy, fluorescent-colored hazmat suits as the secretary toured the station inside.

A few hours before the event, Hunter Lovell, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Labor, said via email that Thursday’s visit builds on Chavez-DeRemer’s celebration earlier this year of National Apprenticeship Day, when she hosted the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) for a ceremony in Washington, D.C., on new apprenticeship standards for first responders. 
“Firefighters put their lives on the line every day, and it’s critical they have access to the best training and apprenticeship opportunities available,” Chavez-DeRemer said in her statement. “I’m grateful for the impressive work the Cranston Fire Department and the International Association of Fire Fighters are doing to prepare the next generation of first responders, and I deeply appreciate their dedication and service to their communities.”
Apprenticeships and staffing challenges were some of the topics discussed during the secretary’s visit, firefighter told reporters after Chavez-DeRemer had left. But unlike the secretary’s recent tour stops in New Hampshire and Idaho, the press was not allowed a peek at Chavez-DeRemer’s interactions and luncheon with the fire department’s recruits and senior staff.
Just after 2 p.m., the front doors to the fire station’s garage closed again, as Chavez-DeRemer and her staff gathered in the garage area to watch a demonstration out of sight of the three reporters and a cameraman who had been waiting outside for over an hour.

The secretary’s two-car motorcade drove off shortly afterward, as  reporters shouted questions for the secretary.. A remaining federal staffer who parked on the other side of the fire station ran away when reporters began asking questions, got into his car and drove off.  
The fire department had suggested the news media would have the opportunity to ask the secretary questions, but by the event’s conclusion it was still unclear who decided to keep the event private. One  federal staffer told reporters that the fire department had asked for things to be kept private.
“That’s not my call. I have no comment on that,” Jonathan Francis, union president of Cranston Firefighters IAFF Local 1363, told reporters after the secretary left. 
Firefighters said they enjoyed a pleasant afternoon with the secretary discussing staffing and workforce issues. Francis said that Cranston is short six firefighters from being fully staffed, and that they’re hiring — but the city’s situation is not unique.
“Every community is struggling,” he said. “Call numbers — they’re never going down, they’re always going up. We see that going on throughout the state.”
Cranston’s Republican Mayor Ken Hopkins was invited but was unable to attend,  his spokesperson, Zachary DeLuca, said. Hopkins’ Chief of Staff Anthony Moretti did attend, however, and spoke with reporters alongside firefighters. Moretti said the event was on the mayor’s calendar at least a week ago. 
Why Cranston for the quietly momentous cabinet member visit?
“Because we’re the best fire department in the best city in the state of Rhode Island,” Moretti said, adding that, to his knowledge, no other fire departments had been invited by the labor department ahead of the secretary’s visit.
Moretti said Chavez-DeRemer had wanted “to really keep it low-key, to sit down, meet face to face with the various firefighters.” He characterized the “very genuine” event as one in which the need for “intimacy” with laborers was perhaps prioritized over public access. 
“She seemed to relate so well to the firefighters’ department,” Moretti said, relaying the secretary’s comment that firefighters don’t serve Republicans or Democrats but the public at large. “It’s pretty resounding, and it really speaks true of what these people do.” 
The chief of staff also clarified what was on the lunch menu.
“Diced chicken,” he said. “A spicy, diced chicken, and a healthy salad.”

Union-friendly, but under fire
Prior to her confirmation as labor secretary, Chavez-DeRemer accrued a largely favorable record with large unions nationwide. As a one-term U.S. representative for Oregon’s fifth district, Chavez-DeRemer — whose father was a Teamster — emerged as one of the GOP’s most pro-union members, being one of few Republicans to support the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act — legislation AFL-CIO has hailed as “landmark worker empowerment.”
In March, Chavez-DeRemer’s proclivity for supporting unions led two Republican senators — Kentucky’s Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell —  to vote against her confirmation as labor secretary. Her appointment succeeded, with a 67-32 vote. 
In a Thursday statement, Rhode Island’s solidly blue congressional delegation pounced on Chavez-DeRemer’s visit for seemingly opposite reasons, citing the Trump administration’s recent cancellation of the Revolution Wind project off of Block Island. The Aug. 22 stop-work order paused the 80% complete offshore wind project, idling an estimated 1,000 unionized workers.
U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo issued a joint statement that found the labor secretary’s visit optically problematic after the Revolution Wind news and the recent unfurling of a banner sporting Trump’s visage outside the U.S. Department of Labor building.
“Instead of having her staff make a giant banner of the President to hang at the Labor Department, Secretary Chavez-DeRemer would be wise to listen to and learn from the hardworking Rhode Islanders that the Trump administration put out of work this Labor Day weekend in their corrupt quest to crush clean energy,” the delegates wrote. “We hope she does so on this trip.” 
Whitehouse also launched separate salvoes against the visit on his X and Facebook accounts. Reed followed suit and made a similar post on Thursday morning. 
The two senators, however, were more divided when it came time to confirm Chavez-DeRemer’s appointment back in March. Like Rand and McConnell, Reed was one of 32 dissenters who voted against Chavez-DeRemer’s confirmation. Whitehouse voted in support.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (2024 file photo)A federal judge has stymied a Republican candidate’s attempts to stop his GOP rival from using a special committee to gain a fundraising advantage in next year’s race for governor.
But the judge’s ruling may not be the last word on the dispute.  
Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running for governor, had challenged Lt. Gov. Burt Jones’ use of leadership committees that give certain high-ranking elected officials and candidates the ability to raise unlimited donations. That includes during the legislative session between January and late March, when other candidates – like Carr – must pause their fundraising efforts.

Carr’s office defended the law that created the leadership committees, but he has objected to Jones’ ability to use the committee to run for a higher office, which Carr said in an online video this month is “cheating the system.”
Jones’ leadership committee recently reported receiving about $14.7 million in campaign contributions, though $10 million is money Jones has personally loaned to his campaign.
But U.S. District Judge Victoria Marie Calvert dismissed Carr’s case in a ruling Thursday after concluding that Carr and his campaign for governor lacked standing to bring the lawsuit.
The judge said Carr had asked “the Court to twist itself into a logical pretzel” by challenging the constitutionality of Jones’ reliance on the leadership committee and not the underlying law.
“Plaintiffs do not allege that Mr. Jones is unlawfully operating his campaign committee or that he plays any role in enforcing the campaign contribution scheme,” Calvert wrote in the ruling. “Instead, Plaintiffs appear to allege that Defendants are doing exactly what Georgia law allows them to do. While this has injured Plaintiffs, the Court agrees that the Defendants are not the cause of that injury.”
The Carr campaign has not yet said whether it will appeal the decision.
“The Court acknowledged that this statute gives Burt Jones an unfair and harmful advantage – the same conclusion other federal judges have reached when examining it. The case was dismissed on a procedural technicality, not on the merits. We are reviewing all legal options to right this wrong,” Carr campaign spokesperson Julia Mazzone said Thursday.
Jones’ campaign seemed unconcerned about the threat of continued litigation.  
“If Chris is this bad at being a lawyer, why would anyone want to give him a promotion?” said Kendyl Parker, Jones’ spokesperson.

The 2001 Roadless Rule prohibits the construction of road and harvest of timber on inventoried roadless areas — roughly 30% of all Forest Service land — across the county preserving intact ecosystems across huge swaths of federal public lands in western states. 
Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a press release that rescinding the rule will bring “common sense management” to national forest land. 
“Today marks a critical step forward in President Trump’s commitment to restoring local decision-making to federal land managers to empower them to do what’s necessary to protect America’s forests and communities from devastating destruction from fires,” Rollins said. “This administration is dedicated to removing burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations that not only put people and livelihoods at risk but also stifle economic growth in rural America. It is vital that we properly manage our federal lands to create healthy, resilient, and productive forests for generations to come.”
The U.S. Forest Service will publish its Notice of Intent in the Federal Register on Aug. 29, kicking off a 21-day public comment period that will run through Sept. 19. 
The order will apply to nearly 45 million acres of Forest Service Land, according to USDA, and aligns with two executive orders signed by President Donald Trump aimed at increasing logging operations on federal land. 

The USDA Forest Service will open the public comment period Friday. To learn how to submit a comment, visit Federalregister.gov.

Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who previously worked for the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and for a large lumber producer in Idaho. In a statement, he said changes in management strategy reflect how forests have changed during the last 25 years. 
“The Roadless Rule has frustrated land managers and served as a barrier to action – prohibiting road construction, which has limited wildfire suppression and active forest management,” Schultz said. “The forests we know today are not the same as the forests of 2001. They are dangerously overstocked and increasingly threatened by drought, mortality, insect-borne disease, and wildfire. It’s time to return land management decisions where they belong – with local Forest Service experts who best understand their forests and communities.”
Schultz was in Montana last week meeting with Congressional leaders in the Western Caucus where he advocated for increasing logging operations and increased access on federal lands. 
 Montana’s Roadless Areas 

Montana has 6.4 million acres of inventoried roadless rule, roughly 37% of all Forest Service land in the state. The state contains the third most inventoried roadless Forest Service land behind Alaska’s 15 million acres and Idaho’s 9.3 million acres. 
“This is another huge win for Montana and forest management. This latest news from the USDA shows that the Trump administration is committed to Montana-First priorities,” Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican, said in a previous statement. “By rolling back the outdated Roadless Rule, we’ll be better equipped to manage our Montana forests and protect our communities. I applaud Secretary Rollins for this decision to give our local forests more tools to manage our state’s national forests.”
Montana’s eastern Congressman Rep. Troy Downing called the move “long overdue.” 
But while elected officials, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, praised the move, many conservation and environmental groups decried it as putting the state’s public lands at risk. 
“America’s national forests give us clean air, water, wildlife, and the freedom for all to enjoy the outdoors,” said The Wilderness Society President Tracy Stone-Manning, the former director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Biden and a former Montana department head. “But now they are the latest target in this administration’s unpopular push to give away our lands to drill, mine and log. Gutting the Roadless Rule—which has protected our forests for 25 years—would be the single largest rollback of conservation protections in our nation’s history. Americans cherish their public lands and deserve leaders who protect them for future generations, not give them away to corporations that exploit them.”
In Montana, each major national forest would be impacted by the rescission. 
The Flathead National Forest includes an inventoried roadless area spanning 478,000 acres, along the western edge of the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area and throughout the Whitefish Range. In the Gallatin National Forest, more than 31% of land — 552,000 acres — prohibits road construction including throughout the Crazy Mountains and the Madison range south of Bozeman; In the Kootenai National Forest, more than 600,000 acres of roadless area borders the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness; the Bitterroot National Forest has more than 200,00 acres of roadless area bordering the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness; and the Beaverhead Deerlodge National Forest includes more than 1.6 million acres of roadless area.

“Rolling back the Roadless Rule is another step in the plan to take public lands away from the American people, selling out our shared places and making us less safe to maximize corporate profits,” said Wild Montana Federal Policy Director Hilary Eisen. “The Rule allows for a wide variety of fire suppression activities. Pretending otherwise is a flimsy cover story for handing our treasured places over to industrial interests. Building unnecessary roads will lead to more fires, not fewer, and stripping protections from 60 million acres threatens Montana’s clean water, public access, and our freedom to hike, hunt, fish, camp, ride, climb, and ski.”
“When this rule was considered in 2000, tens of thousands of Montanans, including many Wild Montana members, participated in the process by attending public meetings and submitting comments. Montanans overwhelmingly supported the Roadless Rule then, and we still do,” Eisen added.
While many industry leaders and politicians have praised the move as a way to bolster the timber industry, Forest Service documents from the Roadless Rule’s inception indicate that the reduction in annual harvest from the creation of roadless areas was likely to amount to less than 1% of the state’s historic timber harvest.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In a rare move, a majority of the Oklahoma State Board of Education has scheduled its own meeting without the consent of state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who board members say has refused to cooperate.
The decision comes a day after Walters abruptly canceled a meeting with the board that was meant to take place Thursday.  
Four board members — Chris Van Denhende, Mike Tinney, Ryan Deatherage and Becky Carson — invoked a state law that allows a majority of the seven-member board to call a meeting. They scheduled the meeting through the Secretary of State’s Office for 10 a.m. Wednesday at the state Capitol to hire a new attorney to represent the board, according to a letter sent on Thursday to Walters, which Oklahoma Voice obtained.
Oklahoma City attorney Bob Burke, who is representing the four board members, wrote the letter urging Walters and the Oklahoma State Department of Education to also post a notice of the Wednesday meeting.

If the Education Department doesn’t post a meeting notice by 9 a.m. Tuesday, Burke said he will ask the Oklahoma Supreme Court to force Walters to do so.
“They previously asked for a special meeting of the Board of Education for the purpose of retaining the services of an attorney approved by the Attorney General to represent the Board’s interest,” Burke wrote in his letter to Walters. “To date, you have refused to schedule such a special meeting. You are fully aware of the statutes that authorize a majority of the members of the Board to call a special meeting.
“It is the hope of my clients that you will join them in convening the special session so that this urgent matter of business can be considered.”
Walters has yet to respond to the letter, Burke told Oklahoma Voice. He said one of the board members could lead the meeting if Walters, the board’s chair, doesn’t attend.
Burke said he isn’t the attorney the board intends to hire. Rather, he is helping them schedule a meeting, he said.
An Education Department spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday evening. The agency previously said it canceled the state board meeting this week because its staff and legal team are in flux.
The board’s previous attorney, Chad Kutmas, withdrew from his position in recent weeks after three board members asked the Attorney General’s Office to remove him. The attorney general has the authority to cancel a lawyer’s contract with a state board and did so with the state Board of Education last year.
Van Denhende, Deatherage and Carson complained Kutmas represented Walters’ interests more than theirs.
“He is often uncooperative, belittling, and argumentative with board members,” Carson wrote in an email to the Attorney General’s Office. “He does not represent the best interest of the board, which is what he is contracted to do. He has made it apparent in his actions, or lack of, that we as a board are not his priority.”

Joe Lombardo said Thursday. (Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)The state does not know what the cyber attackers who crashed multiple state systems and stole some data from those systems want, Gov. Joe Lombardo said Thursday.
Asked if the attackers had contacted the state, Lombardo said “we know there was an intrusion, we’re evaluating how the intrusion occurred, and currently CISA (the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), from the federal government, is evaluating whether there’s a demand.”
Asked to clarify that there had been no demand, Lombardo said “it’s clear there’s been an intrusion, but it’s not clear what the motive was.”
Lombardo made his remarks during a briefing with reporters in Las Vegas Thursday afternoon.
The governor also addressed his absence at the first public briefing on the attack by public officials, which had been held Wednesday. The absence seemed conspicuous to many, including the Nevada Democratic Party, which issued a statement linking to a social media notice posted by the Elko County Republicans for an RSVP-only meet and greet with the governor Wednesday.
Lombardo said he was attending pre-planned meetings with constituents in Elko, Eureka and Ely for meetings “with local government officials and constituents” and in frequent contact with state agency directors and the experts engaged in the process of recovering and restoring Nevada’s downed systems.
“Listen,” Lombardo said Thursday after being asked multiple questions about his absence the day before, “this press conference is not intended to address my absence. I’m here, I’m taking care of business, and I’ve never strayed from my responsibility as your governor.”
Lombardo also addressed earlier statements from his office early in the week that the state was unaware of any personal information released into the public. “That’s what we knew at the time,” he said.
On Wednesday, the Governor’s Technology Office’s Timothy Galluzi announced data had in fact been removed from the state networks, though officials aren’t sure exactly what the data was. 
Several state agency directors Thursday reiterated updates they had made the day before about the status of their services.
But unlike Wednesday, the state has created a website designed to provide Nevadans with daily “service status” updates and functioning contact information for state agencies and departments. The website’s content is to be updated frequently, Lombardo said.
Ransoms, and a bill that didn’t become a law
“I’m absolutely confident in our level of preparedness,” Lombardo said Thursday, noting that cyber intrusions are increasingly common worldwide. 
“Of course you can’t prevent everything from happening” including mitigation and preparedness exercises, and having third parties testing systems. “We have done that,” Lombardo said.
“Unfortunately,” he added, the cyber attackers “had access into our systems, and we’re evaluating why.”
Earlier this year legislation was introduced by Las Vegas Republican Assemblymember Toby Yurek to create a state “Security Operations Center” (SOC) to better protect the state of Nevada from cyber threats.
“Every voter record, every tax record, every tax form, every school form, every email sent, every transaction is an opportunity for a threat actor to move from a Nevadan to a visitor to a local entity, and beyond,” Galluzi, the executive director of the Governor’s Technology Office and the state’s chief information officer, said while making a presentation in support of the legislation in March.
Galluzi praised increased collaboration between state agencies on cyber threat awareness and prevention, but “collaboration is not a substitute for structure. Nevada lacks a centralized backbone for cybersecurity,” Galluzi told the Assembly Government Affairs Committee.
Also, “many of our agencies are running on aging infrastructure, and tight budgets.”
Galluzi in March also referenced several instances of cyber attacks carried out against state and local governments, including a 2008 ransomware attack in Atlanta where recovery costs were estimated at $17 million, and a 2023 ransomware attack on Oakland, California.
Oakland didn’t pay the ransom. That resulted in class action suits filed on behalf of at least 13,000 Oakland city employees. Oakland reached a settlement earlier this year agreeing to provide compensation, including $350 per person for credit report and credit monitoring costs, $175 cash for every Oakland police officer, and up to $10,000 per claimant for extraordinary losses connected to identity theft and fraud.  
At least two states, North Carolina and Florida, have banned public ransomware payments. 
Ohio earlier this year enacted legislation by which any public government agency cannot pay ransomware before first getting approval, publicly, from the legislative body with oversight of the agency.
And New York enacted legislation this summer requiring state and local governments to disclose to the state’s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services if they have paid ransomware.
“There is no absolute policy” on paying ransoms in Nevada, Lombardo said Thursday, saying the options “are under consideration.”
“We do have an insurance policy that helps us,” he added. 
In addition to creating a Security Operations Center within the chief information office, which is under Galluzi’s direction, the legislation, AB 432, would have authorized that office to apply for additional federal grants to finance state security enhancements. The bill also would have extended SOC coverage to school districts, and required the SOC to provide annual accountability reports.
After that March 24 committee hearing, the bill was referred to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, where funding determinations and allocations are made, and which is colloquially referred to as “where bills go to die.” No further action was taken on the bill. 
The cyber attack on the state occurred less than three months after the end of the legislative session. Even if progress began immediately on creating an SOC, and a state investigation that is still ongoing, it is impossible to know if the legislation might have helped prevent the attack.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3390-scaled-e1756422844874-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-08-28 19:57:43.456195

(Governor's office photo) Officials cut the ribbon Thursday on a state prison for women, Louisiana’s first new state correctional facility in 35 years.
The new $160 million Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women in St. Gabriel will have 958 beds. The 15-building campus is spread over nearly 7 acres and includes a rehabilitation center, classrooms, a gymnasium, health care facilities and a treatment center for women who deliver babies while in prison.
About 1,000 women state prisoners had been housed at the nearby Elayn Hunt Correctional Center until historic flooding in 2016 rendered the facility unusable. Since then, incarcerated women in state custody have been held at facilities around the state, including the former Jetson Correctional Center for Youth in Baker.
Hunt Correctional Center, which was opened in 1972, has since been repaired and is now used to hold men in state custody. Plans to replace the state’s only women’s prison stalled as state officials sparred with the Federal Emergency Management Agency over whether the damaged campus should be rebuilt or repaired.  
Plans call for 472 women currently at Jetson to move to the new prison in the coming weeks, along with 400 others from the Louisiana Transitional Center for Women in Madison Parish. The state is not disclosing exactly when those transfers will take place for security reasons, a Department of Corrections spokesperson said.
The new prison will employ 261 people and a health care staff of 56. The medical team includes 
full-time physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers and a dentist, along with other part-time specialty physicians.
“The Department [of Corrections] takes the dignity, care and treatment of incarcerated women in its custody seriously,” Kristen Thomas, the prison’s warden since 2021, said in a statement. “Today’s grand opening reflects the culmination of many years of extensive work and a centralized new beginning for my staff, the women in our custody and the volunteers who dedicate their service.”
Before Thursday’s ceremonies, Louisiana last opened a new state prison in 1990 when the Allen Correction Center in Allen Parish was brought online. That came a year after the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center opened in Avoyelles Parish.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/540960050_122235051818179824_1422657781185784877_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-28 19:57:43.456195

Ty Burns, R-Pawnee, sits at the House dais while awaiting action from the Senate on a veto override on May 29, 2025. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A Republican state representative Thursday was charged and pleaded guilty to three domestic-violence related crimes, the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office said.
Rep. Ty Burns, R-Pawnee, pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of domestic abuse and two misdemeanor counts of assault and received a one-year suspended sentence, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Burns, 46, was charged in connection with domestic violence incidents in November 2024 and April 25, 2025, involving family members, including his wife, who sustained an eye injury, according to court records. 
The assault charges were filed after he tried to run a vehicle off the road that was being driven by an adult with a minor family member as a passenger, according to court documents.
Burns was accused of striking the vehicle with his hands, screaming and making threats of violence, including that he would kill the driver, according to charging documents released Thursday afternoon.
Both occupants in the vehicle were reportedly injured when Burns ran them off the road into a ditch, according to charging documents.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond called the charges “serious,” but said he is encouraged that Burns took responsibility. Under the terms of his sentence, Burns will receive counseling, Drummond said.
Burns has been a representative for House District 35, which includes Creek, Noble, Osage, Pawnee and Payne counties, since 2018.
Pawnee County District Judge Patrick Pickerill issued the one-year suspended sentence to run concurrently for each count.
Burns will have to complete a Batterers Intervention Program.
“I take full responsibility for my actions and have started a year-long batterers intervention program and am getting treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and learning how to deal with past experiences in a more healthy manner,” Burns said in a statement.
Burns said he was stepping down as chairman of the House Appropriations and Budget Finance Subcommittee to focus on his family and constituents.
Burns has a background in law enforcement, teaching, coaching, the military and ranching, according to the Oklahoma House website. He retired in 2018 from the 45th Infantry Brigade with 20 years of service. He was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and said he has been awarded the Bronze Star, which recognizes heroic achievement, and a Purple Heart.
Drummond took the case after Pawnee County District Attorney Mike Fisher recused. Drummond’s office had the option of assigning another district attorney’s office to the case, but kept the case because he was committed to aggressively prosecuting cases of domestic violence, said Phil Bacharach, a spokesman. 
Sen. Michael Brooks, D-Oklahoma City, who is a criminal defense attorney and not involved in the case, said while not unheard of, it is “definitely unusual” for a defendant to be charged and plead guilty the same day.
Prosecutors have discretion with public figures and can work with defense attorneys to see if there is a way to resolve it rather than go through a lengthy court process, Brooks said.
Bacharach said it is unusual to file charges and have the defendant plead the same day, but Burns did not get special treatment.
The arrangement meant attorneys in Drummond’s office had to make fewer trips to the Pawnee County courthouse and saved the office resources, Bacharach said.

(Photo by Dayton Call for Utah News Dispatch)Bagpipes echoed through the Logan Cemetery as roughly 1,000 police officers gathered before a flag-draped casket carrying the body of 31-year-old Eric Estrada, a Tremonton-Garland officer who was gunned down two weeks ago responding to reports of domestic violence. 
Estrada, the newest officer with Tremonton-Garland’s small department, was a member of the community outreach team. And among the speakers Thursday, which included Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Estrada’s fellow officers and family, a common theme emerged, perhaps summed up best by Tremonton-Garland detective Michelle Cluff.
“Eric Estrada was community policing.” 
Cluff, who met Estrada when she was in the police academy in 2019, was one of the opening speakers during the funeral service at the Utah State University’s Dee Glen Smith Spectrum. She remembered her colleague as someone most comfortable on patrol, approaching people in his community with a friendly demeanor that would ease even the worst moods. 
“The community, the people he encountered every day, meant everything to him,” she said. “He came up with plans for community outreach and found his personal calling to educate the public.”

Cluff recalled a driving under the influence arrest Estrada made that she believes defines the young officer’s approach to policing. 
“Eric spoke with the man, treated him like a person, and it was that conversation and the way he presented himself that convinced the man to turn his life around. He has been sober ever since and is now happily married with a child.” 
Tremonton-Garland Police Chief Dustin Cordova called Estrada a model officer who helped bust stereotypes and build the community’s trust in police. 
“He spent time with our most vulnerable citizens, educating and supporting them,” Cordova said. “He showed them that officers are more than just a scary thing, they are our neighbors and protectors.”
Jesus Estrada, Eric’s brother, described his sibling as a confident, competitive child with an infectious smile and fierce love for his family. 
“His laugh was contagious, it could fill a room, lighten any mood and stick with you long after the moment passed. That’s what I miss, his spirit, his energy, his presence,” Estrada said. “Those were the simple, perfect moments and I’ll carry those with me always. Eric wasn’t just a part of my life, he shaped it, he challenged it, he looked out for me and he showed me again and again what it means to live fully and to never do anything halfway.” 
Cienna Estrada, one of Eric’s two young children, echoed her uncle. Her dad was always game to play Minecraft, take his family to the river on sunny days or jump on the trampoline. 
“He put others ahead of himself, he was a great human being,” she said. “We love you and miss you very much.” 
‘He gave his life helping his brother and protecting others’
Estrada’s law enforcement career started in 2017 when he joined the Logan Police Department. He later took a job with the Box Elder County Sheriff’s Office at the jail, before transferring to the North Park Police Department to work as a detective. He was just months into a new job with the Tremonton-Garland Police Department’s community outreach team when he was killed.

Estrada, along with his colleague Sgt. Lee Sorensen, was dispatched to a Tremonton neighborhood on the evening of Aug. 17 to investigate reports of a domestic dispute. It’s unclear who arrived on the scene first, but according to court documents one of the officers spoke to the wife of Ryan Michael Bate, a 32-year-old man with a history of domestic violence allegations. 
Investigators would later report that Bate assaulted his wife that night, headbutting her, slamming her head with a door and grabbing her throat. 
However, as she spoke with one of the officers, the woman assured them there was no violence, according to court documents. As the officer was driving away, Bate emerged from his house with a high-powered rifle and shot at the patrol car. The officer called for backup, parked the car and, as he got out, was fatally shot. 
The second officer then arrived — as he ran to help his colleague, Bate fired another shot, killing him. A third sheriff’s deputy and his police service dog were also shot that day. Both are recovering. 
“It makes complete sense that Lee and Eric went together because neither would have left the other alone,” said a tearful Cluff. “They both lived to serve and protect the community.” 
That evening, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox began receiving text updates about the shooting. He hoped those initial reports of two officers down and a third wounded were inaccurate — instead, 24 hours later, he was at the Utah Medical Examiner’s Office in Taylorsville hugging Estrada’s wife, Brittney. 
“Her eyes lit up as she got to tell me about the man that is Eric Estrada,” the governor said. “He wanted to make a difference, he wanted to help other people and make their community better and paid the ultimate price for doing that.” 
“Eric Estrada showed us the meaning of valor,” Cordova added. “He gave his life helping his brother and protecting others.” 
A somber farewell
Following the service on Thursday, nearly 1,000 officers quietly filed out of the arena to the nearby Logan Cemetery, where they formed a cordon that spanned nearly a half mile. 
Officers from around the state and country — several Texas departments were present Thursday, as well as officers from Wyoming and Idaho — saluted as a hearse crept through the corridor, followed by members of Estrada’s family. 
Bagpipes cut through the silence, playing out the melody to “Amazing Grace” as officers lined up to give Estrada the customary three-volley rifle salute. Then came the bugle, and the melancholy notes of taps. Four helicopters flew low over the gravesite. 
Before the crowds dispersed, a police radio crackled to life. “Last call for Eric Estrada,” the dispatcher said, her voice wavering. “You may be gone, Eric, but you will never be forgotten. Thank you for your service, officer Eric Estrada, we salute you.”

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Judiciary Committee said Thursday it is “premature” to hold a legislative hearing into Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to convert a state prison into an immigration detention facility.
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln advised 13 progressive lawmakers who had requested that she schedule a public hearing to instead direct questions to the executive branch and the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Bosn said questions would be “most efficiently and effectively” be answered this way and be answered faster than what is needed to schedule a public hearing.
“Up to this point, the executive branch has been responsive to questions from the Legislature, and a public hearing is premature,” Bosn, a former prosecutor, wrote in a Thursday response letter.

Meanwhile, Nebraska Appleseed on Thursday delivered a petition to Gov. Jim Pillen’s office from more than 18,000 people in 386 Nebraska communities urging him to halt plans for the migrant detention center. The signatures were collected within the past week.
Pillen, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and other state officials on Aug. 19 announced that Nebraska would convert the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook from an approximate 200-bed facility aimed at helping prisoners prepare for life after incarceration into a nearly 300-bed detention center for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. State and federal officials have rebranded it as the “Cornhusker Clink.”
Director Rob Jeffreys of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services has said he wants the repurposed facility to be a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement. Pillen said earlier this week that the repurposed facility should be operational within the next 45 days.
What to know about Nebraska-ICE plan to retool McCook Work Ethic Camp

Legislative oversight
Back-and-forth legislative jockeying began Wednesday when State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a progressive registered nonpartisan, and 12 Democratic lawmakers sent a list of questions to Bosn that the group said needed to be answered. In their letter, the senators suggested the answers should come in a public forum.
Other lawmakers signing the letter were State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Machaela Cavanaugh, Danielle Conrad, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Margo Juarez, Terrell McKinney, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree and Ashlei Spivey.
Lawmakers’ questions include the legality of Pillen entering a federal agreement to convert a state-run, legislatively defined prison into an ICE facility and the legality of Jeffreys’ department housing ICE detainees.
The Nebraska Constitution’s Article IV, Section 19, has since 1875 given the Legislature exclusive authority in the “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”

The Legislature this spring completed a nearly two-year effort to clarify and strengthen its legislative oversight of executive branch agencies, including the Nebraska prison system.
“The governor’s disregard for including the Legislature — the people’s branch — is deeply problematic,” the senators wrote Wednesday. “Nebraskans deserve answers.”
The Governor’s Office and Correctional Services Department have not yet addressed critics’ questions over state law and the Nebraska Constitution. Pillen has said he is stepping up to answer Trump’s call for governors and states to do their part to enforce federal immigration laws.
‘We aren’t going away’
Lawmakers will return for the 2026 legislative session in early January, when senators will likely introduce legislation dealing with the Work Ethic Camp. In Nebraska, all legislative proposals get a public hearing in the one-house, officially nonpartisan Legislature.

Among comments by petition signers:

“I say NO to opening a cruel and harmful ICE detainment camp anywhere in our state. This is inhumane.” — Lexington resident.
“Nebraskans do not want this. Not in our state, not anywhere. Do your job!” — Norfolk resident.
“NO using any prison in Nebraska to undermine our neighbors and friends. And absolutely…NO CORNHUSKER CLINK!!! That degrades every one of us!” — Tecumseh resident.
“As a McCook resident, I do not like seeing where Nebraska is headed with the new addition to WEC. This is not McCook. This is not Nebraska.” — McCook resident.

Darcy Tromanhauser, Appleseed’s immigrants and communities program director, said U.S. immigration laws have not been meaningfully updated in nearly 40 years. She said that has left families and neighbors targets while they try to navigate “outdated” immigration laws. 
“Nebraskans want positive and updated immigration laws that support strong Nebraska communities, families, workforce needs, and our future — not punishment and military deployments,” Tromanhauser said.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, the lone Democratic senator on a new Legislative Oversight Committee, described the repurposed facility as an “internment camp” reminiscent of how the country detained Japanese Americans in the 1940s during World War II, “without any due process whatsoever.”
Hunt and Cavanaugh said Bosn’s decision not to host a public hearing was “disappointing but not surprising.” Hunt said lawmakers would “press for answers through every avenue,” even if Bosn and her committee refuse.
“The Legislature has a duty of oversight, and Nebraskans have a right to know what’s being done in their name and with their money,” Hunt said in a Thursday text. “We aren’t going away, and we won’t stop asking the questions the governor and his allies would rather ignore.”

What is the Work Ethic Camp?
The Work Ethic Camp in McCook, legislatively approved in April 1997, opened in April 2001 as a method to reduce prison crowding, primarily with rehabilitative programming to low-risk offenders. As a result, the facility hoped to open up space for more violent offenders in other state facilities.
The Work Ethic Camp has most recently served adult men convicted of felonies who need substance use treatment or cognitive restructuring. It had an annual state budget of $9.5 million last year and about 85 staff. As of Aug. 19, the facility housed 186 Nebraskans in dormitory-style housing.

Vance addresses a crowd at Mid-City Steel in La Crosse on Thursday. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Vice President J.D. Vance decried what he described as the crime-ridden streets of American cities and Democrats’ alleged efforts to take health care away from U.S. citizens and give it to undocumented immigrants at an event Thursday afternoon at a steel fabrication facility in La Crosse. 
At the event, which took place on the bank of the Mississippi River at Mid-City Steel, Vance and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum touted the benefits that Republicans’ budget reconciliation law, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will deliver for working class Wisconsinites. 
The night before Vance’s visit, Democratic elected officials and candidates for state and federal office mingled with voters at state Sen. Brad Pfaff’s (D-Onalaska) annual corn roast. State Dems came to meet voters at the La Crosse County Fairgrounds in West Salem and to search for a path back to power nationally, trifecta of control of  state government and an effective counter to the authoritarian impulses of President Donald Trump.

The back-to-back events highlighted how politically important western Wisconsin is set to become over the next year as attention focuses on the competitive 3rd Congressional District, represented by Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden, and the open race for governor. 
At the fairgrounds on Wednesday, Pfaff’s staff members handed out 350 brats, 150 hot dogs and 500 ears of corn slathered with 13 pounds of butter as a polka band played and candidates for statewide office made their way down long picnic tables with cups of Spotted Cow and Miller Lite, stopping to chat with voters. In attendance were Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who is running for governor, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, who is running for lieutenant governor, and Appeals Court Judge Chris Taylor, who is running for a seat on the state Supreme Court. Also in attendance were state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Wisconsin Economic Development Coordinator Missy Hughes, both of whom have been testing the waters as possible gubernatorial candidates. 
Pfaff, who ran unsuccessfully against Van Orden for the 3rd District congressional seat in 2022, repeatedly touted the importance of Democrats listening to rural voters and speaking to issues that matter to their lives.
That message played well in front of the group of about 120 attendees who complained that Van Orden does not often face disgruntled constituents. Democrats have frequently highlighted the fact that Van Orden has not held any in-person town halls or debated his Democratic election opponents.

“It’s extremely frustrating. The thing is that we as Democrats, we’ve got a brand that we’ve got to rebuild,” Pfaff said. “And I’m a Democrat. I’m a proud rural Democrat. I was raised with the values of hard work, dedication and resilience. I was raised in the fact that, you know, you need to get up every morning and go to work, and you need to be able to provide for your family and put away for the future. But you need to be able to be part of a community and build a community that is inclusive and welcoming.” 
Pfaff added that Van Orden has not been accessible to his voters or answered for his votes on legislation such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
“You need to be accessible to your constituents, and when you’re not accessible to your constituents, you’re not serving yourself, and definitely you’re not in touch with the people of the district,” he said. “So it’s very concerning. But …  we will have a very competitive congressional race in 2026 and Derek’s gonna have to explain his votes and his actions.” 
Rebecca Cooke, who lost to Van Orden in last year’s election and is running again to unseat him next year, said she’s trying to spend this time, about 14 months before the midterm elections, traveling the district and understanding voters’ concerns. 
“My campaign has always been really focused around working families and working class people, which I think Senator Pfaff too, we have a very similar thought and understanding, because we talk to people, right?” Cooke said. “Brad hosts open events like this so that he can hear from people directly. And I think that that’s the difference with Van Orden, who brings in J.D. Vance, the big guns, because he can’t deliver the message himself. I think we are of and from western Wisconsin, and so we know how to communicate with people in our community, and we listen to them.”

On Thursday, both Burgum and Vance celebrated Van Orden’s vote on the budget reconciliation bill, inspiring Van Orden  to stand from his front row seat and pump his fist. Prior to his vote on the legislation, Van Orden said he wouldn’t support a bill that cut funds from food assistance programs, but ultimately he cast a deciding vote for the legislation that, analysis shows, will boot 90,000 Wisconsinites off food assistance programs and cause 30,000 rural Wisconsinites to lose their health care. 
Burgum also said the Trump administration is working to bring steel manufacturing and shipbuilding back to America. But on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin raised the alarm for shipbuilders in Marinette after Trump announced the purchase of ships built in South Korea. 
“I am deeply concerned by recent reports that indicate the Trump Administration is looking to have U.S. ships made overseas in South Korea,” Baldwin said in a statement. “We need to see the details of this agreement because at the end of the day, America cannot compromise here – we are already losing to China and we have no time to waste. We must be firm on our commitment to supporting our maritime workforce, keeping our country safe, and revitalizing America’s shipbuilding capacity. I have long fought to strengthen our shipbuilding industry, and it can’t be done with shortcuts or quick fixes. The President must prioritize American workers by investing in our shipbuilding industry here at home and buying American-made ships.”

Despite the massive cuts the reconciliation law is making to federal assistance programs, Vance said that the Democratic Party is lying about its effects, claiming Democrats voted against the bill because they wanted to raise taxes and give health care to people who are in the country without legal authorization. 
Vance touted the extension of tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017 during the first Trump administration, saying they will put money back into the pockets of American workers like the ones at Mid-City Steel. He also celebrated Trump’s tariffs calling them a lever to protect American industry. 
“What the working families tax cuts did is very simple, ladies and gentlemen, it let you keep more money in your pocket, it rewarded you for building a business, for working at a business right here in the United States of America, it makes it easy for you to take home more of your hard earned pay and it makes it easier if you’re an American manufacturer, an American business, it makes it easier for you to build your facility or expand your facility,” Vance said. 
But the cost of the tariffs is being borne by American consumers in the form of higher prices, and the tax cuts have largely gone to benefit the wealthiest Americans. 
An analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that 69% of the benefits of the tax cuts will go to the richest 15% of Wisconsinites.

The vice president also painted American cities as crime-infested slums where everyday Americans cannot walk down the street without being accosted by a person “screaming on a street corner.” The Trump administration has deployed the National Guard and Marines in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles in a show  of force, and Trump has threatened to send soldiers to fight crime in other Democratic cities — even though the highest crime rates in the country are in Republican-controlled states. 
On Thursday Vance said that even though Milwaukee has what he said is a crime problem, the president doesn’t want to send troops in to address it unless he’s asked to by local officials. 
“Very simply, we want governors and mayors to ask for the help. The president of the United States is not going out there forcing this on anybody, though we do think we have the legal right to clean up America’s streets if we want to,” Vance said. “What the president of the United States has said is, “Why don’t you invite us in?’”
William Garcia, the chair of the 3rd Congressional District Democratic Party, said that Vance’s visit showed that Republicans are out of touch with western Wisconsin, noting that a speech at a steel fabricator isn’t representative of what actually drives the local economy and delivering that speech to a hand-selected crowd glosses over the pain the Trump administration’s policies are bringing to local communities.

“If you really wanted to talk to people out here, you would talk about agriculture, and you would try and justify why Canadian fertilizer has a massive tariff on it now, so we have to spend so much more money to just grow our own food,” Garcia said. “Then you have to talk about your immigration policies that are preventing our harvest from being picked after they’ve grown. And so that’s why he’s having to narrow the people he’s talking to, to this super small crowd, because by and large, conservative, liberal, whatever, are being hurt by these policies, and he doesn’t want to hear any pushback about that.”

Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, and Democratic governors across the country issued a statement Thursday criticizing Trump’s policy decisions, saying Americans deserve to feel safe.
“But instead of actually addressing crime, President Trump cut federal funding for law enforcement that states rely on and continues to politicize our military by trying to undermine the executive authority of Governors as Commanders in Chief of their state’s National Guard,” the 19 governors wrote in a joint statement.
The president deployed Washington D.C.’s National Guard earlier this month, which is within his authority, and he has expressed interest in deploying state National Guards to Chicago, New York City, Baltimore and Oakland. Earlier this year, he mobilized California’s National Guard to confront demonstrators in Los Angeles who were protesting the administration’s immigration raids.
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has been vocal in his opposition to Trump’s threats.  
“Unlike Donald Trump, we keep our promises,” Pritzker wrote in a Wednesday social media post. “We will not stand idly by if he decides to send the National Guard to intimidate Chicagoans. Action will be met with a response.”
All but four Democratic governors signed on to the statement. Those who did called Trump’s actions “chaotic federal interference.”
“Whether it’s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow,” the governors said, “the President’s threats and efforts to deploy a state’s National Guard without the request and consent of that state’s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5020092-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-28 19:57:43.456195

Mike Dunleavy has named former Texas U.S. Attorney Stephen Cox to replace departing Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor, he announced in a prepared statement Thursday.
Cox’s appointment is subject to a confirmation vote by the Alaska Legislature next spring. 
Dunleavy is term-limited, and new governors typically appoint a new attorney general, meaning that Cox is likely to serve for a little over one year.
Taylor, who announced last week that he would resign on Aug. 29, is expected to run for governor in 2026, joining an already-crowded field of candidates. 
Cox will begin serving as attorney general-designee upon Taylor’s resignation, the governor’s office said.
A spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Law said Cox was not immediately available for an interview about his plans for the department. 
“Stephen Cox brings a wealth of experience to the Attorney General’s office, and I am confident in his ability to serve Alaskans well,” Dunleavy said in a prepared statement. “From his service in the U.S. Department of Justice to his leadership on complex work here in Alaska, Stephen has demonstrated a wide breadth of experience and steadfast dedication to the rule of law.”
Cox, a graduate of the University of Houston law school, worked five years for Apache, the Houston-based oil company active in Alaska at that time. 
According to the governor’s office, he specialized in Apache’s Cook Inlet operations.
Cox joined the Department of Justice in March 2017, during the first Trump administration and after working on Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s unsuccessful campaign for president in 2016. 
When Cox was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas by Trump in 2020, Cruz said he and Cox had been close friends for two decades.
Cox has served as the president of the Houston, Texas chapter of the Federalist Society since 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile, a national conservative and libertarian legal organization.
Cox resigned as U.S. Attorney after President Joe Biden took office and took a job with Bristol Bay Industrial LLC, a holding company and investment subsidiary of the Bristol Bay Native Corporation, until being picked by the governor to become attorney general.
“I am honored that Governor Dunleavy has invited me to be a part of the Alaska story,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “And I am grateful to the Governor and the people of Alaska for the opportunity to serve. Since 2011, I have been privileged to work on Alaska’s development, and my family and I were blessed with the opportunity to move to Anchorage and make Alaska our home. My wife and I are grateful to be able to foster for our three children the best future Alaska can offer. The Anchorage community, and the entire state have become an inseparable part of our lives. I commit to work tirelessly to uphold the rule of law, protect the rights of all Alaskans, and ensure that our state’s laws are enforced with integrity.”
In 2023, Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan named Cox to a panel of experts that Sullivan intended to use to examine candidates for Alaska’s vacant U.S. District Court seats.
To date, that panel’s activities have not been publicized and the panel has not published a list of recommendations. Two of Alaska’s three federal judgeships remain vacant. 
In private life, he and his wife have been active in the formation of Thomas More Classical School, a private Christian conservative K-6 alternative school, according to posts on LinkedIn. The school is scheduled to open in 2026 in Anchorage.
Cox lives in Anchorage with his wife, Cristina, and their three children.

The bus transportation company Travel Kuz sent a cease-and-desist letter Wednesday to the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 alleging the union engaged in “unlawful” picketing practices and put student safety at risk.
The Teamsters Local 597 president denied the allegations, and local law enforcement said they did not witness criminal activity during Wednesday’s demonstration at Brattleboro Union High School. 
The labor dispute began when the company, affiliated with Beacon Mobility, locked out its Vermont union bus drivers and monitors from the Brattleboro headquarters last week after contract negotiations broke down. 
Travel Kuz provides student transportation for Windham Southeast Supervisory Union schools in Brattleboro, Dummerston, Guilford, Putney and Vernon. The union bus drivers and monitors with Teamsters Local 597 typically handle school routes for the 10 schools in the supervisory union, but they have not been allowed to work with their employer Travel Kuz due to the lockout.

Since the work stoppage by Travel Kuz, the union drivers and monitors have been on the picket line. The company brought in replacement workers to serve Windham Southeast Supervisory Union schools for the start of the school year. 
Travel Kuz claimed that union members picketing Wednesday at Brattleboro Union High School spat on school buses, blocked school bus access, caused traffic disruptions and hazardous conditions and displayed “obscene and aggressive behavior toward students and drivers,” according to a Travel Kuz press release. 
Curtis Clough, president of Teamsters Local 597, denied the allegations of union members spitting, risking public safety or otherwise causing harm to students or drivers. He said the union members did cross the street a few times during the picketing but that is a legally protected activity. 
He said the union is looking into taking legal action against the company and the company’s counsel due to allegations in the letter. He said it is the company’s actions — tapping replacement workers and preventing local bus drivers and monitors who are more familiar with the community and school routes from working — that are detrimental to students, not the union demonstrations. 
“We didn’t put any students in danger yesterday,” Clough said. “They were the ones that put students in danger by locking out the bus drivers.”  
The Travel Kuz company is seeking injunctive relief against the union and claimed to be working with local authorities and legal counsel to “ensure compliance with labor laws and public safety standards,” according to the press release. 
Clough said Brattleboro police were present during picketing and did not issue any citations or tell the union to cease demonstrating.

Brattleboro Police Capt. Adam Petlock confirmed that officers were present at Brattleboro High School during the picketing because it is customary to have law enforcement stationed at schools during the first week of school. 
Petlock said the role of law enforcement is to respect the right of people to protest and engage in protected First Amendment activities while ensuring the safety of children and the public. 
Officers who were present during picketing demonstrations witnessed “no criminal violations” by union members, Petlock said, and Travel Kuz has not contacted Brattleboro law enforcement to his knowledge.
Brattleboro resident Ian Turner, a parent of two students in the supervisory union, said that the lockout has caused inconvenience and safety concerns for his family as they are forgoing bus transportation for their children during the lockout.
One of Turner’s children enrolled in the 10th grade is nonverbal and needs preparation to use the bus, and was comfortable with the union driver and monitors during the previous year, he said. Turner said he has reached out to Travel Kuz and the company has yet to communicate a transportation plan, and the lockout by the company is disruptive to his child’s education. 
Turner said he talked with the union members picketing outside of Brattleboro Union High School yesterday and did not witness any aggressive behavior. On the contrary, Turner said he has generally seen union picketing garnering positive reactions from parents and he considers the union bus drivers and monitors to be trusted members of the community.

Lena Melentijevic, a spokesperson for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, wrote in a statement many of the drivers are part of the community and have students in the supervisory union. 
“Travel Kuz is failing in its desperate attempts to distract the public from the truth — this company locked out its own workers, preventing them from returning to work since last week,” Melentijevic wrote in a statement. “This lockout could end today if the company chose to end it.”
Clough said the contract negotiations are still active despite the labor dispute, and the Teamsters Local 597 will work to agree on a fair contract.
“We’re gonna be out there on the picket lines until the company gives us a fair contract,” Clough said. “They’ve locked us out. They say they’re not gonna let us back in until we agree to a contract, so it’s gonna have to be a fair one.”
The Windham Southeast Supervisory Union superintendent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico prosecutors allege that an “imposter nurse” nearly caused the death of a hospice patient earlier this summer after working for three health care providers in Albuquerque for a year-and-a-half using a stolen identity.
A Bernalillo County grand jury on Aug. 22 indicted 26-year-old April Guadalupe Hernandez, of Los Lunas, with 19 criminal counts including falsifying documents, nursing without a license, fraud, identity theft and abuse.
The indictment alleges that Hernandez stole the identity of three people with similar names in order to deceive three different Albuquerque-based hospice centers, and went on to receive up to $40,000 in fraudulent wages.
The New Mexico Department of Justice said in a news release on Thursday that Hernandez, a certified nurse assistant, stole the identities of two registered nurses from Texas and California and a licensed practical nurse in Kansas in order to work as a nurse in New Mexico.
The indictment charges Hernandez with abuse of a care facility resident on June 7. The news release states that she allegedly mis-transcribed a medication order for a patient that nearly led to the administration of a fatal dose of morphine.
“To exploit trusting patients in their most vulnerable moments is unconscionable,” Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “These charges send a clear message: the New Mexico Department of Justice will not tolerate those who endanger the safety of patients or betray the trust of our health care system. Anyone posing as a health care provider in New Mexico will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law as we continue to fight to protect those who are in their most vulnerable state.”
If convicted on all counts, the defendant could face up to 27-and-a-half years in prison, the news release states. 
Hernandez is set to appear before Second Judicial District Court Judge Britt Baca on Sept. 8, according to court records.

Jared Polis presents his spending cut plan to the Joint Budget Committee on Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis announced Thursday a total of about $250 million in cuts and redirected funds to help close a state budget gap his office estimated to be $783 million.
Colorado special session 2025: Updates from the Capitol

The spending reductions, which Polis made through an executive order and outlined during a presentation to the Colorado Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee, primarily hit health care, higher education and state grant programs. The JBC, which comprises lawmakers from both parties and both legislative chambers, writes the state budget.
The state budget gap follows the passage of the federal tax cut and spending law, which President Donald Trump signed in July. Tax code changes in that law hit Colorado’s projected revenue by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, mostly through a loss of corporate income taxes. The current fiscal year started July 1.
Polis’ plan includes about $103 million of spending cuts and the transfer of about $147 million from various state cash accounts to the state’s general fund. He noted that no cuts were made to public safety funding or K-12 schools.
“This is a time when we need to focus on the difference between things that are nice to have and things that we need to have,” Polis said. “We’re focused on finding the things we need to have, and we all know that in this time, there’s some of the things that are nice to have that we can afford, but we can’t afford all of them.”

Polis’ announcement comes two days after the end of a special session of the Colorado Legislature, during which lawmakers passed bills that in total will bring in about $250 million to the general fund this fiscal year.
The governor’s office has the authority to make midyear spending cuts during revenue shortfalls. A new law passed during the special session and signed by Polis requires that the governor present such cuts to the JBC.
The largest cut is a reversal of the state’s plan to increase reimbursement rates by 1.6% for health care providers who see patients on Medicaid. By axing the rate hike, the state will save an estimated $38 million.
The governor’s higher education cuts total $12 million and affect several community colleges and universities across the state. Several state grants are also being reduced, including for programs that address public health disparities and provide dental care to low-income Coloradans.
About $100 million is being redirected to the general fund from an affordable housing fund that was approved by voters in 2022. That’s the biggest of Polis’ funding transfers.










This is a time when we need to focus on the difference between things that are nice to have and things that we need to have.


– Colorado Gov. Jared Polis


The governor’s office estimates that a hiring freeze, which Polis put in place on Aug. 26 through the end of the year, will save the state $3 million.
To plug the remaining hole in the budget, Polis said he plans to tap the state’s reserves by $325 million. That will deplete the reserve to about 13% of the general fund from a previous 15%.
During the six-day special session, lawmakers passed a series of bills to eliminate certain tax exemptions for businesses and increase revenue by selling credits for advanced payments of future tax liabilities. Polis on Thursday morning signed those revenue-raising bills into law.
Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican who sits on the JBC, said Democratic lawmakers and the governor’s office should have focused on cutting government staffing, as opposed to raising revenue.
“How come, in the special session, we weren’t allowed to make cuts?” Kirkmeyer said.
However, Polis said the bills passed by the Legislature were sufficient in allowing his office to “avoid much deeper cuts.”

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Recent federal cuts to food programs, including those that help feed Indigenous people, mean more tribal members across New Mexico will rely on a more limited food program often called “commodities,” the chairman of the All Pueblo Council of Governors said Thursday.
The United States Department of Agriculture recently eliminated its Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement program. The department as of Aug. 26 allocated more than $5.7 million to  the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo. It provided funding to tribal schools to purchase food produced within local and regional areas to benefit student nutrition and local farmers. 
In addition to nixing that program, the “big beautiful bill” that Congress recently enacted makes cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or “food stamps.” New Mexico has the highest percentage of SNAP recipients in the country, and its high error rate could mean it will have to find a way to fund some of the program itself.
One program that is not “on the chopping block as of yet” is USDA’s  Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, which serves low-income households, said James Mountain, the pueblo council chairman, to an interim New Mexico legislative committee Thursday. 
NM food banks say they will struggle to provide meals for those who lose federal benefits

But the program has its drawbacks, he said. It’s been around since the 1970s and picked up a colloquial name, “commodities,” based on the quality and nutritional value of the food. “Commodity cheese” is a huge block of cheddar that Mountain remembers fondly. 
“It serves our most vulnerable people in our homes, in our communities,” he said. “I was raised on that in my grandma’s house. For many of our grandmas and grandpas and our aunties and uncles, it’s their only source of food for a month.”
But while the program has expanded its offerings over the years, it’s still less nutritious and traditional than programs that allow members to choose what food they want, Mountain said. And funding for it has stayed flat, despite the other programs being cut, he said. 
“We will see an influx of those participants migrating back into the Food Distribution Program. And our question to USDA, to President Trump and the administration and to lawmakers, is, how are we going to fund this?” he said. “We’d love to have those participants there, but it’s a flat budget.”
That question is one of many Mountain said he has after the passing of the tax and spend bill and Trump’s latest budget request. Another source of uncertainty is whether the Farm Bill will adequately fund those programs or redesign them, given that Republican lawmakers have announced they are seeking a “skinny,” or pared-down version of the once-a-decade legislation. 
“Now it’s reduced to what they’re calling a ‘skinny’ Farm Bill. Please don’t ask me what that means, because we don’t know yet, but we’re trying to figure that out,” he said. “Again — it goes back to the unknown.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/James-Mountain-2048x1367-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-28 18:56:58.297445

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
Trump administration says CDC chief ousted, but her lawyer says she hasn’t resigned or been fired

One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”

 Nonmedical vaccine exemptions vary from state to state

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.

Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

The Advocate previously reported that the two test wells drilled by the Department of Corrections to test if the groundwater in the area could support the prison yielded two gallons per minute and ten gallons per hour, based on a state database of well construction reports.
However, versions of those reports included with the testing summary, which is dated Aug. 19 but wasn’t received by the department’s spokesperson until earlier this week, indicated one of the test wells yielded ten gallons per minute, rather than per hour.
Rand Champion, the corrections department’s spokesperson, attributed the discrepancy to likely human error when the well construction reports were put into the database. He said to his knowledge, all of the flowrates were meant to be “per minute.” The correct amount for one well is ten gallons per minute.
In the prior reporting, the Advocate asked the department multiple times for clarity on whether the yields reported in the online database were accurate. Champion said at the time that all numbers were preliminary, but did not answer questions about whether there was any reason to believe the database entries were inaccurate.
A third well included in the testing report existed on the property prior to the state’s purchase of it in 2024. That well yielded approximately 15-16 gallons of water per minute, according to the summary. The department’s contractors tested the well to determine the recharge of the aquifer it draws water from. According to the summary, the recharge rate was approximately 12.5 gallons per minute.
Still, the flow is well below what would be necessary for the prison.
Additionally, while running that test, the contractors noted that “when the pump initially began pumping, the produced raw water exhibited a strong sulfur odor and reddish-brown to reddish-orange color.” After five minutes, the water cleared and the smell “dissipated significantly.”
A water sample was sent by the contractors for testing. The results, according to the summary, show that the water is slightly acidic, with a pH of 5.5. Lemon juice has a pH that ranges from 2-3.
EPA’s non-enforceable guidelines for drinking water say pH should be between 6.5 and 8.5.
Testing done by the Arkansas Department of Health found that total coliform bacteria was present in the water sample it was sent, but not e. Coli.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Despite the Oklahoma Department of Human Services spending hundreds of millions on child care using pandemic funds, not all of the investments had a lasting impact, a state official said. 
State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd on Wednesday said the state Department of Human Services did not provide the oversight needed to ensure federal grants had the greatest impact across the state. Her remarks followed the release of a 330 page audit of how state agencies used federal dollars during the 2023 budget year.
Beginning in March 2020, Oklahoma Human Services received $791 million through the federal Child Care Development Grant, which was intended to cover normal operating expenses and prevent the permanent closure of day cares during pandemic lockdowns, Byrd said. The Department of Human Services was also allowed to use the funds to create programs tailored to the needs of the state, she said. 
This included programs like Oklahoma’s Child Care Desert Startup Grant program, which was intended to provide funding for new child care businesses located in areas that don’t have enough providers to meet demand. In 2022, over half of Oklahomans lived in a child care desert. 
“There’s no better example of DHS financial mismanagement of child care development than the Child Care Desert Grant Program, an initiative meant to expand access to child care in counties that could not meet the demand,” Byrd said. “In theory, the program would provide crucial start-up money for new day cares, or expanding day cares to cover things like minor construction projects.”
The current director of Oklahoma Human Services, Jeffrey Cartmell, in October requested an audit of the program, which expended over $43.7 million to providers. At the time, he cited concerns of “disallowable expenses.” 
“At Oklahoma Human Services, our commitment to serving communities is rooted in continuous growth and improvement,” Cartmell said in a statement Thursday. “We value the financial analysis and review provided by our state partners on these COVID-era child care programs. Their feedback informs strategic planning and drives program improvements, allowing us to provide top-tier services to Oklahomans.”
Of the 73 grant recipients who were sampled in the audit, 20 were no longer operating by March 2025. These recipients were awarded a total of $2 million in federal funds to start businesses that have now shut their doors. 
Byrd said some “bad actors” used federal grant money for “unallowable” expenditures like major remodeling projects. Others failed to provide documentation of their expenditures or misappropriated the funding for large purchases unrelated to child care, operating other businesses or “excessive” payroll costs.
Another applicant who received $2.1 million in federal funding used the money to run an afterschool program, she said. The applicant is married to a former Oklahoma Human Services director of child care services, but both are unnamed in the audit because of an ongoing investigation, Byrd said. 
Byrd said in an interview with the applicant, her office was told the after school programs will not continue once desert grant funds run out. Byrd was unsure if the business had closed as of Thursday. 
“The federal government sent this money to the states and gave great leeway to the states in terms of how they deployed it,” Byrd said. “DHS did not put strong guidelines on how day cares were to use the funds, nor did it conduct any financial monitoring of child care development. As a result, bad actors were able to game the system at taxpayers’ expense.”

(Edwin J. Torres/Governor’s Office)The former state attorney general who crafted New Jersey’s sanctuary policy for immigrants is asking a judge to throw out the Trump administration’s lawsuit challenging four cities’ local sanctuary policies. 
Gurbir Grewal, who is representing Newark and Hoboken in the legal fight, said in a Thursday letter to U.S. District Court Judge Evelyn Padin that the Trump administration’s claims “fail many times over.” Grewal’s letter argues that the administration has no standing to sue the cities because they are obliged to follow the state’s 2018 policy anyway. Even if it had standing to sue, the letter adds, the lawsuit would fail on its merits.
“Plaintiffs’ contention that federal law somehow requires state and local authorities to help the federal government in carrying out federal immigration policy is at odds with the anti-commandeering principle embodied in the Tenth Amendment,” the letter reads. “As the Supreme Court has explained, the federal government may not compel States and localities to help ‘administer a federal regulatory program.’”
Grewal is asking Padin, a Biden appointee, to dismiss the lawsuit quickly.
“It is critical to defendants to dispose of this challenge expeditiously to maintain public safety and to protect the delicate trust defendants have built with their communities,” Grewal wrote. “That trust is essential.”
Thursday was a deadline for the cities to respond to the Trump lawsuit.
The Trump administration sued Newark, Hoboken, Jersey City, and Paterson in May over local ordinances and orders that limit when police can assist federal immigration authorities (the cities’ elected leaders are also named as defendants). The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause by interfering with federal law amid Trump’s efforts to roll back sanctuary policies nationwide. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold federal funds and grants from jurisdictions that don’t cooperate.
The local policies are similar to the statewide directive, which restricts when local, county, and state police can assist in federal immigration enforcement, bars cops from sharing certain information with immigration officials, and prevents local law enforcement from asking people about their immigration status unless it’s relevant to a criminal investigation. Police officers are also prohibited from stopping, questioning, or detaining someone based on their suspected immigration status.
The sanctuary policies in Jersey City and Newark passed in 2017, Hoboken’s followed in 2018, and Paterson’s came in 2019. The Justice Department included the four cities on a recent list of sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote to them earlier this month demanding they end their sanctuary policies. Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, a Democrat seeking election to the state Assembly in November, told Bondi his city won’t “bend its knee” to Trump. 
This isn’t the first time that Trump has gone to court over New Jersey immigration policies. In 2020, his first administration sued New Jersey over the state directive, alleging it conflicts with federal statutes. That case was dismissed after the judge said the administration lacked a valid legal claim because the directive regulates state and local officials, not federal officials. When Ocean County and others sued over the directive in a separate case, they also lost for a similar reason in a ruling subsequently upheld by the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, which Grewal’s letter notes.
“That decision is binding and requires rejection of Plaintiffs’ preemption claims,” he wrote.
A federal judge in Illinois last month dismissed a Trump administration lawsuit targeting sanctuary policies in that state, with the judge saying the Tenth Amendment protects those policies.

(Stock photo by Twenty47studio/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The U.S. Supreme Court last week allowed the Trump administration to proceed with cancelling hundreds of millions of dollars in National Institutes of Health grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion — including at least $8 million in South Carolina.
At South Carolina’s three research universities, that means lost funding for studies on topics such as stroke recovery, the use of artificial intelligence in trapping mosquitoes and preventing illness, and developmental delays caused by exposure to chemicals used to put out fires.
Those studies continue. But supplements for employing graduate students from certain minority populations, in particular Hispanic and Black students, have ended.
U.S. Supreme Court gives go-ahead for Trump to cancel $783M in NIH research grants

In an effort to increase diversity in the ranks of biomedical researchers, NIH offered additional grant funding that allowed colleges to expand their research teams with more doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows than they could otherwise support.
University of South Carolina professor Prakash Nagarkatti explained to the SC Daily Gazette how that could have impacted his team researching ulcerative colitis, an autoimmune disease that causes a range of painful and potentially life-threatening symptoms.
Nagarkatti, a microbiologist and immunologist, has spent more than 40 years studying inflammation in the body — starting with the effects of Agent Orange. More recently, his team found that a compound contained in certain vegetables, such as broccoli and cabbage, could help manage colitis.
That seven-member team — three graduate students, four post-graduate fellows and three professors — includes a Hispanic student whose tuition, supplies and research-related travel expenses were fully covered by a five-year, $2.1 million grant.
But the Trump administration has ended the minority grant program, which has been around for more than three decades, as part of its efforts to root out diversity-related spending in government programs.
That could have forced Nagarkatti’s student off the team — and potentially to leave USC altogether. But Nagarkatti, a research advisor to USC’s president, ensured the student could stay on tuition-free.
“Fortunately for me, I have other resources that I can use to support the student,” said Nagarkatti, who holds the title of “Carolina distinguished professor.” “But if I was, for example, a junior faculty member and I only had one grant and I didn’t have any of the support, then basically this student would be cut off.”
Student impacts
In other situations, the loss of NIH supplements might require minority students to stay in school longer or delay finishing their dissertation because they have to take work outside of school to pay for food, gas, housing and other costs of living, according to Nagarkatti.
Or a student could have to borrow money, which for graduate students presents a second challenge, as the Trump administration’s “big beautiful” spending package placed new borrowing limits on graduate students who take out federal student loans.
In the case of the Hispanic student, Nagarkatti said, he had put in the work and applied for the grant on his own.
Nagarkatti said USC does this as a way to mentor students on how to write a grant proposal, a crucial skill for those working in academia.
The student still had about 15% of the $2.1 million — $320,000 — left to spend when the president ordered the funding frozen, according to data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
It’s unclear exactly how much was frozen at colleges statewide. Treasury data, combined with a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants, puts estimates around $8 million.
The Medical University of South Carolina did not respond before deadline to questions from the SC Daily Gazette about its grant losses. Beyond a dollar amount — $16,400 — Clemson University also did not provide details about the funding it lost.
In addition to the research universities, online databases tracking these grants show losses at three of the state’s historically Black colleges.
Claflin University, a private school in Orangeburg, lost about $700,000. South Carolina State University, a public school that neighbors Claflin, and Benedict College in Columbia were partners on several defunded projects, according to grant applications published by NIH. It’s unclear how much they specifically lost out on.
Training programs end
In addition to the loss of money for research studies, NIH also cut funding to programs for mentoring minority students.
USC had to discontinue Postbaccalaureate Research Education Programs (PREP) after losing $4.8 million in federal funding.
Nagarkatti said minority students whose test scores may not have been high enough for admission into graduate-level programs at the university could participate in the PREP program for a year, receiving one-on-one training and mentorship from research professors to help them improve.
“We recruited some of those students, and they have done so well,” Nagarkatti said.
Some went on to careers at NIH and Harvard University.
“They really excel, but they needed that one year of extensive training,” Nagarkatti said. “And because now that program has been taken away, the students now don’t have that opportunity.”
MUSC also had similar programs that may have been cut.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/lab-student-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-28 18:56:58.297445

Two Coloradans who forged documents to fraudulently enroll more than 40 real and fictitious children in Arizona’s school voucher program have both pleaded guilty to felony charges.
As part of a plea agreement, Johnny Bowers pleaded guilty on Aug. 26 in Maricopa County Superior Court to fraudulent schemes and artifices and forgery, both felonies.
Ashley Hopkins also pleaded guilty to fraudulent schemes and artifices on Aug. 5.
Bowers and Hopkins were indicted by a grand jury in November 2024 on 60 felony counts, including conspiracy and forgery, for defrauding Arizona’s Empowerment Scholarship Account program.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Between December 2022 and May 2024, the two submitted forged documents, including birth certificates and utility bills, to the ESA voucher program to fraudulently enroll more than 40 real and fictitious children. In total they received more than $110,000 in illegal school voucher payments, which they used to pay for their living expenses in Colorado.
“Fraud in the ESA program will not be tolerated,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a press statement about the guilty pleas. “Those who exploit government systems for personal gain will be held accountable. My office will continue to aggressively prosecute fraud and protect taxpayer dollars.”
Both Bowers and Hopkins are set to be sentenced on Oct. 24.
The ESA program works by giving the parents of participating students a debit card that can be used to pay for various educational costs, or reimbursing the parents for those costs. The costs can include private or parochial school tuition, homeschooling supplies — and even savings for college tuition.
The program was created in 2012 to serve around 11,000 students with disabilities, but was incrementally expanded to include more kids until 2022 when then-Gov. Doug Ducey and the Republican-led Arizona Legislature made it universal, allowing all of the state’s roughly 1 million K-12 students to enroll. This school year, the program is expected to have about 90,000 enrollees, at a cost of around $1 billion.
Public school advocates have been fighting to end or reform the program for years, but it came under increased scrutiny after the Department of Education last November began automatically reimbursing parents for all purchases under $2,000. That practice was implemented due to a huge backlog of reimbursement requests, as student enrollment in the program skyrocketed without a corresponding increase in staffing.
In a recent investigation into those automatically approved purchases, 12 News found that parents used tax dollars to purchase diamond rings, smart TVs, iPhones, household appliances and even lingerie.
In response to that investigation, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne promised that the Arizona Department of Education would claw back the money doled out for those “unallowable” purchases.
In a Wednesday statement, Horne, who is a Republican, attempted to take credit for the prosecution of Bowers and Hopkins.
“(T)he only way today’s conviction of two people on charges of fraud using Empowerment Scholarship Account (ESA) dollars could happen was because the Department of Education discovered the activity in 2024 and referred it for prosecution,” Horne wrote in the statement.
In the statement, Horne misspelled Mayes’ first name and said she had falsely accused him of permitting the extravagant purchases of jewelry and lingerie.
“To date we have collected or referred for collection more than $622,000 in improper purchases” for under $2,000 that were paid automatically, Horne wrote.
He added that the process of risk-based auditing, or automatically approving purchases and then auditing for fraud and misspending after the fact “is a common practice in many federal and state agencies and is dictated by state law.”
However, the Department of Education ignored part of the risk-based audit law — which required it to work with the Arizona Auditor General to create auditing processes — for nearly a year. The law went into effect last September, but ESA officials repeatedly pushed back meetings with the auditor general and only conferred with that office in July, after state legislators insisted on it.
“Without this (risk based audit) program, reimbursements for expenditures would take over two months, putting a terrible burden on parents who have paid money and are entitled to reimbursements,” Horne wrote.
Horne also blamed Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs for inadequate staffing to deal with the expanded universal voucher program, because she refused in June to endorse a state budget that included funding for 12 additional purchase reviewers.
A spokesman for Hobbs, Christian Slater, previously told the Mirror that the request for additional ESA employees was discussed during budget negotiations between Senate Republicans and Hobbs, but was left out because “Republicans wouldn’t agree to any accountability measures to go along with the increased staff.”
One of those proposed measures included automatic review of all purchases under $2,000, Slater said.

Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, answers questions during a Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce event on Aug. 28, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Native American radio stations will receive stopgap funding promised to them in a handshake deal with the Trump administration, U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds said Thursday in response to concerns expressed earlier this week by tribal leaders. 
The South Dakota Republican answered questions about the issue Thursday during and after a public appearance with the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce.
Tribal radio stations across the country said they haven’t heard from the Trump administration about the amounts or timing of grants needed to operate their stations over the next year, causing worry among managers and forcing them to seek other funding options.
Rounds voted for the cancellation of $1.1 billion in previously approved funds for public broadcasting in July, but only after he secured a handshake deal with the Trump administration to provide $9.4 million for tribal broadcasting. The informal deal wasn’t written into the bill that Congress passed and President Trump signed.

“My goal was to try to find a resource so that these folks, who definitely would shut down if we didn’t do it, at least have a fighting chance,” Rounds said.
“The writing was clearly on the wall” that the broader funding would be rescinded, Rounds said, but the loss would be more detrimental to tribal stations because more than 90% of their funding came from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is shutting down after losing congressional funding.
Tribal station programming focuses on language and cultural programs in addition to music and news segments. The stations also provide emergency alerts.
Rounds told South Dakota Searchlight after the chamber’s Inside Washington event that the grant program should be up and running by October. The program will be administered through the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Office of Indigenous Connectivity and Technology, according to Rounds’ staff. 
Rounds added that the grant amounts should be a replacement of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding and equal to what stations received previously. According to an Interior Department spokesperson, the department will distribute the $9.4 million among 37 stations.
“We know how important these stations are for public safety and are moving quickly to get the money out,” a department statement read. “Before we can set a timeline, we need to coordinate with the stations, tribes and other partners to ensure the funds are delivered efficiently and meet the needs of Indian Country. We will share updates when we have more to share publicly.”
Four tribal stations in South Dakota received a collective $820,760 in federally funded radio community service grants in fiscal year 2024:

$207,744 for KDKO in Lake Andes, serving the Yankton Sioux Reservation.
$214,991 for KLND in McLaughlin, serving the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River reservations.
$198,408 for KILI in Porcupine, serving the Pine Ridge Reservation.
$199,617 for KOYA in Rosebud, serving the Rosebud Reservation.

The temporary funding will allow his office and other lawmakers to seek a permanent funding source for tribal broadcasting, Rounds said.

(Photo by Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current)Six weeks ago, it was clear that Rhode Island’s largest health system stood on rocky financial ground when it contemplated closing the Newport Hospital birthing center.
What executives at Brown University Health didn’t say at the time: Its Rhode Island hospitals and physician groups are performing quite well. Brown Health posted a $28.4 million profit for its Rhode Island business in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, up 68% over a year ago, according to financial results published Wednesday. The third quarter ended June 30.
“We feel very positive about where we’ve brought Rhode Island,” Peter Markell, chief financial officer for Brown Health, said in a call with investors Thursday afternoon. “From the quality of earnings, we feel even stronger about [fiscal year] 25 than we do 24.
But the $175 million purchase of two Massachusetts hospitals from Steward Health Care last year has dragged down the bottom line, resulting in a combined quarterly operating loss of $3.8 million. The Massachusetts side of the business — which includes St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River, Morton Hospital in Taunton, and associated physician groups — ended the quarter $32.2 million in the red, with a $53.3 million loss across the six months in which Brown has operated the Massachusetts facilities.
Markell acknowledged the company has struggled to resuscitate the Massachusetts hospitals, which were at risk of shuttering after Steward filed for bankruptcy. Yet, the company has held off on making cuts to staff or services, hoping that new hires and an image makeover will help turn around the Massachusetts segment.
“We can’t cut our way to glory,” Markell told investors during the hourlong, virtual conference call Thursday. 
In July, the health system said it was looking at ways to cut costs in Rhode Island, including, potentially, shuttering the Noreen Stoner Drexel Birthing Center at Newport Hospital. The warning sparked an outcry from residents, local and state leaders, who insisted the award-winning labor and delivery unit was not only an institutional landmark, but a necessity for the Aquidneck Island community.
Health system executives subsequently agreed to keep the birthing center open, committing to its funding through the upcoming fiscal year 2026 which starts Oct. 1. Brown Health also committed to forming a task force to assess the birthing center’s operations. The group will be formed sometime this fall, Jessica Wharton, a company spokesperson, said in an email on Tuesday.

Cuts loom on the horizon
But CEO John Fernandez laid out a series of other cuts to Rhode Island hospitals and services, including the imminent closure of its medical equipment arm, Brown Home Health Medical, on Sept. 5. 
Markell in a follow-up call with reporters Thursday said the home health care supply segment was “very small,” and the patients served were being referred to alternative providers. Employees will be shifted to alternative parts of the company operations, Markell said.
Meanwhile, Brown Health is contemplating changes to its inpatient adult psychiatry program at Rhode Island Hospital, which continues to lose money due to a heavy reliance on contract workers and long-term stays of patients who don’t need hospital-level care but don’t have other options, Markell said. 
Yet, he denied that Rhode Island was subsidizing the losses in Massachusetts. Nor did Markell regret the decision to buy the Massachusetts hospitals, which required selling $400 million in bonds earlier this year.
“We still think it was a smart decision for the long haul,” Markell said of the purchase. “We truly believe we can do well in the market.”
Especially because Massachusetts offers higher reimbursement rates to health care providers, including hospitals, than Rhode Island. The lack of competitive payments in the Ocean State has featured prominently in discussions about how to improve Rhode Island’s fragile health care ecosystem, with better pay seen as a driving force in attracting and retaining providers, and keeping health care facilities solvent.
State lawmakers greenlighted a boost to Medicaid reimbursement rates for primary care providers as part of the fiscal 2026 budget, and added more money in hospital  payments than what Gov. Dan McKee had initially proposed. It still fell short of the $270 million that the Hospital Association of Rhode Island asked state leaders for. And with additional fallout expected from federal budget cuts, which threaten key sources of hospital funding like state directed payments and provider taxes, health care leaders remain on edge.
“We may be OK right now, but I am still worried about what [fiscal year] 27 is going to bring, 28 is going to bring, with all the stuff going on in Washington,” Markell said.

Physician group acquisition 
For the year ahead, the health system is focused on a strategy of efficient growth, including acquiring the independent physician practice, Brown Physician Inc. The nonprofit specialty practice was founded by faculty at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School, but is not part of the university, and therefore, was not included in the 2024 partnership between Brown and Lifespan Corp. Adding the 500-physican practice, which includes specialties in dermatology, urology and neurology as well as primary care and emergency medicine, will allow the health system to better serve patients through referrals and expanded services, Markell said.
“Strategically, it’s really critical we have them,” Markell said.
The cost for the “integration” does not include a purchase price, but does reflect expenses tied to adding Brown Physician Inc. providers to the company’s electronic health care system, among other costs. Markell declined to provide a cost estimate, awaiting federal regulators approval for the deal, expected in September. The new Brown Health Medical Group will include primary care and specialty providers from Brown Physician Inc., as well as those from what was formerly known as Coastal Medical and the Lifespan physician network.










We still think it was a smart decision for the long haul. We truly believe we can do well in the market.


– Peter Markell, chief financial officer for Brown University Health, in a call with reporters following the third-quarter earnings release 


Brown University Health hopes to bring in another 30 to 40 primary care providers across Rhode Island, along with new hires in Massachusetts, Markell said.
Other upcoming investments include continued infrastructure upgrades, including the launch of a major renovation project at Rhode Island Hospital. The first phase of the renovation project relies on proceeds from a $300 million bond sold in the second quarter of 2024. But the bulk of the work, planned over the course of the next decade, hinges upon future financial results.
“Right now, we feel very positive about that,” Markell said Thursday.
Fernandez wrote in the July 29 memo that the project “has been revised,” but did not specify what had changed. The health system has also committed to keeping open through fiscal 2026 its behavioral health care services through Gateway Healthcare, and the Samuel Sinclair Dental Center, which provides dental care to children and people with special needs. 
However, the staple behavioral and dental care programs will be eyed for “greater operational efficiencies,” Fernandez wrote.
Beyond the bottom line 
It’s not just finances that are a concern. Markell stressed the need to evaluate programs for safety, efficiency and high quality patient care. 
Does it make sense to devote resources to a Newport Hospital birthing center with 400 births a year? 
“We’re going to give it a good hard look,” Markell said of the birthing center’s future. “There’s no magical date on when we’re going to make a decision.” 
But the company will need to find money somewhere as it looks to raise its target operating margin in fiscal 2026, likely to 6%, Markell told investors.
A 3% operating margin has been the longstanding performance target, but remained elusive for most of the last decade. In fiscal 2025 to date, the company reported a 1% operating margin, with enough cash on hand to sustain operations across its network for 103 days.
Quarterly net income was $48.7 million, up $13.3 million from a year ago, driven by a boost in investment income. Total quarterly revenue was $1.1 billion, up from $873 million a year ago.
In Rhode Island, the increase stemmed from higher patient revenues, primarily on the outpatient side, which rose 7.3% to $781.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, thanks to a better payor and rate mix. Quarterly income from its pharmacy line spiked more than 51% year-over-year, driven by expanded eligibility under the federal 340B program, and company incentives for employees to fill prescriptions through its own pharmacy.
However, costs soared faster than revenue coming in. Quarterly expenses were up across the board in compensation and benefits, supplies, purchased services, and licensing fees for a total of $1.2 billion, compared with $861.5 million in costs in the third quarter of 2025.
Brown Health ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in net assets, adding $76 million to its balance sheet during the quarter, reflecting rising net income and gains on investments .
Across all five Rhode Island hospitals, there were 14,370 discharges in the third quarter of 2025, with an average length of stay just over six days. The two Massachusetts hospitals reported 3,807 discharges, with average stays lasting 5.7 days.

The Holland Food Shelf announced Tuesday it would close its doors the last week of September, citing the loss of federal nutrition assistance funds and high rent costs as major factors in the decision. 
“We can’t do it without funding,” said Don Stevens, executive director of the pantry’s nonprofit operator, Abenaki Helping Abenaki, and chief of the Nulhegan band of the Coosuk Abenaki Nation. “It’s not just us, right?” he added, referencing Vermont Foodbank’s recent cuts in addition to other struggles in the state’s food assistance network.
The food pantry has served residents in and around Holland, a town sitting on the Northeast Kingdom’s border with Canada, since 2021. This year, Stevens said, demand had reached a peak, with the pantry sometimes serving nearly 700 people per month. Now, as the organization winds down, residents and advocates are concerned its absence will leave a vulnerable and rural part of the state without enough support.
Stevens said he hopes the month of continued service will allow participants time to transition to other providers. His organization had started the food pantry to “help as many as we can,” he said. His team also has been purchasing food from local farmers and participating in gleaning efforts in the NEK.

The organization had lost several other federal income streams in the past, Stevens said, but the most recent decisive setback was the loss of $25,000 in SNAP-Ed, or Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program Education, grants starting next year. The money would have gone to food purchases, outreach, training and wages, but was eliminated with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4.
“(SNAP-Ed) has helped low-income Vermonters develop skills and understanding about how to access, use, and prepare nutritious food, and helped families eat healthy meals on a budget,” Kyle Casteel, a spokesperson for the Vermont Department of Health, wrote in a statement Thursday. 
“The funding loss is impacting important projects and initiatives that are carried out by valued partners across the state,” the statement continued.
The two paid employees of the pantry will be laid off, Stevens said.

“We had no choice,” he said.
Abenaki Helping Abenaki is a nonprofit with the primary mission of providing programs and services for the Nulhegan band of the Coosuk Abenaki Nation and “other native people,” Stevens said. That work will continue.
“We are still feeding our tribal community,” Stevens said, though the public food pantry will close.
The Holland Food Shelf has worked with Vermont Foodbank, which had recently been providing the organization with roughly 10,000 pounds of food per quarter, according to the food bank’s government and public affairs manager, Carrie Stahler. Before the end of pandemic-era nutrition assistance programs that lowered the cost of food for local providers, she said, the food bank had provided even more. 
The northern portions of Orleans and Essex counties are areas of the state that have proven especially challenging for Stahler’s organization to reach, she said, due to the distance involved in delivery and a relative scarcity of local organizations to partner with.
“One of the issues that we as a state struggle with regularly is service delivery to very rural communities,” she said.
Vermont Foodbank can’t work alone, Stahler said.
“Those organizations are absolutely critical,” she said of local food pantries like the one in Holland. “They are the ones who neighbors see and know.”
She anticipates that the Holland Food Shelf’s closure will force residents to drive farther for help  and put more strain on regional assistance providers.
Marci Diamond, a local resident who has volunteered at the Holland Food Shelf, echoed Stahler’s concerns. 
“It’s a very rural, very isolated community,” she said.
Diamond said many locals who frequented the organization were veterans, young families and sometimes farmers “who grow food, and still can’t afford to feed themselves and their families.”
Diamond also noted there was no grocery store in Holland. 
“Not everybody has the ability to drive,” she said.
Trevor Gray, chair of the Holland Select Board, said the town was in a tough position when it requested a higher rent from the food pantry. He said the operational costs for the building surpassed the income the tenants generated by over $30,000. 
Nonetheless, he said, the board was “extremely disappointed” that an agreement could not be made to continue the food pantry’s operation. He said he understood that Stevens’ nonprofit was under a great deal of pressure from federal cuts, but added that “it’s just unfortunate for the people that utilize that service.”
Stahler said relying on small local budgets for food assistance can be problematic. 
“There’s an overeliance on tiny community organizations to really fulfill the basic needs of their neighbors,” she said. “How do we fill that gap? … That is a really difficult question.”

Sam Creekmore of New Albany invited testimony from speakers who support the use of the chemical for treating post traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and opioid addiction.","A high-ranking lawmaker is asking Mississippi to use $5 million of opioid settlement money to explore the medical potential of ibogaine, a drug with mixed evidence of its ability to safely treat addiction. 
At a meeting Thursday of the House and Senate committees that deal with public health, Republican Rep. Sam Creekmore of New Albany invited testimony from speakers who support the use of the chemical for treating post traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and opioid addiction. Creekmore, who chairs the House Public Health and Human Services Committee, said Mississippi could prevent suicides and drug overdoses by investing in clinical trials that study the drug.
“We cannot keep using the same conventional methods for these ailments and expect different results,” he said. 
Some studies suggest ibogaine, a molecule found in a shrub native to West Africa, can help treat substance use disorder. But analyses of these research papers have pointed out that most of the evidence comes from studies with few people and no comparison group. 
A review conducted by researchers across North American universities in March found that most examinations into psychedelics, including ibogaine, and their ability to treat opioid addiction were “found to have high risk of bias” because of their study designs. It said there were possible ibogaine deaths in two of the studies. 
While many mental health conditions do not have clear treatments, the FDA has approved medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder. Addiction researchers across the country call two of them, buprenorphine and methadone, the “gold standard” for treating opioid addiction.
Ibogaine has been linked to dangerous heart problems, particularly cardiac arrhythmias. Brian Shoichet, the University of California San Francisco Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry chair and a psychedelic researcher, told Mississippi Today in an email that while making access to ibogaine easier may help a lot of people with mental illness, it could also lead to more deaths.
“There are alternatives to ibogaine, often having the same mechanism of action but without the arrhythmias, that will be safer and perhaps just as efficacious,” he said. 
It’s uncommon for any state to fund clinical trials. Studies for many treatments for mental illness are funded by private investors or branches of the National Institutes of Health. But over the past few years, some states have proposed using public dollars to fund experiments on the drug. Last spring, Texas set aside $50 million and Arizona allocated $5 million for ibogaine clinical trials.
Five speakers, including three Mississippi military veterans, shared personal stories about traveling outside the U.S. to receive ibogaine treatments for mental disorders. All praised the drug’s impact on their lives and encouraged lawmakers to fund ibogaine clinical trials.

“My migraines vanished, my chronic depression was dramatically alleviated,” Myles Grantham, a Mississippian who served in the Army, told the committee. “For the first time in years, I felt a shift.” 
Bryan Hubbard, chief executive officer of the nonprofit Americans for Ibogaine and a speaker at the hearing, has traveled to states across the country encouraging lawmakers to invest in Ibogaine research. He told Mississippi Today the drug’s dangerous side effects can be mitigated under proper medical administration, and some Mississippians with mental health disorders could join the experiments as participants if the state provides money for the trials.
Hubbard said ibogaine drug development is expected to cost $300 million to $350 million, and he hopes trials could lead to a Food and Drug Administration approval of ibogaine as a medication within six years. He criticized existing addiction medications like buprenorphine and methadone, saying the crisis has persisted even with these treatments available. 
“We are here to introduce an additional therapeutic option through a fractional amount of money that is used on what we have just for a potential breakthrough,” Hubbard said. 
Dr. Benjamin Howell, a faculty member of the Yale Program in Addiction Medicine, said in May that while buprenorphine and methadone aren’t perfect, they’ve been proven over decades to treat opioid addiction well. 
He said one of the biggest reasons tens of thousands of Americans continue to die of overdoses is because they can’t get these treatments. 
“I’m open minded that there might be future treatments that could be developed that are superior,” he said. “And yet, we also don’t have systems that are allowing everyone to get access to the medications that we know work.”
Most of the money Mississippi has received from the opioid lawsuits – cases that accused pharmaceutical companies of marketing and distributing prescription painkillers in a way that led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths – is controlled by state lawmakers. 
Unlike most states, the Legislature and Attorney General Lynn Fitch have set aside some funds to be spent on purposes other than addressing addiction and have yet to spend any of the state government’s share on curtailing the public crisis.
Creekmore told Mississippi Today he would like the Legislature to use millions of dollars from the general purposes settlement pot to financially support pharmaceutical companies that could run ibogaine clinical trials. 
“We could pave a road with it,” he said. “But I think it needs to go toward opioid abatement.”
Nine out of 10 drug clinical trials fail to receive FDA approval, but Creekmore said he believes the risk of not funding ibogaine research outweighs the risk of Mississippi’s settlement money not leading to a new medication.
He pointed to some of the public speakers’ stories of ibogaine treatment as evidence that the experiments are worth pursuing.
“It’s obviously working or they wouldn’t be doing it,” he said.
Ibogaine is a Schedule 1 drug on the U.S. list of controlled substances, meaning the federal government believes the compound is dangerous and has no medical use. The scheduling system has been criticized by many public health researchers who say it can prevent research into potential medications.

Mississippi Department of Mental Health Medical Director Dr. Thomas Recore gave the health committees an overview of the potential of psychedelic drugs, including ibogaine, to treat mental health conditions. He told lawmakers that as they think about whether to invest in ibogaine trials, they should consider whether it has enough potential to merit further study rather than whether it’s a cure-all for all mental afflictions. 
“The answer for me is a clear yes,” he said. 
Creekmore has been writing opinion pieces promoting ibogaine’s potential therapeutic uses throughout the summer. He frequently cites a 2024 Stanford University study in which researchers reported that among 30 veterans with mild traumatic brain injuries, many had decreased PTSD, depression and anxiety treatments a month after receiving ibogaine treatment. 
The scientists did not report any adverse cardiac effects in the study, which they said could be because the veterans received magnesium simultaneously. 
Creekmore and Recore were two attendees of dozens for a conference Hubbard organized last spring called the Aspen Ibogaine Meeting. Its website says the group hosted lawmakers from as many as 17 different states. 
Robert Gulock, the meeting’s coordinator and a private medical consultant, told Mississippi Today in May that Creekmore and the other legislators paid for their flights and lodging themselves. Creekmore and Hubbard said they do not have financial ties to the development of ibogaine as a medication.
Howell, the Yale physician, said he believes the public health priority for preventing more overdose deaths should be connecting people who need it with tools already proven to be effective, rather than a compound that could take years to move through the FDA approval process and may not lead to any new medication.

Article Summary

The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to overturn Cook County’s assault weapons ban in June.
Two gun rights groups are appealing that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
They hope the court rules in their favor and that the decision will overturn similar bans across the U.S.
Illinois enacted a statewide ban in 2023 that is also being challenged in the courts.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Two national gun rights organizations are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down Cook County’s ban on assault-style weapons in hopes that such a decision would overturn similar bans nationally, including the statewide ban Illinois lawmakers enacted in 2023.
The Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment Foundation filed a petition with the court Wednesday, asking it to reverse the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. In June, the 7th Circuit said plaintiffs in the case had shown no reason for the court to reverse its own precedents that have upheld assault weapons bans, including a 2019 decision upholding the Cook County law.
The petition was filed on the same day two children were killed and 17 other individuals were injured in a mass shooting at a Catholic church in Minneapolis. As of Thursday, authorities had not yet publicly identified the specific weapons used in that shooting, only to say one of them was a rifle.
It also came as the 7th Circuit is still weighing arguments in a challenge to Illinois’ statewide assault weapons ban, known as the Protect Illinois Communities Act. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office filed its final brief in that appeal Aug. 14. The court has not yet set a date for oral arguments.
“The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in America, owned by millions of peaceable people for lawful purposes every day,” Coalition President Brandon Combs said in a statement. “The Bill of Rights is not a suggestion, and the Second Amendment is not a second-class right.”
Cook County’s Ban
Cook County first adopted a local assault weapons ban in 1993, and it has been updated at least twice since then. It is now officially known as the Blair Holt Assault Weapons Ban, named after a Chicago teen who was killed in a 2007 shooting while protecting a high school classmate.
The law prohibits the possession, acquisition and transfer of a variety of firearms, including semiautomatic rifles that can accept large-capacity magazines. It specifically names 125 prohibited rifles, including the AR-15.
In 2018, a federal judge in Chicago upheld the law, citing a 7th Circuit decision from three years earlier upholding a nearly identical city ordinance in Highland Park. The case was appealed and in 2019, and the 7th Circuit reaffirmed its position that “bans on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines do not contravene the Second Amendment.”
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that decision.
The current challenge was filed in 2021, when the two gun rights organizations went back to court seeking to have both the Highland Park and Cook County decisions reversed. The plaintiffs include two Cook County residents, Cutberto Viramontes and Christopher Khaya.
Recent decisions
While that case was proceeding through court, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a landmark gun rights decision in 2022, New York State Rifle and Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen. That ruling held that to pass constitutional muster, gun control laws must be “consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
Also while the case was pending, the Illinois General Assembly passed a statewide assault weapons ban, officially known as the Protect Illinois Communities Act.
In November 2023, the 7th Circuit issued a ruling in a consolidated appeal involving the statewide ban as well as local bans in Chicago, Naperville and Cook County. In that ruling, the court refused to issue preliminary injunctions to block enforcement of any of those laws, saying its original ruling upholding the Highland Park ordinance still stood.
As a result, in March 2024, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer granted Cook County’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs appealed that ruling to the 7th Circuit, hoping for a reversal of the appellate court’s earlier decisions. But in a simple three-page opinion June 2, a three-judge panel said the plaintiffs had provided no compelling reason for the court to reconsider its earlier decisions.
Now, the plaintiffs are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the 7th Circuit. But in recent months, the nation’s high court has been reluctant to take up the question of assault weapon bans.
In July 2024, the court declined to hear an appeal of the 7th Circuit’s decision not to issue preliminary injunctions on the state and local assault weapons bans. And in June, the court also declined to hear appeals involving Maryland’s assault weapons ban as well as Rhode Island’s ban on large-capacity magazines.
In denying to hear the Maryland and Rhode Island appeals, however, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a statement that he felt the issue of assault weapons was not yet ripe for review, but that the court probably would address it “in the next Term or two.” He also specifically cited the Cook County case as one of several that the court might decide to review.

Free-roaming herds of large herbivores are few and far between on Earth, but where they do occur — like with bison in northwest Wyoming — monitoring shows a remarkable bump in grassland nutrition.  
The post Bison eradication stripped western grasslands of nutrients, Yellowstone research shows appeared first on WyoFile .","The remarkable seasonal flow of thousands of bison into and out of Yellowstone National Park is both a relic of an earlier, pre-settlement era and a source of great debate — Montana’s even sued in pursuit of fewer bison.  
But there’s now less debate about the ecological good the herds of native herbivores bring to the landscape. A new study published in the journal Science shows that the migratory herds of bison effectively function as nature’s fertilizers, providing an astonishing 2.5-fold bump in crude proteins growing into the grasslands that blanket Yellowstone’s Northern Range. 
“It’s mainly coming from urine and feces,” said Jerod Merkle, a professor of migration ecology and conservation at the University of Wyoming. “What happens is it goes into the ground, and it lights up the microbial ecosystem in the soil.
“It’s a circle,” he added. “Bison graze, pee and poop. That facilitates the insects and the microbes, which then creates better soil, which then the plants take up again.” 
Bison and other critters, in turn, benefit.

Merkle, along with co-authors Chris Geremia of Yellowstone National Park and Bill Hamilton of Washington and Lee University, even estimated the net benefit migratory bison add to the landscape in terms of crude protein. There’s not actually more grasses growing — even though they’re heavily grazed, the volume sprouting off the landscape stays about the same. 
“It’s not biomass,” Hamilton told WyoFile. “It’s more productive — the nutritional quality is improved. There’s more nitrogen and crude protein in the forage.”
Across Yellowstone’s Northern Range, researchers calculated that the bison stimulation effect added 3,549 tons of crude protein to a 329-square-mile region, which pencils out to an estimated 37-pounds-per-acre bump in nutrition. 
Figure from study. A) Bison now account for the majority of herbivore biomass on Yellowstone’s northern range, which has a complete guild of migratory herbivores and their carnivores. B) Beginning in spring at lower elevations in the West, bison move in dispersed groups, calving on the move and following the “green wave” of emerging vegetation. C) As they ascend, they gather in larger, coordinated groups on floodplains and wet grasslands, forming grazing lawns crucial for nurturing calves D) The main migratory route in Yellowstone covers about 100 kilometers from west to east in the northern part of Yellowstone. (University of Wyoming)

The benefits aren’t uniform. There’s a “mosaic” of bison grazing’s influence on the landscape, Merkle said, both in terms of space and time due to seasonal migrations. Grazing provided 156% more crude protein in the lawn-like habitats like the Lamar River valley and 155% more in high-elevation landscapes. In dry areas, the effect was slightly more subdued, with a 119% increase. 
To make those calculations, the research team assessed grazing and nutrient dynamics at 16 sites from 2015 to 2022. They used fenced exclosures moved every five weeks and kept track of datapoints including plant consumption, plant growth and plant composition, nutrient cycling, plant and soil chemistry and soil microbial populations. 
Merkle, Hamilton and Geremia did not detect overgrazing, which can result in declining plant productivity and diversity and soils becoming compacted. Rather, they detected the opposite and a lot of variation across the landscape, Merkle said.
“There are spots that bison hit hard, and places they don’t touch at all — and that can change over the years,” he said. “The cool thing is that allowing these bison to freely move across the landscape at a big scale, creates the heterogeneity.”

On the broader western landscape, it’s an effect that’s largely been lost. Although there are a few exceptions and efforts to grow more free-roaming herds, bison are generally not allowed to behave like wildlife in the modern world. 
In Wyoming, for example, bison are classified as a big-game species where the roughly 500-animal Jackson Herd roams and in the unoccupied Absaroka herd unit east of Yellowstone. But elsewhere, they’re not considered wildlife and instead considered “privately owned or bison running at large.”
That’s not particularly unique. Today, about 95% of the 400,000 bison that exist are privately owned or commercially raised for their meat. The few “conservation herds” that exist average just 300 animals, and they’re “almost universally managed in constrained areas with strict limits on numbers and movements,” according to the Science paper. It’s a far cry from the 20,000-strong bison herd that early explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark encountered in South Dakota in 1806, which was just a sliver of the tens of millions that existed before white settlers hunted the American bison to near extinction.
Yellowstone is one of the very few exceptions. The herd-oriented, migratory plant-eating megafauna  — and their quantifiable ecological effects — have been lost almost everywhere else. 
“The closest relatable ecosystem is the Serengeti, where we have big herds of wildebeest and zebra moving and migrating in a similar way and creating a similar nitrogen and ecosystem cycle,” Merkle said. “It’s kind of cool for Yellowstone to be on par with a Serengeti-type place.”

(Rachel Mipro/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas attorney general’s office issued a $250 fine to the Haysville City Council for violating the Kansas Open Records Act, officials said Wednesday.
City employees declined without explanation to release copies of photographs requested under the state government transparency law. The photographs should have been released under KORA. The photographs were subsequently presented in court during a jury trial and led to the examination of whether the city committed a KORA violation.
An investigation by the attorney general’s office concluded the Haysville City Council violated the open records act. The city is southwest of Wichita in Sedgwick County.
“Unfortunately, an individual requested an open record and was unknowingly deprived of these city records until it was too late to matter. Therefore, a civil penalty was an appropriate remedy to remind the city of its obligations under the KORA,” said Amber Smith, deputy attorney general for the public protection division.
A consent order included the $250 civil penalty assessed against the Haysville City Council in addition to requirements for supplemental training on the open records act and a commitment to comply with the state law.
“While there is no evidence that the city intentionally violated the KORA, it is necessary to recognize that their actions in responding to an open records request fell short of its legal obligations,” Smith said.
She said it was the attorney general’s responsibility to make certain government bodies required to adhere to KORA made public records available for inspection by any person.
Under Kansas law, individuals can ask to obtain or inspect public records not exempted from KORA by state law. The recipient of a request is required to provide a response to the request within three business days. That reply could range from rejection of the request, production of the records or an explanation why it would take more time to provide the records. If a record request was denied, the government agency is required to identify the reason or legal authority for the decision.
A new state statute, according to Kobach, removed the presumption of a 25-cent per-page fee for copies of a document or digital records requested under KORA. Going forward, he said all KORA fees must be tied to the actual cost of meeting the record request.
The attorney general’s office anticipated the actual cost would be less than 25 cents per page so the fee charged per page would likely decline in Kansas.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kobach1-1024x769.jpeg,,,2025-08-28 17:57:57.742765

Impacts from federal cuts to services are difficult to nail down, but are already resulting in layoffs and service interruptions in New Mexico, she said. (Danielle Prokop / Source New Mexico)Federal cuts to services are already impacting health care, education and infrastructure for Pueblo and Tribal communities in New Mexico, leadership for the state’s Indian Affairs agency told lawmakers Thursday, and with deeper cuts expected
Moreover, New Mexico tribal governments are facing challenges determining the specific financial losses they will face, Indian Affairs Secretary Josett Monette told lawmakers at the Federal Funding Stabilization Subcommittee held inside Santa Ana Casino.
Monette said her department’s analysis of the Trump Administration’s “big beautiful bill” could mean losses of three-quarters of a billion dollars to Indian Country with an unknown impact to New Mexico.
“The numbers are constantly in flux right now, and we really can’t know exactly right now,” Monette told Source NM just outside Quezada’s Comedy Club after the meeting. “But our department is committed to be there for Pueblos, Tribes and all New Mexicans, when we do know the impacts.”
The shrinking of Medicaid services by nearly $4 million will have a large impact on tribal communities, Monette said, noting that nearly 40,000 Native American adults receive Medicaid in New Mexico, accounting for 16% of the state’s population using the state-federal insurance program.
Medicaid accounts for more than half the funding for Indian Health Services hospitals. U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, both New Mexico Democrats, earlier this week invited Mark Cruz, a Tribal citizen of the Klamath Tribes and senior advisor to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to visit Gallup Indian Medical Center and “witness firsthand how the Administration’s bureaucratic red tape is limiting access to basic and essential health care services like ultrasounds and emergency care,” a news release from Leger Fernández’s office stated. The letter followed an earlier one this month from members of the delegation about the hospital to Kennedy Jr.
Tribal colleges were facing a 90% cut in funding, but instead will likely have flat budgets this fiscal year. Nonetheless, most will have layoffs or program cuts, Monette said. Direct budget cuts are not the only threat. For example, Navajo Technical University lost more than $3 million after the slashing of federal programs for renewable energy job training and research grants from the National Science Foundation.
The department will roll out a portal for tribal governments to submit lost funding for programs and staffing impacts, prior to the upcoming legislative session, Monette said.
“As we learn about the direct impacts we can work as a state alongside our nations, Pueblos and tribal communities to determine how to help or move forward,” she said.
Lawmakers said they were eager to get a clearer New Mexico picture, urging the department to keep them apprised and to offer updates at further interim meetings.
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup) floated using unspent capital outlay funds to help address gaps in federal funding, but urged Pueblos and tribal governments to reach out directly to the state before the legislative session, to help determine which programs could have state funding.
“If we don’t know, then we can’t help,” he said.

Rep. Bruce Ayers of Quincy said his proposal (H 4029) aims to crack down on drivers who attempt to evade electronic tolls with tinted or “smoked” license plate covers that obscure the visibility of features, including plate numbers, registration decals and state identifiers.
“This creates risk and uncertainty for toll enforcement, accident investigations, and law enforcement operations,” Ayers said in written testimony to Transportation Committee co-chair Rep. James Arciero.
“States like New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania have already banned tinted license plate covers, leading to measurable results,” the Quincy Democrat continued. “Notably, New York recovered over $19 million in lost toll revenue in just one year following stricter enforcement.”
The legislation blocks colored glass, colored plastic, brackets, holders, mountings, frames or any other type of covering that “alters or obscures” license plate features. The measure needs another favorable House vote before it can advance to the Senate.
AAA Northeast has not taken a formal stance on the bill, said spokesperson Mark Schieldrop, who said that the automobile organization “generally support[s] prohibiting the covering or coating of license plates with any materials that conceal, obscure or distort the plates.”
In written testimony, Robert Kearns of Quincy provided lawmakers a link to a Google Photos album, filled with pictures of obscured license plate covers he had encountered throughout the state. In some photos, the license plate numbers are unreadable.
Kearns works at the Department of Fish and Game’s Division of Ecological Restoration, according to the personal website included in his testimony.
“It’s frustrating to know that while I pay my tolls and parking fees as required, others are using these covers to avoid doing the same,” Kearns wrote. “It’s not just unfair—it’s costly. It shifts the burden onto compliant drivers and undermines the systems we all depend on.”
MassDOT officials did not answer a News Service question about the scope of lost toll revenue due to tinted licensed plate covers.
Kearns pointed out that license plate readers are “critical for toll collection on the Mass Pike, the Tobin Bridge, and the Sumner, Callahan, and Ted Williams tunnels.”
“They’re also used by the MBTA and UMass to collect parking fees, and by law enforcement to monitor traffic and investigate crimes,” he wrote. “Obscured license plates compromise all of these functions.”
New York’s law banning the sale or distribution of concealed license plates and increasing penalties for drivers who evade toll collection took effect in September 2024.
The New York Department of Motor Vehicles said the law is part of ongoing efforts to tackle “ghost” plates and “ghost” cars, which involve fake or altered plates. Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams last year also launched a task force aimed at eliminating ghost cars from city streets.
“These changes to the law are meant to make sure that everyone who makes use of public infrastructure is paying their fair share to use them,” DMV Commissioner Mark Schroeder had said in a statement. “Toughening the law will also help authorities crack down on criminals who try to avoid detection when committing crimes by making use of ghost plates or license plate coverings.”
In Massachusetts, state law says license plates “shall be kept clean with the numbers legible and shall not be obscured or the appearance obstructed in any manner by the installation of any device obscuring said numbers.”
In 2011, a state trooper pulled over a driver on Route 495 due to a plastic cover that was obscuring the rear license plate, triggering a court case revolving around how to interpret legibility of plate numbers. 
The defendant won the case in District Court and the appeal by the state, according to CommonWealth Beacon. The District Court had found the license plate was not obscured while the driver was stopped, Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly reported. 
Then-Appeals Court Judge Gabrielle Wolohojian, who’s now on the Supreme Judicial Court, sought to clarify state law: “The regulation likewise does not impose a universal prohibition against license plate covers. Instead, it prohibits only those covers that reduce the legibility or substantially diminish the reflective quality of the license plate.”
With the rise of electronic tolling, Ayers emphasized the importance of ensuring that “license plates remain fully legible at all times” and said his bill “will align Massachusetts with best practices nationwide.”

Representatives from Vermont’s Department of Health and seven other Northeastern states met last week to form a regional public health coalition that can respond to challenges passed down from the federal government amid dramatic changes brought on by the administration of President Donald Trump, such as disparities in vaccine recommendations or losses in lab funding. 
Vermont’s interim health commissioner, Julie Arel, confirmed that she and her principal adviser went to the meeting in Providence, Rhode Island, as did the state epidemiologist, lab director and other senior staff members in the Department of Health. The meeting was first reported by the Boston Globe.
Arel described a collaboration in its preliminary stages: “The intent of that meeting in Rhode Island was to start to say, ‘What is this thing?’ We haven’t really defined it. We haven’t really decided what it is we’re doing with this.” 
Still, she sees an increasing need for interstate collaboration as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention restricts funding for lab testing and departs from scientific consensus on its immunization messaging. 
“The biggest issue for public health right now is the uncertainty coming from the federal government,” Arel said. “That level of uncertainty is really hard for entities that are as heavily funded by federal grants as we are.”

No more than a week after the regional meeting, the federal center’s director, Susan Monarez, was forced out of the position, reportedly due to her objections to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s efforts to change vaccine recommendations. On Wednesday, Monarez’s lawyers posted a letter on X that claimed her ouster was due to her refusal to “rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.” 
The CDC’s chief medical officer, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases and the director of Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology all resigned that same day.
On Thursday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called for a bipartisan congressional investigation into Monarez’s firing, citing in his statement the dangers to public health posed by what he called a “reckless” and “dangerous” decision. 
The regional meeting last week centered on questions of infectious disease epidemiology, vaccines, laboratory sciences and emergency preparedness, Arel said. The coalition included all of the New England states except New Hampshire, as well as New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.
“There may be times where we are looking to provide more information than maybe the CDC is. But every state is going to need to do its own thing,” she added, explaining that the idea is that the regional coalition could be a source of guidelines and resources for states to act on independently. 
Attendees were particularly interested in discussing how states might navigate a situation where the CDC’s vaccine recommendations split from state health officials’ scientific consensus, Arel described. 
On Wednesday, the FDA issued approvals for updated Covid vaccines and removed emergency authorizations for their use, which had broadened access to the shots. Kennedy posted on X that the current authorization makes the Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax vaccines available to patients over 12 years old after consulting with their doctors. Still, the end of the emergency designation is expected to make it more challenging for individuals to get the shots without that approval. 
In a Thursday email to VTDigger, Vermont Department of Health spokesperson Kyle Casteel added that what qualifies as an underlying condition to make someone eligible for the vaccine, and how it is proven to someone administering the vaccine, remains unclear. 
The CDC is still expected to issue a recommendation for who should receive those vaccines. In June, Kennedy replaced the vaccine panel at the CDC with vaccine skeptics, and many worry that the panel’s recommendation may further limit access to Covid immunization when it meets in mid-September. 
“The approval of this fall’s COVID vaccine has not followed the typical approval process, and we are still assessing recommendations and potential impacts so we can provide guidance to Vermonters about who can get the vaccine and where,” Casteel wrote. “We are working to reduce any access barriers as much as we can and will keep sharing information as it becomes available.”
He added that the state will continue to communicate with counterparts in other states to inform how to move forward with the confusion surrounding the federal directives. 
Officials at the coalition meeting discussed areas of collaboration in which states can find efficiencies by acting as a larger group — such as buying bulk lab supplies as a region, which would bring cost savings to Vermont as a small state. When the loss of federal funding reduces resources for the state Department of Health, those savings can make a big difference, Arel said. 
Other ideas for collaboration would leverage regional cooperation in less tangible ways — like brainstorming and coordinating messaging, public information campaigns or collectively  strategizing on how to overcome public health challenges as they arise. 
The collaboration Arel described is still at the stage of laying the groundwork and relationships for when the need to collectively act arises: “We don’t want to get out ahead of anything,” she said. “A lot of it has been making those relationships stronger.”

Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee) said. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Democrats are calling for prohibitions on state and local support for the Trump administration’s mass deportations and for greater transparency surrounding law enforcement officers and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers helping carry out arrests. 
Lawmakers, led by the Democratic Socialist caucus, proposed a package of five bills to meet those goals at a press conference Thursday. Federal agents have used increasingly aggressive tactics to arrest immigrants as they seek to advance the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. In Wisconsin, ICE arrests have doubled under Trump with agents arresting an average of 85 people per month since January. 
“The Trump administration is threatening our state’s fundamental values by commanding ICE and its agents to ignore due process, rip people from their communities and repeatedly violate basic human rights,” Rep. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee) said. The bills, he said, will implement “strong accountability measures so that all Wisconsinites, regardless of their background, are welcome and safe here.”
Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee) said that most of the people being detained by the Trump administration aren’t criminals. According to ABC News, a recent report found that since late May, people with no criminal convictions and no pending criminal charges have started to make up an increasing percentage of those arrested by ICE. 
“The vast majority have been people who pose no public threat,” Ortiz-Velez said. “They are the essential workers that put food on our tables, milk the cows and keep the meat factories operating. They build our homes, and they’re our neighbors, and they’re our friends.” 
Republicans, who hold majorities in the Senate and Assembly, would be necessary for the bills to advance.
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said it’s unlikely Republicans will sign on. 
“We hope that our Republican colleagues will work with us on common-sense legislation, especially when the stakes are this high, but no, I don’t anticipate any support from our Republican legislative colleagues on this,” Clancy said. 
Republicans introduced a bill earlier this year that would require local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE. It passed the Assembly in March. 
One of the bills in the Democratic package is a measure introduced earlier this year by Ortiz-Velez to do the opposite by prohibiting cooperation of law enforcement with ICE
Another bill would require law enforcement officers to identify themselves when arresting someone including making their name and badge number visible, providing the authority for arrest or detention and prohibiting them from covering their face or wearing a disguise. Face coverings would be allowed if worn for safety or protection.
Violations would be a Class D felony and carry a penalty of maximum $100,000 fine.
Leaders of the Department of Homeland Security have said agents are covering their faces to protect themselves from doxing and threats, according to NPR. 
“It’s not normal for any law enforcement officer, any agency to wear masks and hide their identity, nor is it safe,” Ortiz-Velez said. “No exception should be made here.” 
One bill would prohibit state employees and police officers from aiding in the detention of someone if the person is being detained on the “sole basis that the individual is or is alleged to be not lawfully present in the United States.” The bill would also prohibit law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin from participating in 287(g) agreements.
The federal 287(g) program provides the opportunity for state and local law enforcement agencies to partner with ICE, allowing local officers to perform certain immigration-related duties, including identifying, processing and detaining removable immigrants in local jails. 
According to the ACLU of Wisconsin, there are 13 counties in Wisconsin as of the end of July that formally participate in the program. Several have joined this year including Kewaunee, Outagamie, Washington, Waupaca, Winnebago and Wood. 
“It’s important to remember as we’re here at the state capitol that Wisconsin has shown strong opposition to policies like 287(g),” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director and co-founder of Voces de la Frontera, a nonprofit immigrant rights organization. 
Neumann-Ortiz noted that in 2016 thousands protested immigration legislation that Republicans were proposing at the time, and it ultimately failed.
“People can make the change,” Neumann-Ortiz said.
Another bill would prohibit state and local facilities from being used to hold detained immigrants and would prohibit funds from being used to establish new immigrant detention facilities. The bill’s co-author, Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire), called it “the Communities, Not Cages” bill. 
“Over the past eight months, my constituents have stopped me at events and contacted my office and shared personal stories of fear and horror that grows and comes with watching the Trump regime abduct, detain and deport people they perceive to be immigrants without due process without accountability, often without even showing their faces,” Phelps said. “Our constituents in every corner of the state wish for us to be welcoming, safe and humane — a state that invests in communities and not in cages.” 
The final bill would establish a grant program run by the Department of Administration for community-based organizations in Wisconsin to support them in providing civil legal services to people and families in immigration matters.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers’ administration released new estimates Thursday showing that President Donald Trump’s recently approved federal tax cut and spending megabill will cost Wisconsin $284 million — $142 million annually — due to shifting costs and new “red-tape” requirements for social programs. 
The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act — as it is officially named — makes a number of policy changes to federal social safety net programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), that will be implemented gradually until completion in 2028. The cuts to the programs were aimed at balancing out the continuation of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and significant increases in military as well as immigration and border spending, though the law is projected to add $3 trillion to the national debt. 
The estimate from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) comes as Vice President J.D. Vance is scheduled to speak in La Crosse on Thursday to tout the legislation. 
Evers said in a statement that the bill is “bad for Wisconsin taxpayers, who will be forced to help foot the bill for Republicans’ red-tape requirements just to make it harder for folks to get the care they need and food to eat.”
“Wisconsinites shouldn’t have to pay the price for a reckless Republican bill that’s going to add trillions of dollars to our federal deficit and shift hundreds of millions of dollars in costs to hard-working taxpayers, all so Republicans could pay for tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations,” Evers said. “Wisconsinites aren’t getting a fair shake from Republicans in Washington — that’s plain as day.”
Some of the cost-cutting in the law comes from adding additional requirements to qualify for safety net programs that will reduce the number of people benefiting from them and offload some of the federal government’s costs to state and local governments. 
Wisconsin DHS has estimated that the requirements could put more than 270,000 Wisconsinites at risk of losing health insurance and as many as 43,700 could lose access to food assistance. 
Starting on December 31, 2026, childless members of BadgerCare Plus who are between the ages of 19 and 64 will have to report 80 hours of work, training or volunteering per month or risk losing coverage.
The analysis notes that it is now “fiscally and operationally unfeasible” for Wisconsin to expand its Medicaid program due to new provisions in the law. Wisconsin could get an additional $1.3 billion from the federal government if it expanded Medicaid, but the provision that made that a possibility will sunset in 2026. Expansion states will also now be required to redetermine eligibility at the six-month marks for its adult population covered under expansion.
When it comes to the SNAP program, the federal government will only cover 25% of administrative costs under the new law. It previously covered 50%. The shifting of the additional 25% to the states will cost Wisconsin about $43.5 million annually starting in 2027. That cost is also expected to grow in the future. 
The federal law also eliminates funding for SNAP education programs with Wisconsin losing $12 million annually starting in October. DHS said it would need additional funding in the 2027-29 state budget to implement and sustain Medicaid and FoodShare employment and training programs. 
The federal law could also mean additional costs for states if its annual payment error rate for the SNAP program is over 6%. The payment error rate measures mistakes by states in assessing eligibility and payments and, according to the Evers administration, Wisconsin has typically had a low rate. Last year, the state’s error rate was about 4.5%, but the agency said rates fluctuate and new policies and standards could make rates fluctuate more. 
States with a rate over 6% starting in October 2027 will be required to pay 5 to 15% of SNAP costs. 
“Achieving and maintaining Wisconsin’s historically low error rate while implementing the other provisions in the reconciliation bill will require additional state and county quality control staff,” the analysis states. “Failing to do so will have even larger consequences for the state and Wisconsin taxpayers.” 
The agency estimates that if an error rate were over 6%, it could cost the state as much as $205.5 million annually. 
DHS said it will not be able to absorb all of the increased costs associated with the law and additional state funding will be necessary, including $69.2 million to cover additional administrative costs including an  additional 56 state employees and county quality control positions to consistently achieve and maintain a FoodShare payment error rate in Wisconsin below 6% over the long term. The agency  said it would also need additional funding in the 2027-29 state budget to implement and sustain Medicaid and FoodShare employment and training programs. The agency estimated that it would cost the state roughly $72.4 million each year to provide employment and training services to help Medicaid members meet the new requirements. 
DHS Sec. Kirsten Johnson said the potential costs covered in the analysis are “just the tip of the iceberg.” 
“From increases in uncompensated care for hospitals to lost revenue for Wisconsin’s farmers, grocers, and local economies and thousands of Wisconsinites losing Medicaid and FoodShare, these cuts will cause a ripple effect throughout the state and put a financial strain on all of us,” Johnson said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-28 21:21:08+00:00,CT Mirror,DeLauro calls for RFK Jr.’s firing amid ouster of CDC director,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/28/rosa-delauro-robert-f-kennedy-susan-monarez-fired-cdc/,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has 'set us back decades' by firing experts working on infectious disease prevention, Rep. Rosa DeLauro said.","U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro called for the firing of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday, arguing that he has “set us back decades” by firing scientific experts working on infectious disease prevention.
Her pushback comes shortly after the ouster of Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after some back-and-forth on her employment status. That prompted the resignation of a few other officials at the CDC, which is overseen by Kennedy’s health agency.
DeLauro, who is the top Democrat on the House Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, has been critical since Kennedy took the helm. At a hearing in May, she accused him of “wreaking havoc” because of federal funding cuts to health programs and research.
The White House said Monarez was no longer in support of President Donald Trump’s agenda, as well as the “Make America Healthy Again” movement promoted by Kennedy, but didn’t give a specific reason for her firing. Monarez’s lawyers said in a statement that she “refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.”
“We know his agenda — he wants to take away lifesaving vaccines from kids and families. But there are principled experts, like the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Susan Monarez, who refused to rubber-stamp RFK Jr’s plans that would hurt millions of children,” DeLauro, who represents Connecticut’s 3rd District, said in a statement on Thursday.
“Yesterday’s firing of the CDC Director, and the resignations of top CDC experts, shows us what is at stake and the urgency with which we must act. RFK Jr. was never qualified to be secretary of HHS, and he never should have been allowed to set foot in the building. The longer we wait, the more lives we risk,” she said. “It is time for RFK Jr. to be fired.”
Monarez had been serving as the acting director of the CDC before she was sworn in as the permanent head late last month. But on Wednesday, a few weeks into the job, HHS posted on social media that she was no longer serving in that role.
Her lawyers pushed back in a statement that she had not resigned or been terminated. But by later Wednesday evening, the White House had formally fired Monarez. Shortly after, three other key officials at the CDC resigned in response.
Demetre Daskalakis, who was serving as the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, was one of the officials to resign. He argued there was a lack of transparency and the manipulation of data for political purposes.
“I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public’s health,” Daskalakis wrote in his resignation letter.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the decision at Thursday’s press briefing, confirming that the president ultimately fired her. Leavitt pointed to Monarez’s own lawyers saying she wasn’t aligned with the administration. 
“The president has the authority to fire those who are not aligned with his mission,” Leavitt told reporters, adding that Trump and Kennedy are “committed to restoring trust and transparency and credibility to the CDC.” She said one of them will have an announcement soon on who will be nominated as director.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment about DeLauro’s remarks about Kennedy and Monarez’s firing.
The shakeup at the CDC comes amid the rollout of new restrictions around the COVID vaccine for the fall and as cases are starting to rise as children head back to school.
The Food and Drug Administration, which is overseen by Kennedy’s HHS, announced Wednesday it approved updated COVID vaccines as well as new recommendations for a much more limited pool of people who should get the shot. It is now authorized for those who are 65 and older as well as for those with a medical condition that puts them at higher risk of illness.
At Thursday’s briefing, a reporter asked Leavitt if vaccines will still be available and covered by insurance for people seeking them regardless of their age or whether they have a preexisting condition.
Leavitt said the FDA revoked the emergency authorizations because of the end of the pandemic but said the policy around the COVID vaccines “doesn’t affect vaccine availability for Americans who want them.” But she didn’t say explicitly whether insurers will continue to cover the vaccine for those outside of the recommendations.
Citing revised vaccine policies and other changes at the top health department, DeLauro argued, “We are seeing the consequence of his leadership at HHS.”
“He’s fired scientific experts who keep Americans safe from infectious diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis and measles. We have already seen a resurgence of, and deaths caused by, measles — a disease that had been eliminated in America — and because of him, we will see new disease outbreaks going forward,” DeLauro said. “He has pushed out world-class scientists who are working on cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and other debilitating diseases.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25155750803369-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-08-28 17:57:57.742765

(Allan Swart/Getty Images)New parties were added Thursday to a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of an Arkansas law requiring Ten Commandments displays in public school classrooms after a federal judge granted permission to do so.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks issued a preliminary injunction Aug. 4 that blocked enforcement of Act 573 of 2025, which would have required public schools to “prominently display” a 16”x20” poster or framed copy of a “historical representation” of the Ten Commandments. 
The injunction only applies to the four Northwest Arkansas school districts — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Siloam Springs and Springdale — that were sued by seven families of varying religious and nonreligious backgrounds in June. 
The Arkansas families allege the state law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
Supporters of the law have argued the tenants have historical significance because they influenced the country’s founders in creating the nation’s laws and legal system.
Plaintiffs ask federal court to add more parties to Arkansas Ten Commandments lawsuit

Attorneys for the families involved in the lawsuit recently requested the court allow them to add the Conway School District as a defendant and families from the district as plaintiffs in the ongoing litigation. In Wednesday’s order, Brooks said plaintiffs could file a supplemental complaint instead of an amended complaint as requested. 
Thursday’s supplemental complaint names April and Kyle Berry, Julee Jaeger and their minor children who attend the Conway School District as new plaintiffs in the case. The Conway School District, which hung Ten Commandments displays in classrooms, is also named as a new defendant in the complaint.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys also filed on Thursday a motion for a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction on behalf of Jaeger and the Berrys. They requested that the Conway School District and the Arkansas attorney generals’ office file any opposition to a temporary restraining order by 9 a.m. Friday. 
“This schedule will ensure that the Court has enough time to order that the Conway School District’s Ten Commandments displays be immediately taken down and that such order is effectuated by the time students return to class after the Labor Day weekend,” the motion states.
If the court grants the temporary restraining order, plaintiffs’ attorneys requested that the court schedule any additional briefing or hearing necessary to convert the order into a preliminary injunction within 14 days. 
According to the supplemental complaint, the Conway School District defied the court’s ruling by posting Ten Commandments displays. On Aug. 5, the day the law took effect, the original plaintiffs’ counsel sent a letter to superintendents to inform them about Brooks issuing a preliminary injunction and noted that “they have an independent legal obligation to respect their students’ constitutional rights,” according to the amended complaint. The letter also stated that districts that implement Act 573 “could be inviting additional litigation.”
Jaeger and the Berrys assert the same claims as the original plaintiffs and seek identical relief. The only difference is the new plaintiffs claim they suffered injury because they observed Ten Commandments displays hanging in their children’s schools, according to court filings.
Jaeger is raising her child in a nonreligious household and objects to the displays because she believes they will create a structure for teachers and administrators “to inject additional religious beliefs into the classroom,” according to the supplemental complaint. Jaeger also said she doesn’t want her child “to be subjected to additional religious indoctrination.”
The Berrys are raising their children in the Christian faith and Kyle is a worship leader at a Methodist church. However, they object to the Ten Commandments displays because they “forcibly impose” scripture on their children that’s contrary to the family’s faith, according to court documents. 
“In fact, the Ten Commandments is not scripture that the Berrys or their faith community tend to focus on,” the complaint states. “Instead, they focus their religious instruction of children more on teachings found in the New Testament, such as the teaching to love your neighbors.”
The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Arkansas, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett serving as pro bono counsel.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
Despite federal shift, state health officials encourage COVID vaccines for pregnant women

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.











We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics



Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

(Photo courtesy of the state Department of Transportation)The closure of a bridge connecting eastern King and Pierce counties is dealing a blow to businesses in the area and adding lots of time to commutes.
But the White River Bridge could reopen to alternating traffic by the end of next month. 
A semitruck crash on Aug. 18 caused structural damage running the length of the bridge on State Route 410. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the damage, potentially opening up federal dollars to reimburse for repair costs.
“The White River Bridge is a critical lifeline to these communities, and we are doing all we can to get it reopened as quickly as possible,” Ferguson said in a statement.
The bridge, built in 1949, connects the cities of Enumclaw and Buckley. Detours around the closure can add 45 minutes of travel. Before the crash, the White River Bridge carried more than 22,000 vehicles per day, according to the state Department of Transportation.

Estimates to repair the steel truss bridge could exceed $2 million, according to Ferguson’s emergency declaration. Its last inspection showed it was in fair condition. 
King County Executive Shannon Braddock issued a similar proclamation over the weekend to foster extra resources to respond to the bridge closure. It also called for a nearby pedestrian bridge to remain open to walkers, bikers and emergency vehicles 24 hours a day with added safety measures.
The state Department of Transportation will install five temporary braces, similar to a cast for a human’s broken bone, the agency said late Wednesday. Once that’s done, the plan is to reopen one lane. 
Both lanes won’t be able to reopen until permanent repairs are made. State engineers are working on a plan for what that will look like. 
Buckley Mayor Beau Burkett said earlier Wednesday that the city is looking at interim measures to ease burdens for commuters, like expanding parking lots, creating paths for people who need to cross the bridge and adding lights. 
“These are improvements that were not budgeted for, and the Governor’s emergency declaration will hopefully assist us in securing the resources needed to implement them quickly,” Burkett said in an email. “This support is critical to helping our community stay connected while longer-term repair solutions are developed.”
Businesses in the area have already seen sales drop 30% to 50%, said Pierce County Councilmember Dave Morell, whose district includes Buckley. 
Morell noted many Enumclaw teachers live in Buckley. The city also doesn’t have a grocery store, so residents usually shop on the other side of the White River Bridge.
On the King County side of the bridge, Enumclaw Mayor Jan Molinaro says everything from usually routine drives to medical appointments and delivering meals to seniors has been disrupted.
“It feels like COVID 2.0,” Molinaro said via email, adding that Enumclaw is a “strong community, however the bridge needs to reopen quickly.”
She welcomed the news of one-lane traffic, but said during rush hour, the drive time will likely remain lengthy.
She hopes Ferguson’s disaster declaration will help provide funding to businesses hurt by the closure. King County is looking at a loan program run by the U.S. Small Business Administration to potentially help local establishments.
Ferguson’s declaration calls on state agencies to “do everything reasonably possible to assist affected political subdivisions.”

Disaster declarations don’t guarantee the feds will cover costs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency this year has twice rejected the state’s request for federal help to cover tens of millions of dollars in damage caused by a bomb cyclone late last year.
Meanwhile, a dozen miles south of the White River Bridge, the Fairfax Bridge, a gateway to Mount Rainier, has been permanently closed since April due to deterioration. The state transportation department is considering rebuilding a new bridge there, or tearing down the existing bridge and building nothing new in its place.
Jayme Peloli has been pushing Ferguson to open up state reserves to help local businesses in the town of Wilkeson, where she lives, and the surrounding communities affected by the Fairfax Bridge closure. 
Peloli said Ferguson called her before issuing Wednesday’s proclamation on the White River Bridge. He told her his team would work with her to find solutions given the infrastructure issues with the Fairfax Bridge don’t qualify it for emergency federal reimbursements, Peloli said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gy0JFKYbMAA71mw-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-28 17:57:57.742765

“On the ag side, I think we’re going to see a lot of balance sheets contract,” he said.

Evert Van der Sluis, a council member and South Dakota State University economics professor, said the declining profitability of crops is likely why the S&P Global growth forecast for South Dakota’s 2025 gross domestic product — the sum of all goods and services produced within its borders — is 0.4%. National growth is projected to be 1.7%. 
Van der Sluis warned that labor shortages in agriculture and construction could worsen the situation as federal immigration policies tighten and deportations increase. Several participants pointed to other federal policies as compounding the uncertainty, including tariffs pursued by the Trump administration.
A tariff is a tax paid by an entity importing foreign goods, with the cost often passed along in prices charged to domestic consumers, Van der Sluis said. He said the Trump administration’s approach to tariffs and international relations has hurt the U.S. on the global stage. 
Roughly half of U.S. soybeans typically go to China, but buyers there have shifted some purchases to Brazil, which has rapidly converted land to agriculture and improved ports and rail infrastructure, according to council member John Hemmingstad of Elk Point, a director of Avalon Capital Group.
“China’s still eating and buying. They’re just not buying from us,” Hemmingstad said.
From June 2024 to June 2025, U.S. agricultural exports to China declined by 39%, according to an Investigate Midwest report citing data from the Census Bureau’s USA Trade Online database.
Despite the downturn in crop prices, farmland values remain strong, buoyed by investor confidence that federal lawmakers will step in with financial support, Hemmingstad said. But with a lot of industries suffering the effects of tariffs, he added, “there’s no guarantee we’ll get that same safety net.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/591A0144-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-28 16:57:15.823673

The Saginaw City Council unanimously vacated Lamar-Silvia’s seat on the city council upon her sentencing as a result of the conviction.
According to the Department of Attorney General, Lamar-Silvia fraudulently signed the names of Saginaw voters to a petition form in July 2024, aiming to ensure city council candidate Eric Eggleston a place on the ballot. 
Eggleston also signed the petition form, falsely certifying that he was the circulator, and submitted both forms to the clerk’s office shortly before the filing deadline that same day. He was not granted placement on the ballot.
Eggleston is scheduled for sentencing on Sept. 4, in the 10th Circuit Court in Saginaw County.

Ilhan Omar (right) call for a ban on assault rifles and high capacity magazines at a news conference with fellow Democrats and gun safety advocates in Minneapolis City Hall on Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) Federal, state and city Democratic lawmakers joined gun safety advocates to call for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines on Thursday, a day after a shooter killed two children and injured 17 others during morning Mass at a Catholic school in south Minneapolis in one of the worst mass shootings in Minnesota’s history.
The shooting at Annunciation Church and school set off a morbidly familiar routine in the United States, where firearms are the leading cause of death for children and teens: candle light vigils, thoughts and prayers from politicians and partisan deadlock over how to prevent the next massacre.
“Thoughts and prayers are not going to cut it,” said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey at a news conference in City Hall flanked by more than two dozen lawmakers and scores of supporters. “We need action at the federal level. We need action at the state level. We need coordination with the cities around the country.”
Law enforcement said the shooter used three legally purchased firearms to carry out the attack — a shotgun, a handgun and a semiautomatic rifle. In a now-deleted YouTube video, a person police believe to be the shooter shows a handwritten notebook entry saying it was “shockingly easy” to obtain a firearm at a pawnshop.
The shooter fired more than 100 rounds into the church from the outside while children and parishioners ducked for cover under church pews.
“A 10-year-old boy had more courage hiding in a church pew while his friend shielded him with his body than I have seen from far too many lawmakers more beholden to a gun lobby than a child,” said Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of the national gun safety advocacy group Moms Demand Action.
The injured included 15 children ranging in age from 6 to 15 and three parishioners in their 80s. As of Wednesday evening, one adult and five children were in critical condition at Hennepin Healthcare with four other victims receiving treatment for non-life threatening injuries. Three children were still being treated at Children’s Minnesota as of Thursday morning with four victims discharged.
Minnesota Republican House Floor Leader Harry Niska criticized Democrats for diminishing the power of prayer in their calls for action.
“Some people have said thoughts and prayers aren’t enough. Well I believe in the power of prayer. Prayer is such an important part of what we start with,” Niska said in a video posted to X. 
Niska voted against the state’s red flag law and background check requirement for private gun sales.
The massacre comes on the heels of the political assassination of House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and attempted assassination of Sen. John Hoffman. Hortman’s husband was also killed and Hoffman’s wife was injured.
Assault rifles and high capacity magazines were banned in the United States from 1994 until 2004, when the ban expired after Congress chose not to renew it. Available research, while limited, shows there is evidence that bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines decrease mass shootings like the one at Annunciation Church. Former President Joe Biden urged Congress to renew the ban, but was unsuccessful.
“This is not a big issue for us to solve, like curing cancer or AIDS,” said U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar. “This is something that is simple — a simple ban to make sure people who should not have access to these weapons do not get them.”
State legislators vowed to introduce a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, though the chances of such a bill passing in a divided Legislature seem dim.
Democrats had control of the Legislature for two years and failed to pass a statewide ban. Democratic House Floor Leader Jamie Long of Minneapolis said he had the bill drafted but didn’t introduce it because he didn’t think they were ready.
“We’re ready now,” Long said. “It shouldn’t have taken tragedy coming to Minnesota to be ready.”
Democrats did pass a slate of gun control laws when they held power in 2023 and 2024. They instituted an extreme risk protection order, or “red flag,” law that allows family members or police to ask judges to take guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.
They also passed universal background check requirements on private gun sales as well as increased penalties for possession of converted machine guns and “straw purchases” when people buy guns for someone not legally allowed to possess them.
One gun safety measure — a ban on binary triggers which increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons  — was recently struck down by a judge because it passed in a monster, 1,400-page bill that violated the state Constitution’s requirement that laws are confined to a single subject.
“We cannot become numb to this… There is more we can do,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who represents Annunciation Church. “Everyday people need to be safe doing everyday things.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P1230576-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-28 16:57:15.823673

Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, speaking at a committee hearing on Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Leading Democratic leaders urged Gov. Glenn Youngkin to suspend any further appointments to Virginia’s university governing boards, after a state Senate committee rejected 14 of his appointments on Thursday.
The committee has axed a total of 22 Youngkin appointments, including the ones on Thursday and eight rejected in its June meeting.
Va. lawmakers reject latest Youngkin appointees to university boards

Virginia law grants governors the authority to appoint individuals to approximately 300 public commissions and boards, including ones at institutions of higher learning. However, the governor and Democrats have not seen eye-to-eye on board appointments at several universities, ultimately leading to rejected appointees and an ongoing legal dispute.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected 14 appointments: four for the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), four for the University of Virginia (UVA) and its affiliates and six for George Mason University (GMU). Youngkin made the appointments to fill vacant positions on their respective boards.
Va. governors make board appointments; legislators confirm them. How’s the process work?

“This unprecedented level of rejection reflects not partisan obstruction, but genuine concerns about the qualifications, backgrounds, and intentions of your appointees,” Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, wrote in a letter to Youngkin on Thursday. “The pattern of inappropriate nominations and acquiescence to outside political influence has created significant uncertainty and instability within our higher education system at a time when these institutions need steady, qualified leadership.”
Senate leaders wrote that they have serious concerns regarding his appointments, who they said have introduced additional “controversy” and “division,” and have “abdicated” their responsibilities. They wrote that Virginia’s universities need members who “unite rather than divide,” possess relevant experience in higher education governance, and are committed to protecting academic freedom and institutional integrity.
One of the earlier rejections included former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a former deputy secretary of Homeland Security under President Donald Trump’s first administration. Committee Chair Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, said earlier he could not support Cuccinelli’s board appointment because of his “extreme” position on reproductive rights, his work on Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should be run under Republican control — and his “hateful attacks” on LGBTQ Virginians, factors against Democrats’ ideals.
In response to the committee’s decision on Thursday, Youngkin said its eight Democratic members continued their “partisan campaign to irreparably harm higher education in Virginia” by blocking the appointments. 
“In my view, a single Senate committee does not have the legal authority to perform duties that the Constitution and Code explicitly assign to the full General Assembly,” Youngkin said in a statement Thursday. “This important constitutional question is now before the Supreme Court of Virginia, and I am confident in our position.”
He added that the committee was “damaging” Virginia’s great institutions of higher education and that removing the “talented, experienced, and dedicated” appointees is “an unprecedented” breach of public trust. 
“Even more concerning, they refused to provide Virginians with any explanation for their decision,” he said. “This is blatant partisanship that damages our great universities.”
On June 15, the Senators fought to keep other rejected appointments off the boards by successfully urging a Fairfax County Circuit Court judge to grant a temporary injunction suspending eight gubernatorial appointees from serving on governing boards at GMU, UVA and VMI.
Attorney General Jason Miyares has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
The senators also requested that the governor suspend further appointments until he can have “meaningful consultation” with Senate leadership. 
However, Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, a member of the committee, said that while dialogue is good, he questioned his colleagues’ motives if they continue to reject appointments.

“I think it’s great for everybody to be talking, and they should,” Sturtevant said, but “I don’t know what would come to fruition from those (conversations) if the folks on this committee can’t vote for those individuals, I don’t know who they could vote for.”
During Thursday’s meeting, which wrapped up in under 10 minutes, Republican members expressed concern about the politicization and removal of the appointees, two of whom own a prominent business and served in the General Assembly.
They also questioned why the committee would take up the appointments when the Supreme Court is determining whether eight of the previously rejected appointees can still serve.
“Why would we not wait for the Supreme Court to rule on this?” asked Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach.
Sen. Tara Durant, R-Fredericksburg, added that the committee has “a long list of people who got quite a wealth of experience, and I think the broader question it begs is what will happen in the future to dissuade those who are willing to serve the commonwealth in this capacity, and we can see now that it’s becoming a lot more politicized.” 
The committee voted 6-8, rejecting the resolution to accept the appointments.
“We have a job to do as this committee, not only to protect our colleges and universities, but to make sure that appointees or potential appointees are upholding the values and principles set forth by members of the commonwealth and members of this board,” Rouse said to reporters after the brief meeting.
Youngkin’s term ends in January, after which time Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee, or Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger will take office, giving them the power to make appointments or even terminate them.
Youngkin exercised this option in March when he fired businessman Bert Ellis from UVA’s board, though he did not expand on why. He only stated that “on many occasions” Ellis violated the state’s Code of Conduct for state boards and commissions, and the Board of Visitors’ Statement of Visitor Responsibilities.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders say they’ll obey court orders and redraw the state’s congressional map after a judge earlier this week ruled the map the Utah Legislature last adopted in 2021 was a product of an unconstitutional process. 
But they also made it crystal clear they’re not happy about it. 
“Despite a misguided court ruling and an arbitrary 30-day deadline, the Utah Legislature will defend its constitutional authority and move forward with redrawing the state’s congressional map,” House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a joint statement issued Thursday.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While Adams and Schultz say state attorneys plan to appeal the decision to the Utah Supreme Court, in the meantime they say they’ll follow the order’s timeline. 
“While we will continue to pursue every legal option available — including requesting a stay from the Utah Supreme Court if necessary — we will attempt to redistrict under these unprecedented constraints, consistent with our oath to represent the best interests of Utah,” they said. 
In their statement, Adams and Schultz asserted 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson’s ruling itself was unconstitutional. 
“The court’s order unconstitutionally ties the Legislature’s hands by mandating certain redistricting criteria when the U.S. and Utah constitutions leave it to the people’s representatives in the legislature to redistrict,” Adams and Schultz said. 
The ruling comes as a redistricting arms race is unfolding across the nation as President Donald Trump looks to grow Republicans’ slim majority in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
Utah’s redistricting ruling catches Trump’s ire

For years, Utah’s four U.S. House seats have been reliably Republican, especially after the Utah Legislature went through their last redistricting process in 2021. That year, Utah lawmakers drew their maps after they repealed a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4 and replaced it with SB200, a law that turned the proposition’s independent commission into an advisory body lawmakers could ignore, and they did just that. 
This week, Gibson deemed that repeal and replacement of the Better Boundaries voter initiative unconstitutional, and found that the map lawmakers drew was a result of an unconstitutional process. 
Criticizing that ruling, Utah Republicans argue the Utah Constitution’s plain language requires the Legislature to carry out the task of redistricting. Gibson’s ruling, however, said the term “Legislature” in that provision “does not exclude the legislative power of the people.” 
“Neither the U.S. Constitution nor the Utah Constitution grants sole and exclusive authority over redistricting to the Legislature,” Gibson wrote. “Because legislative power is shared co-equally and co-extensively between the Legislature and the people, and because redistricting is legislative, the people have the fundamental constitution right and authority to propose redistricting legislation that is binding on the Legislature.”
Gibson’s order requires the Legislature to “design and enact a remedial congressional map that complies with the mandatory redistricting standards and requirements originally established under Proposition 4.” 



Let us know what you think...


 


Adams and Schultz said in their statement that they plan to draw a map that has districts that represent both rural and urban voices. That approach indicates they’re reluctant to go with what’s been called a “donut hole” approach, or drawing a map that carves out a district concentrated around the state’s capital of Salt Lake City, the state’s darkest blue Democratic stronghold. 
“We can and will continue to pursue the same goal we have had from the outset — for each member of Congress to represent both urban and rural voices,” Schultz and Adams said. “This model provides a true statewide perspective, ensuring that all Utahns — whether they live in rural towns, suburban neighborhoods or our capital city — have four strong voices in Washington, D.C.”
Adams and Schultz also criticized the tight, 30-day timeline set by Gibson. 
“When we last drew congressional boundaries, the Legislature spent nearly six months traveling the state and holding more than 20 public meetings to gather input,” they said. Now, the court has allowed only 30 days to complete the same complex process, leaving little opportunity for meaningful, statewide public involvement. Even more concerning, after hearing summary judgments in January, the judge waited months to issue a ruling — only to then impose this rushed deadline on the public and the Legislature. Such a timeline is not only unreasonable, it is fundamentally unfair to Utahns.”

This year, comprehensive privacy laws are going into effect in eight states to regulate how businesses handle digital information and to give consumers more protections over their personal data.
The laws in Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Tennessee have taken effect already this year, according to a database from the International Association of Privacy Professionals’ Westin Research Center. Maryland’s privacy law, signed by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore last year, will go into effect Oct. 1.
Privacy laws enacted in Indiana, Kentucky and Rhode Island will go into effect next year.
Several other states are considering comprehensive privacy bills during this year’s legislative sessions. They include Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
When a person visits a website, applies to a job or logs into an online portal, they may be sharing their personal information. Comprehensive privacy laws can apply to a wide range of companies that participate in this kind of data collection.
These laws generally include two types of provisions — those related to consumer rights and those that establish business obligations, according to the association.
Under each of the new laws, consumers have the right to control when and how their data is collected and shared. Some of those provisions include the right to delete data from a company’s database, the ability to opt out of sharing sensitive information and the right to prohibit a company from selling their data.
The new measures also require businesses to ask consumers if they want to opt in to data collection. In some states, businesses are required to complete consumer data risk assessments and identify ways in which discrimination could take place. Some companies also may be required to limit to how consumer data is processed.
In 2018, California became the first state to enact comprehensive privacy legislation for consumers in the state; the law went into effect in 2020. Virginia and Colorado enacted laws in 2021. Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Utah also have comprehensive laws that have taken effect, the database shows.
Other states have passed measures with more specific data protections this year. California, Colorado and Montana, for instance, passed legislation that aims to protect sensitive brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings, KFF Health News reported earlier this year.
One bill under consideration in New York would establish data privacy protections for children. And another measure in Pennsylvania aims to improve consumer data protections with genetic testing companies.
Without comprehensive federal protections, state lawmakers are driving the push to protect consumers from having their personal information shared without their knowledge.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to take another look at a legal challenge related to underground carbon dioxide storage projects – a case that could have long-term effects on carbon pipelines, ethanol producers and power plants. 
The Northwest Landowners Association, a North Dakota group formed to defend property rights, is suing the state of North Dakota and the state Industrial Commission, which approves permits for permanent underground storage of carbon dioxide. 
The association in 2023 sued over a state law that requires landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage beneath their property if 60% of the affected landowners agree to the project, a procedure referred to as amalgamation. The group argues the law is unconstitutional because it allows companies to use private property without letting landowners use the court system to argue for just compensation.
The Supreme Court gave landowners a partial win, reversing a district court judge’s opinion that affects carbon storage, but upholding the judge’s rulings on two other property rights issues.
The outcome of the case could affect the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, which proposes to gather carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in five states and bring it to North Dakota for underground storage. 
Summit, Minnkota Power and Basin Electric Power Cooperative have joined the state in defending the law. The companies have argued that an adverse ruling could prevent the use of carbon capture technology in some cases, threatening North Dakota’s energy industry.
A judge had previously ruled that landowners had missed their window of opportunity to sue. Northeast Judicial District Judge Anthony Swain Benson dismissed the lawsuit last August, ruling that the law passed in 2009 could not be challenged because a statute of limitations had expired. 
But the Supreme Court rejected the procedural objections to the case in Wednesday’s ruling. It now goes back to the district court judge to rule on the merits of the case. 
Derrick Braaten, a Bismarck attorney representing the Northwest Landowners, said the judge could make a ruling based on the arguments he has already heard or could ask for additional information.

Braaten said he was thrilled with the ruling. “It essentially clears all the procedural roadblocks for our primary challenge to the CO2 amalgamation lawsuit to move forward,” Braaten said. Summit declined to comment on the ruling. The Iowa-based company is seeking to use property in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties that has geology that the company says is well-suited for underground storage.  
About 92% of the landowners in the 90,000-acre sequestration area chose to participate in the  Summit project when the Industrial Commission approved the storage permit in December.
Attorney General Drew Wrigley issued a statement, saying the state is prepared to proceed with the case. 
“The state laws in question respect the sanctity of private property rights and constitutionally balance the interests of all parties,” Wrigley said.
In an April hearing before the Supreme Court, attorney Phil Axt, representing the state, said the state should have the authority to regulate a shared resource like pore space. 
He said the case could set a national precedent on the pooling of pore space.
Troy Coons, chair of the Northwest Landowners Association, said Thursday that the lawsuit goes beyond Summit’s pipeline project. 
“Really, Summit isn’t the focus here,” Coons said. “It’s the unconstitutional taking that this piece of legislation did. Nothing to do with saying ‘no’ to Summit. It’s about the law and the constitutionality.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Supreme Court did uphold the district court on two other parts of the landowners lawsuit.
The lower court dismissed the Northwest Landowners’ argument that companies do not have the right to go on to property for the purpose of surveying for a potential project. The Supreme Court in 2024 ruled in Summit’s favor in a separate case on that claim. 
The district court also ruled the landowners lack standing to challenge an underground gas storage law passed in 2021 because regulators have not yet been asked to grant a permit under that statute. 
Braaten said the law’s language is nearly identical to the 2009 law that is specific to carbon dioxide. He said he expects the ruling on the CO2 case to eventually apply to the gas storage law as well. 
While the Summit pipeline has received the permits it needs in North Dakota and Iowa, it still faces hurdles in South Dakota. Minnesota has approved a small portion of the pipeline route and Nebraska has no state permitting authority for carbon pipelines.

(Photos by Dana DiFilippo, Hal Brown, and Amanda Brown)As political violence becomes a growing threat and reality, New Jersey’s election watchdog has moved to officially allow candidates to use campaign money to pay for security services and devices.
The Election Law Enforcement Commission has historically permitted such expenses, but commission members voted earlier this month to propose regulations to codify and standardize the use of campaign funds to bolster security.
Under the proposed regulations, candidates and officeholders could use campaign cash to get bodyguards and other security services and devices, including cybersecurity software, alarm systems, security cameras, motion detectors, locks, lighting, fencing, gates, and doors. They could also use campaign funds to cover those expenses for their immediate family and campaign staff.
The candidate or officeholder would have to demonstrate in writing an ongoing danger or threat, and expenditures would have to be reasonable in cost and address the nature of the threat, according to the commission. They would be expected to discontinue security services and sell security devices that were funded with campaign cash, once they leave office or their campaign ends.
The commission hopes to have the regulations in place by December or January. It’s now accepting public comment and will hold a public hearing Nov. 18 at its Trenton headquarters.
For candidates now campaigning for November’s general election, the commission noted that “reasonable expenditures” for security measures are allowed.
Former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate in the race to replace term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, has not received any threats, his campaign manager said.
“To date, we’ve not experienced any serious, legitimate threats and have not had any dangerous situations in any of our events,” said Eric Arpert, the campaign manager. “We certainly take the safety and security of our candidate, and of the hundreds and hundreds of residents and voters that attend all of our events, seriously.”
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, is running against Ciattarelli. Sean Higgins, her campaign’s communications director, declined to comment.
Threats and harassment against local elected officials are climbing, according to the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University.
More than 250 incidents were reported in the first half of 2025, up 9% from the same period last year, the initiative found. The uptick comes as local officials report that they have taken steps or spent money to strengthen their privacy protections and personal security in response to mounting hostilities.

(Photo by Karsan Turner for Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is offering free training courses on chronic wasting disease in deer for hunters and community members interested in managing, testing for and educating others on the disease. 
The courses will be held over three evenings, one a week, at Iowa State University Extension offices in Marshalltown and Waterloo. Once completed, graduates of the course will be dubbed chronic wasting disease ambassadors and will have the skills to help others in the community manage the disease, which continues to mount. 
Chronic wasting disease is caused by infected prions, which are naturally occurring proteins in the body, and is fatal to deer and elk. Over time, the infected prions damage neural and lymphatic tissues in the deer, though it can take between 18 and 36 months for clinical signs to appear in the deer.

This is why DNR has stressed the importance of testing deer for the disease if hunters plan on eating their game. While the disease has never been reported in humans, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said ingesting infected meat would be the most likely way a human could contract the disease. 
The disease, which was first detected in Iowa in 2013, spreads across deer populations through bodily fluids, like saliva. These prions can persist for several years after they are shed, which means the disease can be prevalent even in areas without dense deer populations. 
Each year, the DNR tracks the number of infected deer from deer samples submitted by hunters. 
In 2024, DNR reported 136 wild deer with the disease. Since 2013 when the first case was reported, there have been more than 520 reported cases in 29 counties.

To manage and monitor the disease, DNR has been testing for the disease and has established deer management zones and chronic wasting disease zones that have additional hunting tags and management practices in place to help control the populations. 
The ambassadors learn the scientific management practices for the disease, including sampling, diagnosis and communication skills to help other members of the community. 
The DNR partnered with Iowa State University Extension and Outreach for the ambassador program, which runs through the middle of September. Participants have two online modules plus three in-person courses that last 1.5-2 hours and include dinner. 
Jordan Koos, a Decorah deer hunter who took the course in 2021, said in a press release with DNR that he “learned a lot” from the program and didn’t realize how widespread the disease was. 
Hunters, non-hunters and “anyone interested in white-tailed deer conservation and management” can register online for the classes, which will have between 12 and 25 participants each.
The Waterloo classes will be held on Sept. 2, 9 and 16, from 6-8 p.m. at the Black Hawk County Extension office, 3420 University Ave. # B. 
The Marshalltown course will be offered Sept. 3, 10 and 17, from 6-8 p.m. at the Marshall County Extension office, 2608 S 2nd St., in Marshalltown.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryRepublican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears expressed strong opposition to a series of LGBTQ+ rights in a candidate questionnaire completed when she unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2004. She responded “yes” to questions about whether she would vote to block same-sex couples from adopting children and oppose workplace protections for gay people, and she indicated that she believed homosexuality is an “immoral lifestyle choice.”
The survey was conducted by Public Advocate of the United States, a conservative nonprofit organization that has advocated against same-sex marriage and in favor of laws that oppose abortion, reduce federal spending, and support “faith-based initiatives.”
Earle-Sears has often spoken about her Christian faith, of which some sectors do not support LGBTQ+ identities.
The Mercury reached out to Earle-Sears’ campaign to inquire if any of her stances had evolved in the decades since the survey, formatted for “yes” or “no” responses, or if she would like to elaborate further on her answers to it. Her campaign could not be reached for an interview or statement by the time of this publication. 
Earlier this year in the Virginia legislature, Earle-Sears left a handwritten note on her signature of an anti-discrimination marriage bill that would protect same-sex unions, saying she was “morally opposed” to it. As the current lieutenant governor, she is obligated to sign bills that pass the legislature but chose to add the note. 
Earle-Sears’ apparent opposition to LGBTQ+ rights also seems ill-matched with one of her running mates’ candidacy and identity.

She didn’t mention Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid, Virginia’s first openly gay statewide candidate, at public campaign events for months until the two appeared at an event in July with Attorney General Jason Miyares. A June phone call between Earle-Sears and Reid reported by National Review this month highlighted earlier tensions behind the scenes, when the lieutenant governor “repeatedly dodged Reid’s questions” and  “expressed her own distrust” of him.
Reid, whose campaign did not follow through on an interview request for this story, has spoken publicly about Earle-Sears since launching his campaign and vowed support for her election. The two recently appeared together in a video they posted to social media where he said he was excited about their campaigns. 
“It’s going to be hard to fill your shoes, or high heels as the case may be,” he said to her with a grin. He then praised her and Miyares’ roles in Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration. 
At that point,  Earle-Sears turned to the camera and emphasized how the trio would keep Virginia the “best place to live, work and raise a family” — a common refrain from Youngkin. 
Pending this fall’s election results, Earle-Sears and Reid may have to put any personal differences aside in order to work together as top officials in the state — from signaling legislative priorities to state lawmakers to agreeing on state budget priorities. Governors have the final say on the state budget, but lieutenant governors preside over the state senate and can cast tie-breaking votes on critical issues.
The backdrop of both their campaigns is an in-progress effort to enshrine marriage protections in the state’s constitution, as now-defunct language inserted in 2006 bans same-sex marriages. While the executive branch does not formally contribute to constitutional amendments, if the proposal to remove the defunct ban passes the legislature next year and successfully clears a statewide ballot referendum by voters, Virginia would protect gay marriage. Advocates for the amendment stress its importance as the U.S. Supreme Court could consider undoing a decade-old ruling that federally protects such unions.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Environmental and community groups from Iowa sent a letter Thursday to the state’s congressional delegation urging them to oppose a House bill that would “gut critical clean water protections.” 
The groups in the letter say Iowa is “on the frontlines of a drinking water emergency” and the changes the bill plans to make to the Clean Water Act would exacerbate the problems in Iowa. 
The Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today, or PERMIT, Act seeks to “limit the scope “of the Clean Water Act, which has been in place since 1972. 
The bill would redefine navigable waters, the waters which the act applies, to exclude: waste treatment systems, waters that flow only after precipitation, prior converted cropland, groundwater and “any other features” the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determine should be excluded. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter in opposition, signed by Environmental Law & Policy Center, Food & Water Watch, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and 11 other organizations, said the act would lead to more waterways unsafe for recreation, higher water treatment costs, more “dead zones” in rivers and lakes and more “harmful pesticides, PFAS, and other forever toxic chemicals” in waterways. 
Patricia Fuller, an Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement member from Council Bluffs, said in a statement “now is not the time to make our waterways more vulnerable.” 
“We cannot continue to play politics when it comes to our impaired waters affecting our health, especially since we have the second highest rate of cancer in the nation,” Fuller said. “Iowa’s Congressional delegation should protect Iowa waters and vote no on weakening clean water protections.” 
The letter was addressed to U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn. 
A spokesperson for Hinson said the representative was supportive of the PERMIT Act and other bills that get government out of the way of infrastructure projects in the state. 
Hinson has supported bills that would expand access to precision agriculture technology and preserve the Driftless area in Iowa, which the spokesperson said would improve drinking water quality in Iowa. 
The other representatives did not respond to requests for comment. 
The letter noted Iowa waterways have had repeatedly high nitrate concentrations, sometimes as much as double the amount permissible under federal safe drinking water standards. 
Municipal utilities in the state that rely on Iowa rivers for their drinking water have been faced with mounting costs to remove the contaminants from finished water supplies. In Des Moines, this led to about two months where residents were not allowed to water their lawns in order to lower demand on the system as it worked to remove nitrates from the water. 
Matt Ohloff, policy advocate at the Environmental Law & Policy Center said the PERMIT Act would “make Iowa’s already challenging water issues worse.” 
“This legislation is the most dangerous, misguided weakening of the Clean Water Act that Congress has considered in decades,” Ohloff said in a press release. “The PERMIT Act would dramatically narrow Clean Water Act protections that Iowans have relied upon for more than 50 years to safeguard Iowa’s rivers and lakes.” 
The PERMIT Act follows a series of attempts to reform the waters under the protection of the Clean Water Act. The waters of the United States, as these applicable waters are often referred to, have also been the subject of several lawsuits. Most recently, the Supreme Court overturned the EPA’s definition of wetlands, as they relate to the Clean Water Act protections. 
The letter said the Supreme Court’s decision has already “narrowed” the definition of protected waters. 
“We should be doing more to safeguard Iowa’s waterways and our health,” the letter said. “Instead, the PERMIT Act puts polluters ahead of our communities and clean water.” 
Deaconess Irene DeMaris, the executive director of Iowa Faith & Climate Network which also signed the letter, said “clean water is not optional.” 
“It is essential to life, a gift of our planet, and a moral responsibility,” DeMaris said in a press release. “People of diverse faith and spirituality across Iowa are calling on Congress to reject this dangerous bill and instead strengthen protections for the rivers, lakes, and streams that sustain our families, communities, farmers, and future generations.” 
The Republican-led bill is sponsored by U.S. Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., and co-sponsored by Republican representatives from Missouri, California, North Carolina, Colorado, Utah, Minnesota, Arkansas and Ohio. 
A press release from the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure about its approval of the bill, said the bill “cuts red tape, streamlines reviews, and provides greater regulatory certainty.” 
Collins, who also chaired a subcommittee for the bill, said the bill provides “much needed reform” to the Clean Water Act that “will overhaul permitting processes and reduce burdens on permit seekers.” 
“As we enter a new era with a renewed focus on domestic energy production and growth, this legislation delivers the tools that our country needs to build faster, smarter, and safer,” Collins said in the release. 
The bill is on the House’s Union Calendar to be voted on, and members of Congress will return to DC next week. 
Additional groups that signed the letter in opposition to the bill: Des Moines County Farmers and Neighbors, for Optimal Health, Iowa Alliance for Responsible Agriculture, Iowa Environmental Council, Iowa Groundwater Association, Iowa Wildlife Federation, Jefferson County Farmers and Neighbors, Panora Conservation Chapter Izaak Walton League, Poweshiek CARES, Progress Iowa and Raccoon River Watershed Association.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Breakthrough T1D)Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said the Trump administration’s firing of the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Susan Monarez late Wednesday warrants congressional oversight, echoing bipartisan leaders of the Senate committee dealing with health policy.
“While I recognize that the CDC Director serves at the pleasure of the President, I am alarmed that she has been fired after only three weeks on the job,” Collins said in a statement.
Monarez reportedly refused to sign off on changes to vaccines or the firing of other agency leaders from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s hand-picked panel of vaccine advisers before she was ousted on Wednesday via a social media post made by HHS, which oversees the CDC. Earlier that day, Kennedy announced that the Food and Drug Administration restricted eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines.
When asked whether she stands by her vote to confirm Kennedy, Collins told Maine Morning Star that she doesn’t expect to agree with any cabinet official’s decisions all of the time, regardless of party.
“I do not agree with Secretary Kennedy’s approach to the vaccine advisory committee,” Collins said, referring to Kennedy ousting the entire 17-person committee who he replaced with his own picks, which she said “is likely to weaken the independent and professional recommendations of the committee.”
“But, I do believe that he has some valid points about ultra-processed foods and their impact on obesity and the health of many Americans,” Collins added.
US Senate health leaders committee question CDC tumult

The Maine Democratic Party was quick to accuse Collins of hypocrisy. 
“RFK Jr.’s crusade to undermine science and American health was well-documented and his anti-vaccine, anti-science views have been clear for years – and yet Collins voted to confirm him anyway,” spokesperson Tommy Garcia said in a statement Thursday. “Now, her false outrage at his partisan firings at the CDC is falling flat to Mainers who will hold her responsible for supporting him.”
Collins voted to confirm Monarez, who was sworn in as director on July 31. The senator called Monarez “a highly capable scientist who brought a wealth of experience to the agency.”
Collins also raised alarm about the resignations of other senior CDC officials, allegedly in protest of Kennedy’s broader policy moves.
“Her departure has triggered the immediate resignation of four long-time experts at the agency, who will not be easily replaced, and who are respected worldwide,” Collins said. 
Collins said she spoke with Monarez Wednesday night and agreed with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy — chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, who posted on social media that the firing “will require oversight by the HELP Committee.” Cassidy also voted to confirm both Monarez and Kennedy, the latter after Kennedy made several assurances to him about maintaining vaccine policy.
Hours after HHS wrote on social media that Monarez was no longer running the CDC, her attorneys posted that she hadn’t been fired or resigned, but didn’t announce whether they plan to sue the Trump administration. 
“When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda,” Mark S. Zaid and Abbe David Lowell wrote. “For that, she has been targeted. Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing that Trump had every right to fire Monarez and that he expects to pick a new nominee “very soon.”
“Her lawyers’ statement made it abundantly clear themselves that she was not aligned with the president’s mission to make America healthy again,” Leavitt said. 
Monarez was President Donald Trump’s second choice for CDC director. He originally selected former Florida U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon to run the CDC shortly after he secured election to the Oval Office in November. But the White House pulled Weldon’s nomination in March, after it appeared he couldn’t secure the votes needed for confirmation.

Mike Bohacek pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drunken driving charge under a plea agreement approved Wednesday by a LaPorte County judge.
Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, admitted to operating a vehicle with an alcohol concentration equivalent of .15 or more, a Class A misdemeanor, according to the agreement obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
In exchange, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the remaining charges filed against him.

Bohacek did not reply to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment about the plea deal.
The state senator was initially charged with three counts: operating a vehicle with an alcohol concentration equivalent of .15 or more, a Class A misdemeanor; operating a vehicle while intoxicated in a manner that endangered a person, also a Class A misdemeanor; and operating a vehicle while intoxicated, a Class C misdemeanor.
The deal calls for Bohacek to pay $110.50 in fines, $189.50 in court costs, and $200 for countermeasure fees. He was also ordered to complete a substance abuse evaluation and participate in therapy through the LaPorte County Alcohol and Drug Services program, known as LADS.
Although special Judge Jeffrey L. Thode of the Superior Court in neighboring Porter County imposed a 365-day jail sentence but it was fully suspended. Bohacek will instead serve 365 days of informal probation, per the plea agreement. A license suspension will be determined separately by the court at his sentencing. 
While charges were pending, Bohacek was allowed to keep driving so long as he used an alcohol-monitoring device in his car.
The underlying charges, filed May 15, stemmed from a Jan. 24 incident in Michigan City, after a citizen reported seeing Bohacek “drinking an open container and stumble out of his vehicle” in a Panda Express parking lot, according to charging documents obtained by the Capital Chronicle.

Police later located and pulled him over near Swan Lake Cemetery along U.S. 20. He was taken to a hospital, where a blood test revealed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.28% — more than three times the legal limit in Indiana.
But Bohacek wasn’t arrested at the time. Under Indiana law, members of the General Assembly are shielded from arrest in most cases during the legislative session — a protection known as legislative immunity.
That meant Bohacek’s case was kept sealed and the senator remained uncharged for months.
The incident did not become public until June, when reporters began asking for details.
In the weeks and months following his arrest, Bohacek continued to attend legislative meetings at the Indiana Statehouse.
Bohacek, who represents portions of LaPorte, St. Joseph and Starke counties, has served in the Indiana Senate since 2016. He most recently served on the Corrections and Criminal Law, Health and Provider Services, and Local Government committees.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Board of Corrections unanimously approved a request from Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders at a special-called meeting Thursday to reallocate 100 beds at the Central Arkansas Community Corrections Center for a recidivism reduction pilot program.
Sanders’ chief legal advisor, Cortney Kennedy, pitched the program to the board during its regular meeting earlier this month. At that meeting, the board voted to explore possible locations to host the program.
During Thursday’s meeting, Kennedy said it was likely they wouldn’t use all 100 beds, as she expected some people participating in the pilot would already be at the corrections center.
Kennedy told the board earlier this month that the program will take a whole-of-government approach to tackling recidivism by helping inmates within six months of release find stable housing, work and opportunities for community integration and engagement. The program will also involve community and faith organizations and the private sector.
Arkansas corrections board green lights governor’s recidivism reduction program

Board Chairman Benny Magness said programs like the one proposed by the governor’s office are crucial in reducing the stigma faced by many inmates once they leave custody. He described a phone call he received from a man who was mentoring a recently released inmate. Magness said the former inmate was filling out a job application when someone announced over a loudspeaker that “anybody that was a felon” would not be hired and not to bother filling out the application.
“So he laid [the application] down and went back out,” Magness said. “And this gentleman, a former inmate, has really tried to stay on the straight and narrow, being mentored by a leading citizen of Baxter County, and it was just disheartening for him.”
Magness said he hopes programs like the one proposed by the governor’s office, and others like it, will help “start turning industry around” to being more accepting of former inmates.
“These people have to have jobs,” Magness said.
In Arkansas, the recidivism rate is the proportion of people who are convicted of a crime that are subsequently reincarcerated within three years of being released from custody.  People can be reincarcerated for committing a new crime or having parole revoked for technical, non-criminal violations of their conditions of release.
“This pilot program will address many of the issues that cause former inmates to recommit, like lack of housing, employment, and substance abuse treatment,” Sanders said in a press release earlier this month. “Ultimately, we want to expand this program statewide to lower Arkansas’ recidivism rate and prepare inmates for a healthy, well-adjusted life outside prison.”
The recidivism rate in Arkansas has remained flat over the last 17 years and is one of the worst in the U.S. The most recent data places the state’s recidivism at 49.6%.
Addressing the statistic has become a focus for some Arkansas policymakers. The Arkansas Protect Act of 2023 created a recidivism reduction task force, state lawmakers approved recidivism reduction bills during the 2025 session and debates among BOC members about how to best prepare outgoing inmates to rejoin society have remained ongoing.

Smith in Apalachicola on August 28, 2025.Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and a group of law enforcement officials on Thursday announced the arrest of six men as part of “Operation Summer Hurricane,” a multi-agency operation targeting online child predators in North Florida.
Two other individuals are being actively sought.
Uthmeier made the announcement in Apalachicola, in Franklin County. It’s a historic small town in the Panhandle located between Tallahassee and Panama City, perhaps known best for its oysters. Law enforcement officials said that such rural areas are known to child predators as “safer” places to hunt kids, but no longer.
“There is a perception in the pedophile community that if you want to see kids online that there are safe places to do so and there are places that are not so safe,” said Albert Willis, assistant agent in charge at the FDLE Tallahassee Regional Operations Center. Previous law enforcement stings have been held in more metropolitan areas of the state such as Tampa or Tallahassee, he said.
“We are setting a standard that the places you typically thought were okay to hunt kids, or solicit kids online, that is no longer the case,” Willis added.
“If you thought you were safe trying to solicit a child online in a place like Eastpoint or Apalachicola because your mind says that there’s not a big law enforcement presence there, it may not be a large, sophisticated agency, so it’s safer — we’re breaking that mold with this op[eration], and this will be the first of many more planned across the state … because the internet doesn’t care where you are and it provides these offenders a pathway to offend anywhere so we’ve had to adjust, and we’ve made that adjustment.”
The sting operation took place between July 10 and 12 and included a dozen state, local, and federal agencies, according to a press release issued by the attorney general’s office. That release said that a Homeland Security Investigations officer interviewed one of the men and learned that he is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico and placed a deportation detainer on him.
That arrest should dispel what he called “the narrative” that most undocumented immigrants in the U.S. are actually peaceful individuals just trying to provide for their families, Uthmeier said.
“So, you hear the left, you hear the media try to spin the narrative, that people are just here wanting to pursue a good living. An honest living. And then, every time we do one of these stings, we end up pulling illegal aliens off the streets that are trying to molest and prey upon our kids,” he said. “So, no. It is not just people that are here wanting to work hard and raise a family. There are people here that have illicit motives that want to hurt our children.”
The Phoenix reported last month while the Trump administration’s push for mass deportations has led to a 31% increase in Florida of arrests of people with criminal convictions between May and June, the biggest jump, 86%, was of people without previous convictions or charges.

The Des Moines private university announced Thursday in a news release the launch of the Drake Stadium Centennial Campaign, which will raise funds for renovations to different aspects of the space, including its track, technology and more. The campaign received a $600,000 grant from Prairie Meadows this summer for the updates.
“Drake Stadium is a place where legends compete and communities gather,” said Gary Palmer, president and CEO of Prairie Meadows. “We are proud to support its next chapter and help keep the Blue Oval shining bright.”

Both the track and field surfaces of the stadium are scheduled for replacement under the campaign, the release stated, as well as upgrades to lighting and the video and score boards. The release stated the campaign will also put donations toward updating the stadium press box and adding “two reversible long jump/triple jump and pole vault runways.”
Funds from the campaign will also go toward construction of a “permanent hospitality space” for guests coming to the university for events hosted at the stadium. According to the release, these enhancements will ensure the stadium meets different competition and broadcast standards and improves guest experiences.
First opened in 1925, the release stated the stadium hasn’t seen renovations since 2006. In addition to the annual track and field event the Drake Relays, the stadium has hosted multiple USA Track and Field Championships, NCAA Outdoor Championships and AAU Junior Olympics. It is also home to the Iowa High School Track and Field Championships, Drake football and other community events.
“Drake Stadium is more than just a facility—it’s a century of memories, records, and community pride,” Drake University President Marty Martin said in the release. “With the support of partners like Prairie Meadows and the commitment of our alumni and fans, we’re building the next 100 years of greatness.”

This story was updated at 3:55 p.m.
Gov. Phil Scott’s new return-to-office plan for state employees will require a minimum of three days in the office starting Dec. 1.
Secretary of Administration Sarah Clark announced the decision in a message to all state employees Thursday afternoon. 
“We know there is no path that will make everyone happy. But a consistent, predictable hybrid schedule will bring balance. It will increase interaction among — and across — teams, departments, and agencies,” Clark wrote. “And it will result in more effective collaboration, communication and connection among us, and the Vermonters we serve.”
Scott first hinted at the return-to-office initiative earlier this month. The Vermont State Employees’ Association has strongly opposed the move, saying hundreds of state workers have voiced their concerns. 
“The top down, managers-know-all approach is an abject failure when it comes to supporting your staff and the morale of staff,” Steve Howard, executive director of the state employees’ union, told VTDigger Thursday. 
In her message, Clark wrote the “decision to continue a hybrid approach — rather than a full return to in-office work — reflects employee feedback on the value of remote options.”
A group of state government officials, led by Doug Farnham, Vermont’s Chief Recovery Officer, will provide recommendations on how to minimize disruptions caused by the policy change, according to Clark. She said the state would seek further input from employees and union representatives “so we can identify potential opportunities to assist employees through this change.”

Still, most metrics did not meet pre-pandemic levels.
The state Department of Education reported improved scores in English language arts, science and math “Smarter Balanced” tests. According to state officials, Thursday’s results marked the first time since that test was introduced in 2014 that Connecticut students saw improvement across all subject areas simultaneously. All categories measured — including racial and ethnic groups, grade levels and special needs students — saw an improvement in scores.
“It is worth celebrating your hard work and what is happening in our classrooms every day,” said state Department of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker. “These results are no accident.” 
Most improvements over the previous year were incremental — measuring one percentage point or less. In nearly all cases, the scores also fell short of pre-pandemic levels, though many groups are now within one or two percentage points of previous scores. The average score across all students for English language arts was 64.7 compared to 67.7 in 2019, 61.1 in math compared to 63.1 in 2019, and 62.6 in science compared to 63.8 in 2019. The state target for all three areas is 75.
Chronic absenteeism also improved across nearly every group measured over the previous year’s cohort. The most significant improvement occurred among kindergarteners, whose rate of absenteeism dropped from 18.5% to 16.3%. The state reported that high school students had the highest rates of absenteeism, while grades three and four had the lowest rates of absenteeism.
The state Department of Education’s chief performance officer Ajit Gopalakrishnan said that the pandemic had been a significant disruption with impacts of learning and that extra work is still being put in by educators and administrators to recover from the negative effects. But he said that the positive improvements across groups and subject areas was “a sign that our collective efforts are really making a difference.”
The data, while positive, reflected persistent gaps between white children and children of color, in particular Black children. There were gaps of more than 20 percentage points in math and science scores between white children and Black children. Those gaps, as well as the gap in scores for English language arts, have grown larger since 2019.
Kari Sullivan Custer, the state lead for attendance and engagement, said at a press conference held on Thursday that since the 2021-22 school year, chronic absenteeism declined by an average of 6.5% across all students, and 9.2% among students with high needs. Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing 10% of school days. Since the school year is a minimum of 180 days per year in Connecticut, that equates to around 18 days in most districts. According to the state officials, 83,405 students were still chronically absent during the 2024-25 school year.
“These improvements demonstrate that our collective efforts are working statewide,” Sullivan Custer said.
Leaders of four school districts joined the state Board of Education at the press conference to discuss the strategies they had deployed to achieve positive results. East Windsor leadership said that a five-year strategic plan including objectives for literacy and family outreach has been instrumental in improved scores, the result of stronger instruction and more engaged families. Timothy Field, principal of East Windsor Middle School, also discussed the ways that approaches to education have shifted for children in grades 5 through 8.
“One key area of emphasis has been student to student discourse,” Field said, where students engage in meaningful conversations rather than having those discussions led by the teacher.
Officials also said that the Learner Engagement and Attendance Program, or LEAP, which uses home visits to try and identify why students are missing school and how families can be better supported, has been instrumental for gains on chronic absenteeism.
“During COVID and for the year or two after, we found it was very confusing for families to know when to send their child to school and when to keep them home,” Sullivan Custer said. 
Post-pandemic, the ‘School is better with you!’ campaign has also pushed the message that students should come to school even if they have light cold symptoms, as long as they aren’t seriously ill, Sullivan Custer said. School nurses have also become key figures in ensuring that persistent confusion about when to come to school doesn’t result in chronic absenteeism.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024_0123_SR_RighttoRead_071-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-28 15:57:55.910973

(Photo provided by The Muscogee (Creek) Nation - Department Of Health via KOSU)Muscogee Nation Principal Chief David Hill issued an executive order on Thursday, pausing the issuance of new citizenship cards in the wake of a tribal court’s ruling requiring the nation to grant citizenship to the descendants of Freedmen.


The Muscogee Nation Supreme Court issued the historic ruling last month. The justices rejected the tribe’s “by blood” language for citizenship requirements, which is noted in the tribal nation’s 1979 constitution. The court cited the Treaty of 1866, which ensured those who were enslaved by Muscogees should “enjoy all the rights and privileges of Native citizens.”
The ruling has been praised by descendants of Freedmen, who have been fighting for citizenship for years. However, tribal leaders said the ruling “does not appear to provide the clarity our Nation needed.”
In response, Hill issued the executive order. He argues that the Supreme Court overstepped its authority by rejecting the tribe’s “by blood” language in its Constitution. He wrote that the Tribal Council must approve new laws and potentially amend the Constitution – with the help of a citizen vote – to remove the specified language. Therefore, he’s pausing citizenship.
“My responsibility as Principal Chief is to preserve stability and ensure we move forward in a careful and lawful way,” Hill said in a statement. “Even when another branch oversteps, it is my duty to keep our government steady, to avoid disruption, and to protect the integrity of our Nation’s institutions.”
The tribe’s citizenship office is directed to continue accepting applications from Freedmen applicants. However, they are not to issue any membership cards to them “until our laws and policies are updated to reflect the Court’s ruling and to ensure that the processing of all applications will be completed in a fair, objective, and timely manner,” Hill wrote in a statement.
Muscogee Nation citizen and Freedman descendant Eli Grayson called Hill’s executive order “hypocritical.”
“You’re telling Governor (Kevin) Stitt to respect the rights of the reservations and all the… criminal aspects of McGirt and all that stuff,” Grayson said in reference to recent arguments about tribal sovereignty surrounding the McGirt v. Oklahoma decision. “But then when your own Supreme Court rules on something that you don’t like because of your own racial feelings, then you know, you’re a hypocrite.”
He said the Muscogee Nation granting citizenship to the Freedmen is overdue, pointing to the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which granted citizenship to people who were formerly enslaved in the country.
“Why shouldn’t we?” He said. “We’re in the same situation.”

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”

Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.

Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.

Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.

“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”

California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) An Iowa nursing home administrator who also worked briefly for the state agency that inspects nursing homes has agreed to surrender her license after being accused of stealing hundreds of patient medications.
According to state records, nursing home administrator Cassandra Strube of LeClaire recently agreed to surrender her license after being criminally convicted of stealing drugs from two of the Iowa care facilities where she worked.
The Iowa Nursing Home Administrators Board alleged that in 2022 Strube was serving as the administrator for Aspire of Pleasant Valley and Atrium Village Nursing Home in Hills when she took the emergency drug kit from the Pleasant Valley home and stole 60 hydrocodone pills.
Four months later, she allegedly stole oxycodone and hydrocodone from Atrium Village’s emergency drug kit. Several days after that, she was allegedly found to be in possession of OxyContin and more than 500 tramadol pills for which she had no valid prescription.
According to state records, Strube pled guilty last year to acquiring and attempting to acquire controlled substances by misrepresentation, fraud, deception, or subterfuge.
As part of its order dealing with Strube’s voluntary surrender of her license, the Iowa Nursing Home Administrators Board has stipulated that Strube can apply for reinstatement of her license in one year.
Strube worked briefly for inspections department 
In addition to her work as a nursing home administrator, Strube worked for the state agency that inspects nursing homes, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, from Aug. 19, 2022, to Sept. 6, 2022, after being hired as a health facilities officer.
The department has said that Strube was in training and orientation at that time and that she exercised “no oversight of facilities or interaction with residents, and was released from employment after less than three weeks.”
The drug thefts first became public in 2023 when the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported on Strube’s unemployment-benefits hearing. Evidence at that hearing indicated Strube had been fired from Atrium Village for the willful destruction of the employer’s property, the unauthorized removal of the employer’s property, and the misuse of drugs.
Strube had been living in the care facility in what was called a “guest room.” According to testimony from Atrium Village officials at the unemployment hearing, Strube was working the night of Nov. 29, 2022, when she obtained from the on-duty charge nurse a set of keys to access her guest room, which was locked. The set included a master key that could unlock the area where the facility stores the emergency medication kit, which included drugs for resident use. Strube returned the keys to the nurse a short time later.
The next day, according to the testimony, a nurse arrived for work and found Strube walking about outside, saying she was locked out of the building. At the time, Strube was allegedly incoherent, appeared to be cold, had no coat or shoes, was missing one sock and her foot was bleeding. After Strube indicated she had taken some kind of medication, paramedics were summoned, and a nurse went to Strube’s room to gather the administrator’s medications.
The nurse allegedly found the room in a disheveled state, with many loose pills on the floor, according to the Atrium officials’ testimony. The nurse also reported finding an open box that contained pills and observed bottles of pills on the windowsill. After collecting the pill bottles and giving them to paramedics, the nurse went to Strube’s office to find her emergency-contact information.
In the office, she found a sock on the floor and saw the window was left open. In addition, the phones were knocked off the hook, a plant had been torn apart, and various items were thrown about on the desk and scattered on the floor, according to the unemployment case testimony.
After being notified of the situation, the facility’s board of directors contacted the Johnson County Sheriff’s Department, which launched an investigation and confirmed drugs were missing from the residents’ supply.
Strube allegedly told investigators a stranger had attacked her in the facility and she had blacked out.
Strube had previously worked at the Anamosa Care Center, Trinity Senior Living Communities, Ruthven Community Care Center and other Iowa facilities.



Correctionville administrator faces charges 
The Iowa Nursing Home Administrators Board has charged Amanda Nobles of Holstein with violating a state or federal regulation, rule, or law of this or any other state that relates to the practice of the profession.
The board has not disclosed the nature of the alleged misconduct that gave rise to the charge, but has indicated it occurred while she was employed as a nursing home administrator working in Correctionville and Dunlap.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Oct. 13, 2025. Nobles has been an Iowa-licensed nursing home administrator since Aug. 12, 2009.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DIAL-NURSING-HOME.jpg,,,2025-08-28 14:57:01.398627

For many families of trans loved ones, the fear is not just that medically proven health care is being withdrawn. It’s also that a White House that has been openly hostile to transgender people may seek legal persecution.
One organization that is seeking to provide comfort, information and resources is Michigan-based Stand With Trans. Michigan Advance spoke with Daily Andrews, the group’s director of clinical services, about fallout from the decision. 
What follows is a conversation that has been edited for length and clarity. Advance questions are in bold, and Andrews’ responses are in regular type.
 
How are your clients reacting to the decision by the University of Michigan and what steps are they taking to try and deal with it? 
I think a lot of families are panicked and are very anxious, and I actually think a good representation is the Trevor Project, which put out a survey a year ago. One of the questions was, “How many youth have been affected by political or policy making in their state, and has that caused an increase in depression and anxiety?” I think it was about 90% had been impacted by these policies in a negative way. 
 From Trevor Project’s 2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People
I see that on an individual level with the clients that I serve. I have several families where they’ve been with [The University of Michigan gender clinic] since forever. I have a kid that socially transitioned when she was 5 and now is 16 and so it feels so close to the finish line, and it feels like the rug has been pulled out.
I think that the internalization that people feel is, “Well, people don’t care about me. They don’t care about my dignity. They don’t care about my health. They don’t care if I live, they don’t care if I die, so why does it matter? Why does my life matter?”
How do you talk a 16-year-old off the ledge when it is very clear that the government around them doesn’t care and keeps trying to strip them of their rights? It’s very sad, but there’s a lot of people fighting and it’s not hopeless. I do think that there is a lot of hope. I do think that there is a lot of change that is trying to be made, but in this moment, it just is hard I would say. 
 
For the broader public, the idea that gender-affirming care is life-saving is largely either misunderstood or just disbelieved, and many have bought into the notion that gender-affirming care is cosmetic in nature.
Yes, that is absolutely 100% true. I do think there’s lots of misinformation, and I think it also should be stated that gender-affirming care is not just medical care. There are some levels of affirmation, and gender-affirming that comes from social transition or the clothes you wear or the therapist you can have or the name you have or someone respecting your pronouns or your family finally acknowledging your pronouns. All of that is care and I think that gender-affirming care is just seeing someone as they are. 
I do think gender-affirming care has gotten a bad reputation, because also a lot of times people hear about surgery, where most of the time it’s very, very, very, rare for someone under the age of 19 to get surgery. I’m not going to say that it doesn’t happen, but I do think it is very rare and that that part is misunderstood, that people are just chopping off body parts and all of these extremes where that’s actually not true most of the time. It is very small, again a name change, a haircut, a different style, things that are also very typical for youth and sometimes adults, too, that we go through, you know, different things where we are trying to find who we are.
 
The University of Michigan made this decision after being sent a subpoena by the Department of Justice, looking for medical records, including names and medical procedures. The federal government wants personal, private medical information, and while today they’re going after trans individuals’ medical records, doesn’t it open a door that maybe next they’re going to go after someone else’s records for some other reason? 
Absolutely. I think that any type of infringement on your rights or pushing the boundaries of what the federal government can or cannot do will always be nerve-racking and a little bit scary. I think this comes back to when people were really scared in Texas when they were trying to remove kids from the care and put them in child welfare or foster homes if they caught the parents doing any type of gender affirming care and there was a panic of, “Am I on the list? Is there a list somewhere?” Sometimes it’s a little bit paranoid, but I think sometimes in moments like this where it feels very valid. It’s a slippery slope. It’s not just about trans health care, this is about all of us and the access and the rights that we have as individuals and as American citizens to have privacy, and that is definitely being infringed on.

I understand Stand with Trans is putting together a list of resources for families? 
Yes. We have started to build some resources and some other referrals of places that are known in Michigan, in the Midwest, that at least today are still taking patients.
 
If people have questions and they would like to find out if there’s a resource they can turn to, should they just call your hotline? 
Stand with Trans does have a hotline number (833-HELPSWT or 833-435-7798) where people can call, and it is staffed 24/7 by volunteers. We also have an info email (info@standwithtrans.org) that people can email and that is checked regularly. 
People can also join our support groups. There are still support groups for both young adults to use and parents and caregivers.
We also have our mental health care that we do and we still are taking patients, so if someone is maybe needing more individualized care or family therapy, then we can see them as well for that.

Patrick Morrisey speaks at the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce’s 2025 Business Summit at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, on Thursday, Aug. 28, 2025. (Photo by Alex Wilson/The WV Chamber of Commerce)WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — On the heels of terrible jobs data in West Virginia, Gov. Patrick Morrisey told the state’s business leaders he’s focused on cutting government red tape in an effort to boost the economy and move the state forward. 
“West Virginia will be positively affected within just a few months. We’re already seeing this transformative strategy take root and it will bear fruit,” Morrisey said. 
It was the first time the governor addressed the state’s leaders in business, higher education and health care along with lawmakers at the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce’s annual Business Summit. It is being held at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. 
Just last week, the chamber raised concerns about WorkForce West Virginia data that showed the state’s labor force and overall employment have declined consecutively for 14 months. 
In the last year, West Virginia lost more than 4,000 jobs and 7,600 people from the workforce. Employment opportunities in manufacturing have fallen by a dramatic number in the last few decades, the chamber said in a news release. 
Previous governor Jim Justice, a coal company owner and businessman prior to politics, announced a string of big business investments in West Virginia during his tenure. Justice, now a U.S. senator, gave millions in taxpayer dollars to Nucor Steel on top of the initial $315 million mentioned in 2022 to build a plant in Mason County.
At last year’s Business Summit, Justice announced a $35 million investment in an Upshur County manufacturing facility for Prime 6, a maker of charcoal and wood grilling logs that was featured on the television show, “Shark Tank.” Prime 6 received a $10 million forgivable High Impact Development Project Performance Loan from the state’s Economic Development Authority, according to public records.  
While Justice and Morrisey — both Republicans — overlap on their business and energy investment focuses, the current governor is heavily focused on addressing regulatory barriers in the state. And Morrisey doesn’t want to lure businesses to the state through financial incentives. 
“We do have a new approach that we’ve been working on, and that involves this, rather than just throwing money at individual companies in an ad hoc manner, we’re working on the fundamentals,” Morrisey said. “We have to enhance West Virginia’s investment climate by lowering the regulatory and the capital barriers.”
He wants to scrutinize the return on investment on every taxpayer dollar spent on economic development in the state. 
“Gone are the days where a department comes in [and says], ‘I need $3 million on X.’ You must prove your [return on investment],” Morrisey said. 
He added, “We are not going to be in the business of just trying to buy companies and get in some of these competitions …We’re going to show the world what West Virginia is made of.”
Morrisey’s universal licensing bill in effect 
This past legislative session, the governor championed a bill that allows new residents to transfer their occupational and professional licenses from another state to West Virginia. It’s known as occupational licensing reciprocity. Morrisey signed the measure into law April 7.
“Already, in just a few months since that bill’s passed, we’ve seen things that are moving the needle,” Morrisey said. “We’re increasing the number of contractors registered in the state since this time last year. If you look at the April through June timeline, things are getting faster. That’s an 8% increase year over year.”
Shortly after being sworn in, Morrisey launched an “Economic Backyard Brawl” through an executive order. The plan focuses on developing energy infrastructure and, through that, competition with surrounding states. He said there were talks to accelerate permit application approvals, which can delay the start and completion of certain projects.
Following his speech, he told reporters he’s conscious of federal money drying up. He wants a balanced budget and transparency on spending. 
“We’re trying to leverage our resources, and we’re not doing it for all this federal money that’s out there. That’s the key,” he said. “We’ll take advantage of all the great things that happened in the past, but we’re going to have to keep growing and getting stronger and stronger to move the needle.”
Morrisey didn’t announce a major economic development at the Business Summit, but said news of his energy plan will be shared in the coming weeks. 
The governor also touted digital investments and a complete overhaul of Workforce West Virginia’s website and “the overall functionality of the agency” in an effort to boost the state’s poor workforce participation.
“We have some new people and we’re going to drive that process forward,” he said. 
Morrisey also noted the loss of Supreme Court Justice Tim Armstead, former Speaker of the House, who died Tuesday. The governor ordered that flags at all state-owned facilities be displayed at half-staff yesterday to commemorate the life of Justice Armstead.

Other states have followed suit. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)This year, comprehensive privacy laws are going into effect in eight states to regulate how businesses handle digital information and to give consumers more protections over their personal data.
The laws in Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Tennessee have taken effect already this year, according to a database from the International Association of Privacy Professionals’ Westin Research Center. Maryland’s privacy law, signed by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore last year, will go into effect Oct. 1.
Privacy laws enacted in Indiana, Kentucky and Rhode Island will go into effect next year.
Several other states are considering comprehensive privacy bills during this year’s legislative sessions. They include Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
When a person visits a website, applies to a job or logs into an online portal, they may be sharing their personal information. Comprehensive privacy laws can apply to a wide range of companies that participate in this kind of data collection.
These laws generally include two types of provisions — those related to consumer rights and those that establish business obligations, according to the association.
Under each of the new laws, consumers have the right to control when and how their data is collected and shared. Some of those provisions include the right to delete data from a company’s database, the ability to opt out of sharing sensitive information and the right to prohibit a company from selling their data.
New Hampshire’s law, which went into effect in January, allows a consumer to take action to prevent their data from being stored by companies and businesses and gives them tools to remove or amend that data.
A guide to New Hampshire’s new data privacy rights

The new measures also require businesses to ask consumers if they want to opt in to data collection. In some states, businesses are required to complete consumer data risk assessments and identify ways in which discrimination could take place. Some companies also may be required to limit how consumer data is processed.
In 2018, California became the first state to enact comprehensive privacy legislation for residents; the law went into effect in 2020. Virginia and Colorado enacted laws in 2021. Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Utah also have comprehensive laws that have taken effect, the database shows.
Other states have passed measures with more specific data protections this year. California, Colorado and Montana, for instance, passed legislation that aims to protect sensitive brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings, KFF Health News reported earlier this year.
One bill under consideration in New York would establish data privacy protections for children. And another measure in Pennsylvania aims to improve consumer data protections with genetic testing companies.
Without comprehensive federal protections, state lawmakers are driving the push to protect consumers from having their personal information shared without their knowledge.

Rollins first announced the Trump administration’s plans to repeal the rule on June 23, 2025 in Santa Fe during the Western Governors Association meeting. (Photo by Julia Goldberg / Source NM)The U.S. Department of Agriculture will open up public comments on Friday on its plan to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
About 1.6 million acres, or about 2,500 square miles, in national forests in New Mexico are currently protected by the “Roadless Rule.” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins first announced the Trump administration’s plans in June at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in New Mexico’s capital.
Rollins said in a news release on Wednesday the three-week public comment period represents a step toward “restoring local decision-making to federal land managers to empower them to do what’s necessary to protect America’s forests and communities from devastating destruction from fires.”
“It is vital that we properly manage our federal lands to create healthy, resilient and productive forests for generations to come,” Rollins said in a statement. “We look forward to hearing directly from the people and communities we serve as we work together to implement productive and commonsense policy for forest land management.”
The Forest Service will publish a notice seeking public comment in the federal register on Friday, the USDA said, and people will have until Sept. 19 to submit comments.
Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said the rule has frustrated land managers by prohibiting road construction to allow for wildfire suppression in overstocked forests increasingly threatened by drought, mortality, insect-borne disease and wildfire.
“It’s time to return land management decisions where they belong – with local Forest Service experts who best understand their forests and communities,” Schultz said in a statement. “Your input will help to build a stronger, safer future for our forests and the communities that depend on these forests for jobs, recreation and clean water.”
Nonprofit conservation groups came to the rule’s defense on Wednesday, saying it has helped protect 45 million acres of national forest land across 37 states.
The Wilderness Society said the public-comment period is an “outrageously short time frame for the public to meaningfully comment on protections for forests in 39 states.”
“America’s national forests give us clean air, water, wildlife and the freedom for all to enjoy the outdoors,” said Wilderness Society President Tracy Stone-Manning said in a statement. “But now they are the latest target in this administration’s unpopular push to give away our lands to drill, mine and log.”
Rescinding the rule would be “the single largest rollback of conservation protections in our nation’s history,” Stone-Manning said.
The National Parks Conservation Association said throwing out the rule would allow for increased oil and gas leasing and other harmful development on public lands that can destroy or disrupt habitats, increase erosion and worsen sediment pollution in drinking water.
“Everyone who cares for America’s national parks and public lands should be deeply alarmed about attempts to dismantle the roadless rule,” said Beau Kiklis, the association’s Associate Director of Energy and Landscape Conservation, in a statement.
Trout Unlimited President and CEO Chris Wood said the rule protects drinking water for millions of people and habitat for native trout and salmon.
“We would, honestly, welcome a transparent, collaborative process to determine if tweaks to the rule would allow us to better protect the values of roadless areas while also better protecting communities of people at risk of catastrophic fire,” Wood said in a statement. “Rather than rescinding the Roadless Rule and allowing that chaos to unfold, we encourage the Forest Service to work with stakeholders to develop solutions that continue to protect roadless areas and intact fish and wildlife habitat.”

Tim Taylor, fifth from right, listen to testimony at a hearing Wednesday in Macon. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)MACON — Separate tax rates for the four classes of taxed property would protect homeowners from large tax increases during reassessment, Chariton County Assessor Darrin Gladbach told a special Missouri House interim committee at its final field hearing.
If residential, commercial, farm and personal property each had a separate rate, any rate cuts due to growth above inflation would be confined to the classification where the growth is occurring, Gladbach said.
That is because when residential values rise faster than appraisals of commercial or farm property, it shifts the burden to homeowners because the Hancock Amendment was written so total property tax revenue growth doesn’t exceed inflation.

“Either the overall valuation does not go up enough to trigger a rollback, or if it does trigger a rollback, all the other subclasses also benefit from that rollback,” Gladbach said.
St. Louis County is the only county to separate property by subclass under a law making it optional.
Gladbach was the first person to testify Wednesday evening to the Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform. The committee is looking at how rates are set, what share of true market value should be taxed and what needs to change to make property taxes simpler to understand and pay. It previously took testimony in Jefferson City, Lebanon, Kansas City and St. Louis. 
More than 100 people attended the hearing where, over the course of three hours, the 20-member committee heard from county officials and residents of north Missouri on what would make property taxes fairer, where assessments reflect actual values and rates reflect the constitutional limits on revenue growth.
Aggravation over higher property tax bills, fueled in part by a push at the State Tax Commission to get assessors to recognize higher land and building values, has held the attention of state lawmakers for the past two years.
On Monday, elected officials from five counties who have refused commission orders to raise property valuations sued to block it from withholding funds that help pay for assessment activities.
During testimony that closed out the hearing, tax commission Chairman Gary Romine endorsed Gladbach’s proposal to tax each subclass of property at a separate rate.
“Assessed valuations going up should not be an increase in the constituents taxes,” Romine said. 
One reason the tax commission has pushed assessors to make increases is to bring appraised values closer to actual market value, especially for residential property. But every appraisal is a guess, based on the sales price of comparable properties, and Missouri does not require sellers to report the value of the property as it is sold.
Romine  said the commission has pushed for years for the legislature to enact a law requiring a certificate of value to be filed with the deed transfer. 
“But we also realize that that data has to be protected, and it’s no secret the Realtors Association will kill any kind of (certificate of value) bill, if it gets out there, unless we can find a way to protect that data,” Romine said.
Lawmakers have tried to respond to constituent upset over property taxes with measures that allow local voters to freeze tax bills for people over 65, and, during a special session in June, put in place caps on the growth of individual tax bills in 97 of the state’s 114 counties.
But freezes and caps on bills can have the effect of shifting the burden to property not sheltered by the new laws because revenues for the 2,807 local government agencies that impose property taxes are allowed to increase by the rate of inflation and the value of new construction.
“When we freeze an area, the ones left in the pool pick up the slack, because we’ve got these fire districts and ambulance districts in rural Missouri, and the cost of funding is not going down,” Gladbach said.
Lawmakers provided lower-income seniors and people with disability more property tax relief during the regular session this year. The tax bill that eliminated taxes on capital gains also increased the income limits and credit amounts for the elderly and people with disabilities who use the Circuit Breaker tax credit and, in June, put in place caps on the growth of tax bills in 97 of the state’s 114 counties.
The committee will meet again next Wednesday in Jefferson City as it takes the information from five public hearings held around the state and works on a bill to introduce for the 2026 legislative session, said state Rep. Tim Taylor, the Republican from Boonville who is chairman.
The committee may meet several times in early September if there is a special session on congressional redistricting, he said.
“It’s my goal to try to have this meeting over the public testimony in that week in Jefferson City, on whatever time frame, if it comes to fruition,” Taylor said. “And it would be my goal to even have one more after that, prior to December, so we might try to sit down and get a bill.”
The questions the committee must answer include whether constitutional changes are needed, whether the percentages of appraised value subject to tax should be changed and whether the tax commission should be expanded beyond three members.
“Part of the reason why I got this job is because I knew how complicated it was, and I complained that it was too complicated,” Taylor said. “So the speaker said, ‘well, if you want to complain, maybe you should try to help fix it.’”
 Tax Commission lawsuit

The Missouri State Tax Commission provides oversight to the work of local assessors in 114 counties and the city of St. Louis. It sets the amounts used as the productive value of farmland, oversees the taxation of railroads and utility property, and is a place where owners can appeal property values when dissatisfied with the outcome reached by local boards of equalization.
In the lawsuit filed Monday in Polk County, officials in Audrain, DeKalb, Pike, Polk and Reynolds counties accuse the commission of exceeding its authority by demanding large jumps in assessed value and imposing impossible timelines.
Each county has received what the commission calls equalization orders, directing them to boost property values for real estate by up to 15%. 
The commission’s orders “are an effort to force clerks, assessors, and boards of equalization to raise residential property assessments in an arbitrary and capricious manner without providing proper notice to the taxpayers affected by the increases,” the lawsuit states. “Upon information and belief, (the) commission has been made aware of this timing issue regarding the required notice to taxpayers and has failed to address these concerns.”
Members of the tax commission declined to comment on the lawsuit when asked at the interim committee hearing.
Local assessors are required to assign new values to all property in odd-numbered years, a process called general reassessment. The tax commission wants the values to fall between 90 and 110% of the true market value for the particular type of property.
When assessment increases are likely to cause tax bills to go up, notices must go out by June 1. Individual property owners are given a chance to appeal the new value to the local Board of Equalization, where they can argue over the price of comparable properties, or that factors such as age or storm damage make the valuation inaccurate.
Once the total value of all property in a taxing district is set in July, the governing boards calculate the impact on rates and set a public hearing. The rates for the year are set by Sept. 1 after public hearings.
DeKalb County, home to 42 taxing entities, was issued an equalization order dated July 22 demanding that it increase commercial assessments by 15%. That was too late to allow for appeals, County Clerk Melissa Meek said in an interview with The Independent.
The result, she said, would have been for the affected businesses to pay their taxes under protest, freezing the funds until appeals were resolved.
“I begged them to rescind their order and do it next year in a timely manner,” Meek said. “The patrons, the business owners, could meet with the Board of Equalization and they could bring their comps for comparable sales, and they could say why they shouldn’t have to pay and then let the (board) decide if the 15% increase was valid or not. But they didn’t give anybody that opportunity.”
The tax commission hasn’t formally threatened DeKalb County’s funding for assessment costs, which Meek said is about $25,000 a year. But the lawsuit says the commission is threatening to withhold more than $250,000 from the other four participating in the case.

Audrain County stands to lose $51,275. When the tax commission ordered the county to raise assessments, it did so by 12%. The commission demanded 15%, the lawsuit states.
Pike County would lose $47,180 because the commission determined that residential assessments decreased 0.72% versus a demand that they rise 13 to 15%.
Polk County would lose $65,406 in fiscal 2026 funding and denied $24,762 remaining from its fiscal 2025 allocation if it does not boost residential assessments by at least 14.99%.
Reynolds County was directed to raise residential land values and residential improvements by 15% or lose $34,329 in fiscal 2025 and another $34,527 for fiscal 2026.

The orders would force assessors to violate the law because any property where the value increases by 15% or more must be evaluated from the exterior in an inspection. The commission’s order to add the increase to any locally determined value for all residential properties would force assessors to violate the law, the lawsuit states
Along with forcing assessors to violate the law, blanket increases in assessments do not take into account individual conditions. Values may not change much, if at all, for properties in poor condition or in undesirable locations, the lawsuit states.
“The equalization orders specifically are discriminatory to taxpayers owning low-value properties in that a 15% increase will cause those properties to be assessed higher as compared to their market value than other properties within the counties,” the filing states.
Only the local assessor can know where it is appropriate to set higher values and which properties have not changed, Meek said. 
“We know our county,” Meek said. “We know what our people can do and what they can’t do.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tax-hearing-committee-20250827-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-28 14:57:01.398627

(Photo of Center: UNC.edu) A common misconception is that academic freedom means professors can say or do anything they want. What it means, in fact, is that professors are supposed to be free to conduct research and teach in ways deemed professionally competent by their faculty peers, without being subject to outside political interference.
This freedom is not a job perk offered for the benefit of individual professors. It’s the institutional practice that distinguishes a university from a profit-focused business run by owners and managers. Without this freedom, science and scholarship are impossible. If we want to enjoy the fruits of honest truth-seeking, academic freedom is part of the package.
This is why it’s important to be on guard against political interference with academic freedom and the failures of university administrators to protect it. Even more concerning ought to be occasions when administrators, succumbing to outside pressures, take it upon themselves to quash academic freedom.
A recent example comes from UNC-Chapel Hill. As reported August 22nd in The Daily Tarheel, top-level university administrators at UNC-Chapel Hill ordered a mural in the Hanes Art Center lobby boarded up. That’s not a metaphor. The mural was literally covered with a board—with no prior notice, at night.
The mural was an outgrowth of a studio art course, Art as Social Action, taught by professor H?ng-An Tr??ng in the spring of 2024. Some students in the course joined the UNC Gaza Solidarity Encampment, where they taught other participants how to make carved block prints. Participants used this technique to create prints expressing their views about events in Palestine. In less than a week after police wrecked the encampment on April 30, 2024, these prints were assembled into a mural that was put on display in the Hanes Art Center lobby, in accord with procedures established by the department of art and art history.
It should be clear, given the mural’s origins and purpose, that boarding it up under cover of night is not like scrubbing protest graffiti off the wall of a campus building. Nor is this a case of overzealous activists flouting reasonable time, place, and manner limits on free speech.
The mural was a collective act of artistic creation, undertaken with serious intent by students, emerging from a course taught by a tenured faculty member with relevant disciplinary expertise, properly exhibited in a departmental art space. Covering the mural, making it inaccessible to members of the university community, is a violation of academic freedom akin to shutting down a lecture.
In trying to determine precisely who was responsible for the censorship, reporters for The Daily Tarheel sought comments from chancellor Lee Roberts, interim provost James Dean, vice chancellor for operations Nate Knuffman, interim associate vice chancellor for facilities services Howard Wertheimer, and vice provost for arts and culture and senior associate dean for the fine arts and humanities Elizabeth Engelhardt. None responded.
Jim White, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, did not speak with DTH reporters but issued a statement through UNC Media Relations. In the statement, White said, “The artwork was on display for a year, and the time had come for it to be taken down and for other artwork to go up. It was on my list of things to talk with the department about early this semester.”
White’s statement beggars belief if one understands what deans at large research universities usually concern themselves with. The idea that the dean of arts and sciences would be monitoring, as a matter of administrative routine, the schedule for displaying artwork in the lobby of the art building is nonsense.
“I’ve been teaching [at UNC] for fourteen years,” professor Tr??ng told a meeting of the UNC Faculty Executive Committee on August 25th, “and I’ve never seen the administration have a say in what we put on our wall, the art that goes up in our building, or any of the exhibitions that we’ve put into our space.” Annette Lawrence, chair of the art and art history department, added that the artwork previously displayed in the Hanes lobby was up for four years.
It has since become clear that the artwork was on dean White’s radar because of complaints from some Jewish students and alumni who “felt threatened” by the artwork, as reported to the Faculty Executive Committee by interim provost James Dean.
On the same day as the Faculty Executive Committee meeting, White issued a longer statement about the mural. The statement, titled “An Open Letter: The Art of Balance Through Interpretation,” attempts to justify the act of censorship as necessary to protect the vulnerable. The vulnerable here being those who felt intimidated by a work of art expressing opposition to genocide.
In the first sentence of his statement, White says that some people saw the mural’s support for the Palestinian people as antisemitic. No complainants are identified, but presumably they do not include the many Jewish students and faculty who participated in the Gaza Solidarity Encampment. White then goes on to say that UNC “will not take an indifferent stance toward any form of antisemitism, whether intended or interpreted.”
That last clause is breathtaking in its implications. What it means, in effect, is that any time partisans of Israel feel that an expression of support for Palestinian rights, or criticism of Israel, is “antisemitic,” administrators are right to intervene and squelch the troublesome speech—or art, or teaching, or research. The Anti-Defamation League, a pro-Israel lobbying group that has for years masqueraded as a civil rights group, could not have said it better.
White’s statement further implies that university administrators, as self-proclaimed artful balancers, can decide, at their discretion, where academic freedom and free speech begin and end. “Okay, you folks had your mural on display for a year,” White’s statement says, if not in precisely those words. “We’ve decided that’s enough; now we’re taking it down.” That, it seems, is an autocrat’s idea of civil discourse.
Outsiders to the usual goings-on in public research universities might look at all this and see it as a tempest in an academic teapot. So one art exhibit in one corner of the university got covered up after being on view for a year. How is that a big deal?
Here’s how: censoring the exhibit—and first denying that outside pressure had anything to do with it—is another instance of how the intellectual freedom uniquely afforded by universities is being eroded with the aid of complicit administrators who take their jobs to be the assertion of managerial control in service to their right-wing political masters. Anyone who has been paying attention knows that this is not a Chapel Hill problem or a North Carolina problem. It’s a problem all over the country.
Academic freedom, like democracy, dies one step at a time. No single step seems large enough to warrant outrage. Yet each minor act of censorship or repression serves to form a larger picture of a changed society, one we can see taking shape now. When that picture is finally filled in, we may find nowhere in it what we knew as academic freedom or the universities where this principle was once most revered.

(Photo by Jerry Grayson/Helifilms Australia PTY via Getty Images via Grist)It has been 20 years since New Orleans’ faulty levee system failed during Hurricane Katrina, causing a flood that claimed almost 2,000 lives and inflicted more than $150 billion in economic damage. The catastrophe was so bad that some doubted the city could continue to exist at all — the U.S. House speaker at the time declared that rebuilding New Orleans “doesn’t make sense” and that much of it “could be bulldozed.”
 
This story was originally published by Grist.

Rather than just patch up the damage, which would have left one of the country’s most iconic cities exposed to every future storm, the federal government doubled down on flood protection, building a new $14.4 billion levee system that ranks as one of the most sophisticated anywhere in the world.
Over the course of a decade, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rebuilt and expanded almost 200 miles of levees across three parishes. It outfitted every major channel and canal with a gate that could swing shut during surge events. On the east side of the city, where storm surge had overtopped its old levees, it built the Lake Borgne Surge Barrier, a 2-mile wall that could stop as much as 26 feet of surge.
On the three canals where it had built shoddy flood walls, it built new ones and massive pump stations that can remove an Olympics-sized swimming pool of water from the city every 3.5 seconds. It also decommissioned the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, or “Mr. Go,” a large shipping channel that had destroyed protective marshland around New Orleans and funneled Katrina’s storm surge into the city.
But for all the success of the new levee system, the future of New Orleans remains uncertain.
The sea levels around the city are rising by about half an inch every year as climate change warms the oceans and melts glaciers. The city itself is sinking even faster than that, with some sections of the levee system settling by almost 2 inches each year — faster than the rate of change that the Corps projected when it built the system. This elevation change makes the new levee system less effective with each year, requiring constant repairs and expansions.
Even landmark structures like the Lake Borgne barrier may lose a few feet off their protection capacity by the middle of the century. That would put them within a hair’s breadth of being topped by storms such as Hurricane Michael, which delivered almost 20 feet of surge to Florida in 2018.
“Since 2005, several storms have made landfall on the Gulf Coast that far exceed the stated design capacity of the new ‘risk reduction system,’” said Andy Horowitz, a historian at the University of Connecticut and the author of a book on Hurricane Katrina. “It’s just chance, or luck, that one of them didn’t hit New Orleans. One day, inevitably, one will.”

The Corps maintains that the system is working as designed, but federal and state cuts could jeopardize the system’s resilience even further. The Trump administration has already eliminated funding for the Corps and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for key resilience projects and levee inspections. Republican-controlled Louisiana is following suit. Protecting New Orleans through the end of the century, against climate-fueled hurricanes, will require the exact whole-of-government effort that the Trump administration is trying to end.
“The system that we have is a good system,” said Sandy Rosenthal, a citizen activist and the founder of the website Levees.org. Rosenthal was responsible for exposing the Corps’ original design errors after Katrina. “But for the first time since the levees were completed, I’m actually concerned.”
New Orleans has been an engineered city for centuries. Subsidence and wetlands loss have driven the city to sink below sea level, turning it into a kind of bowl between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. Even the French settlers of the early 18th century had to use levees to keep the city from flooding. Almost the entire perimeter of New Orleans is now lined with either earthen levees or concrete walls. When it rains, pumps carry water up and out of the bowl, the same way you would bail out a canoe.
This levee system has had many iterations, but the one that existed at the time of Hurricane Katrina was the federal government’s project. The Army Corps of Engineers, which is the nation’s flood-protection agency, had built around 125 miles of barricades around the city over the second half of the 20th century.

(Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images via Grist)
The best way to describe this system is the old Woody Allen quip about restaurants: “The food here is terrible, and the portions are too small.” The Corps made serious engineering mistakes when it built flood walls along canals that funnel water away from the city’s densest neighborhoods. But even the levees it built “correctly” in the eastern part of the city, closest to the Gulf of Mexico, were too small. In other parts, there were no defenses at all.
When Katrina sent storm surge barreling toward New Orleans, the old system failed in at least six places. The wall of water rushed over the tops of the levees, and the canals that were supposed to channel water out of the city shattered, flooding neighborhoods with water and silt. FEMA bungled the emergency response and took several days to deliver critical supplies, turning the disaster into a true humanitarian crisis.
Katrina itself was not all that powerful, especially compared to the Category 5 monsters that now strike the Gulf in most years, but it exposed every engineering flaw in the Corps’ structure. The American Society of Civil Engineers called it the “the worst engineering catastrophe in U.S. history.”
Despite some initial skepticism about the cost of the rebuild, the federal government’s response was to throw money at the problem. In the decade after Katrina, Congress allocated more than $14 billion to the Army Corps of Engineers to protect the whole city against a hypothetical 100-year storm, or one that has a 1 percent chance of happening in a given year. It was classified as a repair project, rather than new construction, which meant the feds picked up the entire tab.
The new Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System comprises a network of hundreds of discrete projects touching every corner of the city. It no longer purports to offer “hurricane protection,” as the previous system did, but rather “risk reduction.”
“The new system that’s in place now is the first time New Orleans has ever had a complete approach to dealing with water,” said Ed Link, a civil engineer at the University of Maryland. Link helped lead the government-appointed task force that evaluated the Katrina levee failures. “The old system was not a system — we called it a ‘system’ in name only.”
The Corps completed the major pieces by 2012 and finished its final work by 2018, a remarkable turnaround time for an agency that often spends two or three decades on major capital projects. The system passed its earliest tests: New Orleans took 9 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Isaac in 2012 and took another direct hit from Category 5 Hurricane Ida in 2021. During these storms, things worked the way they were supposed to: The storm surge barriers kept out the waters of the Gulf, and the pump stations stopped rainwater from flooding the city. Rosenthal said Ida showed that the system “passed the ultimate test.”
Whether it will always pass that test is another question. The federal government no longer maintains the system; that job is now the responsibility of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority.
Though now in local hands, the authority still relies on the Corps for levee-inspection funding. The Trump administration has already cut its budget, with Republicans in Congress proposing even further reductions. The Corps said it doesn’t have the money to inspect New Orleans’ levees this year or next. Much of the system’s maintenance funding also comes from local governments, some of which have chafed at the cost of keeping the levees at the Corps’ standards after Katrina.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Louisiana’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry, has also attempted to take control of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority this year, giving himself more influence over what had been an independent board and slashing funding for line items like cutting levee grass. His moves to undo post-Katrina governance reforms caused three members to resign in March. Landry has selected a new board chair, fired that chair, and installed a new chair through what critics say may be illegal means.
If that wasn’t enough, New Orleans is still sinking. The city pumps its drinking water from underground aquifers, and levees farther up the Mississippi River have blocked the sediment that once replenished the delta on which the city sits. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico itself is rising by a few millimeters a year due to global warming. With these two factors combined, the relative sea level rise in Louisiana is higher than almost anywhere in the world.
The Corps was aware of climate change when it built the new system, but it was planning for a moving target. Congress gave the agency enough money to build a flood network that would protect against a “hundred-year flood” event, but the height required to protect against such an event changes each year as land subsides and the Gulf of Mexico rises. Because these rates are very hard to predict, and may be accelerating, the Corps has to inspect the levees at regular intervals and elevate the ones that are sinking fastest.
“The 100-year criteria is no longer a valid way to design things, primarily because it changes all around now,” said Link. “We added a certain amount of subsidence and a certain amount of sea level rise to our calculations, but we didn’t put enough.”
Corps spokesperson Ricky Boyett said the agency is confident that the system will provide 100-year protection through 2057, provided it has the money to lift up the earthen levees every few years. It also said it is preparing to expand the system west toward Baton Rouge and studying how to extend that 100-year level of protection for New Orleans through at least 2073, even with further subsidence.
“The goal is always to stay ahead of it,” said Boyett. The major concrete structures, like the surge barrier, were built with enough spare height to last through 2057, but only if sea levels rise as the Corps predicted — and new research from Tulane University suggests that these structures are sinking too.

The Corps also readily admits that bigger storms are possible. The Risk Reduction System would reduce the damage from these storms, but would not stop them altogether. As for whether it will ever build a 200-year or 500-year system, one that would be robust enough to stop supersized storms such as Hurricane Ian or Hurricane Michael, the Corps can offer no guarantees. Such funding would depend on Congress, which tends to act after big disasters rather than before them.
Another problem is that levees are only supposed to be one part of a broader approach to resilience, and the federal and state governments are now neglecting the other parts of that approach. Gov. Landry just scrapped a $3 billion sediment diversion project that would have created 30,000 acres of new hurricane-slowing wetlands, bowing to pressure from a vocal group of oyster fishermen. The city, meanwhile, has pursued a novel project to slow down subsidence by capturing rainwater, but that project depends on funding from federal resilience programs that President Trump is trying to cut.
“I’m not minimizing the importance of the hard levees and the other structures, but the natural stuff is as important, if not more important,” said Charles Allen, a New Orleans activist who founded an organization to support the flooded Lower 9th Ward after Katrina. He now serves as the Gulf Coast community engagement director at the National Audubon Society. “We can’t just throw up something, turn our back, and say, ‘Oh, it’s gonna be fine.’ … Now two decades have passed, and we are still fiddling.”
In the meantime, the hard levees are all New Orleans has.
Massive civil works projects like the Risk Reduction System may soon look like the product of a bygone era. The second Trump administration has purged the federal civil service and called for drastic reductions to government spending, and Trump has said he wants the states to take on a greater share of disaster preparedness costs. If that model continues past his presidency, it might threaten the Corps model of proposing large capital projects that depend on money from Congress, the projects that can extend a city’s probable lifespan by a century or more.
While the new system isn’t perfect, it does demonstrate what the government can do if it tries, says Horowitz.
“I used to think of the post-Katrina ‘risk reduction system’ … as the bare minimum, but subsequent events have reminded me that of course Congress could have done less,” he said. “It could have done nothing, which has been its response to many crises since.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-28 18:05:05+00:00,Mississippi Today,Two Mississippi media companies appeal Supreme Court ruling on sealed court files,"Taylor Vance and Anita Lee, Sun Herald",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/28/supreme-court-appeal-court-files/,Mississippi Today and the Sun Herald are asking the state Supreme Court to force a lower court to open remaining sealed records and hold a hearing on why they were sealed in the first place.,"A three-judge panel of the Mississippi Supreme Court has ruled that court records in a politically charged business dispute will remain confidential, even though courts are supposed to be open to the public. 
The panel, comprised of Justice Josiah Coleman, Justice James Maxwell and Justice Robert Chamberlin, denied a request from Mississippi Today and the Sun Herald that sought to force Chancery Judge Neil Harris to unseal court records in a Jackson County Chancery Court case or conduct a hearing on unsealing the court records. 
The Supreme Court panel did not address whether Harris erred by sealing court records and it has not forced the judge to comply with the court’s prior landmark decisions detailing how judges are allowed to seal court records in  extraordinary circumstances. 
The case in question has drawn a great deal of public interest. The lawsuit seeks to dissolve a company called Securix Mississippi LLC that used traffic cameras to ticket uninsured motorists in numerous cities in the state.
The uninsured motorist venture has since been disbanded and is the subject of two federal lawsuits, neither of which are under seal. In one federal case, an attorney said the chancery court file was sealed to protect the political reputations of the people involved.

Quinton Dickerson and Josh Gregory, two of the leaders of QJR, are the owners of Frontier Strategies. Frontier is a consulting firm that has advised numerous elected officials, including four sitting Supreme Court justices. The three justices who considered the media’s motion for relief were not clients of Frontier. 
The two news outlets on Thursday filed a motion asking the Supreme Court for a rehearing. 
Courts are open to public
In their motion for a rehearing, the media companies are asking that the Supreme Court send the case back to chancery court, where Harris should be required to give notice and hold a hearing to discuss unsealing the remaining court files.
Courts and court files are supposed to be open and accessible to the public. The Supreme Court has, since 1990, followed a ruling that lays out a procedure judges are supposed to follow before closing any part of a court file. The judge is supposed to give 24 hours notice, then hold a hearing that gives the public, including the media, an opportunity to object.
At the hearing, the judge must consider alternatives to closure and state any reasons for sealing records. 
Instead, Harris closed the court record without explanation the same day the case was filed in September 2024. In June, Harris denied a motion from Mississippi Today to unseal the file.
The case, he wrote in his order, is between two private companies. “There are no public entities included as parties,” he wrote, “and there are no public funds at issue. Other than curiosity regarding issues between private parties, there is no public interest involved.”

But that is at least partially incorrect. The case involves Securix Mississippi working with city police departments to ticket uninsured motorists. The Mississippi Department of Public Safety had signed off on the program and was supposed to be receiving a share of the revenue.
Mississippi Today and the Sun Herald then filed for relief with the state Supreme Court, arguing that Harris improperly closed the court file without notice and did not conduct a hearing to consider alternatives. 
After the media outlets’ appeal to the Supreme Court, Harris ordered some of the records in the case to be unsealed.
But he left an unknown number of exhibits under seal, saying they contain “financial information” and are being held in a folder in the Chancery Clerk’s Office.
File improperly sealed, media argues
The three-judge Supreme Court panel determined the media appeal was no longer relevant because Harris had partially unsealed the court file. 
In the news outlets’ appeal for rehearing, they argue that if the Supreme Court does not grant the motion, the state’s highest court would virtually give the press and public no recourse to push back on judges when they question whether court records were improperly sealed. 
“The original … sealing of the entire file violated several rights of the public and press … which if not overruled will be capable of repetition yet, evading review,” the motion reads. 
The media companies also argue that Harris’ order partially unsealing the chancery court case was not part of the record on appeal and should not have been considered by the Supreme Court. His order to partially unseal the case came 10 days after Mississippi Today and the Sun Herald filed their appeal to the Supreme Court.

Charlie Mitchell, a lawyer and former newspaper editor who has taught media law at the University of Mississippi for years, called Judge Harris’ initial order keeping the case sealed “illogical.” He said the judge’s second order partially unsealing the case appears “much closer” to meeting the court’s standard for keeping records sealed, but the judge could still be more specific and transparent in his orders. 
Instead of simply labeling the sealed records as “financial information,” Mitchell said the Supreme Court could promote transparency in the judiciary by ordering Harris to conduct a hearing — something he should have done from the outset — or redact portions of the exhibits.  
“Closing a record or court matter as the preference of the parties is never — repeat never — appropriate,” Mitchell said. “It sounds harsh, but if parties don’t want the public to know about their disputes, they should resolve their differences, as most do, without filing anything in a state or federal court.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081932/HB-1020-appeal1.jpg,,,2025-08-28 14:57:01.398627

It’s a grim artifact from the 1955 lynching of a Black teenager at the hands of angry white men – a crime that galvanized the Civil Rights Movement.
“One of the reasons why this civil rights museum was created is to tell the unvarnished truth about what happened in terms of the Civil Rights Movement here in Mississippi,” Michael Morris, director of the Two Mississippi Museums, said during a news conference Thursday. “That’s our mission, and I think the acquisition of this artifact is a part of our mission.”
The Foundation for Mississippi History acquired the .45-caliber pistol and holster for the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The items came from “a Mississippi family that is not connected to the case,” the department said in a press release Thursday, the 70th anniversary of Till’s lynching.

The gun was once owned by J.W. Milam, one of the two white men charged with murder in Till’s death and acquitted by an all-white jury weeks after the killing. The weapon was later owned by someone else.
Acquisition of the gun happened under the condition that those who most recently had the weapon would remain anonymous, said Morris, who oversees the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the adjoining Museum of Mississippi History. Morris did not disclose other terms.
“We thought we had a moral obligation to go out and try to acquire it,” Morris said. “Once we got acquisition of it, the question became: Should we put it on display? And we didn’t think that this was the kind of artifact that we wanted to just put away in a drawer somewhere.”
The gun and holster were added to an exhibit that tells the story of Till’s lynching.
Nan Prince, the department’s director of collections, said the gun is “a very hard thing to see.”
“This weapon has affected me moreso than any other artifact that I’ve encountered in my 30-year museum career,” Prince said. “The emotions that are centered around it are hard, and a hard thing to see and a hard thing to convey.”
In August 1955, 14-year-old Till traveled from Chicago to the Mississippi Delta to visit his cousins. Till and other young Black people went to buy snacks one day at Bryant’s Grocery & Meat Market in the tiny community of Money. Till’s cousin Simeon Wright later said he heard Till whistle at the white storekeeper, Carolyn Bryant, as they left.
Days later, a group that included Carolyn’s husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother Milam kidnapped Till from the home of Till’s great uncle, Moses Wright. They took Till to a barn, where they beat, tortured and shot him. Milam is believed to have used the .45 to pistol-whip and fatally shoot Till. 
The group dumped Till in the Tallahatchie River, using barbed wire to attach a 75-pound cotton gin fan to him. Till’s body was discovered three days later, decomposed beyond recognition except for his father’s ring on one of his fingers.

Till’s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago so people could see what had been done to her son, and Jet magazine published a photo of his brutalized body.
An all-white jury in Mississippi acquitted Milam and Bryant of Till’s murder in September 1955. Months later, Milam and Bryant admitted their involvement to Look magazine.
In World War II, Milam served as a lieutenant in the Army Air Force and brought back the Ithaca Model M1911-A1 .45-caliber pistol, which has the serial number 2102279.
Morris said the department notified Till’s relatives about the Department of Archives and History’s acquisition of the gun. The department’s press release said Wheeler Parker, a cousin who was in the home when Till was kidnapped, thanked the department for acquiring and displaying the artifacts.
“I think it’s good because it brings closure,” Parker said. “I hope you guys can find the ring and cotton gin.”
Filmmaker Keith Beauchamp discovered the existence of the .45 pistol while working on his 2005 documentary, “The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till.” He shared the email with FBI agent Dale Killinger, who investigated the Till case.

The owner of the weapon had kept it in a safety deposit box in a Greenwood bank, according to Wright Thompson’s book, “The Barn: The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi.”
During the FBI’s 2005 investigation into the case, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office in Illinois did an autopsy that found Till’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
This announcement about the department’s acquisition of the gun comes a week after the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board released more than 6,500 pages of documents on Till’s case.
It’s the second murder weapon in possession of the Department of Archives and History. The first is the .30-06 rifle used in 1963 to kill Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers, which can be seen at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ foster care agency had mediation sessions earlier this year to address deficiencies after a 2024 report revealed the state had backslid.
Foster care providers, government agencies and advocacy organizations anticipate a September release of the updated annual, independent review of Kansas’ foster care system, which was mandated after the state settled a class-action lawsuit with a group of former foster children who alleged systemic failures.
The confidential mediation sessions in January attempted to gauge whether the Kansas Department for Children and Families could make progress on the terms of the settlement agreement that requires the state to meet certain benchmarks, said Teresa Woody, litigation director for the Kansas Appleseed Center for Law and Justice and one of several attorneys representing foster children in their lawsuit against the state.
“The desire is not to punish the state,” Woody said in an Aug. 6 interview. “The desire is to have the state do what’s necessary to provide for kids in foster care so those kids can go on to live meaningful lives.”
The mediation sessions were the first to take place since the state reached the agreement in 2020.
The progress reports evaluate the state of Kansas’ foster care system based on five performance improvement goals, among other outcomes. Those goals include ending the practice of children sleeping in non-licensed facilities like offices and hotels, ceasing night-to-night and short-term placements, ensuring children aren’t overcrowded in their placements, preventing housing-related delays in mental health services, and providing child-focused crisis services across the state.
“We’re looking for progress — progress over time — and we’re looking for consistency and accountability,” Woody said. “I think it’s been very uneven.”
The backslide in 2023 is a concern, Woody said. It was preceded by what appeared to be improvements, but she said the agreement lacks accountability. 
Some parts of the system are doing better than others, and Woody said she is particularly concerned about the areas that are not performing well and leaving foster children at risk.

Demas/Michigan AdvanceExtreme rainfall and widespread flooding in July severely damaged roads and infrastructure, and exhausted local response capabilities, prompting Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday to declare a state of emergency for Houghton and Ontonagon counties in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.
The July 23 rainfall caused flash flooding in Houghton County that tore up roads, culverts and storm sewers, impacting Chassell Township, Torch Lake Township, Stanton Township and the city of Houghton. The Houghton County Road Commission and local officials continue to report pavement collapses as roads dry out, the governor’s office said Thursday in a news release.
That same rain event washed out multiple roads in Ontonagon County, which led that county’s road commission to use more than 90% of its equipment on temporary road repairs. Those temporary fixes restored limited access, but permanent repairs would require substantial resources, materials and funding.
Whitmer’s emergency declaration makes available all state resources in cooperation with local response and recovery efforts. That includes coordination with the Department of State Police’s emergency management and homeland security division. 
“Michiganders in Houghton and Ontonagon were hit hard by extreme rain and are facing significant disruptions to their daily lives and major damage to their roads and infrastructure,” Whitmer said in a statement. “By declaring a state of emergency, we’re going to ensure every state resource is available to help them in their recovery efforts. We will work alongside local teams and get through this together.”
The declaration also opens the door to state financial assistance under Michigan’s Emergency Management Act, and potential federal assistance, although Whitmer earlier this week said President Donald Trump had reneged on a declaration approving portions of a disaster relief package for northern Michigan following devastating ice storms in the spring.
Regardless, the communities were grateful for the support in the wake of the July storms, said state Sen. Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan) in a statement released by Whitmer’s office.
“Thank you to the local road commissions, emergency coordinators, and the Michigan State Police as well for their excellent assistance throughout this time,” McBroom said. “My office is ready to provide any needed assistance to repair and rebuild.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG_0212-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-28 13:57:21.090830

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.

Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
 

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.

Wobbly state finances
Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read. 


– Amanda Goodall, “The Job Chick”


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.

“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
California and Texas
California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

The Iowa Board of Massage Therapy has charged Byron Patterson, owner and operator of Byron’s Best Massage in Des Moines, with professional incompetence and engaging in unethical conduct.
The board has not disclosed the alleged conduct that led to the charges being filed, nor has it stated when the conduct occurred, other than to say it happened “during the time period relevant to these allegations.” Board records indicate the investigation into the matter was initiated sometime in 2023.
One of the administrative rules cited by the board in its statement of charges specifically relates to a massage therapist making “improper sexual contact with — or making suggestive, lewd, lascivious or improper remarks or advances to — a patient, client or coworker.”
A hearing on the charges is scheduled for Dec. 2, 2025.
According to the board, Patterson has been an Iowa-licensed massage therapist since November 1994.

But a web page that candidate and Lexington businessman Nate Morris’ campaign says was posted in error and quickly taken down seems to have engaged in a bit of wishful thinking. “Nate Morris is Trump-endorsed,” it said. 
Rival Andy Barr, U.S. congressman, quickly seized on the claim. “Everything about Nate and his campaign is fake,” the congressman from Lexington tweeted.
Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist who is close to Trump and has more than 1.7 million followers on X, also took Morris to task. “President Trump has not endorsed a candidate in the Kentucky US Senate race, and this is incredibly deceptive,” Loomer said. 
Even before he officially entered the race earlier this year, Loomer posted opposition research against Morris, who announced his candidacy on the podcast hosted by the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr.
The screenshot making the rounds online shows part of a Morris campaign WinRed page, the fundraising platform Republican candidates often use to collect donations. The image partially shows a webpage seeking donations to Morris. The copy includes the “Trump-endorsed” reference. 
Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Morris’ campaign said the webpage was posted by mistake and quickly removed. 
“A copywriter with a digital vendor of ours erroneously added language to a single WinRed page,” said spokesperson Conor McGuinness. “The language was not approved by any member of our campaign. It was up for 23 minutes before we caught and deleted it.”
The first to share the screenshot on X Wednesday evening was Nick Sandmann, a Republican operative who has endorsed Barr. Sandmann, a former Covington Catholic High School student, gained national attention after a 2019 video of an interaction between him and a Native American man in Washington, D.C., went viral. Barr, in turn, boosted Sandman’s post.
Daniel Cameron, another GOP candidate in the race and former Kentucky attorney general, shared Loomer’s post and touted his previous endorsements from the president. Trump endorsed Cameron in his attorney general race and again for the 2023 governor election. Cameron later lost to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who was seeking reelection. 
“I’ve been honored to receive it twice, and I would never lie about it,” Cameron said before criticizing Morris. 
Barr’s campaign issued a statement Thursday afternoon criticizing the explanation offered by the Morris campaign. 
“When is Nate Morris going to become a man and take responsibility for HIS ACTIONS,” the Barr campaign said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Hundreds of Minnesotans jammed into the gymnasium of the Academy of the Holy Angels in Richfield to mourn the loss of two children and injuries to over a dozen others after a shooter opened fire outside Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis Wednesday.
Bernard Hebda, archbishop of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, led the hundreds of mourners through a Catholic prayer service. He told the attendees that the front of the Annunciation Church bore the inscription, “House of God. Gate of Heaven.”
“How is it that such a terrible tragedy could take place in a place that’s the house of God and the gate of Heaven? It’s unthinkable” Hebda said. “But we, brothers and sisters, trust that it’s precisely in that house of God where we’re most at home.”
The mourners packed into the bleachers and stood to the side of the procession. Gov. Tim Walz, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Attorney General Keith Ellison were in attendance.
“We have a God who doesn’t turn away from pain,” Hebda said. Jesus took on pain, Hebda said, because he loves people, even imploring believers in the Gospel of Matthew to “love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”
“(Jesus) loves all of those children who were in that church this morning. He loves their families. He loves the shooter. He loves all of us, brothers and sisters,” Hebda said. 
Michael Thomas, a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, was at the vigil because his 14-year-old son attends Annunciation School and was in the Mass where the shooting took place. His son was unharmed, but Thomas said his son cried when he was reunited with his parents and is still upset because his best friend was shot and is recovering in the hospital.
Thomas said that once he finally had the means to send his children to private school, he jumped at the chance because he thought it would be safer than public school.
“I’d rather send them to a place where I know they’ll be safe at, but as of today that’s changed,” Thomas said.
Lola Abdul, who lives in north Minneapolis, didn’t know anyone personally who attended Annunciation School, but she attended the Richfield vigil because she said as a Catholic, it’s important to “pray with our words and pray with our deeds.”
Local restaurants, including Pizza Lucé, handed out free food to the people leaving the Academy of Holy Angels.
About three miles away, hundreds of other attendees crowded in Minneapolis’ Lynnhurst Park, where the anti-gun violence groups Protect Minnesota and Moms Demand Action co-hosted a candlelit vigil.

Wilmington Police said James Yokeley Jr. flagged down police on Aug. 8 outside a gas station and told them that his two young granddaughters found hard objects in their Dairy Queen ice cream.
Video footage revealed that Yokeley had placed narcotics in the ice cream, police said. He was charged with contaminating food with a controlled substance, felony child abuse, and possession of a schedule I narcotic. Media outlets reported that police field tests showed the small blue pills in the ice cream contained cocaine and MDMA. 
State Auditor Dave Boliek appointed Yokeley to head the Surry elections board in June. 
A new state law put Boliek in charge of appointing elections board leaders in all 100 counties. The law also made Republicans the majority in state and local elections boards. 
Boliek called for Yokeley to resign and announced the resignation Thursday morning.
The state Board canceled its meeting. The state Board will appoint a new Surry County elections chair after receiving two nominations from the state Republican Party, according to a Board press release.
In his resignation letter, Yokeley said he is confident he’ll be exonerated.
“After much prayer, thoughtful reflection, and consultation, I have concluded that it is in the best interest of the State Board of Elections and the Surry County Board of Elections, regarding my own falsely accused circumstances, to step down at this time,” Yokeley wrote.

When a person visits a website, applies to a job or logs into an online portal, they may be sharing their personal information. Comprehensive privacy laws can apply to a wide range of companies that participate in this kind of data collection.
These laws generally include two types of provisions — those related to consumer rights and those that establish business obligations, according to the association.
Under each of the new laws, consumers have the right to control when and how their data is collected and shared. Some of those provisions include the right to delete data from a company’s database, the ability to opt out of sharing sensitive information and the right to prohibit a company from selling their data.
The new measures also require businesses to ask consumers if they want to opt in to data collection. In some states, businesses are required to complete consumer data risk assessments and identify ways in which discrimination could take place. Some companies also may be required to limit to how consumer data is processed.
In 2018, California became the first state to enact comprehensive privacy legislation for consumers in the state; the law went into effect in 2020. Virginia and Colorado enacted laws in 2021. Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Utah also have comprehensive laws that have taken effect, the database shows.

Other states have passed measures with more specific data protections this year. California, Colorado and Montana, for instance, passed legislation that aims to protect sensitive brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings, KFF Health News reported earlier this year.
One bill under consideration in New York would establish data privacy protections for children. And another measure in Pennsylvania aims to improve consumer data protections with genetic testing companies.
Without comprehensive federal protections, state lawmakers are driving the push to protect consumers from having their personal information shared without their knowledge.

As President Donald Trump ramps up threats of military action to “clean up” Democratic-led cities, Newsom said local communities can best tackle crime in their communities. 


As he publicly mocks concerns that crime in California is out of control, Gov. Gavin Newsom is also surging law enforcement resources across the state.
Newsom announced Thursday that he would deploy new “crime suppression” teams of California Highway Patrol officers to partner with local officials in six regions: San Diego, the Inland Empire, Los Angeles, the Central Valley, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area.
It’s an escalation of a strategy that Newsom has already tried in cities such as Oakland and Bakersfield, sending in state officers to assist with cracking down on retail theft, stolen vehicles and drug dealing.
And it appears closely related to political considerations, as President Donald Trump ramps up threats of military action to “clean up” Democratic-led cities across the country. In a statement, Newsom alluded to the president, suggesting that communities were better left to handle the issue themselves.
“While the Trump Administration undermines cities, California is partnering with them — and delivering real results,” Newsom said. “With these new deployments, we’re doubling down on these partnerships to build on progress and keep driving crime down.”
Crime has again become a hot-button national topic. Earlier this month, Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C. and took control of its local police force, arguing that federal intervention was needed because of unsafe conditions in the city — though reports of violent offenses are at their lowest in three decades.
Since then, Trump has publicly mulled expanding the operation into numerous other cities that he claims Democrats have destroyed, including San Francisco and Oakland.
On social media, Newsom’s provocative press team has responded by highlighting murder rates and other crime statistics from Republican-led states that are far higher than California’s.
But his latest “crime suppression” program also provides an opportunity to get ahead of Trump and show that California is already taking action with an approach that Newsom claims is highly effective. Last year, CHP officers made more than 9,000 arrests, recovered nearly 5,800 stolen vehicles and confiscated more than 400 firearms in Bakersfield, Oakland and San Bernardino, according to the governor’s office.
“These crime suppression teams will provide critical support to our local partners by focusing on crime where it happens most,” CHP Commissioner Sean Duryee said in a statement. “By combining resources, intelligence, and personnel, we can better disrupt criminal activity and strengthen the safety and security of communities across California.”
Newsom and Trump are in the midst of an ongoing struggle over the president’s deployment of National Guard troops and Marines into Los Angeles earlier this summer to quell fierce protests against immigration enforcement. The governor sued to stop what he alleges was an illegal military action, and though most of the troops have since been demobilized, a potentially precedent-setting case is still ongoing.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/081324_CHP_FM_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-28 13:57:21.090830

The president called 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson’s ruling itself “unconstitutional” in a post on social media Wednesday. He also urged Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature to push back. 
“How did such a wonderful Republican State like Utah, which I won in every Election, end up with so many Radical Left Judges?” Trump said in the post. 
Like several Utah Republicans did in reaction to the ruling Monday, Trump insinuated it was a result of an “activist Judiciary, which wants to take away our Congressional advantage, and will do everything possible to do so.” 
Judge orders Utah Legislature to draw new congressional maps

Gibson was appointed to the bench by former Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, in 2018. The Republican-supermajority Senate voted unanimously to confirm her without controversy. 
The day of her confirmation, Nov. 14, 2018, on the Senate floor, Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, called her an “extremely impressive candidate.” Weiler — chair of the Senate Judicial Confirmation Committee that favorably recommended her appointment — quipped lightheartedly at the time that he was told “by one of the smarter attorneys I know (that) ‘if we didn’t confirm her we were all a bunch of idiots.’” He said he agreed. 
Gibson received her Juris Doctor degree from the University of Utah’s S.J. Quinney College of Law in 1996. After she graduated, she worked as a law clerk at the Utah Court of Appeals before joining the law firm of Parsons Behle & Latimer, a top law firm with multiple locations in Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana and Nevada. 
Gibson’s ruling this week came more than two years after she initially dismissed the claim that the Legislature overstepped when it repealed and replaced a 2018 voter-approved initiative, Proposition 4. That initiative came from an effort known as Better Boundaries, which sought to create an independent redistricting commission with the purpose of preventing partisan gerrymandering in Utah. Gibson, however, also denied a request to throw out the lawsuit entirely. 
The plaintiffs in the anti-gerrymandering lawsuit then asked the Utah Supreme Court to weigh in on the case. Last year, the Utah Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion that reversed Gibson’s earlier dismissal and sent the case back to district court for further proceedings. 
A judge has ruled Utah’s congressional map unconstitutional. What now?

That Utah Supreme Court ruling made clear that lawmakers do not have unfettered power to repeal or change all types of ballot initiatives, and that if they make changes that “impair” a “government reform” initiative, they must show they are “narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest.” 
While criticizing that ruling, Utah Republicans argued the Utah Constitution’s plain language requires the Legislature to carry out the task of redistricting; Gibson’s ruling said the term “Legislature” in that provision “does not exclude the legislative power of the people.” 
“Neither the U.S. Constitution nor the Utah Constitution grants sole and exclusive authority over redistricting to the Legislature,” Gibson wrote. “Because legislative power is shared co-equally and co-extensively between the Legislature and the people, and because redistricting is legislative, the people have the fundamental constitution right and authority to propose redistricting legislation that is binding on the Legislature.”
The ruling comes as a redistricting arms race is unfolding across the nation as Trump looks to grow Republicans’ slim majority in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
For years, Utah’s four U.S. House seats have been reliably Republican, especially after the Utah Legislature went through their last redistricting process in 2021. 
A redistricting arms race is unfolding. A looming court ruling may push Utah into the spotlight

That year, Utah lawmakers used SB200, the law they replaced the Better Boundaries initiative with to turn the independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore. They did just that when they adopted their congressional map in 2021 that the courts have now deemed unconstitutional. 
Though states like Texas and California have engaged in rare, mid-decade redistricting, Utah’s redistricting process is court ordered — and it has the potential of turning at least one of Utah’s four U.S. seats competitive for Democrats for the first time in years. 
Trump urged Utah Republicans to make sure that doesn’t happen. 
“This incredible State sent four great Republicans to Congress, and we want to keep it that way,” the president continued. “The Utah GOP has to STAY UNITED, and make sure their four terrific Republican Congressmen stay right where they are!”

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Even the judge was smiling by the end of Cozy Dietrich’s adoption hearing.
Cozy had been in foster care longer than any other person in Arkansas’ foster system — until Monday morning, when Anna and Tim Dietrich of Little Rock adopted the nonverbal 19-year-old. He took his new family’s last name.
An atmosphere of joy dominated the small Pulaski County Circuit Court hearing room where his adoption was finalized. When Circuit Judge Tjuana Byrd Manning brought the hearing to a close, the celebration started. The lights dimmed, and court staff — Manning included — pulled out flashing, multi-colored lights as Justin Timberlake’s “Don’t Stop the Feeling” played over the courtroom’s speakers and the standing-room-only audience clapped and cheered.
For many, the celebration was warranted. Cozy entered foster care in October 2010, and has been available for adoption since October 2011, according to a Department of Human Services spokesperson. In all, Cozy spent nearly 15 years in Arkansas’ foster system.
Anna Dietrich said she and her husband had always been open to adopting, but had been waiting for the right person. Anna Dietrich has long worked within the state’s foster system as a logistics coordinator for Project Zero, an Arkansas nonprofit dedicated to placing every child in a loving, permanent home.
Cozy’s disabilities meant having a family “with understanding, patience, and love would be instrumental in supporting” him, according to his Project Zero Heart Gallery page. The Heart Gallery has profiles of adoptable children in Arkansas to help match them with adoptive families.
“To say yes to one was to say no to others,” Anna Dietrich said. “The Lord was going to have to make it clear who was ours. He’s just made it abundantly clear.”
Cozy is their first child.
The Dietrichs were clearly thrilled about the adoption. Anna could be seen beaming at her new son as he ate peanut butter crackers and communicated via hand signals with a companion in the front row of the small gallery before the adoption hearing started.
Newly-confirmed Department of Human Services Secretary Janet Mann also attended and choked up after the hearing when congratulating the Dietrich family.
“This is what we all work for,” she said. “This is the inspirational example of how every child deserves a family.”
Not every foster child goes up for adoption. According to Tiffany Wright, the director of DHS’ Division of Child and Family Services, the vast majority that enter the foster system return to their families, but roughly 200 are currently waiting for adoptive families.
In fiscal year 2023, the most recent year with available data, over 36,000 children nationwide remained in foster care despite being available for adoption, according to the National Council for Adoption. Of the more than 184,000 children who exited the nation’s foster care systems that year, 27% were adopted.
“Youth who enter care often endure trauma or have medical conditions that make finding a family hard, but we will never give up. We work to identify an appropriate family that can provide for a child in the long term. That’s what happened in today’s case,” Wright said.
Cozy’s adoption was also significant due to who his adoptive parents were.
“Anna has championed and featured children in the Heart Gallery, and works hard to find adoptive families for them,” Wright  said. “There are countless children living happy lives with adoptive families across our state because of the work of Anna and Project Zero.”
Adopting a child isn’t as straightforward as filling out a form, Wright said. It’s a long process that involves home inspections, information sharing with interested families and transitional visits. Even when a suitable family is identified, adoptees also have to have lived with them for a certain period of time before the adoption can be finalized.

(Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.
Honoring slain Minnesota leader, Maine House speaker makes plea not to normalize political violence

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

‘Hold people accoutable’
Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.










I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact. 


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat


During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
“What is your ‘why?'”
Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
State leaders brace for ‘heavy lift’ from Medicaid, food stamp changes

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

“Defendants rehash the same general arguments about the importance of immigration enforcement they presented during the Preliminary Injunction Hearing,” U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida wrote Wednesday night.
“As Defendants provide no new evidence or argument about the particular dangerousness of the detainee population at the TNT site or the need for a detention facility in this particular location, the Court will not repeat the shortcomings of Defendants’ claims here.”
Judge Williams’ decision came six days after she ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the detention facility, and after a published report surfaced on Wednesday that it might soon be shutting down.
Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had said in their request for a stay of that order that, if carried out, it would disrupt the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws.
“Without this facility and its detention capacity, many of these individuals would either be released back into the community or not arrested at all, placing significant strain on local communities,” said Garrett Ripa, Miami field office director for the DHS.
“The inability to detain criminal aliens due solely to a lack of detention space creates a serious public safety risk. Notably, it is estimated that among the millions of aliens who entered the United States under the previous administration, one in four provided a release address in the State of Florida. “
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, as well as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida — filed a lawsuit against the state and federal government immediately after they announced plans for the facility at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Collier County.
They contended the government failed to conduct the environmental assessments required by the National Environmental Policy Act before constructing and operating the facility.
In a ruling made last Thursday, Judge Williams ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the facility and gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage, and waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
Detainees are now being moved out of Alligator Alcatraz
Meanwhile, Florida Division of Emergency Management executive director Kevin Guthrie told a rabbi in South Florida in an email on Aug. 22 that “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” according to a report published Wednesday by the Associated Press.
Rabbi Mario Rojzman, and an executive assistant for the rabbi who’d corresponded with Guthrie, confirmed to the AP Guthrie’s emailed response.
In a statement sent to the Phoenix, a DHS spokesperson acknowledged the agency is transferring detainees out of the Everglades facility. “DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities. We will continue to fight tooth-and-nail to remove the worst of the worst from American streets.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis said the reduction in detainees at the facility is being led by DHS.
“DHS is taking people out of there and they’re moving them out,” the governor said during a press conference in Orlando on Wednesday. “Our role is to provide more space for processing detention leading into deportation. DHS determines who goes into those facilities, and who goes out of those facilities.”
He added that there remains a need for more detention centers to hold immigrants without documentation arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and that construction continues for a second such facility in northeast Florida’s Baker County that could hold up to 1,300 detainees.
It’s not known how many detainees are being held at the Everglades facility.
ICE decides ‘everything’ happening at facility, says congressman 
Orlando Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost said in a legal document that he visited Alligator Alcatraz on Aug. 20 and was told by a site manager that around 350 detainees remained on site, that ICE has advised that it now only needs space for 72-hour holds of detainees, and that ICE decides “everything” that occurs at the facility.
Attorneys for the state have filed a motion with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit seeking a stay of Judge Williams’ preliminary injunction issued last week.

(Alex Wilson/Courtesy photo)WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — West Virginia continues to be woefully short on child care: multiple counties don’t have a single child care provider, and other counties have limited spots. 
Child care providers are struggling to stay afloat, and parents have to grapple with the price tag. The average cost of child care in West Virginia is about $800 per month for one child, according to research from the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce.
Meanwhile, there’s been little to no action from state lawmakers or the governor on the issue as more than 150 child care providers have closed their doors over the last few years. 
The issue was highlighted at the chamber’s annual Business Summit, which continues this week at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs. Panelists laid out challenges and potential solutions at the discussion, linking the problem to the state’s low workforce participation rate.
“It’s been one of the things that we’ve been focused on in the legislature for several years now, trying to move the ball forward,” said Brian Dayton, vice president of policy and advocacy for the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce. He noted that Toyota Manufacturing in Putnam County recently announced they’ll open a child care facility for 240 children by 2027.
“But that’s not enough. We’ve got to be doing some other things,” Dayton said.
Sarah Bolyard is president and CEO of YMCA of the Kanawha Valley, which operates a child care facility in Cross Lanes that serves around 300 children ages six weeks to 12. Like many child care facilities in West Virginia, Bolyard’s program takes children using the state’s income-based child care subsidy program or parents who are working or in school.
“At our Cross Lanes YMCA child care facility, we lost $147,000 last year,” she said, explaining that the centers have to stay open with the correct staff ratio every day. “We do lose money to the state when we take children that are on subsidy. And, so that’s where the challenge lies.”
She continued, “It is expensive for a family, but as a provider, we are still losing significant amounts of money every year to be able to operate. 
Jason Moss, head of new government initiatives at Wonderschool, said the tech company is trying to address the affordability challenges in West Virginia. Wonderschool operates in a dozen states around the country. 
“What started in Michigan as a pilot in three counties, is now statewide. It saved $8.5 million in tuition,” Moss said. 
The state recently rolled out its tri-share program, operated by Wonderschool, which divides the cost of child care among the employer, the employee and the state. It’s currently piloted in eight counties: Boone, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Mason, Putnam, Roane and Wirt. 
Recently, Roane General Hospital became the first hospital to join the state’s tri-share model initiative. 
Moss said his company’s research showed that about half of West Virginia businesses interviewed said child care challenges frequently or very frequently affected their employees’ ability to work. 
“The other thing that was sort of interesting that came out of this is that 70% said they were currently not doing anything to support those child care challenges,” he added. “[Tri-share] is one of many solutions, but this is something that really, right now, we can get a lot of traction in to start to help to address this.”
Child care bills stalling out at the statehouse
This year, lawmakers passed zero legislation focused on improving child care in the state. A similar thing happened in 2024.
“’We’re still struggling to get some traction in the legislature,” Dayton said.
There were a number of child care measures introduced this year, particularly in the House, that never made it to up for a vote. One bill would have required the state to partner with child care employers to offset their employees’ child care costs. The program is meant to help centers retain workers and keep classrooms open. 
“Frankly, not a lot of traction on it yet,” said Del. Bob Fehrenbacher, R-Wood, who spoke on the panel and introduced child-care bills during the most recent legislative session. 
“There are multiple reasons why I think this is wise for our state. And, if we were to look at it on a macro level, I think $1 spent on childcare will be well spent and the benefit to West Virginia,” he added.
Most of the child care bills require state dollars, which contributed to their failure due to budget constraints.
The state Chamber of Commerce has pushed for child care changes, including taking the tri-share program statewide and expanding tax credits for employer-sponsored child care.
Boyles proposed updating the state’s “archaic billing” system, as she described it, for parents using West Virginia’s child care subsidy program. Her center bills the state for children based on the days they attend then reduces the parent’s portion of the price. It’s currently based on an hourly increment, but she said they need to be able to bill on a true daily rate. 
“A child could come to our facility 15 times. We could transport them from school, we fed them, we staffed for them to be there. And, we may only be able to bill a parent four days because of the conversion,” Boyles explained. “So, then there is a pocket of money that we are losing because we are not allowed to receive that from the parents, and then from the state as well. So that’s where the losses lie.”
She added that the system is all hand-written, also adding to the inefficiency of the state’s billing system.

(Photo courtesy of Graham for Senate)Democrat Graham Platner, the oyster farmer trying to oust Maine’s long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2026, announced Thursday that his campaign has raised $1 million in his first nine days in the race.
According to his campaign, Platner’s average donation was $33 dollars, with 98% of donations under $100. His campaign has also recruited more than 2,700 volunteers who will help with phone banking, text banking, and door knocking operations.
“I am completely humbled and frankly overwhelmed by the support we have gotten in just over a week,” Platner said in a statement. “We are truly building something special here in Maine, and I am honored that it is powered by tens of thousands of small contributions, and not a single corporate PAC check.”
Collins told Maine Morning Star in the spring she intends to run for reelection in 2026, and although she has yet to officially launch a campaign, she raised $2.4 million to close the quarter with more than $5 million on hand.
According to the latest Federal Election Commission filings as of June 30, Democratic candidate Jordan Wood, a progressive former congressional aide, had raised the most of Collins’ challengers, $1.6 million. The sole independent candidate, Phillip Rench of Waterboro, had raised the next most, just over $54,000.
Platner, a military veteran, had been unknown in politics before announcing his bid for U.S. Senate last week, which is the case for most of the candidates that have entered the race so far.
But Platner’s splashy campaign launch in the The New York Times and team of progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats has set him apart. He’s pitched progressive ideas but rejected the label of liberal, while embracing a working man’s appeal to supporters of President Donald Trump.
Platner was reportedly scouted by unions, while establishment Democrats in Washington, D.C., have been trying to convince Maine Gov. Janet Mills to run. She’s still unsure but said Tuesday that she’d likely decide by mid-November.
Platner has teamed up with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson for an upcoming Labor Day rally in Portland.

According to state records, Dr. Kumar Bobba of Clive, a cardiologist who has worked in central and eastern Iowa, had his clinical privileges suspended in April 2023 by the Veterans Health Care System, which is the network of medical facilities run by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Bobba then had his privileges revoked in October 2023, and his termination from the system was recommended, according to the board.
The board has not publicly disclosed the reasons for those actions. Federal records indicate Bobba was working for VA Central Iowa Health Care at the time.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board also claims that in March 2024, Bobba “received verbal notification of a suspension of privileges” from a medical provider the board has opted not to identify in public filings. Bobba subsequently resigned from that organization, according to the board.
In late March 2024, Bobba submitted his application for a permanent Iowa medical license. It’s not clear from the publicly available board records which type of medical license Bobba had been working under while in Iowa, although doctors licensed by the VA are authorized to work in any state, overriding any conflicting state licensing requirements.
Civil court records indicate Bobba had issues prior to the action taken by the Veterans Health Care System. In 2009, he was sued by a former employer, Cardiovascular Medicine, which alleged Bobba had violated a no-compete clause in his contract after he was fired.
According to a trial brief filed by Cardiovascular Medicine, Bobba had been placed on unpaid leave in July 2008, which the company alleged was “due in part to Dr. Bobba’s suspension of catheterization laboratory privileges at Trinity Hospital at Terrace Park in Bettendorf, Iowa, and Trinity West in Rock Island, Illinois.”
After being on leave for four months, Bobba was “terminated with cause” from Cardiovascular Medicine, according to court records.
The company subsequently lost its lawsuit against Bobba, with a judge ruling the harm caused to Bobba by the no-compete contract outweighed any harm that might be suffered by the company.
According to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, Bobba’s physician and surgeon license in Illinois, which expired in 2023, was “placed in permanent inactive status” earlier this month “due to a violation of his October 2021 IDFPR Care, Counseling and Treatment Agreement.”
The Iowa Board of Medicine recently agreed to grant Bobba a permanent Iowa medical license subject to one year of probation that will include a practice monitoring program. Bobba will be required to meet with the practice monitor for at least one hour each week for the first month of probation, and then once per month thereafter, to discuss his practice and address any areas of concern.
The practice monitor is to inform the board immediately of any evidence of professional incompetency, practice harmful or detrimental to the public, delays in completing medical records, alteration of medical records, improper disposal or reuse of medications, or any violation of the terms of his probation agreement.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Bobba for comment on the matter. Bobba’s attorney, Michael Sellers, said he was not familiar with any past disciplinary issues involving Bobba and was unable to comment on the matter.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida TaxWatch is calling for annual efficiency efforts to be enshrined in statute. 
The business-oriented nonpartisan group points to earlier such efforts, like in 2006 when Florida voters added to the Constitution an efficiency task force to convene every four years, and, earlier this year, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ creation of a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 
DeSantis’ executive order establishing DOGE sunsets in March 2026, “leaving continuity uncertain across administrations,” TaxWatch said in a report, calling the local government audits “music to our ears.”
TaxWatch advocates for new laws requiring the governor to “include explicit efficiency and cost-saving items, informed by the Auditor General, [the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability], the [Government Efficiency Task Force], agency inspectors general, state agencies, and credible outside institutions such as Florida TaxWatch, and would require the Legislature to consider these items during appropriations.”
The constitutional amendment, which contained other language related to budgets, passed with more than 59% voter approval. It established the efficiency task force. 
“Florida TaxWatch firmly believes that, if government efficiency is important enough to the taxpayers to be enshrined in our state constitution, then it should be important enough to the legislature to be enshrined in Florida Statutes,” TaxWatch wrote. 
Despite every-four-year audits, “Recent cycles have shown diminished scope and public tracking,” TaxWatch said. 
DeSantis’ executive order followed efforts by President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk to look over government contracts and spending.
“Florida has proven ideas, demonstrated wins, and active tools; now it needs permanence. By embedding efficiency into the annual budget cycle — backed by transparent tracking and regular reporting — the state can convert sporadic initiatives into sustained savings and better service delivery for taxpayers,” Florida TaxWatch wrote.

Credit: Keith SchubertThe Montana Republican Party has hired Andrew Pierce as its executive director, the party announced Thursday.
Pierce’s pick fills the vacancy created by the departure earlier this month of political consultant Tyler Newcombe, who took a role in the state auditor’s office.
“We’re thrilled to have Andrew directing our party at this critical time,” Montana GOP Chairman Art Wittich said in a statement. “Republicans have the support of more Montanans than ever, and we will harness that momentum to keep the victories coming.”
Pierce graduated Hillsdale College, a small conservative Christian college in Michigan, in 2020. He worked there as an associate editor for the college’s Churchill Project, an award-winning oral history and book research project, and as research assistant to the college president.
According to the party, he also worked as a communications intern for former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-NE, and has extensive political experience and will manage the state GOP’s operations as it prepares for the 2026 election cycle and the 2027 Legislature.
He will begin in his new role on Sept. 8.
“I’m deeply honored to have been chosen by Chairman Wittich and the Executive Board to serve the Republican Party of the best state in the union. I look forward to working with Republican officials and members to build on MTGOP’s successes,” Pierce said in a statement.
Under the new leadership of Wittich, who was elected by the party for a two-year term in June, and Pierce, the party has a stated goal to deliver a conservative agenda mandated by voters and make Montana “an even brighter red state.”
“At their best, political parties serve both as local civic associations that amplify their communities’ concerns and as a statewide, unifying force that ensures voters get the policies they voted for. Parties act as the civic glue connecting citizens to their elected officials, empowering ordinary people to participate in self-government without needing to hold office,” Pierce said. “Parties also reinforce a vital safeguard: accountability. If elected officials disregard the principles or platform mandated by voters, both the party and voters have means to hold them accountable.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2500-scaled-e1740418565165-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-08-28 12:57:31.432817

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The executive branch of Arkansas state government will limit its remote work policy and extend its office hours, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in a Thursday news release.
Remote work became typical when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, but this “inefficient” policy will end Oct. 1, Sanders said.
“Modern technology is excellent and gives us great flexibility during emergencies, but state employees serve our citizens best when they collaborate in person,” she said in the news release. “Similarly, we will encourage in-person meetings instead of virtual meetings to foster clearer communication and face-to-face interaction. There will always be a place for remote work and virtual meetings, but they cannot be the norm.”
All state government offices will now be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, the news release states. The governor also announced flexible and alternative work schedules to allow for coverage of all duties within the new office hours. 
The policy change is the latest step in the Arkansas Forward government efficiency initiative, Sanders said. The project also led to the state employee pay plan overhaul that went into effect July 1.
Sanders announced the plan in November 2024, saying more than 14,000 state employees would receive pay raises that would make their salaries competitive with the private sector and improve recruitment and retention in hard-to-fill positions.
Arkansas legislative subcommittee will vote next week on proposed $139M employee pay plan

“Arkansas Forward also identified at least $300 million in cost savings and avoidance throughout state government,” the news release states.
Additionally, state employees will be allowed to bring their children between 4 weeks and 6 months of age to their workplaces with approval from their supervisors, according to the news release. Sanders’ office and the Department of Human Services piloted the Infants at Work policy before extending it to the entire executive branch.
“Working moms and dads are a critical component of our workforce, and I want to make sure we provide additional options for families to have flexibility and not have to choose between staying home with their infant or returning to work,” said Sanders, a mother of three.

The federal government has struck an agreement with 24 states, including Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, to release the remainder of $6.8 billion in education funds frozen earlier this summer.
The U.S. Department of Education agreed to release any remaining funds between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 to resolve a lawsuit co-led by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and his counterparts in California, Colorado, and Massachusetts. The suit was filed July 14 in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office joined the lawsuit, which commonwealth education advocates lauded.
According to an analysis by Education Week, the $230 million due Pennsylvania was the sixth largest amount among the states after California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois.
As for other states, Rhode Island stood to lose around $29 million under the freeze, funds that were supposed to cover programs like after school and summer offerings, teachers’ professional development, English language acquisition, and adult education.


The state Education Department  provided estimates of the impact on commonwealth schools and other organizations that receive the funds:

Title I-C, Migrant Education, $11 million
Title II-A, Supporting Effective Instruction, $70 million
Title III-A, English Language Acquisition, $20 million
Title IV-B, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, $54 million
Adult Education Basic Grants to States, $20 million



Neronha praised the multistate coalition’s success in a Tuesday statement.
“Because of our lawsuit and immense public pressure, billions in critical education funding will rightfully be restored to fund a wide range of important educational programs, without which the growth and enrichment of our young people would be stifled,” Neronha said. “That said, our victory in this case must be put into context: this funding was not the President’s to withhold in the first place.”
The joint agreement appears to conclude a saga that began on June 30, when federal officials notified state-level school departments nationwide that the funds were being clawed back. On July 13, the day before the lawsuit’s filing, the feds relented slightly and released about $1.3 billion tied to Title IV-B grants, the only federal funding source for afterschool and summer learning programs. About $6.5 million of that money went to Rhode Island.
The feds promised to release the remainder of the funds by July 25, with disbursements expected to arrive sometime over the week of July 28. The new joint agreement notes that the “First Tranche” of funds did arrive the week of July 28, and it ensures that any remaining funds, which it labels the “Second Tranche” of subsidies, will arrive by the dates specified in October.
But, the agreement text makes it clear, the feds and Neronha do not see eye to eye on the original withholding’s legality.
“Defendants do not concede that any of Plaintiffs’ claims are meritorious, but nevertheless intend to make the Second Tranche of funds available on or about October 1, 2025, but no later than October 3, 2025,” the agreement reads.

Michigan Democrats joined with health care professionals this week to warn that Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers’ support for Medicaid cuts would endanger health coverage for hundreds of thousands of Michiganders and put rural hospitals at risk of closure.
Rogers, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, is the lone Republican candidate ahead of the August 2026 primary and is considered a key to the GOP holding on to control of the U.S. Senate in the midterm elections.
During a virtual press conference Wednesday hosted by the Michigan Democratic Party, state Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores), chair of the Senate Health Policy Committee, joined three physicians in condemning Rogers’ support for GOP-backed tax and health care policies that would significantly reduce Medicaid funding.
“Mike Rogers is campaigning on Medicaid cuts that put hundreds of Michiganders in danger of losing their healthcare and risk rural hospital closures throughout the state,” Hertel said. “His toxic agenda represents a fundamental threat to our families’ health and economic security and Michigan’s rural communities.”

In response, Rogers’ campaign pushed back, arguing that reforms are needed to prevent misuse of public programs.
“If the Democrats cared about protecting Medicaid, they wouldn’t want able-bodied Americans and illegal aliens milking the system,” said Alyssa Brouillet, spokesperson for the Rogers campaign. “Mike Rogers will work with the President to strengthen Medicaid for the Michiganders who truly need it while continuing historic investments in rural healthcare.”
The GOP talking point that undocumented immigrants are receiving Medicaid is not based in reality, with the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy noting that not only are those who are in the country illegally ineligible for traditional Medicaid, many legal immigrants are also unable to receive services. Additionally, a study by the Urban Institute found that just 2% of Medicaid enrollees neither worked nor were enrolled in school and reported a lack of interest in a job as a reason for not working.
Health professionals echoed Democrats’ concerns about Rogers’ position, pointing to the potential for increased costs and reduced access to care.
“Mike Rogers’ support for these Medicaid cuts is a moral failure,” said Dr. Aisha Harris, a family physician in Flint and founder of Harris Family Health. “As physicians, we took an oath to ‘do no harm.’ Mike Rogers’ policies violate that fundamental principle.”

Dr. Warren Lanphear, an emergency physician in Grand Rapids and past president of the Michigan College of Emergency Physicians, warned that Medicaid cuts would burden working families and benefit the wealthy.
“Mike Rogers’ reckless agenda will drive up costs for Michigan families while padding the pockets of millionaires like himself,” Lanphear said. “Our patients and our communities can’t afford Mike Rogers’ Medicaid cuts.”
According to the Michigan Democratic Party, Rogers’ support for the Republican tax and spending law known as the One Big Beautiful Bill, includes $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, potentially slashing health care coverage for hundreds of thousands across the state. The party also cited projections of a 15% increase in health care premiums and nearly $1 billion in lost revenue for Michigan hospitals if the policy were enacted.
Rogers, a former U.S. Representative from mid-Michigan, is seeking a return to Washington as he campaigns for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat. 
On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed and research specialist Rachel Howard are seeking the Democratic nomination.
The Cook Political Report currently ranks the race as a “toss up”.

Attorney General Marty Jackley declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination earlier this summer, and state Rep. Casey Crabtree, R-Madison, has filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. The House seat will be up for grabs in next year’s election because Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson is running for governor.

Mawhiney said in a news release that he believes “folks are tired of politics.” He’s running because he intends to give South Dakota families a stronger voice in Washington, D.C.
“I believe we deserve someone who understands our daily lives — someone who will always put people ahead of politics,” Mawhiney said. “I represent the families who have entrusted their children with the programs I’ve led and the communities who’ve never had someone like them at the table.”
Two Sioux Falls Democrats voiced support in the announcement: former South Dakota state Rep. Linda Duba and state Senate Minority Leader Liz Larson.
“From his advocacy alongside tribal voices to his leadership on child care and education, I am confident South Dakotans can rely on him to show up,” Larson said. “He understands rural communities in a way that is so rare.”

I don’t have any really good Katrina stories to tell.
Thinking about Katrina, even 20 years later, still freaks me right the hell out.
Many people will be remembering the storm on Aug. 29. I promise you, I will be doing my best not to think about it. Katrina in one way or another consumed years of my adult life, personally and professionally.
Honestly, I wish I had not volunteered a few months back to write this column. But I did my job after Katrina, and I’ll do it now.
I was a reporter/editor for the Sun Herald in 2005, basically Capitol bureau chief covering the Legislature and state government, splitting time between Jackson, the Coast and Hattiesburg. I had recently moved from the Coast to Hattiesburg — for reasons I’ll get to later — and I spent much time burning up U.S. 49 going to and fro.
One of the clearest early recollections I still have of Katrina is being at the Sun Herald the day before, getting ready to head back to Hattiesburg with a couple of newspaper staffers who planned to ride it out at my house (Hattiesburg, as we and the National Guard soon discovered, wasn’t far enough away). Someone was going through the newsroom saying, “Hey, y’all, look at this.”
They had a copy of “The Bulletin,” as it’s now known. They said something like, “I think the National Weather Service is telling us to kiss our butts goodbye.”
The NWS bulletin, in all caps, said in part: “URGENT … DEVASTATING DAMAGE EXPECTED … MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS PERHAPS LONGER … PERSONS PETS AND LIVESTOCK EXPOSED TO THE WINDS WILL FACE CERTAIN DEATH IF STRUCK … POWER OUTAGES WILL LAST FOR WEEKS … WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS … DO NOT VENTURE OUTSIDE!”
Well, most of us had covered hurricanes before. Some longer-time staffers had been through many. And while we knew Katrina was going to be bad, we thought that NWS communique was downright weird, perhaps a bit too alarmist.
But it was prophetic.
Even 70 miles inland, Katrina was terrifying. But my memories of the actual storm have grown fuzzy. I do remember heading out well before dawn the next morning, trying to make it to Jackson in time for a helicopter sortie of state officials and media Gov. Haley Barbour had arranged to view the damage on the Coast. It took me forever to maneuver around trees across the highway or wait as crews cut paths. Early on, the radio news loop kept saying New Orleans had been spared major destruction.
But as the sun came up and I got closer to Jackson, new reports started coming in that Louisiana and New Orleans were hit hard, levees had been breached and New Orleans was seeing massive flooding.
My heart sank. At the time, I was as worried about the fate of New Orleans — particularly Ochsner Medical Center — as I was Mississippi.
My first wife, Jennifer, had at the time recently been placed on the heart transplant list at Ochsner. We were living in Hattiesburg to be near family who were helping and still be close enough to Ochsner to rush there when a donor heart became available.
The helicopter flight over the Coast that morning was surreal and horrifying. It looked like, as Gov. Barbour said that day, an atomic bomb had gone off, or the hand of God had wiped large swaths of the Coast away.
Communications after Katrina were crap. Cellphone service was worse than spotty, and I hadn’t been able to reach anyone or have a photographer on the flight with me. I shot photos with a point-and-shoot while white knuckled and leaning out the door of a Huey.
And not having talked with anyone at the Sun Herald, as we flew over the destruction, my mind raced: How many of my colleagues and friends died in this storm? How will the Coast ever recover from this? Did Ochsner hospital survive?
Back on the ground at an Air Guard base in Gulfport, I managed to borrow a satellite phone and talk with my boss at the Sun Herald. Most, but not all, employees had been accounted for, but they were still unable to get in touch with some in Bay St. Louis and Hancock County. It would be a few days before we learned that, miraculously, no newspaper employees had died in the storm, although at least one had family members who perished.

The first few months after the storm are kind of a blur to me now, other than we were very busy. I spent much of my time following Gov. Barbour from Jackson to the Coast to Washington, and at times following President George W. Bush and U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran and others as they tried to figure out a recovery plan and funding.
There were special legislative sessions. Big political fights. I had to spend about a month in D.C. watching Congress dicker over Katrina relief spending.
Ochsner wasn’t destroyed by Katrina, but it went into triage mode, and a lot of staff left. Its transplant unit technically kept running, but … not like normal. We had been assured pre-Katrina that the wait for a donor heart should be six months, tops.
One can’t just jump from one hospital’s transplant list to another. It doesn’t work that way. And you have to be within about two hours of a hospital. At the time, they weren’t doing heart transplants in Mississippi.
It took well over a year for Jennifer to get a heart, and she got sicker and sicker in the meantime, amidst Katrina’s aftermath.
She passed away, from an infection, about a month shy of a year after Katrina.
The official death count for Katrina was 1,833, including 238 in Mississippi. It caused $108 billion in damage, destroyed 104,000 housing units in Mississippi including 51,000 houses.
But those numbers don’t cover collateral damage, or all the anguish that storm caused. Those National Weather Service folks were right. The human suffering was incredible by modern standards.
I really intended to have a different focus with this column — perhaps tell a few journalism war stories, talk about the years-long recovery efforts, heck, maybe even try to write something more uplifting about Mississippians’ famous resiliency, how people “hitched up their britches” and got to work on recovery.
I remember a woman on the Coast at a town hall meeting some time well after the storm opined that she was sick and damned tired of being so resilient.
But as I sat to write this, I couldn’t really dredge up any good Katrina stories.
And I damned sure can’t think of anything good to say about that storm, other than all storms end, the sun eventually comes out and life goes on.
I’m afraid I just told a bad Katrina story, and I told it poorly. It’s one I haven’t told very often and I don’t intend to any more if I can help it. But I guess it’s my main Katrina story.
I try to forget that storm as much as possible, when not required to think about it for work. I’m ready for this “anniversary” to be over, and I hope my memories of it fade even more.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
Permitting
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.












We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office




State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
Interconnection
Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

All of us who care about the river and who want our children and grandchildren to share the benefits of living near it need to make our voices count.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Members of the Connecticut River Joint Commissions: Speak up now for the Connecticut River.","This commentary is by Sharon Francis, executive director of the Connecticut River Joint Commissions, and James U. McClammer, a commissioner, both of Charlestown, New Hampshire. Francis was a conservation assistant to President Lyndon Johnson, assistant administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and worked for then-Sen. Henry Jackson in writing sections of the National Environmental Protection Act. McClammer is an environmental scientist, who was the senior environmental scientist at the engineering firm Dufresne-Henry, Inc., and has held positions at the Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Department of Agriculture.


We write to our Vermont neighbors with a sense of urgency about forthcoming federal decisions that will affect our great Connecticut River for decades in the future. 
Now is the moment for all who care about the Connecticut River to raise our voices and ensure that future licenses for power production by Great River Hydro from the dams at Wilder, Bellows Falls and Vernon address the effects on river habitats, species, communities, landowners and recreational users. 
We testified on July 17 in Bellows Falls at the public comment session held by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on their draft environmental impact statement for licenses that will define operating conditions for the three hydroelectric facilities for the next 30 to 50 years. 
In reflection on the licensing process, we recognize the importance for the commission to hear, loudly and emphatically, from as many voices as possible before the agency crafts its final license requirements. Today, all of us who care about the Connecticut River and who want our children and grandchildren to share the benefits of living near it need to make our voices count. 
Is boating on the river important to you? Is fishing? How about knowing that Connecticut River fish are not contaminated by toxic substances and that birds and wildlife along the river’s shores are protected? Do you care that riverfront farmers and other landowners lose land due to erosion caused by dams, which also undermines the integrity of roads along the river?
The commission is seeking public comment on its draft before issuing a final environmental impact statement. While the draft identifies some of the adverse effects of hydroelectric production and offers measures to compensate for these effects, we believe that adverse effects are vastly underestimated and many rightful uses of the Connecticut River are ignored. 
It is imperative that additional compensation measures be identified in the final statement and required in the licenses. 
Not all problems and not all future uses of the Connecticut River can be identified 30 to 50 years in the future. Licenses issued now, however, must provide a mechanism to address issues and opportunities during the lifetime of the licenses. 
That’s why we, the Connecticut River Joint Commissions and others, are advocating that the licenses require the establishment of a Mitigation and Enhancement Fund that would be paid for from the profits Great River Hydro generates. It would provide funding to prevent and correct damages to riverfront properties and habitats, conduct relevant studies, and provide opportunities such as trails, picnic sites and boat launches, so the public can directly benefit from our public river.
The Connecticut River Joint Commissions, regional planning commissions, local town officials and others have all developed well-considered plans regarding our shared resource, the Connecticut River. This work should not be sitting on shelves. It deserves to be implemented. 
A company that will control flow in the river for profit should understand its shared partnership with other river users whose interests deserve support, not indifference. For these reasons, we urge that a necessary condition of the future licenses to operate these three dams also  include a mitigation and enhancement fund.
Precedence for such a fund was initiated in 2002 by the owners of the Connecticut River dams upstream at Fifteen Mile Falls, New England Power Company. The fund had an $18 million-limit and accomplished many worthwhile projects carried out by local communities and organizations. 
In the case of the current licenses now sought by Great River Hydro, we recommend a required commitment of at least $1 million per year for the lifetime of the permits. Unmet needs are already well known and documented. Over the next generations, new urgencies and opportunities will inevitably arise. 
Our many years of responsible actions on behalf of the Connecticut River and the people of its valley have prompted our engagement now. We reach out to you because we know that a chorus of concern and hope will be heard better than the voices of a few. 
The comment period is currently open and comments must be submitted before 5 p.m. Thursday. Please join us in advocating a commitment for additional protection and enjoyment of the Connecticut River.

New Mexico officials just announced the application is available for plans to treat saltier, less usable groundwater for other uses. (Danielle Prokop / Source New Mexico)New Mexico officials announced public entities and tribal governments have just over one week to apply for grants for projects to treat saltier water from deep underground, according to a news release Wednesday. 
Officials from the state’s environment department and office of the state engineer told lawmakers last week they planned to roll out the program to distribute $40 million in grants and contracts for brackish water treatment. On Wednesday, the New Mexico Environment Department posted the application materials, which require submission from public entities and tribal governments by Monday, Sept. 8. Companies seeking to enter into a contract can apply through Thursday, Sept. 25. 
Treating less usable underground resources is necessary, officials say, to address the impacts of climate change in New Mexico, already drying rivers and straining fresh groundwater. The hope is desalinated water can be used for drinking water, agricultural supply or for uses in manufacturing. 
“During these times of drought, it is more important than ever to be thinking about new water sources,” State Engineer Elizabeth Anderson said in a statement. “By working collaboratively with local communities, Tribes and other state agencies on the strategic water supply program, we can develop strategies that will help communities respond to drought for years to come.”
Lawmakers established the program, called the Strategic Water Supply, during the legislative session via House Bill 137, which established the fund and furthers the work to try and map New Mexico’s underground water sources. The final bill was much smaller than Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s original pitch, which would have included the uses of oil and gas wastewater and a $500 million price tag. 
Everyone agrees: Big data gaps remain as state explores brackish water market 

According to the announcement, the projects must: Explore, produce or treat brackish water; enhance freshwater resources; align with development goals for local, state or tribal development; and comply with water quality standards. 
“Access to new water supplies is essential for our communities and future,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement announcing the program. “The Strategic Water Supply initiative will not only safeguard our water resources but also support the nation’s transition to renewable energy and advanced manufacturing — providing alternatives to water-intensive processes that deplete our precious freshwater supplies.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Desal_DP-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-08-28 12:00:04.214126

(Photo courtesy of Graham for Senate)Democrat Graham Platner, the Sullivan oyster farmer trying to oust long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2026, announced Thursday that his campaign has raised $1 million in his first nine days in the race. 
According to his campaign, Platner’s average donation was $33 dollars, with 98% of donations under $100. His campaign has also recruited more than 2,700 volunteers who will help with phone banking, text banking, and door knocking operations. 
“I am completely humbled and frankly overwhelmed by the support we have gotten in just over a week,” Platner said in a statement. “We are truly building something special here in Maine, and I am honored that it is powered by tens of thousands of small contributions, and not a single corporate PAC check.”
Collins told Maine Morning Star in the spring she intends to run for reelection in 2026, and although she has yet to officially launch a campaign, she raised $2.4 million to close the quarter with more than $5 million on hand.
According to the latest Federal Election Commission filings as of June 30, Democratic candidate Jordan Wood, a progressive former congressional aide, had raised the most of Collins’ challengers, $1.6 million. The sole independent candidate, Phillip Rench of Waterboro, had raised the next most, just over $54,000.
Platner, a military veteran, had been unknown in politics before announcing his bid for U.S. Senate last week, which is the case for most of the candidates that have entered the race so far. 
But Platner’s splashy campaign launch in the The New York Times and team of progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats has set him apart. He’s pitched progressive ideas but rejected the label of liberal, while embracing a working man’s appeal to supporters of President Donald Trump. 
Platner was reportedly scouted by unions, while establishment Democrats in Washington, D.C., have been trying to convince Maine Gov. Janet Mills to run. She’s still unsure but said Tuesday that she’d likely decide by mid-November. 
Platner has teamed up with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson for an upcoming Labor Day rally in Portland.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-28 15:29:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,A Mississippi city’s tax break spurred post-Katrina building. But will homes stand the next storm?,"Jeff Amy, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/28/tax-break-post-katrina-building/,Beachfront rebuilding on the Mississippi Gulf Coast was slow after Hurricane Katrina. Gulfport began offering property tax breaks to those who built near the water.,"GULFPORT — Rocking on his front porch overlooking the Mississippi Sound, former Gulfport Mayor Billy Hewes questions how anyone wouldn’t want to live there.
“People are always going to gravitate to the water,” he said. “And we have a beautiful waterfront.”
But it was far from certain that people would return after 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, which killed 238 people in Mississippi and left only concrete slabs in many areas. With beachfront rebuilding crawling along a decade later, Gulfport began offering property tax breaks to those who built near the water. Hewes said the goal was for people to “build back better, quicker, help kick-start the economy.”
Where to encourage building is a thorny decision for local governments in areas exposed to floods or wildfires. Despite risks including rising sea levels, places need residents and taxpayers. Like other Gulf Coast cities after Katrina, Gulfport required residents to build at higher elevations and enforced a stronger building code. But most residents near the water are in at least a moderate-risk flood zone. Nationwide, many more homes are being built in flood zones than are being removed.
“The local government was not necessarily thinking we need people to build in this flood-prone place,” Miyuki Hino, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who researches flooding, said of such decisions. “They were thinking we have this land that’s underutilized and we can increase our property tax revenue.”
Storm left a ‘postapocalyptic’ wasteland
Allen Baker lived through 1969’s Hurricane Camille in neighboring Long Beach and thought he knew what to expect after Katrina. But the 2005 storm was far worse. His historic beachfront home was blown to bits by what witnesses said was a tornado spun off by the hurricane.
“Coming back, there was no home,” Baker said.
All along the coast, neighborhoods between the beach and a railroad track just to the north were shredded by a battering storm tide and winds. Recovery was slow for years.
“It was kind of spooky down here,” Baker said. “I mean, it looked like one of your postapocalyptic movies.”
Baker and his wife waited. They didn’t move into a new home until 2016, after Gulfport began waiving city property taxes for seven years when owners invested certain amounts in building south of the railroad tracks. Property owners still had to pay county and school taxes.
Sixty properties received Gulfport’s tax break before the city stopped approving new applicants in 2021, tax records show. The savings weren’t huge, typically $500 to $1,000 a year, depending on property value. But Baker and others said it was a sign to stop hesitating and start building.
“In simple terms, it was a green light,” Baker said.
Steel rods and thick foundations
Not every area has recovered equally. In a lower-lying area on the west side of Gulfport, where rotting chicken and giant paper bales washed up from the port, many lots are still vacant. But one block inland on the east side, attractive new houses mix with structures that survived.
Hewes also benefited from the tax break, building a new home on a beachfront site owned by his family since 1904 — the second-most valuable house built under the program, according to tax records. Hewes said he and his wife used their tax savings to build stronger.
“We put a lot more money into actually hardening this home to a much higher standard,” Hewes said.
Baker’s current house also exceeds Gulfport’s building code, with steel rods inside walls that tie into a 3-foot-thick concrete foundation and fasten down the roof. That qualified the home for an insurance industry standard called “fortified,” which provides savings on expensive wind insurance. But only 1,500 homes in Mississippi have fortified status, according to the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety. That compares with 9,000 in Louisiana and 50,000 in nation-leading Alabama.
Baker, who became a civil engineer after flying airliners, argues beachfront areas need an extra-strict building code.
“Everything about this house is built to be punished,” he said. “If you seriously want to live in this environment, you have to plan for that.”
Some progress, but not enough?
Katherine Egland, a Gulfport resident who chairs the NAACP’s national Environmental and Climate Justice Committee, fears the community may not be prepared for the next big storm.
“I’m not saying we didn’t make some progress,” Egland said. “What I’m saying is we didn’t make nearly the amount of progress that we should have made.”
She still rejects how Mississippi prioritized business recovery and says some development farther inland has worsened rainwater flooding in historically Black neighborhoods. Areas targeted by the tax break are whiter and more affluent than the city overall.
“You’re giving incentives to residents south of the tracks, but at the same time, you are imperiling residents that live north of the tracks,” Egland said.
Most of the first block facing the beach in Gulfport is rated as having a 1% yearly chance of flooding, although what’s called the 100-year flood zone sometimes stretches farther back. The Federal Emergency Management Agency considers almost all of the rest of the area south of the railroad track to have between a 1% and a 0.2% risk of flooding annually. Flood insurance generally isn’t required in that moderate risk area.
Hino said it’s “absolutely true” that elevating a building reduces risk but said risk grows over time with rising sea levels, which could require someone to elevate a house multiple times over decades. And while a 1% yearly risk of flooding sounds low, those odds add up over time.
“Over the course of your 30-year mortgage, you have a 40% chance of flooding,” Hino said.
It’s not unusual that houses were built in a flood zone in Gulfport. From 2001 to 2019, more than 840,000 homes were built in flood plains nationwide, according to a 2024 University of Miami study. That’s in part because the federally subsidized National Flood Insurance Program will repeatedly pay to rebuild, no matter how high the risk
“The incentive for local governments is to build, and in some ways the incentive for people is to stay where they are,” Hino said.
The buyout that didn’t happen
There was a plan to get more people out of Mississippi flood zones. Federal officials considered buying out 2,000 properties at highest risk of being damaged by hurricane storm tides. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projected that a $408 million buyout, in 2008 dollars, would lower potential yearly storm damage by $22 million to $33 million. But Congress never appropriated the money.
Hino said buyouts can create parkland that serves both as an environmental buffer and an amenity. But Hewes said he thinks Gulfport’s choices “may have done more for our recovery than any sort of federal buyout.” He said it took years for Gulfport to productively reuse land from a pre-Katrina buyout along a flood-prone bayou.
“Do you create an area that is blighted, that is abandoned, that is neglected after the fact?” Hewes asked.
Even without the tax break, construction is continuing in beachfront areas. But it may not be clear how successful recovery has been until those new buildings are tested by the next major hurricane.
“Some people have built out of concrete,” Baker said. “Some people have built out of better materials. Some people have not. And those people are going to be in for a shock.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/07030603/J-Ward27.jpg,,,2025-08-28 12:00:04.214126

Free.,"Fed Governor Cook sues Trump, blasts attack on central bank’s autonomy",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fed-governor-cook-sues-trump-blasts-attack-central-banks-autonomy,,"WASHINGTON — Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, sued President Donald Trump Thursday, calling his move to fire her an “unprecedented and illegal attempt” that jeopardizes the independence of the board. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, sets up a fight between the Federal Reserve and the president who has tried to pressure the independent board to lower interest rates. The challenge could go all the way to the Supreme Court. The suit argues that the president’s Monday decision to remove her was political and violated her due process rights because she had no chance to respond to the allegations of mortgage fraud a Trump appointee lodged against her. Cook has not been charged with any crime.“It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook’s purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,” according to the suit. The suit also emphasized the importance of the Fed’s independence from elected officials.“The operational independence of the Federal Reserve is vital to its ability to make sound economic decisions, free from the political pressures of an election cycle,” according to the suit.The case is assigned to Jia M. Cobb. Former President Joe Biden appointed Cobb in 2021. The suit asks the district court to allow Cook to continue serving on the Fed as she challenges her removal. In a statement to States Newsroom, White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the president’s decision to remove Cook.“The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,” Desai said. “The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board’s accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.”Rift highlights policy differences Cook, the first Black woman appointed to the Fed, has consistently voted against lowering interest rates since joining the board in 2022. Her term ends in 2038. If Trump is successful in removing her and is able to nominate a replacement, he could have a majority of Fed members who are aligned with his desire to lower interest rates to boost the economy.Despite Trump’s long-running pressure campaign, the Fed has kept rates steady amid concerns that the president’s tariffs will produce price hikes. The allegations of mortgage fraud stem from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte accused Cook of making a false statement on a mortgage application to obtain a more favorable rate on her second home. He referred the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The suit does not address the merits of the allegations.Pulte has made similar mortgage fraud accusations against two other political enemies of Trump’s: New York Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the president’s business dealings and won a finding of fraud in state court, and California U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, who led the investigation into Trump’s first impeachment inquiry.",,,,2025-08-28 12:00:04.214126

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) OVERLAND PARK — Former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman pushed for deepening relationships and maintaining international growth opportunities for Kansas farmers at a meeting of state political and agricultural leaders Wednesday. 
Glickman and U.S. Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids spoke about the effects of tariffs and federal policies on Kansas farmers during a U.S. Global Leadership Coalition luncheon. The event was closed to journalists, but Glickman shared thoughts on the current political climate afterward. 
“My theory is pretty much don’t burn bridges, build bridges,” he said. “I got along very well with (Pat) Roberts, (Bob) Dole, (Nancy) Kassebaum. We didn’t try to kill each other.”
Glickman, a Democrat, said Dole, a longtime Republican senator, helped him get the position as secretary of agriculture, which he held from 1995 to 2001 during the Clinton administration. 
Politicians need to be able to reach across the aisle and have open discussions and agreements, Glickman said. 
“I hope we can create an environment where there’s trust in the system of government generally, because it’s not just agriculture, it’s everything,” he said. “And then we have some predictability in foreign policy, federal farm policy.”
He would also like to see Republicans stand up to the president, something he said he had to do when he served under Clinton. 
“I’d like to see the Republicans show more courage and moxie in challenging the president – on the federal side, not so much on the Kansas side – when they think he’s wrong,” Glickman said. “It’s difficult to challenge a president if you’re in their party. When I would say to Clinton, ‘I think you’re wrong,’ I would do it very deliberately but still, I would do it at times, and I don’t see very much happening like that.”
National reports that legislators fear retaliation if they speak up aren’t good, Glickman said. 
“I don’t think it’s healthy for democracy. You know, you’ve got to be able to speak out responsibly,” he said.
 
International trade
Building relationships extends beyond domestic politics, and Glickman is concerned international relationships may be impaired because of the way tariffs are being negotiated. He’s not against tariffs in general, he said, but he’s concerned about future trade effects.
“I’ve never been a purist on tariffs and trade,” he said. “I mean, there are some countries that abuse their relationships with us, and that’s why you have tariff agreements and trade agreements, to build those things in there so one country can’t take advantage of another by being too self protective.” 
But Glickman said the way trade barriers are being implemented concerns him. Historically, international policies involved collaboration between Congress and the private sector to determine the best way to proceed, he said.
“Because when you put your finger on one set of problems, if you’re not careful, you’re going to create another set of problems,” Glickman said. “Agriculture has often been the whipping boy for those other sets of problems, because of how much we rely on access to global markets. So I guess my real answer is, can we do this carefully, or do we have to do it with a sledgehammer?”
Right now, the country is relying too much on the sledgehammer, Glickman said.
Growth opportunities in agriculture lie in the international market, he said. 
“The president said something when he announced the original set of tariffs – ‘American farmers are going to love this, because they can finally take advantage of domestic markets,’ and I’m thinking to myself, no, that’s not where the growth is,” Glickman said. “There’s not really much growth in domestic markets. There might be a little here, a little there. All the growth is global, and so maybe he doesn’t understand it.”
Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, attended the luncheon and agreed with Glickman. 
“As Secretary Glickman mentioned, we are becoming less and less of a reliable trading partner to the world,” he said. “Anymore, we are a global market, and you know, you can be upset with another country because maybe they don’t do as much trade with you and all that, but I’ve always believed that the carrot versus the stick does a lot more good.”
Levendofsky said the potential of growing markets such as India are important to Kansas farmers. 
“If China is shutting the door on us, we’ve got to find an opening somewhere,” he said. “And that, to me, right now speaks to India.”
 
 Farm Bill

Along with international trade, Glickman is watching the future of the Farm Bill. The reconciliation bill passed by Congress in July addressed some policies usually found in the Farm Bill, but it didn’t include all the elements that need to be addressed, he said. 
A Farm Bill has not passed this year, and Glickman said expert assessments that this may be the beginning of creating a different process for agricultural legislation is “astute.”
“We’ve had in the last 40 or 50 years, these five-year farm bills,” he said. “But then lately, we’ve been having these extensions every year and with no real fundamental change.”
Recent legislation added $40 to $50 billion of new or enhanced programs over the next 10 years, and also addressed commodity programs, crop insurance and risk management, Glickman said. 
He hopes this won’t be the new normal because there were many subjcts not addressed, such as research and nutrition programs. 
In his role as a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Council on American Politics at George Washington University, Glickman said he keeps in contact with concerns of farmers and trade groups.
The real worry right now is instability, he said.
“The big story in agriculture is lack of stability, lack of planning, lack of predictability,” Glickman said. “Agriculture is complicated, and then the volatile weather complicates it further. Changes in the weather, plant and animal disease, making sure our research budgets are adequately funded – that’s all part of a new Farm Bill.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/glickman-1-20250827_130517-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-28 12:00:04.214126

Michigan won't share private information with the U.S. Justice Department, but it is struggling to share the public portions, a state official said.

The Michigan Department of State is trying to send along a portion of the voter registration data requested by the U.S. Justice Department, but one state official says it’s waiting for the federal government to tell it how.
The state is sending only the part of the voter roll that is accessible to anyone, including names and voting history. It is not including Social Security numbers or other private information, citing federal laws that ban it from sharing that.
But Michigan officials say they can’t send anything if Justice Department officials don’t explain how to securely transfer the records.
The qualified voter file, or QVF, is available to anyone who files a Freedom of Information Act request with the Michigan Department of State. The file is massive — it was nearly three gigabytes when Votebeat last requested it in June, even before including additional documents needed to interpret it — and can be difficult to share. When a member of the public asks for the records, for example, the state provides it in a series of compressed files through its FOIA portal.
The federal government asked for the records to be submitted either by email or through the Justice Department’s file-sharing system. Sending the qualified voter file by email is technically possible, but it’s not secure, and the file size makes it difficult. The Michigan Department of State has been asking the Justice Department since last week how to access its file-sharing system and has received no response, Angela Benander, spokesperson for the Department of State, told Votebeat on Tuesday.
The files, she said, are “ready to go over” as soon as MDOS officials get a username and password.
The Justice Department did not respond immediately to a request for comment from Votebeat.
Communications between the Department of State and the Justice Department show that Khyla Craine, chief legal director for the Department of State, requested information on how to transmit information through the DOJ system. The email, shared with Votebeat, was sent Aug. 21 to Timothy Mellett, a trial attorney with the DOJ’s civil rights division who has been actively involved in other voting-related legal affairs.
Neither Mellett nor any of his colleagues had responded as of Tuesday, Benander said.
“It seems strange that they’re not prepared to help us,” she added.
Other states have also declined to share personally identifying information. Pennsylvania responded to the DOJ similarly last week, offering only its own publicly available file. It is not clear if Pennsylvania had any similar problems sharing its data.
The Justice Department has shown a willingness to sue for access to the more detailed information, as it did in Orange County, California, earlier this summer. But states have argued that sharing the information would be a violation of federal privacy law.
In Michigan, Benander said, lawyers specifically cited the Drivers Protection Privacy Act, which bans states from sharing personal information gathered through the DMV and connected to motor vehicle records. Other laws may also apply, including the Privacy Act of 1974, which requires the federal government to provide a notice of why it is collecting information and how it plans to store it.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Hundreds of Minnesotans jammed into the gymnasium of the Academy of the Holy Angels in Richfield to mourn the loss of two children and injuries to over a dozen others after a shooter opened fire outside Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis Wednesday.
Bernard Hebda, archbishop of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, led the hundreds of mourners through a Catholic prayer service. He told the attendees that the front of the Annunciation Church bore the inscription, “House of God. Gate of Heaven.”
“How is it that such a terrible tragedy could take place in a place that’s the house of God and the gate of Heaven? It’s unthinkable” Hebda said. “But we, brothers and sisters, trust that it’s precisely in that house of God where we’re most at home.”
The mourners packed into the bleachers and stood to the side of the procession. Gov. Tim Walz, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Attorney General Keith Ellison were in attendance.

“We have a God who doesn’t turn away from pain,” Hebda said. Jesus took on pain, Hebda said, because he loves people, even imploring believers in the Gospel of Matthew to “love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”
“(Jesus) loves all of those children who were in that church this morning. He loves their families. He loves the shooter. He loves all of us, brothers and sisters,” Hebda said. 
Michael Thomas, a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, was at the vigil because his 14-year-old son attends Annunciation School and was in the Mass where the shooting took place. His son was unharmed, but Thomas said his son cried when he was reunited with his parents and is still upset because his best friend was shot and is recovering in the hospital.
Thomas said that once he finally had the means to send his children to private school, he jumped at the chance because he thought it would be safer than public school.
“I’d rather send them to a place where I know they’ll be safe at, but as of today that’s changed,” Thomas said.
2 children dead in Minneapolis Catholic church shooting

Lola Abdul, who lives in north Minneapolis, didn’t know anyone personally who attended Annunciation School, but she attended the Richfield vigil because she said as a Catholic, it’s important to “pray with our words and pray with our deeds.”
Local restaurants, including Pizza Lucé, handed out free food to the people leaving the Academy of Holy Angels.
About three miles away, hundreds of other attendees crowded in Minneapolis’ Lynnhurst Park, where the anti-gun violence group Moms Demand Action held a candlelit vigil.
The park was silent.

That’s why VTDigger launched Dirt Road News, a new project focused on understanding how younger and rural Vermonters get their news, what challenges they face, and what local media could do better.

Take the survey

Do you live in a rural Vermont community or small town?
We want to hear from you. While we’re especially hoping to hear from folks under 50, a group we hear from less often, the survey is open to all rural and small-town readers of any age. By listening closely now, we can tell local stories that reflect all of Vermont.
How do you know if you’re rural? Most Vermont towns and small communities qualify. If you’re unsure, you probably are rural enough for this survey!
Your voice matters
We know that every Vermont community is unique. By taking this short survey, you’ll help us:

Learn what topics matter most to you and your neighbors, and how you like to receive that information
Understand the barriers and frustrations to accessing local news
Shape future VTDigger reporting, news products and community engagement

About Dirt Road News
This project goes beyond this survey. We’re also working with local community ambassadors, aka neighbors who are helping us listen and connect, and popping up at trivia nights across the state to gather fresh perspectives in fun, welcoming spaces. You can learn more and follow our project and events by visiting our Dirt Road News page.

It began operations last week. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)The United Auto Workers claimed a narrow victory Wednesday night in a unionization vote at an electric vehicle battery plant in Hardin County, though the election’s outcome remains uncertain because dozens of ballots have been challenged.
A spokesperson for BlueOval SK told the Lantern that workers voted  526-515 in favor of being represented by the union but that 41 challenged ballots had yet to be tabulated, enough votes to potentially change the outcome.
The National Labor Relations Board confirmed the tally Thursday morning and said the challenged ballots “are sufficient to affect the results of the election.”
In an emailed statement, the Detroit-based union claimed a “hard-fought victory” and “a major step forward for workers who stood up against intense company opposition and chose to join the UAW.”
The union said the challenged ballots were “illegitimate” and represented “nothing more than an employer tactic to flood the unit and undermine the outcome.”
“We will fight these challenges to defend the democratic choices of these workers, as we always do when corporations try to interfere with workers’ democratic choice,” the UAW wrote. “The challenged ballots are not part of the group of workers who built their union from the bottom up. They deserve to have their own union, in an appropriate bargaining unit with a representative of their own choosing.”
The union in its statement, issued shortly before midnight, called on Ford Motor Co. to “acknowledge the democratic decision of its workforce” and “drop their anti-democratic effort to undermine the outcome of the election.” BlueOval SK, a massive complex along Interstate 65 in Glendale, is a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and South Korea-based SK On.
Mallory Cooke, a spokesperson for BlueOval SK, in a statement said the outcome of the election would depend on the National Labor Relations Board’s decision of whether the challenged ballots will be counted.
“BlueOval SK will urge the board to count each eligible vote because every voice matters,” Cooke said. “We remain focused on the safety and wellbeing of our team and our commitment to build best-in-class batteries together!”
The preliminary vote must be certified by the National Labor Relations Board to become official. The agency fields and reviews potential objections to ballots and election conduct before certifying the result.
The votes cast over Tuesday and Wednesday culminated a nine-month campaign by the UAW to unionize the electric vehicle battery manufacturing complex, which began production last week. State officials previously described the complex as the “single-largest economic development investment in state history” that would employ 5,000 people when a second planned plant becomes operational.
If the UAW is successful in the election, it would mark another victory for the union after successfully organizing other electric vehicle battery plants including most recently in Indiana. The UAW’s efforts are part of its broader push to unionize electric vehicle battery plants across the country, although organizing in the South has been more challenging.
Tensions had flared leading up to the election between the UAW and the BlueOval SK over workplace safety issues, and the union called on the National Labor Relations Board last month to investigate what it alleged was a “scorched-earth” anti-union campaign by BlueOval SK. The company had denied assertions from workers about workplace safety and had dismissed the UAW’s call for an investigation as a “dishonest tactic.”

(Photo by Arshia Khan for Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Agriculture and Northwest Arkansas Council will conduct a comprehensive water reclamation study to inform the state’s water plan and guide future wastewater infrastructure projects in Northwest Arkansas, the governor’s office announced Wednesday.
The study will be conducted by Hawkins-Weir Engineers, an Arkansas-based firm that will evaluate current infrastructure and provide recommendations for improvements in Northwest Arkansas, a region with a rapidly expanding population. 
“That growth brings opportunity but also new challenges, which is why my administration has stepped up with a complete review of the state water plan and administration of more than $2.6 billion in water system upgrades,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a news release. “This comprehensive study for our state’s fastest-growing region will add to those efforts and help ensure Arkansas can continue to welcome new residents with the resources they expect and need.”
Womack appropriations bill proposes millions for Arkansas infrastructure projects

Sanders issued an executive order in 2023 to initiate a comprehensive review of and update to the Arkansas Water Plan, which guides the state’s management of water resources, quality, supply and demand, according to the release.  
The first plan was published in 1975. It was updated in 1990 and again in 2014. The most recent iteration was intended to guide state leaders through 2050, when it predicted Arkansas would see a 14% increase in water demand. 
Construction in some of Northwest Arkansas’ fastest-growing cities hit a wall last year after the state health department ceased approving any significant new projects until municipalities can increase wastewater capacity at local facilities.
Northwest Arkansas Council President and CEO Nelson Peacock said the region’s ability to grow will depend on how officials plan and invest in critical infrastructure. This wastewater study is the first step in understanding the region’s future needs, he said in the release. 
“Some cities are already constrained by sewer capacity. Without a coordinated strategy, we risk stalled development, public health challenges, and higher costs across the state,” Peacock said. “By planning together, we can ensure every community has the capacity it needs to grow.”

The study will cost $1.049 million and consist of three phases: development, engagement and implementation, according to the release.

Oklahoma's Broadband Office unveiled a proposal to use federal grant money to help connect Oklahomans to high-speed internet. (Photo by Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — Critics are panning a proposal to return $225 million in federal grants earmarked to expand broadband access, saying it would be wrong to send back any funding while Oklahomans across the state continue to struggle to access it.
But the head of the state’s broadband office said everyone who was expected to be served by the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program will still have access as promised. Changes made by the Trump administration in how a key federal program can be implemented means it costs substantially less to connect Oklahomans to broadband access.
Oklahoma was initially allocated $797 million from the federal grant program to connect Oklahomans to high-speed internet. The Oklahoma Broadband Office unveiled its final proposal for using the funding and is seeking public feedback. Because of changes to what technology can be used for broadband expansion projects, costs are estimated to be $225 million lower than expected, which is equivalent to more than a quarter of the total allocation, a state official said. 
Former Oklahoma Rep. Logan Phillips, R-Mounds, said returning these funds is a “slap in the face” to those who spent years creating the Broadband Office and amounts to a “failure” of its mission to connect all Oklahomans to high speed internet. He helped create the Oklahoma Broadband Office during his time in the Legislature.

“The reality is, even if we’ve covered the whole state in one technology, we can upgrade the other ones and prepare ourselves for the next economic and industrial revolution that requires these infrastructure lines,” he said. “This was a once in a 100 year opportunity for Oklahoma to actually get this funding. It’s a tremendous amount of effort from a whole lot of people, and we’re just sending it back.”
Other states will be allocated Oklahoma’s $225 million if it’s sent back, Phillips said. 
“This money was earmarked specifically for us,” he said. “We do not have fiber to the home in every location. Our businesses are unsecured. Our rural communities are not connected.”
Mike Sanders, executive director of the Oklahoma Broadband Office, said returning the funding doesn’t mean that Oklahomans won’t get connected to the internet. It’s that officials don’t need as much money to do it as initially estimated.
“The same number of people will be served in the state of Oklahoma,” Sanders said. “The remaining toughest, hardest places to get, and that’s about 40,000 Oklahomans, will still be served. It will just be with different technology, and at a cost savings of $225 million.”
He said under the initial program developed during the Biden administration, the funding prioritized fiber-optic broadband technology. When President Donald Trump took office, his administration eliminated that “preferred technology,” meaning that states could instead use more cost-effective means like satellite, fixed wireless and other less expensive technologies.
He said they’ve already selected the projects, but those must be approved by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
By October 2026, the Broadband Office expects 95% of Oklahomans to be connected by broadband, Sanders said, with many of those projects funded by money from the American Rescue Plan Act. The remaining 5% of the state will be covered using the funding from the BEAD program and funding. 
“I am cautiously optimistic that NTIA will follow our state’s lead because I do believe this is a very, very well built plan and final proposal,” he said. “But you know, again, the decision is not ours.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
He said his agency will still fund fiber optic projects if it’s the best use of the federal dollars, but in the most difficult to reach areas, which includes large swathes of rural Oklahoma, officials can focus on other technologies, which results in the expected cost savings.
Under the office’s proposal, 65% of BEAD projects will use fiber-optic technology, 20% will be fixed wireless and 15% will use satellite technology, Sanders said. 
He said Oklahoma is not the only state that plans to return funding. About $42.4 billion was allocated nationwide with the goal of connecting all Americans to high-speed internet.
Rep. Justin Humphrey, R-Lane, said Oklahoma’s government should be working with companies to have more “solution oriented” conversations about broadband. He said some constituents he’s talked to have found internet connection themselves through satellite services, like Elon Musk’s Starlink. 
His district includes areas of Oklahoma the Broadband Office has identified as having low percentages of Oklahomans served with broadband access.
“If we expect to draw people to Oklahoma, and we want to build business and we want to build a better economy,” Humphrey said. “People are not going to come to places they can’t get broadband, that they can’t get internet.”
He said Oklahoma isn’t getting its “bang for our buck” when it comes to broadband. 
“We should not be looking at returning $225 million,” he said. “We should be looking at what we are getting for that money.” 
The proposal is open to public comment until Sept. 1 before it is sent to NTIA. People can submit public comment by emailing BEAD@broadband.ok.gov.

“Ward does not seek relief from his death sentence but only from the method by which that sentence is carried out,” the justices wrote. “Because he seeks to litigate his claims only in post-conviction proceedings and none of them attack the validity of his convictions or the sentence imposed, he has not established a reasonable possibility that he is entitled to post-conviction relief.”
Without a stay — which would effectively pause the execution to allow for additional court proceedings — the justices said its their duty to “complete our administrative task to set an execution date.”
Ward’s death sentence is now scheduled to be carried out at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City before sunrise on Oct. 10. The court previously labeled the execution date tentative while justices weighed additional filings.
Larry Komp, an attorney on Ward’s legal team, said the inmate’s counsel “will pursue available remedies as we seek to explore the outrageously costly drug that from all witness accounts did not work last time.”
Execution date set
Ward, 44, was sentenced to death for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County. His case has played out through state and federal courts for more than two decades. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2017.
Indiana justices said Ward may still have “other, viable avenues in state or federal court.” He can also seek clemency from Gov. Mike Braun.
Ward’s scheduled execution would be Indiana’s third in less than a year, following the December execution of Joseph Corcoran and the May execution of Benjamin Ritchie.
The state’s use of pentobarbital in the last two executions has drawn increasing scrutiny. 
Witnesses reported irregular movements during Ritchie’s execution. No members of the media were permitted to witness, however. 
Story continues below.
Order - Execution Deny SPCR
 
Braun said recently that Indiana does not currently have usable lethal injection drugs, and that state lawmakers should debate the future of capital punishment in Indiana in the 2026 session.
The governor said that while he doesn’t “intend to put another [dose] on the shelf” and risk expiration, his office confirmed that additional execution drugs would be ordered when necessary.
In June, the governor disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
Defense team presses for drug details
Ward’s attorneys have filed multiple public records requests with DOC seeking information about what drugs the state intends to use in Ward’s execution, including “whether they are expired, how they are transported and stored, or their potency and sterility.”
But the defense team said there has been “no disclosure regarding the amount of the drug in DOC’s possession” and called the lack of transparency “shocking and unfair.”
In his most recent filings, Ward’s attorneys argued that he should be allowed to pursue a successive post-conviction petition to challenge Indiana’s lethal injection process, citing the problems reported during Ritchie’s execution. 
Ward seeks execution pause over lethal injection concerns; AG argues date should stand

His legal team contended that the Indiana Department of Correction’s refusal to provide public records on the drugs it intends to use “obstructs his ability to challenge the constitutionality of his execution.”
Ward’s counsel also pointed to a separate 2021 case, Isom v. State, noting that method-of-execution claims are not legally ripe until an execution is scheduled.
“Ward has not exhausted all of his available remedies and has properly and timely raised a methods argument that this Court recognized is only legally cognizable now,” his attorneys wrote in an Aug. 18 brief.
The state countered that Ward’s claims were irrelevant to whether an execution date should be set. 
The court agreed, concluding that while Ward “may have other, viable avenues in state or federal court to seek relief on his claims,” they were not grounds for a successive post-conviction petition.
All five justices concurred in denying Ward’s request, though Justice Christopher Goff dissented in part, writing that the execution date should not be finalized until DOC responds to Ward’s records requests.
“This Court should set an execution date after the records request is resolved, so Ward can effectively raise any constitutional issues,” Goff wrote.
He added that allowing the execution to proceed without disclosure “not only prevents the public from having robust, informed, and honest discussion about the death penalty, it also makes public oversight impossible.”
Komp, Ward’s lawyer, said the defense team “remain(s) hopeful that Indiana precedent will be respected, as pointed out by the dissent.”

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in […]","Sun shines through the canopy in the Tongass National Forest. (Photo by Brian Logan/U.S. Forest Service)The U.S. Department of Agriculture, parent agency of the U.S. Forest Service, announced Wednesday that it is moving ahead with plans to rescind a rule that has restricted logging and construction on millions of acres of federal lands in the American West for more than two decades.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a written statement that the agency intends to open public comments Friday on its proposal to end the so-called “Roadless Rule,” an act that will affect as much as 45 million acres of federal land as well as millions of Americans who live near it.
Opening a public comment period is the first step in repealing the rule. According to Rollins’ statement, members of the public will have until Sept. 19 to offer their opinions on the repeal, a timeframe that opponents of the plan denounced as inadequate.
Roads are a key prerequisite for large-scale logging and mining projects, and the rule — enacted in 2001 at the end of the Clinton administration — has limited the number of development projects on Forest Service land.
Rollins’ announcement was expected. She had announced the Trump administration’s intent at a conference of western governors in June. The first Trump administration also attempted to eliminate the Roadless Rule, but that move was halted by lawsuits, and the Biden administration dropped the effort.
In Wednesday’s announcement, Rollins said rescinding the roadless rule would allow local land managers to make decisions on development and logging.
“It is vital that we properly manage our federal lands to create healthy, resilient, and productive forests for generations to come. We look forward to hearing directly from the people and communities we serve as we work together to implement productive and commonsense policy for forest land management,” she said.
Tree thinning could also reduce wildfire risks, she suggested.
Environmental groups, already prepared for Rollins’ announcement, were quick to denounce it as harmful and out of touch.
“America’s national forests give us clean air, water, wildlife, and the freedom for all to enjoy the outdoors,” said Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society, in a prepared statement, “but now they are the latest target in this administration’s unpopular push to give away our lands to drill, mine, and log. Gutting the Roadless Rule — which has protected our forests for 25 years — would be the single largest rollback of conservation protections in our nation’s history.”
The Roadless Rule has been the subject of lawsuits for decades, and forests in Colorado and Idaho have already been exempted from it under state-specific guidelines.
Ninety-six percent of the Forest Service’s inventoried roadless areas are located in 12 western states, and no state is more affected than Alaska, which has almost a third of the 45 million acres affected by the pending change.
Alaska is home to the Tongass National Forest, a West Virginia-sized stretch of islands and waterways in the Southeast Alaska panhandle that make up the largest surviving temperate rainforest in the world.
Until the 1980s, the area was also home to a vast logging program and pulp wood mills that employed thousands of people.
“Across Southeast Alaska, we see the irreparable damage from so many decades of unsustainable clear-cut logging in the scarred landscapes and decimated fish and wildlife habitats — we cannot and will not go back to that, and we know that’s what public comment will show once again,” said Maggie Rabb, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, in a statement released Wednesday.
Some Alaska Native tribes in the region support keeping the rule in place, as do some tourism businesses.
“Rescinding the Roadless Rule will devastate our community just as we are beginning to heal from clear-cut logging of the past. It’s clear the people making these decisions in Washington, D.C., don’t care about how it will harm those of us who live here and have lived here for thousands of years,” said President Joel Jackson of the Organized Village of Kake, which has repeatedly intervened in lawsuits seeking to defend the rule.
“We are the people of the forest and salmon people — our lives and our voices should count — this process makes it clear they won’t,” Jackson said.
Repealing the Roadless Rule also has powerful support in the region. Local electric utilities have advocated a repeal in order to ease the construction of clean hydroelectric power plants. The Alaska Forest Association, representing the logging industry, supports it, as do mining proponents.
Ten members of the U.S. House’s Committee on Natural Resources were in Anchorage on Wednesday as part of a weeklong tour of the state.
U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, said he believes the Roadless Rule “has really handicapped us in a number of areas,” including in firefighting.
In July, a wildfire swept through parts of Grand Canyon National Park, destroying a historic lodge and dozens of other structures.
Gosar said he believes the federal government needs to take a new approach on federal land in order to thin trees and reduce wildfire risks.
In Utah, which has 4 million acres of inventoried roadless land, Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy said she frequently hears from constituents upset about restrictions on the public use of federal land and supports the repeal.
“One of the complaints my constituents have frequently is that the federal government manages a lot of our resources but isn’t always great at listening to the people who live among the resources. … This Roadless Rule decision is a direct result of complaints from people who live with the Roadless Rule and the unintended consequences it’s having on economies and on resources,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle is a Democrat from Oregon also traveling with the committee. Her state has almost 2 million acres of inventoried roadless area, much of it in her district, but she said she would like to see a more balanced approach than the one being offered by the Trump administration.
“We have to protect our federal lands. We have to make sure that the public has access to our public land, and we have to make sure that we aren’t just wholesale taking out the protections that we worked really, really hard for, because we owe it to the people of this country to protect those lands that truly are theirs,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, is the top Democratic member of the resources committee, and wasn’t on the trip to Alaska.
In an emailed statement, he said Rollins “is steamrolling ahead with Trump’s plan to deliver America’s last wild forests to corporate polluters.”
“Democrats will fight this reckless scheme and stand with Tribes, hunters, anglers, and families who rely on these forests — not corporations looking to cash in,” he said.

(Photo courtesy of Gov. Josh Stein's office)North Carolina officials have finished repairs on their first home as part of the state’s post-Hurricane Helene homebuilding program, Gov. Josh Stein’s office announced Wednesday.
Stein’s office said Renew NC, the state’s recovery program, had done repairs on the home of Matalene Waters, who has lived in western North Carolina for 30 years. Waters was the first person to be approved for assistance under Renew NC’s single-family housing program.
Repairs on Waters’ home mark the first visible progress of construction under the federally funded program, as hundreds more continue to apply for aid.
“When Helene came, the flood came down the street and into the backyard, and it came all the way up to the [outdoor] light sockets,” Waters said in a news release. “It flooded all of my furniture and appliances, so we had to destroy all of that. You don’t realize how much it affects your mind. You’re thinking you’re okay, but you’re not.”


Want to know if you’re eligible or looking to apply? Visit Renew NC’s website or read our story detailing the requirements and process.


Hundreds of others are seeking similar — and in some cases, much more extensive — assistance. Renew NC has received more than 1,900 applications as of Wednesday.
Stein’s administration has touted an unprecedented timeline as they seek to access $1.4 billion total in federal grant money to repair homes and property. North Carolina is the first Helene-impacted state to formally launch its home repair program, his office said in a news release.
“Completing our first home is an important milestone in the Hurricane Helene recovery process,” Stein said. “I applaud my team for moving at record speed. Let’s keep swinging hammers and getting more families back home.”

Recent weeks have seen a surge of new applicants thanks to in-person neighborhood canvassing, in which Renew NC employees knock on doors to alert homeowners who may be eligible but have not applied. That approach led to around 900 new applicants over the past 15 days, according to the governor’s office.
“With the construction phase of our single-family housing program underway, we’re looking forward to helping restore housing stability across the region,” said Stephanie McGarrah, who is leading the Department of Commerce division overseeing Helene rebuilds. “We can’t understate the importance of this work.”
State officials have also launched a public dashboard to track the flow of applications. That includes data on which phase and priority applications are in, as well as a breakdown by county.
As of Wednesday evening, six additional applicants are in the “award determination” phase, a prelude to construction. An additional 196 are under environmental reviews; and 264 are undergoing damage assessments. There are currently no applicants in the “pre-construction” or construction phases.
The counties with the most applicants thus far are Buncombe (over 600) and Henderson (220). But the state has received applications from every county spanning from Clay in the southwest to Surry, Yadkin and Mecklenburg further to the east.

From CalMatters politics reporter Maya C. Miller:
The California Supreme Court has for the second time refused Republican lawmakers’ pleas to intervene and halt Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan, which opponents have characterized as “unconstitutional” since it undermines the state’s independent redistricting commission. 
The Republican plaintiffs include Sens. Suzette Martinez Valladardes of Lancaster and Tony Strickland of Huntington Beach, as well as Assemblymembers Tri Ta of Westminster and Kate Sanchez of Rancho Santa Margarita.
The group of legislators on Monday argued the Legislature violated the state’s constitution by “gutting and amending” the two bills that ultimately allowed them to facilitate the statewide special election on such short notice and, with voters’ approval, install the partisan maps. They previously sued the Newsom administration on similar grounds before the bills were officially passed, which the court also denied.
The four plaintiffs argued the court was abdicating its responsibility to hold the Legislature and governor in check, a move that “undermines voter confidence and sets a terrifying precedent,” they wrote in a joint statement. 
“We are watching in real time the destruction of law-and-order, and of our republic at the hands of a Democratic governor, Democratic super-majority legislature and Supreme Court.”
Speaking of the California GOP: Assuring that his proposal was “not a stunt,” Republican Assembly leader James Gallagher unveiled a plan Wednesday to break off 35 California counties and create a new U.S. state.
Described by the Chico legislator as a “two state solution,” the new state would be made up of inland counties spanning the northern most part of California down to the Inland Empire, and include more than 10 million Californians. Known as Assembly Joint Resolution 23, the proposal is in response to Democratic leaders and Newsom’s redistricting measure.

Gallagher: “A long time ago a man went to a great king in a land where his people were being completely oppressed … and he said to that king, let my people go. In kind of the same token this morning, I’m saying, Gavin, let my people go.”

Since its founding, there have been hundreds of failed attempts to break up California. In one of the most recent efforts, San Bernardino County released a study last year that found that seceding would be challenging and result in financial loss.

Job fair postponed because of immigration agents

Cal Poly Pomona has postponed its annual job fair this week after receiving blowback for including the U.S. Customs and Border Protection as a recruiter at the fair, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
Nearly 28,000 students attend the Los Angeles County campus, the majority of whom are Latino. Its job fair attracts more than 1,500 students and the immigration enforcement agency has participated in almost every job fair at Cal Poly Pomona since 2017. 
The university’s career center director, Tracee Passeggi, said she received as many as 250 emails objecting to the agency’s presence at the job fair. In a public letter published Monday, Cal Poly Pomona’s interim president said the campus has “listened carefully” and plans to push the fair to a later date.
But Passeggi also noted that others have expressed disappointment over the postponement, and how it would affect students who are still job hunting.

45 million gallons?! 💦

From CalMatters water reporter Rachel Becker:
Water thieves could face fines of up to $10,000 per violation for stealing water from fire hydrants, under a bill that California lawmakers passed earlier this week. 
It’s a dramatic increase from penalties previously set as low as $130 per violation under state law. Water providers have said for years that the fine is far too low to fit the seriousness of the crime in a water scarce state. 
The bill by Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat, ramps up the penalties that water suppliers can level at thieves caught stealing from hydrants, starting at $2,500 for a first violation to $10,000 each for three or more. 
Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, a sponsor of the bill, estimates that thieves have stolen up to 45 million gallons of water per year in recent years, according to spokesperson Adrienne Burns — costing money, risking firefighting supplies and potentially damaging the system. Elsewhere in the state, thefts have traced back to illegal marijuana farms.
The bill now awaits Gov. Newsom’s signature.

And we want to hear your story.
News coverage of health care is often framed around the numbers: rising insurance premiums, the state’s budget allocation for MassHealth, the expense of developing the latest therapeutics. But on the other side of those equations are people, many of whom are dealing with life and death decisions and skyrocketing costs.

Dina Titus said while discussing the oft-touted claim that selling federal lands will lead to affordable housing. (Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Any federal proposal to sell public lands should include guardrails to ensure affordable housing is built, have strict water limits on construction, and rely on more public input, U.S. Rep. Dina Titus said.
Speaking Tuesday night at a roundtable featuring representatives from environmental groups and the transportation and home building industries, Titus said previous input on legislation has been “behind closed doors, with just a few stakeholders involved.”
Legislation to sell off public lands in the name of building more affordable housing has been embraced repeatedly in the last several years, by both Democrats and Republicans. 
U.S. Rep Mark Amodei unsuccessfully attempted to add a provision in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill to sell off public land.
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and U.S. Rep. Susie Lee have sponsored various iterations of a public lands bill during their time in office. In March, they reintroduced the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, commonly referred to as the Clark County Lands Bill.
Titus doesn’t expect the bill to go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Senate, saying “I don’t know if they want to do Democrats any favors.”
Titus said she is opposed to the bill but added that there has to be more than criticism to proposals: “We’ve got to talk about what we can offer as an alternative.”
Though there have been calls to develop housing that’s affordable for a spectrum of income levels, some housing advocates have worried there isn’t enough focus on the lowest income workers, who earn 30% or less of area median income.  
When asked how area median income should factor into guardrails and discussion on what affordable housing could be built, Titus said she “didn’t have a figure.”
“I would defer to the experts on what they say is affordable but it’s a sliding scale,” she said. “What a teacher can afford is not what a Culinary Union member can afford. That has to be a consideration because if you just leave it to developers they will just develop high-end housing.”
Proposals to open up more federal lands come in spite of strong criticism. Conservation groups warn it could lead to water scarcity and have negative climate impacts. Housing policy experts push for infill development rather than urban sprawl. 
Despite concerns, local and state officials, including Gov. Joe Lombardo, have focused on the need to sell public lands as a solution to the housing crisis. 
During the 2025 Legislative Session, Titus admonished efforts led by Democrats to approve a resolution asking the federal government to release federal lands, arguing at the time proposals don’t “do anything about affordable housing.”
Speaking Tuesday, Titus said the housing crisis, which is not confined to Nevada, goes beyond federal land. 
“You can’t just say, ‘well, maybe you should build affordable housing’ and not put some guardrails on that,” she said. 
The conversation rarely addresses other complications to building housing, “whether it’s a supply chain problem that’s still left over from Covid, whether it’s tariffs on wood and iron and steel,” she said.
A decline in construction workforce, partly due to President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts, is also exacerbating the housing crisis.  
Titus pointed to the need to look at infill development, references reports that show Southern Nevada has underutilized land. 
The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada released an analysis in February that identified 78,285 acres as “vacant or underutilized land.”
Southern Nevada Home Builders Association CEO Tina Frias said “there’s a lot of components to take into consideration in terms of the developability of that plan.”
Instead, she pointed to a study by Applied Analysis, which was done in coordination with the Home Builders, that warned the valley was running out of land that could be developed.
Titus said some opposed to infill development argue that building more densely could lead to congestion issues, a sentiment she said she disagreed with. 
Andrew Kjellman, a planning director at RTC also thought it was “a false choice.”
“Traffic impacts is what everyone’s going to be tracking with any proposal for increased density, but it does need to be paired with a street grid that is walkable, bikeable and easy to take transit on,” he said.
Unlike similar nearby metropolitan areas, including Phoenix and Denver, Kjellman said Nevada doesn’t invest nearly as much as it should in public transportation.
While there are still ongoing discussions on federal proposals to open up land, new projects, including the proposed new airport and the Brightline West high speed rail, could lead to more development around those projects.
The Federal Aviation Administration and Bureau of Land Management in August held one of their first public meetings on the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport on a dry lakebed near the Nevada-California border.
The airport would be one of the largest in the nation by land area, sprawling across 23,000 acres of public land in the Ivanpah Valley north of Primm and has prompted concerns from environmental groups. 
Titus asked Frias if the land near the airport would be used to produce commercial or residential development. 
“I think it’s far too early to predict what living demand is going to be,” Frias responded.
In addition to the RTC and Home Builders, the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition and Conservation Lands Foundation participated in the roundtable.
The BLM was also asked to participate, according to Titus.
“They told us they had to get permission, and they never got back to us,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1073-scaled-e1756354043973-1024x650.jpeg,,,2025-08-28 08:56:19.194466

Gavin Newsom says these popular weight-loss drugs cost the state too much. But California could save about $3,000 per patient who lost weight. Other health conditions also would improve.","Guest Commentary written by

Kenneth Thorpe
Kenneth Thorpe is a health policy professor at Emory University and chairs the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease.


California just cut off access to critical anti-obesity drugs for hundreds of thousands of patients.
Under the new budget signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, Medi-Cal — the state’s Medicaid program — would no longer cover weight loss drugs, such as Wegovy and Zepbound, unless they’re prescribed to treat diabetes. The measure is intended to promote fiscal responsibility. By cutting this drug coverage, policymakers say they’ll be able to save more than $600 million by 2029. 
But they’ve got it all wrong.
Obesity is a significant driver of skyrocketing health care spending because it’s a major risk factor for other costly, chronic conditions. Keeping evidence-based obesity treatments like these drugs accessible would more than pay for itself in the long run by making Californians healthier and more productive. 
In California, roughly 3 in 5 adults are overweight or obese, including disproportionate numbers of low-income Californians and people of color. That puts them at higher risk of developing numerous other chronic conditions, including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers.
Overcoming those risks can be challenging, especially given that genetics alone may account for up to 70% of people’s differences in body weight. That’s a major reason why lifestyle interventions alone have been largely unsuccessful at stopping the spread of chronic conditions — and why the arrival of anti-obesity drugs in recent years has been so revolutionary.
In 2023, Medi-Cal’s coverage of the drugs for weight loss allowed more than 660,000 Californians to obtain the life-changing treatments. That same year, the national obesity rate dipped for the first time in a decade.
The rapid uptake of these drugs hasn’t merely improved people’s lives. It also has provided policymakers with a new way to downsize health care spending.
Some of my recent research, published in JAMA Network Open, highlights the significant link between weight loss and lower health care costs. Among Medicare beneficiaries with obesity and at least one other related health condition, like diabetes, just a 5% decrease in body weight was associated with a $1,262 drop in annual health care spending, or 7% in savings on average. A 25% weight reduction — which is not at all uncommon among people on anti-obesity drugs — led to an astonishing $5,442 drop in yearly health care costs, or 31% in savings.
This suggests Newsom’s plan to slash health care spending by withdrawing coverage for these drugs could actually increase health care spending in the long run.
According to Newsom, covering the drugs under Medi-Cal would cost California $85 million in fiscal year 2025-26, rising to $680 million by 2028-29. Those figures are overestimates, even before accounting for the savings from improved health. Once federal matching funds and drug manufacturer rebates are factored in, the true upfront cost to California would be much lower.
The state’s supposed savings also pale in comparison to the cost of untreated obesity, which in 2022 depressed economic activity in California by nearly $90 billion and cost state government more than $10 billion in direct health care spending and foregone tax revenue, according to an independent report.
Based on the research I’ve done, California could save about $3,000 per patient by continuing to cover weight loss drugs.
It’s true that anti-obesity drugs require substantial upfront outlays from Medi-Cal. But it’s far more cost effective than paying for patients’ health complications down the road. Continuing that coverage is a smart investment in California’s future.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081825-Wegovy-JA-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-28 08:56:19.194466

Social media swirled with rumors that ICE would be among the employers at the job fair, something the campus said is not true. Still, the campus postponed the event over concerns about Customs and Border Protection’s participation.


Cal Poly Pomona postponed its annual fall job fair this week after students, alumni and community members criticized its inclusion of Customs and Border Protection as an in-person recruiter, underscoring the heightened sensitivity about immigration agencies on college campuses this fall.
The interim president of the Los Angeles County campus with nearly 28,000 students — the majority of whom are Latino — said leadership responded to the criticism and decided to rethink their approach to job fairs. 
“We have listened carefully and are leveraging this input to design career programming this fall that is more personal and better tailored to the evolving needs of our students and to workforce demands,” said Iris S. Levine in a public letter Monday. “I want to thank those of you who reached out and shared your perspectives with honesty and passion,” she added.Tracee Passeggi, the career center director at Cal Poly Pomona, said she received 200 to 250 emails between late Thursday and Monday protesting the presence of immigration law enforcement at the job fair.
In the days leading up to the postponement, social media swirled with rumors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be among the employers at the September job fair, something the campus said is not true in a Tuesday FAQ.“FYI @calpolypomona invited ICE to come and recruit at a job fair on September 18th from 10:30am-2:30pm. Even when calling themselves a HSI (Hispanic serving institution). Stand up against the racial profiling and ICE bounty hunters. Contact: Career@cpp.edu, President@cpp.edu, Admin_affairs@cpp.edu,” read one message from a poster on the campus’s main Facebook page on Sunday.More than 106,000 employers share job updates on the Cal Poly Pomona career portal called Handshake, a common software tool among college campuses. Both Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are in the system and receive updates about campus career events. But ICE has never taken part in a career fair, the FAQ said. 
Meanwhile, Customs and Border Protection, the multi-pronged agency that oversees Border Patrol, a law enforcement agency that’s conducted immigration raids in California, was among the roughly 200 employers registered for the career fair slated Sept. 18-19 and has participated in almost every job fair at the campus since 2017.Billy Gallagher, the faculty union senior field representative at Cal Poly Pomona, said the hyper-vigilance about immigration law enforcement on the campus makes sense, especially given that judges have faulted the agencies for using racial criteria in their arrests in the Los Angeles area. The federal government under the current Trump administration has appealed a preliminary injunction from a district judge to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“There’ve been arrests, U.S. citizens swept up. At this point, it’s hard to tell even who’s who in some of these raids, so there was definitely concern among faculty for sure,” Gallagher said, adding that officers at both Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have led immigration raids in California. Most of the students on campus are Latino, he also noted.
Career fair postponed, not cancelled
The campus doesn’t have a new date for the career fair, said Passeggi of the career center, but she aims to finalize those plans by late September, she said in an interview.The postponed career fair was technically two events on consecutive days, and Customs and Border Protection was scheduled to appear on just one of those days with some 80 other employers.
Still, both dates were postponed. Passeggi said her team will use the opportunity to organize the fairs in new ways. What that means, she doesn’t know yet, but she pointed to the job fairs for the school’s hospitality and education majors that are smaller and subject-specific. Each event includes 200 students and 35 employers. The postponed event usually draws more than 1,500 students. It’s also outside and exposed to the elements on hot or, in the spring, possibly rainy days. She’s unsure if the redesigned fairs will be virtual or in-person.“We have received some feedback from students saying that they were disappointed that the career fair was canceled,” she said, noting that her office was battling two types of misinformation: that the fair was called off and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was among the employers. Neither is true.The Career Center will still support students seeking to connect with employers and organize internships, she said. With much of the email and social media blowback occurring over the weekend, she thinks the campus leadership rallied fast. “We moved as quickly as we could” in a transparent manner, she said, pointing to the FAQ and letter from the president.Nonetheless, “I can definitely hear where our community is coming from,” she said. 
Faculty, student perspectives
The campus’ response to the outcry was sensible, said Mario Guerrero, a professor at Cal Poly Pomona who is chair of the university’s Political Science Department. “I think it speaks volumes about (Levine’s) leadership and being able to hear what folks were saying, but also respond appropriately. It’s a super delicate situation for fairly obvious reasons,” he said. “Even reading the comments now, people are still unhappy, and that’s always going to be part of it, but at least you know you can point to leadership being able to make proactive moves to protect the students however they can.”Guerrero also thinks that the worry over immigration law enforcement as an employer at a job fair tapped into wider fears about those federal agents entering campus and arresting students, faculty or staff.On Instagram, a student group that’s a subsidiary of the faculty union and that has chapters across multiple Cal State campuses, criticized Cal Poly Pomona for writing that it cannot bar employers from participating in its job fair because it is a public university. “Disappointed once again in administration, ignoring the safety and needs of their campus population — while claiming their hands are tied,” read the text on an Instagram Story posted earlier this week.
The campus administration was “getting pretty pummeled by students,” Gallagher said, and he’s “certainly hoping that the (Cal Poly Pomona) administration continues to listen to students.”
Campus staff limited if federal immigration officers enter campus
The California Faculty Association, the systemwide faculty union, published in January a list of demands to California State University leadership that seeks to block federal agents from conducting immigration law enforcement on campus. The demands, updated in July, included blocking those agencies from participating in job fairs. 
But as a public system, Cal State University campuses cannot limit who enters their sites. Cal Poly Pomona administrators said as much in a February email to staff: “CSU is a public university, and a large portion of CSU property is open to the general public. The areas on campus that are open to the general public, like the campus quad and walkways, are also open to federal immigration enforcement officers.”The notice said that immigration officers cannot enter areas that aren’t open to the general public, such as classrooms that are in session and residence halls — “unless the officer presents a valid judicial warrant or declares that exigent circumstances exist.”
However, the guidance says that staff and faculty do not need to divulge any information. The campus appointed an administrator to deal with immigration law enforcement. The guidance says personnel should “respectfully inform the officer that you lack authority but will immediately contact” the designated administrator. If that person isn’t available, personnel should contact campus police or campus legal counsel. 
The University of California has similar guidance and stresses that hiding evidence or individuals violates federal law. So does interfering with an arrest. “Further, you should not put yourself in physical danger,” UC’s guidance says. Cal State University spokesperson Amy Bentley-Smith didn’t answer CalMatters’ questions about whether other campuses invited immigration law enforcement agencies to job fairs. But in an email, she wrote that campuses should try to “mitigate” community concerns about those agencies appearing on site. “That can include informing key stakeholders, like Dream Center coordinators, of the dates and times when” immigration law enforcement are on campus, she wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/060624-Border-Patrol-CBP-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-28 08:56:19.194466

MSJP is being represented by CAIR and is seeking a declaratory judgment as well as damages (Elia Mast/Missourian).Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine filed a lawsuit Wednesday in federal court challenging its exclusion from last year’s Homecoming parade.
The lawsuit was filed against University of Missouri System President Mun Choi. It claims he violated students’ First Amendment rights by barring the group from participating in the parade because of their views on Palestine and Israel.
At a news conference and rally Wednesday afternoon in conjunction with the legal action, an attorney from the Council on American-Islamic Relations said free speech is not subject to the “whims” of the university president’s personal beliefs.
“Public universities cannot open events for the public for expression like they did with the Homecoming parade, then filter which viewpoints they want expressed at these events,” said attorney Ahmad Kaki, who is providing legal counsel for the organization.
Just ahead of the Mizzou Homecoming celebration in October 2024, Choi sent an email to the student group that banned them from participating in the parade.
In the email to the organization, Choi declared that his decision was based on “significant disturbances” that have occurred at Students for Justice in Palestine events around the country.
Choi said he was also concerned about previous activity in Speakers Circle that involved a heated argument.
“The issue is the safety of the event,” said Mizzou spokesperson Christopher Ave at the time. “Let me remind you, thousands of people come to a relatively small space in close quarters to participate in and watch the parade, and we felt that the best decision moving forward would be to move on without the group’s participation, given what we have seen across the country.”
A spokesperson for Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine said the local group was not affiliated with any national movement.
The group said in a statement at the time that it was “extremely disheartened” by Choi’s decision.
“It serves as a reflection of the constant marginalization and dismissal of the Palestinian cause, culture and overall existence,” the statement read.
According to the lawsuit, the student group had planned to showcase a traditional Palestinian dance and hand out Palestinian sweets and bracelets at the parade. Members of the organization also planned to march with banners reading “Ceasefire Now” and “Stop the Genocide.”
Ave declined a request for an interview Wednesday but said in a written statement that the university would defend its decision in the lawsuit.
The university’s statement repeated that the decision was made because of safety concerns involving other Palestine-affiliated organizations.
In addition to violating the First Amendment, the lawsuit claims Mizzou created a limited public forum with topics identified by the university. The group claims its participation fell within the boundaries of university policy.
The lawsuit is asking for declaratory relief that the group’s exclusion was unconstitutional under the First Amendment and seeks to enjoin the university from prohibiting the group from participating in the 2025 Homecoming parade.
The lawsuit is also asking for compensatory and nominal damages for violating its rights and the costs associated with its Homecoming preparations.
The former president of the group, Isleen Atallah, said during the news conference that the organization has already filed an application to participate in the 2025 Homecoming parade.

(Photo by Jordan Siemens/Getty Images)Whether it’s human-caused wildfires, boating and swimming deaths, or off-road vehicle crashes, Utah has seen an increase in preventable accidents this summer. 
Now, with Labor Day weekend approaching, officials are expecting the state’s public land, water and other recreation hotspots to be crowded, and are urging residents to take a few simple steps to prevent tragedy. 
That includes: 

Wearing safety equipment. Whether it’s a life jacket, helmet or harness, always be prepared with the right gear. 
Plan for weather. Utah is seeing some wild weather fluctuations right now, with unpredictable rain, thunderstorms and temperatures ranging from summer heat to unseasonable cold. Check the forecast and try to avoid slot canyons or exposed, alpine ridges. 
Don’t operate any kind of vehicle or boat while impaired. Officials have seen a lot of accidents stemming from drug or alcohol use lately. 
Use fire sense. Be aware of the current statewide fire restrictions, leave your campfire only when it’s cold and be cautious about target shooting.

This summer there have been at least 10 drownings on Utah’s lakes, rivers and reservoirs — two were people on personal watercraft like Jet Skis or Sea-Doos, four were on canoes or stand-up paddleboards, and four were swimming-related. 
“Nine out of these 10 drownings could have simply been prevented by wearing a life jacket. That’s a decision where you don’t get a second chance,” said Chase Pili, a captain with the Utah Department of Natural Resources’ Division of Law Enforcement. 
On Utah’s trails, officials say there have been at least 22 crashes involving off-highway vehicles, or OHVs. At least seven of those resulted in life-threatening injuries, while five were drug or alcohol related. 
“The typical injuries we see out on our trails are head and limb injuries that can definitely be life threatening,” Pili said. 
And, at least 67% of Utah’s wildfires this summer have been human-caused, a much higher figure than years past. 
Utah is already having an above-average fire season, fueled by a poor snowpack, prolonged drought and weak summer monsoons. That, combined with careless behavior on public land and roadways, has resulted in an expensive and potentially record-breaking year for human-caused fire starts.
Roadside starts — whether it’s dragging trailer chains, sparks from malfunctioning parts, or machinery or vehicle fires — are responsible for most human-caused fires. 
“We’ve also seen an uptick in abandoned campfires across Utah in recent weeks. So we need to remember campfires should always be cold to the touch before you leave,” said Kayli Guild, a prevention and communications coordinator with the Utah Division of Forestry Fire and State Land. 
The recent widespread moisture across Utah has been great, but Guild said the state is still in extreme drought. Just because there’s been rain doesn’t mean you can let your guard down while recreating. 
“The weather that we are anticipating coming through the area, it’s honestly going to be a drop in the bucket compared to where we need to be,” Guild said. “The monsoons are a huge help, but once the monsoonal moisture comes, lightning comes with it. We’re probably going to see an uptick in (fire) starts over this weekend.”

State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris, the director of ADPH, said about $15 million of the increase would go to the state’s share of the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The other $1.7 million will go to employee raises and retirement contributions, health insurance, and supplies.
“Our agency, our CHIP folks work for a long time with an actuarial firm, they basically just have the formula that looks at what our utilization was last year, and our expected enrollment is, what inflation is and what health care costs are,” Harris said. “That’s how we came up with this number. It’s typically pretty accurate.”

CHIP is a federal program for children under 19 that do not qualify for Medicaid coverage and cannot afford private health insurance. Families making up to 300% of the poverty level — about $80,000 a year for a family of three — qualify for the program. The FY26 budget, which passed this spring, included $85.5 million for CHIP, about 20% of the total cost of the program. Harris estimated that would grow to $100.6 million for FY27. The federal government pays for the other 80%. 
Nearly 200,000 Alabama children combined are enrolled in CHIP and ALLKids, a low-cost health insurance for low-income families.
Harris said in an interview Friday that Alabama is the only state that funds CHIP through its public health department. 
“These are for working families, this is not a giveaway program,” Harris said Wednesday.
Harris also said that the department is in a period of uncertainty with the new administration, which he said is normal. Federal funding for ADPH will end on Sept. 30 if Congress does not pass a budget or continuing resolution.
“I think we’ll have a good picture in October, but we just don’t know,” Harris said. 
ADPH gets 66% of its funding from federal sources, Harris said. Its General Fund and Education Trust Fund allotments, making up less than 15% of the budget, mostly go to pay for CHIP. 
Harris also praised part of the Trump-backed budget bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), that will award individual states up to $200 million over five years for rural health care. The definition of rural health care is yet to be known, but Harris said that would come with the grant application in mid-September.
“I think we would certainly, as a really rural state with a lot of health care needs, I would think we would have a good chance at getting most of that,” Harris said.
The governor’s office is responsible for applying for the grant, he said, and ADPH has been in contact with them in preparing for the application.
Rep. Chris Sells, R-Greenville, who has three rural hospitals in his district, said they are vital to the state.
“If these rural hospitals close, it doesn’t matter if you live in a rural area or you live on Lake Martin. You’re going to be affected,” Sells said.
Harris echoed that in an interview after the meeting Wednesday. 
“Traumas in our state – heart attacks, strokes – they all end up in just four or five cities in our state,” he said. “That’s just not really sustainable.”
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Linden, asked Harris what he would do with his budget if he had no limitations. Harris said he would want to focus on preventative health care and creating a sustainable model for hospitals to run.
“There’s a lot of factors that can predict that that really don’t have anything to do with care,” Harris said of health trajectories. “The zip code you’re born in, how much money you make, how far you got in school. Those are powerful predictors of how long you live and what diseases you’re at risk for.”
McCampbell emphasized the importance of taking care of children while they are young.
“It’s the parents that we really have to start education about how important it is for the health of their children,” McCampbell said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0388-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-28 08:56:19.194466

(Photo courtesy Abraham Mehring)Nevada will lose $3 million in federal funding after a program that supported local small and mid-sized food and farm businesses was terminated three years ahead of schedule. 
The Southwest Regional Food Business Center – which serves California, Arizona, Nevada and Utah – is one of 12 food business centers across the country that will cease most operations in September instead of July 2028 as originally planned, cutting off millions in funding for local food systems. 
In May 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded $5 million in funding to the University of Nevada, Reno Extension to support the local food economy over a 5-year period, including direct grants to farmers and food businesses.
However, last month the USDA announced the elimination of the $360 million Biden-era program, which was funded through the American Rescue Plan Act to bolster rural development and build stronger food-supply networks in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In the announcement, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins criticized the Biden administration for creating the food business centers “without any long-term way to finance them.” 
The USDA said they would honor more than 450 Business Builder Grants to farmers and food businesses that were already approved under the program, but any additional funds would be terminated.
The Southwest Regional Food Business Center was awarded $30 million to be split among the four states, including $4 million in Business Builder Grants that could be used to pay for cold storage, transportation, marketing, and other costs to expand local food businesses. Before the closure, the center was only able to award about $1.6 million in grant funding.
During its two years in operation, the Southwest Regional Food Business Center supported 170 small and mid-sized food and farm businesses in Nevada.
The vast majority of Nevada farms are family-owned, according to the USDA, making up about 93% of producers in the state. That can put Nevada’s agricultural sector at a disadvantage, as small farms often lack access to the federal subsidies and resources that support larger farms.
The Southwest Regional Food Business Center was created to help fill that funding gap.
The center – in partnership with the UNR Extension – set aside $900,000 in Business Builder Grants to help food businesses in Nevada expand capacity, but the center’s early closure means only about $350,000 will ultimately be distributed. 
Fallon Livestock Processing was one of 18 small and mid-sized farm and food businesses to receive a Business Builder Grant from the center before it shut down three years ahead of schedule.
Cattle farmers within the 400-mile radius of Fallon Livestock Processing have few processing options if they want to keep their business operations in state, said Cindy Johnson, who helps run the company along with her husband.
Producers in the area are often forced to haul their animals long distances due to the lack of slaughter facilities nearby, adding costs and logistical challenges that many cannot afford.
Johnson said the $30,000 grant the company was awarded this month would expand their cold storage capacity to serve 10 additional local meat producers, thereby strengthening the local agricultural economy.
“We’re feeding and keeping our communities healthy and viable. Cutting this kind of funding for Nevada farmers and ranchers three years ahead of schedule it’s really putting a strain on rural agricultural businesses like ours,” Johnson said. 
Programs like the Southwest Regional Food Business Center are vital for pushing back on corporate consolidation in the food industry that has hollowed out rural communities, Johnson said.
“It’s concerning that the center will be going away. It limits our access to additional resources to continue doing what we do. For small and mid-sized organizations such as ours there isn’t a lot of access to other USDA grants,” she said.
Fallon Livestock Processing was also able to expand their business into dried meats through a rebranding initiative, “expanding access to quality meats that are thoughtfully sourced and processed,” Johnson added.
Blue Lizard Farm in Lincoln County is another small family-owned producer that benefited from the center’s initiatives, including a $30,000 grant this month to expand the cooling capacity of a trailer for improved transportation. 
Rodney Mehring, the owner of Blue Lizard Farm, said programs like the Southwest Regional Food Business Center are an important step in building greater local resilience so Nevada can weather emergencies and economic disruptions like the ones experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I’m really sad to hear it going away. This is something that we, as an agricultural industry, have been working on for a long time,” Mehring said. 
“There’s huge demand for local produce, and we know that we can grow a lot of our own food, but the infrastructure is not there,” he continued. 
The centers were meant to coordinate regional food efforts, offer comprehensive technical support, and provide small financial grants to build the local food economy. And they’ve shown considerable success.
A report from the USDA in December found the centers led to the creation of more than 300 new food businesses. Biden’s USDA also reported that nationally 2,800 individuals had received technical assistance, 1,500 new partnerships were formed, and 287 businesses reported increased revenue as a result of the program.
Another big loss for small and mid-sized food and farm businesses in Nevada is the cancellation of planned consumer preference research after funding was terminated.
The research would have provided data on the buying habits and preferences of Nevada consumers to help local food businesses develop marketing strategies and expand their market. 
“This research will need to be postponed due to insufficient funding,” said Jessica Lozada, a communications manager for UNR.
The Extension said the center is “actively working to build private-sector partnerships within the four-state area of California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/blue_lizard_farm_harvest-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-28 08:56:19.194466

There was also an increase of 145 deportations compared to January-July 2024, or 237.7%.
Most deportations were to Ecuador, followed by Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and the Dominican Republic since Jan. 20.
Danbury in particular has been the site of notable ICE activity, as well as strong pushback from advocates. In mid-June, Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants held a press conference in which they said that between 12 and 15 people were arrested near the Danbury Superior Courthouse. 
On Aug. 20, ICE’s Boston Office announced the completion of what they called “Operation Broken Trust,” which led to the arrest of 65 immigrants in Connecticut, at least six of whom were arrested in Danbury.

Videos posted on social media show confrontations between advocacy groups and ICE agents in the parking lot of Danbury Superior Court as the officials arrest a man and a woman. The videos show a group of officers dressed in tactical gear, some of whom wore masks. 
“ This past week we saw, we experienced, we felt, and we witnessed terror of state sponsored violence, intimidation, kidnapping for disappearances,” Juan Fonseca Tapia, an organizer with Greater Danbury United for Immigrants, said at a press conference on Aug. 20. He characterized the ICE apprehensions as “state-sanctioned kidnappings.”
Fonseca Tapia said that one of the people picked up by ICE at the Danbury Courthouse in mid-August was an 18-year-old who had been arrested for a noise complaint. As of the 20th, Fonseca Tapia said, he did not know where the teen had been taken. 
Data shows that 19 people were arrested in Danbury in June and July. 
Sen. Ryan Fazio, a Greenwich Republican and candidate for governor, commended the ICE action.
“Connecticut’s sanctuary policies have made our state a magnet for illegal immigration, including for convicted criminals,” he said in a Monday release. “I appreciate the work of federal immigration enforcement in removing some of these criminals.”
Cpt. Mark Williams of the Danbury Police Department said the current immigration enforcement activity was unlike anything he’d experienced before. He also said it was frustrating how little communication was happening between federal immigration enforcement and local police departments as a result of Connecticut’s Trust Act.

Arrests also took place in Stamford and Norwalk. Last week, immigration advocates held a rally outside the Stamford Courthouse in protest of the arrest of two men who were reportedly there for a follow-up appointment after being the victims of an armed robbery. In Norwalk, a video posted to social media showed two brothers, identified as Ricardo and Leonard Chavez, tased and arrested by ICE agents in the middle of the street. 
Police in Danbury, Norwalk and Stamford all told CT Mirror that they were not aware of “Operation Broken Trust” and that they did not know the number of people who were arrested or detained by ICE. 
Other arrests in Connecticut have gained significant attention. In early June, a mother of two was detained in New Haven; according to police chief Karl Jacobson, she had a pending court case on a misdemeanor charge. Her 13-year-old daughter, Monse, and her 8-year-old son witnessed the arrest. 
The New Haven community also rallied for the release of Esdrás, an 18-year-old student at Wilbur Cross High School who was detained in July at his workplace at a car wash. Esdrás, whose surname has not been made public, was reportedly sent to a detention facility in Louisiana but later transferred to a facility in New England after a local attorney intervened.
At the Danbury press conference, a senior at Wilbur Cross High School and leader with CT Students for a Dream who identified herself only as Melanie said she was deeply troubled by Esdrás’ arrest. 
“ The thought that they might return and take away more of my friends, my brothers and sisters fills me with fear and anxiety. This fear is overwhelming. It distracts me from my studies, from my future, and that should never be the case,” she said. 
In New Britain, community members protested outside City Hall after four people were detained by ICE during a raid at a car wash in early August. In early June, a senior at Maloney High School in Meriden and his father were detained by ICE and sent to a detention facility in Texas. And in July, Zia S, an Afghan citizen who worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Armed Forces and came to the country through humanitarian parole, was arrested and sent to a detention center in Plymouth, Mass.
On Wednesday, a crowd protested outside the Church of Christ, Congregational in Newington after ICE reportedly arrested seven workers at the Optimo Car Wash on Saturday. According to Constanza Segovia of Hartford Deportation Defense, two of the workers were mothers with young children. One of the women detained at the car wash had just undergone surgery; Segovia said her organization is currently fighting to get her access to the health care she needs. 
“ Our many immigrant communities across the state have been terrorized daily, on the streets, in courthouses, at work, and at home. Parents are worried about sending their kids to school this week or going to the hospital for care.  This is all happening while we confront potential cuts to life-saving resources, including state funded health care and food assistance,” Segovia said at the press conference on Wednesday. 
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., ranking member on the Senate’s permanent subcommittee on investigation, recently announced that he has begun an investigation into the “abusive and potentially illegal tactics” being used by ICE. He said the main driver of the investigation was threats made against Connecticut State Senator Corey Paris on social media, one of which was later reposted by ICE’s official account.
“These reports of abusive tactics, excessive use of force, detention of U.S. citizens and possible harm to individuals who are taken into custody and thrown into unmarked vans by masked agents, and then confined in inhumane conditions, are deeply troubling,” Blumenthal said.  
Since ICE has no detention centers in Connecticut, people arrested by ICE in Connecticut are swiftly moved through detention centers across the nation, most commonly Plymouth Correctional Facility in Massachusetts and Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana, the nation’s busiest deportation hub.
Since January 20, 2025, 348 people apprehended in Connecticut have been transferred to out-of-state detention centers, and there have been at least 1,262 transfers. One person can have more than one transfer.

For example, a 47-year-old Nicaraguan man arrested in Hartford was moved through Plymouth Correctional Center and Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center in Louisiana before being sent to ICE’s Guantanamo Bay facility in March. He was deported to Nicaragua a week later. The ICE dataset shows he had no criminal charges beyond immigration offenses. 
He is one of 290 immigrants nationwide sent to Guantanamo this year. ICE records show no ICE detainees were sent there from September 2023 to January 2025.
A quarter of those arrested this year in Connecticut do not have any criminal charges beyond an immigration offense. Half were “pending criminal charges,” according to the ICE dataset, meaning they have a charge moving through the justice system but have not been convicted. A quarter have existing criminal convictions.
ICE arrests of people with a conviction, or without any other charges, have increased somewhat, but arrests of people with pending charges have increased tenfold.
Over half of those arrested in Connecticut come from just five Latin American countries, but ICE has also arrested immigrants from 44 other countries, including Russia, China and the United Kingdom.
About 16% of Connecticut’s population is foreign born, according to 2023 data from the Migration Policy Institute. Among immigrants to Connecticut, the most common countries of origin are Jamaica, India and Brazil.
Immigrants arrested most commonly come from Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Brazil, and Honduras.
Compared to last year, ICE arrests of immigrants from Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras and China have increased fourfold.
From January-July of 2024, two Venezuelans were arrested by ICE in Connecticut. This year the number has risen to 10. The Department of Homeland Security revoked Venezuela’s Protected Status in March.
Since Inauguration Day, there has been a shift in nationalities arrested by ICE. While most people arrested still come from Latin America, the distribution of countries has changed compared to the same period in 2024.
Nicaragua (-36%) and Colombia (-11%) saw declines, but Ecuador surged by 284% and now accounts for the largest share, 23.7% of the 2025 total. Guatemala grew even faster in relative terms (+440%), becoming the second-largest nationality to be arrested at 13.3%.
Together, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Brazil, Honduras, Peru, and the Dominican Republic make up about 71% of all arrests in 2025. South American countries in particular, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and Colombia, stand out in the trend.

,California,2025-08-28 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California schools reverse truancy trends. Improving reading scores could be next,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-schools-reverse-truancy-reading/,"California's public schools have struggled to improve test scores in recent years. A return to phonics instruction could turn the tide on reading, a move that comes as many schools overcome pandemic-era absenteeism.","Good news is a rarity in California’s massive public school system, which purports to educate nearly 6 million students but struggles to improve chronically subpar academic achievement levels on state and federal tests.
The most recent round of “Smarter Balanced” assessments showed fractional improvement at best, with fewer than half of all students meeting or exceeding state standards in English language skills, and scarcely one-third doing so in math. Meanwhile, California continues to fare poorly compared to other states in the tests administered by the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
We did get a bit of positive news about California schools recently. After decades of what were termed “reading wars,” California’s political establishment is finally embracing phonics, a proven technique for teaching children to read that could boost the state’s low reading scores. It’s a minor miracle that pushes aside years of trendy reading instruction that had failed.
Another miracle may also be occurring: California is making progress on its exceedingly high levels of chronic absenteeism.
A few years ago, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly one-third of the children enrolled in public schools were chronically absent from classes. You can’t learn if you’re not in class, and the absences negatively affected overall academic achievement, the futures of millions of kids and the state’s need for trained or trainable workers as those in the huge Baby Boom generation retire from the workforce.
Chronic absenteeism also adversely affects the finances of local school systems because aid from the state is calculated on attendance, not just enrollment. Schools with high absenteeism rates also tend to have low levels of learning and lose the money they need to raise achievement.
California wasn’t alone, of course. However, it kept its public schools closed longer than most in other states, and the makeshift online classes were a poor substitute for classroom instruction.
Children from low-income families, whose parents could not work from home to monitor participation or afford private tutoring, suffered the most from school closures. Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state’s education establishment were responsible for unnecessarily prolonging them.
From 30% chronic absenteeism in 2021-22, California dropped to 25% in 2022-23 and 20% in 2023-24, according to a new state-by-state report on absenteeism by SchoolStatus, a company that provides consulting services to school systems. California’s 18% decline over the last two years was the third-most of any state surveyed by SchoolStatus, behind just Nevada and New Mexico. Nationally, the decline was just 6%.
The report bolsters what Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of schools and a 2026 candidate for governor, hailed last week.
“Due to historic investments in student supports and family engagement, California has cut TK–12 chronic absenteeism levels by one-third, from 30% in 2022 to 20% in 2024,” Thurmond said. “We are on track and committed to reduce chronic absence by 50 percent over five years.”
The SchoolStatus report did have one caveat: that reducing absenteeism is relatively easy in elementary grades but becomes progressively more difficult in middle school and particularly among high schoolers.
“Student attendance deterioration accelerates systematically from the middle school transition onward,” the researchers noted. “Chronic rates more than double from 5th grade (14.22%) to 12th grade (32.13%).” They called for “targeted intervention when districts track early warning indicators like partial-day absences, tardiness patterns, and family communication response rates during those critical transition years.”
Lasting progress will depend on keeping kids in danger of dropping out of high school in class and learning what they need to survive in a competitive world.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/020623-Stege-Elementary-8002-24-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-28 08:56:19.194466

Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, speaks with another member of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee during a meeting on Wednesday, May, 28, 2025. He recommended additional changes for the parole guidelines to the parole board during a meeting on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025, (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Legislators signaled to Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles staff Wednesday that they will recommend modifications to the parole guidelines finalized by the board last month.
The changes could include weighing a parole applicants’ disciplinary record beyond 12 months instead of placing greater consideration for a person’s behavior in prison within the year, and giving more flexibility for housing and job plans after release when considering parole.
“If an inmate is in prison, and let’s say they have been in there for 15 years, and they have a lot of disciplinaries in the first two or three years, and then they tail off, and in the last five they had none, that tells me something,” said Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, who chairs the Legislature’s Prison Oversight Committee. “That tells me they were a little wild, but they have matured.”

Chambliss also recommended amendments to the housing plan and the plan for securing employment, both of which are required as part of the application packet for an applicant to be seriously considered for parole.
“If you have those, it means that is positive, but some people are not able to get those at that point, and maybe they should not be penalized,” Chambliss said.
In an interview after the meeting, Hal Nash, the chair of the board, and Cam Ward, the director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, which oversees supervision of those on probation and parole, appeared open to those modifications.
‘“How do you have a job if you are in prison?,” Ward said, echoing what critics have said about the updated parole guidelines. “You can’t do a job interview while you are in prison, so that has been a big issue.”
The parole board finalized the guidelines in July following a public comment period. The guidelines use a point system to determine whether an applicant qualifies for parole. The results are not binding on the board’s decisions.
Civil rights groups criticized several aspects of the initial version of the board’s proposed guidelines, which penalized applicants for disciplinaries for both nonviolent and violent behavior in the past 12 months leading up to the parole hearing date, which they felt was a longer time horizon for consideration.
The Legislative Council, whose members include both House and Senate leadership, may review the guidelines and request the parole board amend the guidelines, rescind them and begin the process over again, or approve what the parole board had established.
The revisions came years behind schedule, leading to mounting criticism from legislators. Last spring, Chambliss got an amendment added to the General Fund budget making funding for the parole board contingent on members adopting the guidelines. The board unveiled them in May.
Wednesday was the first time that the parole board appeared before legislators since Gov. Kay Ivey appointed Nash as chair in July.
“I believe that people need second chances,” Nash told lawmakers during the meeting. “I believe that we do not need to take hope away from people. I also believe in public safety.”
Legislators Wednesday expressed concerns about the conformance rates, the frequency that the board follows the guidelines when they make decisions regarding parole. As recently as 2024, the conformance rate was near 25%.
“I would just ask that you write the guidelines that people are looking at in a manner that you are applying them,” Chambliss said during the meeting. “That is something that I feel strongly about that we, as a state, if we are going to write the guidelines, go by the guidelines generally.”
The parole rate declined precipitously from 2017 to 2023, falling from nearly 50% to just 8%. Parole rates have been hovering around 30% over the past month.
“You will, in my opinion, never see a 50% grant rate again,” Ward told lawmakers during the meeting because of changes to the law. “I think, realistically … you are looking at anywhere from 26% to 31% is the ideal grant rate.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7256-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-28 08:56:19.194466

An NPR tally reported that around 37 of the 219 U.S. House Republicans held town halls during the August recess (Aiyana Massie/Missourian).HARRISBURG — U.S. Rep. Mark Alford defended actions taken by President Donald Trump at a contentious town hall in Harrisburg on Wednesday night.
More than 100 constituents packed the Lions Club event hall. The small venue — full of shouting and passionate pleas — drew in people from all over the county who voiced their questions and complaints.
Hot topics during the session included Medicaid cuts, Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and complaints about the priorities of the Republican Party.
Alford began the event with a prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, then opened the floor to questions. Questions continued for more than two hours.
As soon as the microphone opened, over 20 members of the crowd queued up for their chance to speak to the congressman.
The crowd spoke on a variety of issues, including the need for gun reform and their disapproval of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”
One man who voiced his concern about Medicaid cuts said he was “living proof” of the importance of Medicaid after surviving being on a ventilator in a recent hospitalization.
To concerns about Medicaid cuts, Alford cited legislation proposed by Sen. Josh Hawley, who voted for cuts in Trump’s bill, to invest in rural hospitals and stop future Medicaid cuts.
“I wish I had thought of it,” Alford said, drawing mocking laughter. “We need more money to shore up to our hospitals.”
Alford is a Republican in his second term in Congress, following a long career as a TV news anchor in Kansas City.
Many people pleaded with Alford to address his commitments to Trump, with one attendee saying that Alford wasn’t in the Republican Party but the Trump party.
In response, Alford said, “Trump isn’t a perfect person but has the best interest at heart.” His response was met overwhelmingly with boos and shouts from the audience.
Throughout the meeting, Alford heard complaints from people who said they were unable to make contact with him or his team to voice their concerns.
“We are not doing the job we need to be doing,” Alford said. Throughout the meeting he directed people with questions to reach out to his team for answers.
As some in the audience chanted “liar” at him, Alford replied sarcastically, “If you didn’t want to hear my lies why did you come here tonight?”
One speaker noted that Alford was not visiting Columbia despite stopping in 15 counties this week.
“We are in Boone County, yes, but we are just a few feet away from the county line,” said Mark Haim, director of Mid-Missouri Peaceworks. “Basically we have been denied even though Columbia represents a significant portion of your district in terms of population.”
“We will come to Columbia next year,” Alford said.
Alford experienced a contentious town hall in February when federal workers were experiencing layoffs and got national attention for his comment that “God has a plan” for those affected. He is one of the few Republicans in Congress who has met publicly with constituents.
Two people voiced support for Alford, thanking him for his work.
“I want to say that I am proud of the work you’ve done, especially as a student,” said Brenden Poteet, club president of Mizzou Republicans.
Trump last week endorsed Alford’s reelection on his social media platform Truth Social.

(Getty Images)Native American housing advocates are calling on Congress to help them meet growing and urgent affordable housing needs on tribal lands by reauthorizing a law that expired more than a decade ago.
Tribal housing leaders discussed what they say is an affordable housing crisis among their communities at a webinar Tuesday held by the Western Governors’ Association — a nonprofit organization of the governors of 22 states — and urged reauthorization of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, a law Congress first passed in 1996 that gave tribes more flexibility in how they could use federal housing funds to meet their communities’ needs. It eliminated a matrix of different housing programs and replaced them with a single, block grant program for projects.
“This isn’t really a handout in any way, shape or form,” said Rudy Soto, executive director of the National American Indian Housing Council and member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation. “Our ancestors of tribal nations, early as the country was forming, had the foresight to forge these treaties and legal agreements while conceding lands for the purposes of housing, education and health care.”
Native Americans have some of the lowest rates of homeownership in the country, and updating the law is the single most important way to boost home construction and homeownership among Native Americans, the housing leaders said.
“If people really want to help, they can help us reauthorize (the act) to improve the legislation and ensure this funding well into the future,” said Paul Lumley, a citizen of the Yakama Nation and chief advancement officer at the Native American Youth and Family Center in Portland.
The last time the act was reauthorized was in 2008, and it expired in 2013. While Congress still funds Native American housing assistance programs through other appropriations bills — even increasing funding for tribal housing needs in 2024 under the Biden administration — tribal leaders said the act itself needs to be reauthorized and updated to reduce red tape for housing projects.
Soto said his organization is working with Oregon’s U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum, a Democrat representing the state’s 5th Congressional District, and Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, of Montana, to introduce legislation reauthorizing the law.
Neither congressional office immediately responded to requests for comment from the Capital Chronicle.
The Native American homeownership rate in the U.S. sits at 54% — less than the rate of 72% for white households and 63% for Asian households, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Native American homeownership rate is, however, higher than the rate of Black homeownership at 45%, and slightly more than the 51% Hispanic homeownership rate.
Advocates at the meeting pointed to a variety of barriers to owning homes, such as lower income levels and mortgage lending constraints on tribal land. Research also shows that Native American communities disproportionately experience overcrowded homes, and a lack of infrastructure and housing in remote areas where many Native Americans live on or near reservations.
Jody Cahoon Perez, executive director of the Salish and Kootenai Housing Authority based on the Flathead Reservation in Montana, said beyond policy, cultural and historical injustices play a role in the barriers Native Americans face when trying to own a home.
“Our whole way of life has changed, and we now live in homes that are stationary and we get mortgages on them when we never used to,” she said at the webinar. “We moved with the seasons, with the food we migrated. It was different. So it’s like we’re having to catch up with centuries of progress on the non-tribal side and also surviving genocide.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-28 11:41:12+00:00,CT Mirror,Is gerrymandering the way?,Eric Kuhn,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/28/is-gerrymandering-the-way/,"I understand the impulse to fight fire with fire, but redrawing districts is not going to get us out of the fix we’re in.","I write today to express my profound misgivings about the nationwide counter-gerrymandering campaign the Democrats are contemplating under the de facto leadership of Gavin Newsom. 
In part, this is a government major’s perspective. Gerrymandering is a bad thing for democracy, therefore wall-to-wall gerrymandering will not be a good thing. The goal of any gerrymander is the creation of “safe seats,” which are seats that one or the other of the political parties can rest assured about instead of competing for.
But it is only when candidates compete hard for seats they might or might not win that we get useful elections, where new ideas might get tried out or old ideas might get fact-checked, where tuned-in voters are aware that the seat is up for grabs and that the contest is therefore worth paying attention to. 
Seats in our House of Representatives are something like 90% safe as it is. This is mostly due to decades of gerrymandering, and to seniority and momentum. Once you’re been in the House a while, unless the endless fund-raising gets to you, you have name-recognition at home and perhaps some bacon-bringing ability.
Routinely, Americans rate the Congress very low and their own representative pretty high. For those who can handle the working conditions (which may include death threats), it’s a job that can last most of a lifetime. In the big picture, this would not appear to be a good thing for the country and world. Currently, our safely-seated Congress is pretty useless.
The new Dem push will exacerbate the problem, not as a side-effect, but as a goal. The idea is to carve out districts wherever possible nationwide that will, according to the latest polling and what might be described as voter science, be safe Democrat districts. Less clash of ideas, a higher barrier to entry for anyone who isn’t already in. The only election that matters will be the Democratic primary, usually a low-turnout affair controlled by the party itself.
There’s an even more fundamental problem with the line-drawing approach to winning elections. It implies punting on the thing that elections are supposed to be about, which is changing hearts and minds. The gerrymanderer assumes that the votes are what they are and where they are, and therefore it’s time to create districts that look like a robot’s attempt at modern art.
The point of politics is supposed to be to convince voters to vote for you — because of your pretty face or your bold ideas or your decades in office or your newcomer status or whatever you feel you have going for you. The gerrymandering strategy involves a certain throwing in the towel on communicating with the voters and the non-voters who might get off the couch someday if somebody really spoke to them.
And why would a major political party– the Democrats, in this case– give up on regular old message-based politicking at this point? It’s a little as if they had acknowledged and internalized their lack of a real message to sell other than Stop Trump, and instead were forging ahead with a strategy cooked up by the latest software, the hippest algorithms. As a matter of political philosophy, I hate when that happens.
Late in the Harris campaign I was dismayed to find her seeming to continually focus on Trump and his latest utterances, as if America didn’t already know about Trump, instead of playing to what should have been her strength. She’s a sane and well-informed grown-up who could have been speaking directly to the public about sane grown-up stuff, which would have left Trump at the children’s table because he isn’t capable of an informed debate about much of anything. She could have been talking about her program.
The Democrats as a herd have not particularly moved beyond that. Thirty-some years ago, Bill Clinton shoved the party to the right; he won the White House, and the party lost any credibility it had as a change agent or a voice for the oppressed. In 2016 when it looked like Bernie Sanders might take the country by storm, the party– not the people– stopped him. These days, the Democrats’ selling point is that they’re not Trump– which is true, and important, but not enough to change hearts and minds. So, let’s gerrymander!
I understand the impulse to fight fire with fire, but redrawing districts is not going to get us out of the fix we’re in. In Texas, the current epicenter of Republican gerrymandering, part of the reason the GOP sees opportunities is the rather hard swing toward Trump among Hispanic voters there in 2024. That’s not a technical detail; that’s the real story. It’s a sad story but true, and the Democrats need to somehow come to grips with it. Hispanic Texans aren’t the only demographic they’re losing.

A substantial amount of state funding would, instead, go toward fixing roads with a $3.4 billion increase to the Department of Transportation budget over the current fiscal year.
There were also numerous boilerplate items prohibiting money for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across state agencies.
Members of the House voted Tuesday to pass a substitute version of House Bill 4706 along party lines. The budget would fund the state’s various departments with $54.63 billion, while $12.09 billion would go to the General Fund. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The House’s total fiscal year 2025-26 budget proposal comes to $78.5 billion in gross funding when its education budgets are included, which passed months earlier.
By comparison, the Democratic-controlled Senate’s budget that passed in May – excluding community colleges, higher education, the education departments and school aid funding K-12 – is $60.28 billion, with $13.04 billion going to the General Fund. With the education budgets included, the Senate’s budget plan comes to $84.6 billion.
The difference between the two plans is a whopping $6.1 billion.
Among its largest cuts were to the Department of Health and Human Services.
A line item for Medicaid and behavioral health was slashed by $3.79 billion, a 13% decrease over the current year, while the public health line item for the department would be cut by $92.4 million in the House plan, a 7.6% decrease. Additionally,  human services in the health department line item would be slashed by $1.07 billion in the House plan, a 14.8% decrease over the current fiscal year.
Republicans’ proposal for the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity also slashes the agency by $1.13 billion – a 46. 7% cut.
The department would be funded at $1.29 billion in the House budget. Michigan funded the department at $2.42 billion in the current fiscal year.

The governor proposed a considerable cut to the department in her recommendations delivered at the turn of the year, opting to fund the agency at $1.88 billion. The Senate has proposed a cut but with funding more in line with the current year at $2.11 billion.
Other cuts proposed by House Republicans include:

$54 million from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development;
$28.5 million from the Department of Corrections;
$200 million from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy;
$5 million from the Department of Insurance and Financial Services;
$29.2 million from the judiciary budget;
$69.4 million from the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs;
$53.2 million from the Department of Natural Resources; and
$66.2 million from the Department of State Police.

Total general government spending was cut by $667.2 million. That includes cuts of $38.3 million from the Department of Attorney General; $15 million from the Department of Civil Rights; $69.3 million from the Department of State; another $431.1 million from the Department of Technology, Management and Budget; and $117 million from the Department of Treasury.
Regarding state police, the House budget would also defund 300 full time employee positions from the statewide law enforcement operations.
House GOP builds wall against DEI programs
Across multiple pieces of boilerplate language in the proposed House Republican budget, the majority caucus aims to prohibit any state funding from going to DEI programs.
No specific DEI initiatives within various programs are mentioned in the analysis from the House Fiscal Agency, but the boilerplate language appears in the outlook for agriculture and rural development, the environmental agency, the total general government budget, health and human services, the labor department, the military and veterans affairs agency, state police, and transportation.
The House also removed $218,800 from the General Fund used to pay for a DEI officer within the attorney general’s office, and eliminated the Office of Race, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion within the health department.
In the state police budget, the House deleted boilerplate language that requires training on tolerance, diversity, implicit bias and de-escalation.
House budget wasn’t all cuts and slashing
There were some increases in spending proposed by House Republicans, as evidenced by the influx of money to the Department of Transportation.
House Republicans are proposing to fund the agency at $10.2 billion, a 50.5% increase by $3.43 billion. Boilerplate language for transportation notes that the House’s increase to the state trunkline road and bridge capital program followed Whitmer’s plan to increase spending in that area by $53.6 million.
The House goes a step further, however, keeping Whitmer’s baseline increase but adds $67.9 million from MDOT administrative funding, $366.8 million from the increase in motor fuel tax revenue proposed in House Bill 4183, $126.3 million from the redirection of income tax revenue proposed under House Bill 4187, and $333.6 million for the redirection of debt service.
Democratic lawmakers say federal budget cuts will hurt Michigan efforts at road funding plan 

Another nearly billion-dollar increase would go toward cities and villages by way of Act 51 Michigan Transportation Fund dollars, with the House noting it “recognizes” Whitmer’s proposed increase of $9.8 million in transportation funding, as well as the $204.5 million from the increase in motor fuel tax revenue, a $459.2 million redirection of income tax revenue and $260 million moved from General Fund dollars.
The county component of that would also result in a billion-dollar increase from the same streams under the House proposal.
A new targeted local bridge program would be funded at $100 million under the House plan.
A modest 6.9% increase from the House to the Department of Military and Veteran Affairs would fund the agency at $295 million. The current fiscal year funds the department at $275.9 million. Whitmer proposed an increase at $293 million and the Senate has proposed funding the department at $291.5 million.
Cuts raise eyebrows with various groups
Democrats in both the House and Senate have by and large derided the GOP’s budget plan for the lower chamber. 
State Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores), chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military, Veterans, and State Police, slammed the cuts to the Michigan State Police budget.
“Funding our police should never be a partisan issue. But House Republicans’ budget makes catastrophic cuts and undermines public safety. I will not play games with the safety of Michigan communities, and I will never balance the budget on the backs of our troopers,” Hertel said.

While criticism from Democrats was a given, various advocacy groups have joined them in their concern for the House’s budget proposal.
Ken Nixon, director of outreach and community partnerships with Safe & Just Michigan, called out cuts to programs that promote public safety.
“The Republican budget proposal guts the very programs that keep our communities safe and help people return home with stability and dignity,” Nixon said in a statement. “Cutting reentry services, prison healthcare, education, and alternatives to incarceration doesn’t make Michigan safer – it sets us back. Real public safety comes from investing in people, reducing barriers to success, and ensuring basic human needs are met. Both parties still have work to do to fully live up to that vision, but this plan takes us in the exact opposite direction.”
Chuck Warpehoski, project director of Michigan Collaborative to End Mass Incarceration, said the House cuts to prison staffing come at a time when prisons are already dangerously overcrowded and understaffed.
“There is a safe way to cut prison costs, increase safety, and address overcrowding: stop Michigan’s over-reliance on excessive prison sentences,” Warpehoski said in a statement. “Keeping someone incarcerated after they have rehabilitated and served a meaningful prison sentence only wastes taxpayer dollars that could be better spent on crime prevention and victims services. The legislature can start this process by funding the bipartisan sentencing commission.” 
The Michigan Works! Association also expressed strong concern over the House budget’s cuts to workforce development funding and the elimination of what it called “two of Michigan’s most effective talent programs: the Going PRO Talent Fund and Registered Apprenticeships.”
“These are draconian cuts that would severely undermine Michigan’s workforce development system at a time when employers and jobseekers alike are depending on it most,” Ryan Hundt, CEO of the Michigan Works! Association, said in a statement. “Apprenticeships and the Going PRO Talent Fund are proven, effective tools for building a stronger economy, and Michigan cannot afford to lose them.”
The association particularly questioned the move given President Donald Trump’s recent executive order calling for one million additional additional apprenticeships nationwide.
“Every Michigander deserves a pathway to prosperity, and every employer deserves access to a skilled workforce,” Hundt said. “We will be vocal in our advocacy to ensure decision-makers understand the vital role these programs play for Michigan residents and businesses.”
Education leaders also continued to ring the alarm bell on the House’s previously passed K-12 budget, calling the Republican budget a $2 billion loss for K-12 schools and urging the House to go back to the drafting table.
“Adequate funding is the foundation that sets Michigan students up for long term success. It’s how we deliver a K-12 education system that provides smaller class sizes, mental health supports, wraparound services, and other resources we know creates an education environment where students can reach their full potential,” Peter Spadafore, executive director of the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the House budgets do none of those things.”
Spadafore and others noted that the House education budget diverts $1.47 billion in School Aid Fund dollars to Higher Education, while also cutting $598 million in School Aid Fund dollars used to offset retirement costs. That would result in increased payroll obligations in school districts across the state.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_6641-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-08-28 07:57:17.193246

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A fatal crash in Florida earlier this month has immigrant advocates here in New Jersey nervous that migrants with valid Garden State driver’s licenses will be a target if they drive out of state.
Florida officials announced this week that after police pulled over a man Sunday who is in the United States illegally but had a New Jersey driver’s license, authorities turned the man over to immigration agents. Those licenses are “no good here,” Republican Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said.
Uthmeier’s comments came about two weeks after the driver of a tractor-trailer attempted an illegal U-turn on a Florida highway and caused a crash that killed three people. Police say the driver is in the U.S. illegally and had obtained a commercial driver’s license in California. Florida officials after the deadly crash said they would crack down on undocumented immigrant drivers.
“It’s sad, but not surprising, that Republicans are using a tragedy like what happened in Florida to justify their intimidation and discrimination against immigrants,” Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08) said in a statement.
Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union), a chief sponsor of the New Jersey law that allows people without citizenship to obtain driver’s licenses, questioned why Florida officials would begin a public fight with other states. 
“This absolutely heightens the fear even more among immigrant communities, and continues to use what has been good government to the political advantage of some,” Cryan said. “Quite frankly, I find it a horrific thing to do.” 
Nineteen states including New Jersey allow all residents, regardless of immigration status, to obtain a driver’s license, part of a push to decrease the number of uninsured drivers on the road. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed the law expanding driver’s license access in 2019, and it took effect in 2021. All drivers have to pass the same test and be insured to be licensed in New Jersey, and licenses do not denote immigration status. 
People without legal status are barred from obtaining a New Jersey commercial driver’s license or a Real ID. 
A spokesman for Murphy declined to comment. William Connolly, a spokesman for the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, said all driver’s licenses issued by New Jersey are valid in other states. 
“New Jerseyans who safely operate a vehicle in compliance with state and federal law should be able to utilize their licenses in all U.S. states,” Connolly said. “The MVC will continue to issue commercial and non-commercial driver’s licenses in accordance with state and federal law, upholding the highest safety standards when it comes to licensing drivers.” 
Florida police say the man they pulled over on Sunday was driving a white Ram pulling a large car hauler trailer and had stopped his car in a lane of traffic at a green light in a town in northwestern Florida. Police say he spoke only Spanish and “did not understand even the simplest request.” After confirming the man is not a legal resident of the United States, they said, they contacted immigration agents.
“There’s no telling how many illegal aliens are in this country driving large commercial vehicles and putting American families in a safety risk every single day,” Uthmeier said Monday.
He added, “If you have obtained a driver’s license from one of the sanctuary states like California, Washington, or in the case of the driver from last night, New Jersey, those licenses are no good here.”
Nedia Morsy is the executive director of Make the Road New Jersey, an immigration advocacy group that led the fight for driver’s licenses regardless of status. Morsy said the law has been a success in New Jersey, adding that she isn’t surprised about Florida officials’ comments considering escalating anti-immigrant rhetoric nationwide.
She said the community is more anxious and confused because it seems like “the very rules the government has created, they don’t follow them.” 
“The Trump administration has sort of created a personal militia that is sort of editing regulations as it sees fit in order to target people of color,” she said. 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday that California, New Mexico, and Washington are at risk of losing federal funding because they are not enforcing President Donald Trump’s executive order that commercial truck drivers must be proficient in English.

Harnessing the beaver’s ability to mitigate impacts from climate change makes sense. It is better than removing them again and again from the landscape in a way that damages ecosystems and needlessly drains municipal funds. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jennifer Lovett: Humane beaver management could save Vermont towns thousands of dollars.","This commentary is by Jennifer Lovett, of Starksboro. She is a conservation biologist, author of “Beavers Away!” and a former museum curator and educator.


Beavers are amazing animals who are simultaneously admired for their industrious engineering skills and disliked when their activities flood roads and fields. Our often-contentious relationship with them is long overdue for change. 
Recently, several studies have demonstrated the financial benefits of managing beavers humanely with beaver deceivers, pond levelers and fences rather than traditional methods of trapping, shooting or blowing up dams. Now that federal disaster relief is not guaranteed and emergency funds may not be available to towns for infrastructure protection and flood remediation, towns could save thousands of dollars by employing non-lethal beaver controls.
As a keystone species, beavers create, enhance and maintain habitat that countless other species rely on for survival. As ecosystem engineers, beavers change the landscape by converting small streams into vast dynamic wetlands, swamps and meadows. 
Beaver wetlands slow the rate of snowmelt and runoff by storing and cooling vast amounts of water underground, which, in turn, reduce the erosive impact of floods and can be released during droughts. Wetlands also act as firebreaks and critical places of refuge for wildlife during wildfires. Moreover, the sediment at the bottom of ponds filters out pollutants and improves water quality downstream.
While beavers could be among our best allies in the ongoing battle with the changing climate, I admit that they can be frustrating and can cause serious problems in areas prone to flooding. Flooded roads, farm fields, building sites and blocked culverts are often extremely expensive and recurring problems for towns and landowners. 
Beaver conflicts are often handled by killing the beavers and destroying their dams. However, this is rarely a permanent solution since any good territory will be claimed by new beavers, resulting in a continual cycle of flooding, road or culvert damage, infrastructure repairs and repeated annual killing of numerous animals. 
Alternatively, non-lethal means of controlling beaver activity can be achieved by simply regulating the flow of water out of ponds or wetlands. Devices can allow water to flow through a dam or culvert without the beavers’ desire or ability to block it. This permits the many benefits beavers provide to ecosystems and biodiversity to remain in place while also protecting infrastructure. 
In Alberta, Canada, researchers assessed the efficacy of pond-leveling devices and fencing to manage beaver activity in areas with chronic flooding. A cost-benefit analysis compared the cost of traditional management approaches, such as trapping, with non-lethal alternatives. The difference was remarkable. Over a period of seven years, traditional management cost the province more than $3 million, while the installation of non-lethal devices cost $179,440.
In Billerica, Massachusetts, 55 beaver-conflict sites were studied from 2000 to 2019. Again, results showed that the sites managed with non-lethal controls cost much less than those managed by lethal removal. While it cost $409 to trap beavers at each site per year, installations of flow devices at each site cost on average $229 per year. Thus, the town saved $7,740 annually with non-lethal management.
Another study analyzed the efficacy and comparative costs of using flow devices to resolve beaver conflicts along roads in seven counties in the Coastal Plain of Virginia. 
Flow devices were installed in 14 sites damaged by beavers. The average maintenance cost at each site was less than $20 after flow devices were installed, compared with $21,490 per site per year for maintenance, road repairs and population control prior to this installation. 
The work on this project was also executed by Skip Lisle, the inventor of the Beaver Deceiver and president of Beaver Deceivers International, which is based in Grafton. Lisle has successfully installed his flow devices — with lifespans estimated at 30-40 years — all over the country and in several locations in Europe. 
With such a resource here in Vermont, this state should be leading the transition away from lethal management toward coexistence.
Cost-benefit studies have not been done in Vermont. However, the small town of Andover, New Hampshire, resolved decades of costly beaver conflicts by rejecting traditional lethal management in favor of beaver deceivers and coexistence. In 2007, the town hired Lisle, who, over 10 years, installed protective devices at eight sites where culverts had been repeatedly blocked and roads damaged by flooding. 
Although financial considerations were paramount, Andover’s transition from lethal management strategies also reflects changing attitudes toward beavers and the critical role they play in wetland ecosystems. Andover town officials estimated that over 10 years, the town saved about $130,000 and projected a savings of almost $500,000 to town coffers over 30 years. Alternatively, repeated killing of the beavers and the associated repairs to infrastructure would cost the town well over that amount.
Fiscal savings are quantifiable when it comes to the time, equipment and labor involved in repairing culverts and roads, but the value of a functional, ecologically balanced wetland system is immeasurable. 
Sadly, traditional methods for controlling beaver activity are still commonplace and seem to be the first choice of towns, landowners and wildlife managers. The resulting loss of wetlands has dire ecological detriments. Floods, droughts, biodiversity losses and wildfire are all symptomatic of our rapidly changing environment. 
Clearly, harnessing the beaver’s ability to mitigate impacts from climate change makes sense and is far preferable to removing them again and again from the landscape in a way that damages ecosystems and needlessly drains municipal funds.

(Photo courtesy Dubois County Sheriff's Office Facebook)The state body that oversees police certification is now considering whether Dubois County Sheriff Tom Kleinhelter should be stripped of his law enforcement credentials.
The Indiana Law Enforcement Training Board’s decertification subcommittee was asked last week to review the case, following a request from the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy and its executive director, Tim Horty. 
The request follows a monthslong Indiana State Police investigation into allegations of misconduct by Kleinhelter. Although a special prosecutor ultimately decided not to charge Kleinhelter, the training board voted Aug. 18 to move forward with charges of fraud, perjury, false informing and criminal misconduct.
Story continues below.
SIGNED - Notice of Charges
 
The board pointed to two separate allegations of fraud in the charging document.
In one instance, Kleinhelter was accused of purchasing employee gifts and directing the jail matron to falsely list the expenses as “training” in commissary records. The sheriff is also alleged to have reimbursed the jail commissary with more than $16,000 following a state audit, but then sought to recoup the money by filing a reimbursement request with the county auditor that falsely listed a State Board of Accounts employee’s name to suggest its approval.
The board also accused Kleinhelter of perjury, alleging that the sheriff signed a nepotism compliance form months after he approved his wife as a special deputy. The training board claimed that could be a violation of the county’s policy around “hiring and supervising relatives.”
Kleinhelter is further accused of false informing for telling state police investigators he received an airline “e-credit” for a canceled work trip — although the airline confirmed he was actually issued a direct refund.
Story continues below.
Officer 10
ILEA’s training board noted in the charging document that Kleinhelter’s alleged actions occurred while he was serving in his official capacity as sheriff and could qualify as official misconduct.
Kleinhelter did not reply to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s request for comment about his potential decertification.
If he is decertified, he could no longer serve as sheriff, since holding the office requires maintaining police certification.
Kleinhelter serves on the full 23-member Indiana Law Enforcement Training Board that will make the final decision on his case.
Subcommittee to weigh decertification
The state police’s criminal investigation stemmed from a 2024 audit by the Indiana State Board of Accounts, which flagged more than $16,000 in spending by Kleinhelter. State auditors forwarded the case to the Indiana Attorney General’s Office and the local prosecuting attorney, and state police opened an investigation in July 2024.
​​The probe has since drawn wider attention after former Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter publicly criticized the agency’s handling of the case. Carter pointed to the discipline of Lt. Jeff Hearon, the lead investigator, who was suspended after pressing a reluctant prosecutor to charge Kleinhelter.
 Indiana Law Enforcement Academy Executive Director Tim Horty (Photo courtesy ILEA)
Horty told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that his office initiated the decertification request after spotting news coverage of the state audit into Kleinhelter’s handling of county jail commissary funds.
“On a weekly basis, we do a Google search of police officers around the state that might be involved in any kind of activity,” Horty said. “That Google Alert came up … and then we went to the State Board of Accounts to look at their report that is a public record.”
Under Indiana law, officers can lose their certification for certain felony or misdemeanor convictions — but also for conduct that would constitute a crime, even if no charges are filed. Horty emphasized that distinction.
“The reason that the law was written with or without conviction is because … just because they don’t necessarily get prosecuted doesn’t mean that they should just be dropped,” Horty said.
The decertification process begins with the training board’s five-member subcommittee, made up of three law enforcement board members and two civilians. It’s currently chaired by David Wantz, former president of the Independent Colleges of Indiana. 
The subcommittee conducts an evidentiary hearing, where the officer can appear with legal counsel. 
“For lack of a better term, it’s an administrative trial,” Horty explained.
He additionally stressed that the academy does its own investigation before presenting a case to the subcommittee, which includes collecting documentation to support allegations.
“In this case, it was the State Board of Accounts report,” Horty said. “We started to determine internally, should this go to the subcommittee? Should this be presented to the subcommittee? In this case, we said yes, because I think there are some conduct that could be considered a felony if it were convicted.”
Conditions for decertification
State law changed in 2022 to broaden when an officer can be decertified.
Under current statute, certification can be revoked if an officer has been convicted of a felony, or of a misdemeanor that would lead “a reasonable person” to believe the officer is dangerous, violent, or has a demonstrated propensity to break the law. 
Certification can also be stripped if the officer has been found not guilty of a felony by reason of mental disease or defect; if the officer’s certification was issued in error or based on false information; or if the officer engaged in conduct that would constitute a disqualifying criminal offense even without being formally charged or convicted.
Before the law changed, the standard was a felony conviction or two qualifying misdemeanors.
Lengthy investigation into sheriff’s alleged wrongdoing ends with investigator in hot water

From there, the decertification deliberations unfold much like a courtroom case, but the burden of proof is lower, Horty said. The standard is “preponderance of the evidence … meaning just over 50% certainty,” rather than the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
An officer who receives notice of a decertification request can seek a hearing or voluntarily give up their certification. If the officer chooses the hearing route, Horty said, “we give them 90 days to respond to set a hearing date and so forth.”
A pre-hearing conference must be scheduled within ten days of that request. At the hearing itself, “evidence is presented, they are allowed to be represented by counsel, and it’s an administrative trial,” Horty continued.
The subcommittee does not face a strict timeline. Horty said the panel meets about once a month, “but continuances are common,” and “it could take several months” for a case to be resolved.
He noted that Kleinhelter’s matter has not yet been scheduled because the letter was only recently sent to him and his attorney.
The subcommittee can recommend permanent decertification, a temporary suspension, or impose conditions like additional training or drug and alcohol testing.
“They could give (the law enforcement officer) additional training or additional drug testing or additional something that would help satisfy the board’s appetite,” Horty said.

He added that while officers in past cases have been required to complete domestic violence or Fourth Amendment training, “it has never been a situation where paying the money back or paying a financial retribution has … been part of the” conditional options.
Whatever the subcommittee recommends, the full training board must vote to give final approval. 
The board’s 23 members including law enforcement leaders from across the state, as well as civilians — are appointed by the governor and serve four-year terms.
Among the board’s current members is Kleinhelter himself. Horty confirmed that the sheriff’s presence on the board “doesn’t really change anything” in this case, except that he would not participate in any vote involving his own decertification.
Kleinhelter was appointed under former Gov. Eric Holcomb. Horty said no new training board members have yet been named by Gov. Mike Braun’s administration.

Article Summary

This summer marks a decade since Illinois’ budget impasse began, which ultimately dragged on for two years and decimated human services across the state.
Since then, Illinois’ human services sector has recovered, albeit unevenly — a picture complicated by both the increased need brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the billions in federal funding spent as a result.
But major cuts in Medicaid and other federal grants, led by President Donald Trump, threaten to upend progress made rebuilding Illinois’ human services.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

JONESBORO, Ill. — It was a bitterly cold evening on Jan. 19, 1997, when Judy Stegle and her husband, Mike, received the call that would upend their lives forever.
Their 17-year-old daughter, Cortnie Stewart, a softball and basketball standout at Anna-Jonesboro Community High School, a gifted painter with a spunky attitude, had taken the car without permission to drive to Harrisburg. She hit black ice and the car landed on her after she was thrown from the vehicle. When the ambulance arrived, she was unconscious.
Cortnie woke up 13 days later in a hospital in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.
“She opened her eyes and she saw me, and she started crying,” Judy Stegle said. “And they said, ‘Well, that’s great that she has emotions.’”
But Cortnie had suffered extensive brain damage. She’d never speak again, or feed herself, or go to the bathroom without help. She would live, but she would need round-the-clock care for the rest of her life.
A few years later, the Stegles reached out to the Delta Center, which provided respite care services. That meant even just a few hours a week where someone from the Cairo-based nonprofit organization could step in for the Stegles. Enough time for Judy Stegle to run to the doctor, get her hair done, maybe grab a meal with her husband at the local Dairy Queen.
Then, in 2015, the Delta Center closed, becoming one of the earliest casualties of Illinois’ two-year budget impasse, which began a decade ago this summer — a product of the political struggle between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who controlled the General Assembly.
Just over a month into the impasse, the nonprofit’s respite care program that helped the Stegles and more than 50 other families in Southern Illinois ended and never returned.
“The state of Illinois … is pretty crappy,” Judy Stegle said. “There’s just no help out there for anything.”

The Stegles were far from alone in their experience; organizations that provided child welfare, housing, mental health care, alcohol and drug addiction services, food for poor people, senior services, childhood education, and care for domestic violence victims cut off services to nearly 1 million Illinoisans. Hundreds of human service agencies were forced to lay off employees and slash their budgets with disastrous outcomes.
In some cases, these services still haven’t recovered.
The stories of upended lives were legion: A sexual assault crisis center in Urbana put rape victims on a three-month waiting list for counseling appointments; a social service agency in Chicago denied drug addiction treatment, domestic violence counseling and HIV prevention to hundreds of people; a senior service agency in Alton took on $3.5 million in debt, reduced Meals on Wheels services and warned that seniors are “starving and being left out in the cold.”
Most organizations weathered the storm, though it was costly. Some tapped into financial reserves or bank loans to get them through, in addition to shuttering programs and laying off or furloughing employees. Others relied on more desperate moves like using a board member’s 401(k) fund or illegally withholding payroll taxes. Many fundraised through bake sales. Some sold impasse-themed T-shirts.
But the impasse was less forgiving for some smaller operators in the poorer, sparsely populated towns throughout Illinois. They closed and never reopened, and there was no one else to do the work.
Then-candidate JB Pritzker seized on the resulting discontent and sailed to an easy victory over Rauner in 2018, with the Democrat promising to undo the damage. But in the decade since the state’s two-year budget stalemate began, recovery for social services has been uneven.
As governor, Pritzker has touted significant growth in spending under his administration; annual General Funds state spending on human services jumped by 60% from 2014 to 2024 — from $12.3 billion to $19.7 billion.
University of Illinois-Chicago professor David Merriman, who has long researched state finances, said Illinois’ economic picture has drastically improved more than he thought possible a decade ago.
“We’ve done better than I expected, quite honestly,” Merriman said. “We’re in much better shape than I thought we’d be.”
But that progress very well may be upended by large cuts to Medicaid benefits and cuts to housing and food assistance contained in congressional Republicans’ recently passed federal budget signed into law July 4 by President Donald Trump.
Illinois Collaboration on Youth Chief Executive Officer Andrea Durbin warned the state’s network of human services organizations is not equipped to handle an increase in need created by federal spending cuts, especially as social services agencies continue to struggle holding onto qualified employees.
“We’ll see great demand and fewer resources and a … shrinking workforce to serve them,” Durbin said. “And so how can people prepare for something like that? I don’t know that you really can.”
Illinois Deputy Governor for Health and Human Services Grace Hou, who ran the Department of Human Services during Pritzker’s first term, said she’d learned early on that “trust … can be easy to lose, but it’s really hard to rebuild.”

She fears the coming federal cuts will undo years of progress.
“It’s an earthquake, it’s a tidal wave, it’s a tsunami,” Hou said.
The impasse years
Rauner, who ran for governor in 2014 as a socially moderate Republican during the tail end of the GOP’s era of libertarian dominance, had a simple message for voters: Illinoisans’ tax dollars were being wasted by the “corrupt bargain” between Democrats who ran the state and public employee unions which he alleged inflate the cost of government services.
Two years before his victory against unpopular Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, Rauner said he wanted “to drive a wedge issue in the Democratic Party” on the role of government in social services and bring in voters who’d rather “help the disadvantaged, the handicapped, the elderly, the children in poverty” than unionized government workers.
Before Rauner was even sworn in, he faced an immediate $6 billion structural deficit when a temporary hike to the state’s income tax rates expired on Jan. 1, 2015. The deficit would have to be made up by either other sources of revenue or cuts to state spending — or a combination of both.
Instead, after a spring of ever-worsening relations between the governor and Democrats who controlled the legislature, Illinois entered the new fiscal year on July 1, 2015, with no spending plan after Rauner vetoed most of the budget passed by the majority party.
Rauner did not respond to multiple messages for comment.

During the two-year stalemate, Illinois saw neither cuts to state spending nor new revenue sources. In fact, the state kept on spending due to a combination of constitutional mandates and a series of court rulings forcing the state to maintain certain services for vulnerable populations like the developmentally disabled.
Rauner himself took steps that ensured the impasse did not affect most voters, such as approving K-12 public schools spending and going to court to keep paying state workers.
The impasse lacked hallmarks that make federal government shutdowns a spectacle like airport security agents walking off the job or mass furloughs. The budget stalemate affected less than 10% of the state’s population, people who already live on the margins of society, including the poor, homeless people, children in foster care, people with disabilities, those struggling with addiction, and people suffering from domestic violence or gun violence.
Social services agencies that served those Illinoisans often weren’t covered by the patchwork of legal shields but were still obligated to fulfill their state contracts — many of which were even renewed during the two-year impasse — without any state funding.
The cuts to the state’s social safety net came fast and furiously. Some were temporary, others permanent.
‘It is so sad’
By the time the budget impasse began, the Stegles had settled into a life that was upended by tragedy. And they had done so with help from the state of Illinois.
The state had long funded the Delta Center, which hired the respite care worker they came to rely on, Becky Neathery. She knew how to bathe Cortnie, feed her, keep her calm. She was someone they felt safe leaving Cortnie with — and for the first time in many years, Judy and Mike could breathe on occasion. They even started going on an annual vacation, often to a beach in Mexico.
Then, one day, Judy received an unexpected call from Becky. She told her, “‘Judy, I gotta get a job, and there’s no more Delta Center.’ And it’s like, ‘Oh no.’ I mean, and it was just — it was gone!”
In addition to respite care, the Delta Center provided housing for homeless people and sex offenders, offered jobs to disabled adults, and after-school programming for at-risk teenagers in the small, impoverished city of Cairo, which has lost more than half its population in the last few decades. A total of 1,523 people lived there in 2024, according to census estimates.
Neathery described the organization’s closure as “devastating” for many rural families, including one that resorted to institutionalizing their disabled family member when their respite care services were cut off.
“Of course, when we found out funding was going to end, we sent a formal letter out to all the families, and I was actually at a home doing respite care when the family opened their letter and cried,” she recalled. “They just cried because they weren’t going to have it anymore.”
When the Delta Center closed, another provider, Vienna-based Family Counseling Center Inc., now known as Arrowleaf, took over some of its mental health programming.
Today, the once sprawling Delta Center campus is mostly deserted. Big white block letters spelling out the Delta Center’s name on a nearby brick sign are swallowed in a tangle of vines.

“The services that ended in Cairo have never come back to Cairo,” said Sandy McGregor, a former Delta Center accountant who lived in Cairo as a young adult but now lives across the border in Kentucky. “It is so sad.”
The impasse was especially hard on small towns in Southern Illinois, which lacked the economic power to weather the storm. If a housing nonprofit shuts down in a more populated area like Chicago or Bloomington-Normal, others are available to step up.
That’s not the case in places like Rosiclare, a city of 980 people along the Ohio River about 80 miles northeast of Cairo. In February 2016, the Mahoney Transitional Living facility, a homeless shelter for young adults in the Southeastern Illinois city, also closed its doors about a year after FCCI opened the residence.
Arrowleaf Chief Executive Officer Sherrie Crabb made the difficult call to shutter Mahoney, which she’d named after her first-grade teacher. As her organization tried to prioritize services during the impasse, Crabb said she went without pay for the better part of a year, while 37 employees were laid off.
Crabb was introduced to FCCI as an elementary schooler when she and her sister were briefly placed in foster care, and said it was “traumatizing” to inform the five or six youths and young adults there that they needed to leave the closing shelter.
“It was another traumatic experience for them of picking up and having to go somewhere else, thinking that they had found a safe and secure place and had the support that they needed,” she said.
The shelter had been funded through a state grant, but payments were halted when the impasse began. Crabb said the impasse taught her to view grants funded exclusively by the state as “risky,” and said the stalemate years forced her organization and many others like it to diversify their funding sources — especially to federal money, which up until recently was viewed as more stable.
In the years since, the state’s Department of Human Services has continued to put the grant out for bid, but Crabb said Arrowleaf “will never touch a homeless youth program again because of that experience that we had.”
The damage spreads
As the impasse dragged on, Illinoisans’ access to social services shrank rapidly, as tracked by regular surveys conducted by the United Way of Illinois. Within weeks of the new fiscal year’s start, more than a third of the roughly 400 respondents to the United Way’s survey reported they had already made cuts.
Six months into the stalemate, nearly half of the 444 human services providers that responded to the survey reported limiting the number of clients they could serve, shuttering entire programs or both. Layoffs were becoming more common, too.
Illinoisans who received mental health and addiction treatment services made up the largest share of the million Illinoisans who’d had services shut off to them by June 2016, although the impasse affected portions of nearly every other vulnerable population throughout the state.

Rape Advocacy, Counseling, & Education Services in Urbana laid off its staff of eight workers and created an interim position to triage calls from sexual assault victims and people seeking protection orders.
“We were in a position of having to say, ‘I’m sorry we can’t help you and … no survivor deserves that,’” said Jaya Kolisetty, who became RACES’ interim leader during the impasse and is now executive director. “It can make it so people feel like there’s … no clear purpose in reaching out for help, and that can be a really helpless position to be in.”
The Alton-based Senior Services Plus Inc. laid off 17 employees and scaled back its popular Meals on Wheels program, which served up to 700 people in St. Clair and Madison counties, according to Chief Executive Officer Theresa Collins. They went from doing wellness checks and delivering hot food to each senior five times a week to doing wellness checks and delivering five frozen meals to each senior once a week.
By the time the impasse ended, more than 100 seniors were on the Meals on Wheels waiting list.
“When we started calling them when funding got flowing … several had been institutionalized or had died,” Collins said, adding that Meals on Wheels kept the once-a-week food delivery program as the number of their senior clients had ballooned to 1,100.
Though smaller nonprofits were uniquely vulnerable to the impasse, larger organizations suffered, too. Lutheran Social Services of Illinois, the single biggest human service provider in the state, sent shockwaves when it announced mass program closures and layoffs in mid-January 2016.
LSSI shuttered 33 programs that served 4,700 Illinoisans throughout the state, though the organization’s president and chief executive officer, Mark Stutrud, emphasized that efforts were made so that clients could be matched with other service providers. More than 750 staffers — roughly 43% of LSSI’s workforce — also were laid off.
The nonprofit scaled back youth services, including closing a youth shelter near Dixon, scaled back substance abuse treatment, shuttered nine mental health counseling centers and an adult day care, scrapped respite care for military families as well as reentry programs designed for inmates and their families in Alton, East Saint Louis and Chicago.
By the time of LSSI’s restructuring, the state owed the Des Plaines-based nonprofit more than $6 million and the organization had maxed out the bank line of credit it had been relying on for seven months and was “burning cash,” Stutrud said.
“We went too long because we thought this would get resolved, and they did not,” said Stutrud, who’d taken the helm at LSSI just a month before Rauner’s victory in the fall of 2014. “I don’t believe anybody understood how long it was going to go. No one did.”
For Kristen Ward, the budget impasse was one more sign that she’d gotten treatment for her heroin addiction at the right time.
In 2013, after two decades of abusing painkillers spiraled into heroin use, the 41-year-old nurse and mother of two young boys finally reached rock bottom. Ward had started stealing to support her addiction. After multiple arrests and a conviction, she spent five months in the Will County Jail.
“You better take this seriously … because this isn’t going to be available for everyone in the future,” Ward recalled being told during her 13-month stay at LSSI’s addiction treatment center in Chicago’s Edgewater neighborhood in 2013 and 2014.

A little over a year after she completed inpatient treatment, LSSI announced its mass layoffs and program closures. By that time, she was working as a nurse at LSSI’s newly opened detox center.
Ward’s job was safe but she worried for residents who “weren’t ready to go,” along with the detox patients she was helping through withdrawal — a brutal process she’d once gone through alone in a jail cell.
“It’s a vulnerable stage right after detox,” Ward said. “And if someone tells you they don’t have a bed … and you’re kind of left to your own devices, then you could convince yourself you could do it on your own, and then you’re back out there, and then the cycle starts again before you know it.”
In the years after the impasse, LSSI opened new residential treatment programs to replace ones shuttered in 2016, including in Edgewater. But that wasn’t the case for the organization’s in-home care program for seniors, most of which was taken on by two for-profit businesses as part of LSSI’s restructuring. The program had been the largest segment of LSSI’s operations, serving roughly 2,500 seniors in more than two dozen Illinois counties at its peak.
Jane Massey, of Rock Island, worked as an office manager and helped with client intake of LSSI’s in-home care program in Moline. It served 130 seniors in Rock Island, Henry and Mercer counties.
LSSI sold the business to Help at Home, but the company laid off all 78 of its local employees, who were then told to reapply. Massey said the quality of care suffered when Help at Home moved its central office to Rockford.
“I can tell you that our staff members that were going out and taking care of these people they were getting — they were having such a hard time with communicating with that office,” Massey said. “They didn’t return calls.”
Help at Home closed its Moline location in 2022 and fired Massey and the eight remaining workers.
In a statement, a Help at Home spokesperson called the budget impasse “a difficult period,” but said the organization maintained “uninterrupted home care” and preserved jobs after it took over LSSI’s portfolio.
Money flows again
After two years of compounding miseries, the Republican front folded in July 2017 when enough legislators joined the Democratic majority to override Rauner’s veto power, approving both a budget and an income tax rate hike to fund it.
State payments flowed once again, made easier after Comptroller Susana Mendoza borrowed $6.5 billion in a low-interest bond deal to pay off nearly half of Illinois’ staggering bill backlog.
After several years, the comptroller’s office was able to pay bills within 30 days — a figure that has since shrunk to an average of two weeks, and occasionally just one day.
But just because payments started flowing again didn’t mean social services agencies could immediately reopen their doors or ramp up capacity.
That impact could be seen at the Wells Center in Jacksonville, which provided drug addiction treatment for about 500 people each year but closed its doors in May 2017, one year shy of its 50th anniversary.
By the time the Wells Center became one of the last victims of the impasse, the state owed the nonprofit nearly $350,000. Shortly after being sworn in as comptroller in late 2016, Mendoza offered ways her office could pay a sliver of what the Wells Center was owed to keep it afloat. But the nonprofit’s leadership indicated it was likely too late.

“That’s a perfect example of a group that was so far gone that no matter how much money we poured into it, they weren’t going to survive,” she said.
The Wells Center’s facilities sat empty for months, but by the end of 2017, the Chicago-based Gateway Foundation had purchased the property. The new location opened its doors in June 2018.
Kasia Loniewska watched the budget impasse play out from Gateway’s offices in Springfield and is now the program director over the entire Jacksonville site. She said it was crucial for Jacksonville, a small city about 30 miles west of Springfield, to have intensive inpatient addiction treatment services — along with supportive housing for those in recovery — available for the surrounding rural areas.
“Other than Springfield, there was nothing and we knew that there’s definitely a need for it,” said Loniewska, who credits her sobriety to a stay in a Chicago recovery home as a young adult. “Not everybody’s able to relocate to Springfield and not everyone is able to afford the sober living facilities.”
For those in and around Jacksonville, whose roughly 18,000 residents make it the third-largest town in the part of western Illinois sometimes referred to as “Forgottonia,” the nearest inpatient offerings aside from Springfield are nearly 80 miles west in Quincy and more than 80 miles south in the Metro East.

Recent funding infusion
Pritzker has often pointed to “historic investments” in human services during his tenure as governor, though he occasionally blames his predecessor when the state has fallen short.
When the governor’s director of the Department of Children and Family Services was held in contempt of court a dozen times in 2022 for the agency’s continued failure to place foster children in appropriate settings, the administration pointed to the loss of 500 shelter beds during the budget impasse.
More than 6 ½ years into Pritzker’s governorship, the number of state-funded youth shelter beds operated mostly by private agencies has not returned to pre-impasse levels, meaning some children still languish in psychiatric hospitals beyond medical need or remain in juvenile detention after their sentences end because they have no other place to go.
But other areas of human services, including homelessness prevention and anti-violence organizations — both hurt by the impasse — have seen an influx of cash from both state and federal sources.
The infusion of funding in recent years is evident in Illinois’ three of its largest state agencies that oversee human services: the Department of Human Services, the Department on Aging and the Department of Children and Family Services.

Pritzker has boasted that doubling state funding to DCFS, which is subject to multiple federal consent decrees stemming from civil rights litigation spanning decades, has allowed the historically dysfunctional agency to grow its headcount from 2,615 in 2014 to 3,681 last year.
The number of children removed from their homes and in DCFS’ care, which child welfare experts label as a lagging indicator for unmet needs in other areas of human services, began climbing just after the impasse ended in mid-2017. The figure peaked at more than 21,000 at the end of Fiscal Year 2021, according to agency snapshot data, though some of that increase can also be attributed to the pandemic.
The overall spending increases on human services were helped by massive infusions of federal COVID-19 money, much of which the state distributed as one-time grants. The COVID money is reaching the tail end of its spending runway just as major federal cuts under Trump are beginning.
Illinois comptroller’s data shows that since 2022, the state has spent more than $10 billion in federal relief money, including $666 million in human services spending. That money allowed some nonprofits to boost their budgets and expand their services.
Lutheran Social Services of Illinois, which had a budget of $110 million before the budget crisis, and plunged to $79 million during the budget crisis, now has a budget of $157 million, said Stutrud, LSSI’s CEO.
Arrowleaf, which closed its young adult homeless shelter in Rosiclare, now operates in seven counties and has doubled its employee headcount since the impasse. Thanks in part to receiving more federal grants, Crabb, the nonprofit’s CEO, said her organization has increased its budget by about $10 million since the impasse to a high of $17.6 million in fiscal year 2024, though last year it fell to $15 million.
She even cited a $363,000 COVID-era “Rural Development Emergency Rural Health Care Grant” from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that Arrowleaf used to rehab its facility.
“It looks, probably, like one of the nicest buildings now in the city of Cairo,” Crabb said.
Federal cuts as deja vu
Some organizations like Arrowleaf have achieved steady budget growth in part through increased reliance on federal money, which has helped them meet higher levels of need brought on by COVID and the last few years of inflation and a shifting labor market.
But that strategy, adopted to shield social service agencies from future instability like Illinois’ budget impasse, has once again made organizations vulnerable to the current political moment.
Crabb said she had to lay off 10 Arrowleaf employees earlier this year due to state budget cuts and in anticipation of federal cuts even before Republican majorities in Congress approved the new budget in July, which includes significant reductions to Medicaid.
The “Big Beautiful Bill” is expected to cut Medicaid spending in Illinois by $46 billion over the next decade through new eligibility standards such as work requirements. It also limits the amount states can tax health care providers to pay for Medicaid — a lever Illinois has continually pushed to maximize federal match dollars for the program.

Paula Worthington, a senior policy advisor at the nonpartisan Civic Federation and lecturer at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, said Medicaid cuts may be more apparent in blue states like Illinois, which have chosen over years to be “more generous in terms of the services provided” by Medicaid dollars.
She cited Illinois paying for vision and dental care and offering longer timelines for new mothers and their babies to stay on a supplemental Medicaid program, which is offered regardless of immigration status.
“It’s going to be more painful and obvious in states that have been more generous when that funding is cut back,” she said.
Pritzker has warned that more than 330,000 Illinois residents will lose health coverage as a result.
And just like the long-term damage done by the budget impasse, Worthington worried southern Illinois and other rural parts of the state will be hit the hardest by Medicaid cuts and the shuttering of services reliant on those federal dollars.
“You can see that in rural downstate counties, greater shares of the relevant population are reliant on these things,” Worthington said. “Cook County, too — don’t get me wrong. … It’s Cook County, and then it’s downstate, rural communities that I think are most vulnerable.”
Illinois Deputy Governor for Budget and Economy Andy Manar acknowledged that challenges remain “not just in rural areas” but in historically underserved areas like Chicago’s south suburbs and shrinking population centers like Decatur and other mid-sized cities. Manar, a former state senator from rural Macoupin County, pointed to the human services agencies and programming that “cease(d) to exist” during the impasse.
“Rebuilding that has been a laborious process,” he said. “And by the way, that doesn’t happen by spending less money. You don’t rebuild DCFS … by hiring fewer people, by spending less money. You’ve got to spend more money.”

In Jonesboro, Judy and Mike Stegle, now retired, take turns with the caregiving, never leaving 46-year-old Cortnie alone.
But they know they can’t take care of her forever. Judy touches her hands, her fingers swollen from arthritis. She’s not as strong as she used to be, and she’s so far been unable to persuade the state or insurance to subsidize her purchase of a mechanical lift for Cortnie.
But she’s not ready to think too far into the future.
“I’ve done this since, well, in my 40s,” she said. “Now I’m 72. … But it’s like, ‘well, darn — there’s nobody that cares.’”

B. said he left Cameroon nine years ago because he was scared for his life. Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.
“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers a variable amount of monthly cash assistance through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Josh Hawley, take a leading role at the federal level in pushing for much needed health care reform, our state should not follow along with his apparent plans for rewiring the pharmacy system.
Last December, Hawley surprisingly partnered with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to introduce the “PBM Act” which would fundamentally change how Americans seek, obtain and pay for prescription drugs.
In these highly partisan times, though it may be refreshing to see such an unexpected joint effort, that feel good sentiment vanishes when one realizes this shortsighted bill does more harm than good.
The “PBM Act” would severely restrict how Pharmacy Benefit Managers operate as the nexus between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and customers.  PBMs are basically a central nervous system in getting medicines to patients.  They have lowered overall costs through high volume transactions in negotiations with pharma companies that invent and produce prescription drugs, plus are central to the distribution, co-pay and reimbursement processes.
Sens. Hawley and Warren are seeking to force pharmacies that own PBMs to divest them in an effort to help local pharmacies better compete, alleging the PBMs steer consumers to their own pharmacies and are taking too much market share.
Yet both gloss over the fact that PBMs are major players in the pharmacy-by-mail system which would sustain heavy damage if their bill becomes law. Both suggest that by cutting out the “suits” who aren’t doctors, they can save consumers money. However, without the PBMs to negotiate lower drug costs with manufacturers at scale, the prices will inevitably go up.
Both make misleading arguments to blame PBMs for why prescription drugs are so much more expensive in the U.S. compared to Canada and Europe. They ignore how consumers ultimately pay for America’s media market being saturated with pricey advertisements.
Anyone who watches cable TV here knows you can’t go five minutes of channel surfing without seeing one. I remained a citizen of Missouri for many years after launching my Army career from Kirksville. My Show-Me State experience taught me not to accept half-truths and rumors as facts. Those misleading arguments being pushed on Missouri residents do not reflect what is really happening in Asia and Europe.
Matter of fact, one of the PBMs in the bullseye is Express Scripts which serves the military’s Tricare insurance, among other major accounts.  Curtailing how Express Scripts procures and delivers prescription drugs to military families and retirees, plus many veterans will have a terrible impact on millions of people.
We’re seeing the negative consequences of anti-PBM efforts play out in real time next door in Arkansas.
Earlier this year the state legislature in Little Rock passed a similar law to what Senators Hawley and Warren are proposing.
The result was that CVS, which owns PBM CVS Caremark as a subsidiary announced it would close all stores statewide before the 2026 mandate, while Bentonville-based Walmart was conveniently granted a waiver to maintain the status quo.
Both CVS and Express Scripts sued the state for overreach. Last month a federal judge blocked the law, at least for now.
Even though Arkansas is setting up countless residents for severely negative consequences if the law remains on the books, some lawmakers in Missouri want to do the same thing.
State Sen. Travis Fitzwater said at the end of the 2025 legislative session that he would bring the Arkansas bill here when his PBM reform bill didn’t pass. He has plugged that awful Arkansas bill on social media, and also gave a shout out and thanks to Senator Hawley for heavily berating a PBM industry witness during a committee hearing in Washington this past May.
While I appreciate the desires of both federal and state lawmakers to enact health care reform, a system which admittedly needs a lot of work, we should also remind them that there are inevitably pitfalls with laws that create more problems than they solve.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/free-antibiotics1744798382.jpg,,,2025-08-28 07:57:17.193246

Americans for Prosperity claims its mission is to make Vermont more affordable. But its founding and financing by some of the world’s richest oil men and a history of spreading climate disinformation has raised doubts.

This story is a partnership between VTDigger and Grist.
For about two decades, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political network, has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into stalling climate action nationwide. Founded by Charles and David Koch, the libertarian oil billionaires behind Koch Industries, the group has local chapters that block renewable standards, clean car rules and carbon pricing at the state level. For decades, it’s been a bulwark of climate science denial that has shaped the modern-day Republican party. After notching wins against climate policy in states like Ohio and Kansas, the group is now testing its playbook in one of the bluest states in the country: Vermont.  
In March 2023, the group launched its Vermont presence as part of its 50-state strategy to involve Americans for Prosperity in traditionally more progressive states like California and New York. In the two and a half years since, the group has spent tens of thousands of dollars launching mail and digital campaigns targeting the state’s energy legislation like the Affordable Heat Act. It has also testified in favor of repealing laws like the Global Warming Solutions Act. 
The work in Vermont is being led by Ross Connolly, the group’s 34-year-old northeast regional director. Connolly, who grew up in New Hampshire, where he now lives, has said that his work in Vermont was focused on deregulating state government and helping residents realize their American dream. On a recent podcast, he called Vermont “bizarro-New Hampshire.” He later said that was due to its geographic upside-downness along with its politics, which zigged to the left while New Hampshire zagged to the right.
“I could talk endlessly about all the good things New Hampshire’s doing and all the bad things that Vermont has done,” Connolly said on the podcast, 802 Scoop. Vermont’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, “has been a great champion for Vermonters here, but there’s a lot more work to do here than New Hampshire.”
In July, the group launched an affordability road show, and in a media release, Connolly wrote that “the state’s progressive majority has chosen to inflate taxes and increase regulations” and “advance their own radical agenda.” He expressed gratitude to Scott for his “continued commitment to Vermonters despite the progressive majority.”
Vermont, often the first to go blue on national election nights, has served as a testing ground for national legislation like the right to same-sex marriage and now a law to hold oil companies accountable for their pollution. Perhaps one of its best-known exports, U.S. senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has a long history of opposition to Koch-backed groups like Americans for Prosperity. He was a vocal opponent of the Citizens United case, which opened up election influence to the billionaire class.
“So many groups on the right, center-right, don’t get involved in the northeast outside of New Hampshire or Pennsylvania,” Connolly said in an interview before an event the group hosted at a golf course this month in Rutland, Vermont. “If we don’t fight for people in those areas we’re never going to make any sort of difference.”
But well-funded campaigns like the ones Americans for Prosperity has launched in Vermont — with a total of $186 million at the national group’s disposal, according to its 2023 nonprofit filings — are unfamiliar for the small state, where grassroots politics have long ruled. The annual tradition of Town Meeting Day, for example, marks a regular practice of direct democracy at the local level. 
Americans for Prosperity claims its driving mission is helping Vermonters afford to live in the state. But its founding and financing by some of the richest oil men in the world, and a history of spewing climate disinformation, casts that in doubt. 
Americans for Prosperity is one of the first conservative dark money groups to enter Vermont politics in a big way. Other high-profile groups have often supported liberal causes, and those groups were often funding candidates. Americans for Prosperity doesn’t directly fund candidates; its nonprofit status means it seeks to influence policies and elections through other means like mailers, ad campaigns, and in-person meetings. AFP-Action, an associated super PAC, does spend hundreds of millions on federal elections in support of right-wing politicians, but has not yet invested in a Vermont candidate, according to Connolly.
In Vermont, Connolly said Americans for Prosperity aims to help make the state more moderate. Its arrival comes on the heels of an election where Vermont lost more Democratic seats than any other state in the nation, and the state is struggling with rising housing, health care, and education costs, which makes their affordability message especially salient. 
The organization has been planting seeds in Vermont, especially when it comes to energy policies it hopes to see repealed. And as the group has repeatedly said on podcasts, during panels, and in an interview with VTDigger, it plans to root here permanently. 
Over the summer, the group organized about half a dozen speaking events, including in Rutland. Four legislators spoke at the panel event, including three first-term Republican legislators from Rutland: Rep. Todd Nielsen, Rep. Chris Keyser, and Sen. Terry Williams, who joined the legislature in 2023 and serves on the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy.
While organizers expected 30 people in Rutland, about 15 came, including local officials and former legislators.
Williams said he was expecting more. He heard about the group two weeks earlier when Rachel Burgin, the organization’s northeast regional deputy director, contacted him. Burgin, who lives in Georgia, is one of three lobbyists registered in the state through 2026, along with Connolly and Lauren Schley, whose LinkedIn page says she works for Americans for Prosperity out of Washington, D.C.
No one who works for Americans for Prosperity on Vermont issues lives in Vermont, Connolly said, though he noted one person in the national office lives in the state.
Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, said groups like Americans for Prosperity opposed the energy transition because it undercut the profits of its oil tycoon founders. 
“Vermonters need to be savvy about that,” Watson said, “and recognize when outside influence is coming in to try and affect our policies and our elections.”

AFP sets its sights on energy policy
While the group first arrived in the state in 2023, it launched its first campaign last summer by attacking a first-of-its-kind climate policy — Act 18. The law studied the feasibility of a clean heat standard, which was intended to lower fossil fuel emissions from thermal energy sources like heating oil commonly used to warm Vermont homes.
“We focused on it because we came here and heard from Vermonters, and that was the one thing we heard across the board, was the concern on energy costs, and if that bill was implemented the amount of money that would cost the state and ratepayers,” Connolly said.
Supporters of Act 18 said the law was intended to regulate price-volatile fossil fuels and speed up the transition to cleaner sources like electric heat pumps. In a press release last year, Vermont House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, wrote the cost of heating oil had jumped from $2 per gallon in 2020 to $5.87 per gallon in November 2022.
“The goal of the Affordable Heat Act is to help insulate Vermonters from fossil-fuel price swings, and to make it easier and more affordable for them to transition – if they want to – to more sustainable energy sources,” Krowinski wrote. 
But Americans for Prosperity opposed Act 18 and in May 2024 launched “a major five-part mail and digital campaign” that initially cost more than $63,000, according to the group’s disclosures. Another group within the state, Vermonters for Affordable Heat, supported by the state’s locally owned fuel dealers, spent around $11,300 on postcards and a petition opposing the law. 
Liberal groups spent much more money in support of the law, but that money largely came through super PACs, political action committees that can raise unlimited sums of money to fund campaigns but cannot coordinate directly with parties or candidates. The out-of-state Green Advocacy Project, a Washington, D.C.-based pro-clean heat group, contributed three times that — $180,000 — to a Vermont super PAC to boost candidates supporting the program. 
Within Vermont, the super PAC Vermont Conservation Voters, part of the national League of Conservation Voters, spent almost $218,500 on pro-clean heat mailers, ads and videos, endorsing candidates with environmental records the group supported. While it supports election reform that wouldn’t allow for super PACS, the organization’s political director Justin Marsh told VTDigger in November that the growing presence of Americans for Prosperity was the reason they spent more than in past election cycles.

Legislators, local officials and advocates who spoke to VTDigger said they weren’t aware of any other conservative out-of-state group like Americans for Prosperity spending tens-of-thousands of dollars to influence Vermont politics.
Other groups like the Ethan Allen Institute, part of the State Policy Network, another Koch-affiliated group, have occasionally run conservative advertising campaigns in the state, according to Ben Walsh, climate and energy program director at Vermont Public Interest Research Group, an environmental advocacy organization. But that group has far less funding and is not concentrated on climate policies, he said.
“I imagine a group like AFP with long and well-documented ties to the fossil fuel industry has a real interest in making sure policy that’s good for clean energy and bad for fossil fuels is not enacted, and if anything, it’s a little surprising that they didn’t show up sooner,” Walsh said. “But now that they’re here, they’re making it very clear that anything good for the transition to clean energy is something they oppose.” 
In March 2025, a month before Americans for Prosperity settled a lobbying violation with the state, the political advocacy group launched a second state-wide mail campaign, spending $13,425 between March 13 and June 12, according to lobbying disclosures.  
The mailer said Vermonters should call their legislators and ask them to repeal Act 18, claiming the law “guarantees energy price hikes across the state,” according to a media release. The associated mailer, sent to Vermont households this spring, stated “Vermonters want Energy Abundance. Vermonters are responsible. They do not need Government mandates.”
If it had moved forward, Vermont’s clean heat standard would have been the first in the nation. But lawmakers never passed the program, largely because a Public Utility Commission report found the program would be too expensive to implement without help from other states in the region.

“Vermont was considering this first-of-its-kind clean heat standard that would hold fossil fuel companies to a standard of actually reducing carbon emissions in a way that the electric utility sector has had to do for decades,” said Elena Mihaly, vice president for the Vermont chapter of the Conservation Law Foundation, a clean energy advocacy group based in New England. “They were trying to nip it in the bud here in Vermont before it got out.”
Connolly said his group advocated for the full repeal because progressive legislators were trying to wait it out until they had a majority again and “could force it down the throat of Vermonters when Vermonters don’t want this policy at all.” 
Watson, chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, which is in charge of the bill, said that while she wasn’t necessarily saying the clean heat standard should move forward, she disagreed that Vermonters didn’t want effective clean energy policies.
“We know Vermonters care about climate change, and they care about affordability,” Watson said. “Both of those things are met by advancing renewables and renewable energy sources in the state because the vast majority are cheaper than their fossil fuel counterparts.” 
Because the clean heat standard never became a law, it doesn’t impact Vermonters’ utility bills. But Americans for Prosperity has repeatedly said the state’s energy policies, including laws like the Global Warming Solutions Act, have “without a doubt” driven costs higher for consumers.
The group is also against federal subsidies for energy programs that could lower energy costs for low-income Vermonters. In the days before the Rutland event, the state lost $62.5 million promised for solar programs after the “One Big Beautiful Bill” axed federal clean energy initiatives. 
“We believe those subsidies should have ended,” Connolly said of Solar for All. Upon the passage of the Trump omnibus bill that withdrew the funding, the national group threw a party called the One Big Beautiful Bash.
Instead of renewables, Connolly said the region needed more nuclear energy, such as small modular nuclear reactors, which have yet to be developed anywhere in the U.S., as well as the expansion of natural gas pipelines. 
“We should look at all the options on the table,” Sen. Zachary Harvey, R-Rutland, said of natural gas and nuclear power, after speaking at the event.
Connolly said his group was also against the Climate Superfund Act, which charges oil companies for greenhouse gas emissions between 1995 and 2024. The law applies a “polluter pays” mindset to climate recovery, potentially giving Vermont resources to build back from disasters like recent devastating floods. 
“If your concern is climate change, that does absolutely nothing to solve climate change,” Connolly said. 
“It’s sort of petty type politics where it’s like, we’re going after Big Oil and punishing them,” Connolly continued. “Vermont isn’t going to bankrupt ExxonMobil or any of these companies. You’re just going to drive them out of your state and drive energy costs higher because of it.”
On podcasts, in interviews and during speaking events, Connolly has repeated the same talking point: Vermont isn’t going to solve climate change. Harvey agreed, and said the Rutland event wasn’t about climate denialism, noting Williams told the room, “We agree there’s climate change.”
“We’re not denying climate change exists,” Connolly told VTDigger. “We’re saying the way we’re going about it in this state is hurting people, and we should put people first and solve the problem in a more reasonable and moderate way.”

‘Kingpins’ of climate science denial
Connolly’s acknowledgment of climate change may be a made-for-Vermont approach, but that tone doesn’t match the two decades of action Americans for Prosperity has taken to sow disinformation about climate science. 
It was founded in 2004 by libertarian billionaires Charles Koch and his late brother David Koch, who died in 2019. They amassed wealth through Koch Industries, an oil refinery and pipeline conglomerate that has siphoned up many other companies since their father created the business in the 1930s, profiting through deals with the Stalin and Hitler regimes, according to Dark Money, a book by Jane Mayer.
Together, the Koch family grew their worth to more than $141 billion. After years among the top ten richest people in the world, David Koch’s family and Charles Koch now rank 21st and 22nd, according to Fortune.
They’ve used this wealth to remake the national GOP into the party of climate denial, after government regulation of pollution and a push for renewables threatened their oil empire. In 2008, they began the “No Climate Tax Pledge,” asking officials to vote against spending money to fight climate change without equivalent tax cuts. By 2013, 411 officials had signed, including a quarter of senators and a third of representatives, along with other leaders like U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
In that era, Greenpeace called the brothers the “financial kingpin of climate science denial and clean energy opposition,” partnering with and then outspending better-known oil corporations like ExxonMobil. During the first Trump administration, they launched local campaigns through Americans for Prosperity to roll back car emissions standards.

Under Americans for Prosperity, and a host of other front groups, the brothers have long denied the threat of climate change, and have gone as far as to say that a warming world would benefit people. David Koch told a reporter in 2010: “The Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food.”
The consensus of the international community says otherwise. A warming atmosphere increases food and water insecurity for much of the planet, and causes increasingly dangerous weather events like heat waves and floods. In the two decades since Americans for Prosperity’s founding, more than half a million people were killed by the world’s 10 deadliest extreme weather events so far. All those events were made worse by the burning of fossil fuels, according to a report by World Weather Attribution, an academic outfit based at Imperial College London that scientifically quantifies how climate change influences extreme weather.
And while the Koch brothers have publicly clashed with President Trump, they have benefited enormously from his elections, earning more than $1 billion per year from the first Trump administration’s tax bill. They plan to extend tax cuts and roll back regulations, including in the energy industry, through Americans for Prosperity’s work under the second Trump administration, according to a 2025 plan obtained by The Guardian. 
Their networks have also heavily influenced both Trump teams. Under the first, about 50 administration officials had ties to Koch networks, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Today, key figures like Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have worked closely with and donated large sums to both Americans for Prosperity and other Koch-affiliated groups.
The summer campaign in Vermont comes as the second Trump administration launches an unprecedented attack on climate and clean energy policies that gained traction under the Biden administration. Along with deleting climate information and reports from federal websites, the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy have spent six months deregulating fossil fuels and slashing clean energy projects. 
Most of that work was outlined by another source of environmental skepticism that received funding from the Koch brothers: the Heritage Foundation, responsible for creating Project 2025, the unofficial blueprint for the second Trump administration. It includes the breakup of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation’s premier climate science agency, calling it “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.” Trump’s 2026 budget proposal eliminates the agency’s research arm responsible for helping the country adapt to climate change.

‘Here to stay’
Vermont Democrats have made the most of Americans for Prosperity’s slip ups. 
On an August mailer, Americans for Prosperity had misspelled their URL -– GreenMountainProsperity.com — instead printing GreetMountainProsperity.com. Around midnight on Aug. 8, May Hanlon, the 26-year-old executive director of the Vermont Democratic Party, spotted the error and bought the misspelled web domain for $12.19.
Now, when users visit the website, a two-minute video pops up in which Hanlon calls the Americans for Prosperity mailer “sloppy” and “full of false claims about what Democrats are doing in the state legislature.” Visitors are redirected to a webpage about Democratic wins during the 2025 legislative session, emphasizing affordability concerns like housing. 
“While Americans for Prosperity spent thousands of dollars on a recent mailer to spread misinformation about our legislators’ priorities, they misspelled their own website,” Hanlon said in a text message. “They can’t get their own website right, so it’s no surprise their claims don’t add up.” 
Months earlier, the Virginia-based group was fined thousands of dollars for violating Vermont law on a mailer asking Vermonters to contact their legislators to repeal Act 18. That mailer said the campaign was “Paid for by Americans for Prosperity Vermont.” But that group was not registered in the state. 
Vermont law requires that a lobbying advertisement like a mailer contain the name of the entity that paid for it, according to an email sent by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which responded to a formal complaint by Jim Dandeneau, the former executive director of the Vermont Democratic Party. 
In a settlement with the state on April 29, Americans for Prosperity agreed to stop using that name and paid a $3,000 fine.
“We don’t really comment on legal things,” Connolly said of the settlement. “That has been resolved. It was just, I think, a miscommunication. We changed our disclaimers. No problem.”
He said the fine didn’t reflect the work the group was doing in Vermont, where he said it has had over 5,000 Vermonters take direct action like mailing letters or making calls since 2023. 
“That mailer was received very positively, again focusing on the moderation of the legislature and the issues that Vermonters care about,” Connolly said. “Little disputes in election law are not top of mind for Vermonters.”
Harvey, a first-term legislator appointed by Gov. Scott in January, said Vermont needs groups like Americans for Prosperity to revitalize voters. He first met the lobbyists during a dinner in Stowe early in the 2025 legislative session, and said even though the group came from out of state, they’d made an effort to get to know legislators and were committed to policies he supported. 
For Connolly, a rightward transition in his politics came during college, when he read Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek, a book that argues government planning can lead to tyranny and also radicalized Charles Koch’s politics, according to Dark Money.
After graduating, Connolly worked for Republican campaigns before joining Americans for Prosperity in 2013. The group has since expanded to 37 state chapters, but the only chapter across nine New England states is New Hampshire. 
Connolly ran that state’s chapter before taking on the entire New England region. Down the road, the nonprofit could establish a chapter in Vermont, which would give it infrastructure and full-time staff and enable a permanent presence in the state. 
“We promise we will be here for the long term,” Connolly told the audience at Rutland. “We at AFP are not going anywhere.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.

First of two parts
Months away from 2026, Amanda Sherman worries often about how the new year will change her health care.

Sherman, a broker’s assistant in a real estate office, buys her health insurance through the federal health insurance marketplace, HealthCare.gov. Her coverage has helped her through a chronic illness and critical health setbacks.
Her health plan costs her $300 a month. Without it, she says she couldn’t afford the weekly shots that she gets for lupus — a chronic autoimmune disorder she was diagnosed with five years ago.
HealthCare.gov was established in 2014 as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). “It’s been there as a great resource when I haven’t been able to get insurance at work,” Sherman says.
In 2026, however, Sherman expects the cost of her health insurance to skyrocket. An enhanced federal subsidy that helped her afford the coverage is set to disappear at the end of this year. When that happens, she isn’t sure what she’ll do.
In the last few years, record numbers of Americans, including record numbers of Wisconsin residents, have been signing up for coverage that the ACA has made possible.
“When we look back over the last decade, the number of uninsured people in our state has dropped by over 200,000 thanks to the Affordable Care Act,” Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance Nathan Houdek tells the Wisconsin Examiner. “So we’ve seen a lot of success in terms of more people getting health insurance coverage and being able to access the health care they need as a result.”
Advocates warn that that is about to change under policies coming from the administration of President Donald Trump and the Republican majority in Congress.
“It’s going to take apart a lot of the advances that have been made to extend coverage to more people,” says Bobby Peterson, executive director of ABC for Health, which provides nonprofit legal services and advocacy for people caught up in medical debt.
Obamacare and HealthCare.gov
The ACA was enacted in 2010 during then-President Barack Obama’s first term and phased in over four years.
Nicknamed Obamacare — by detractors at first but later by its supporters — the law made changes that affected health coverage for everyone. It prevented insurers from rejecting coverage or hiking the premium cost because of a pre-existing health condition, for example.










We've seen a lot of success in terms of more people getting health insurance coverage and being able to access the health care they need as a result.


– Nathan Houdek, Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance


The ACA also created a first-ever national marketplace where people without health insurance could buy coverage for themselves and their families: HealthCare.gov. And the law set standards for the policies sold in the marketplace.
In addition, the law established a nationwide navigator system — nonprofit agencies that help people who buy coverage at HealthCare.gov review their policy options and assess what might best fill their needs.
Dr. Jill McMullen, a family practitioner in Tomah, says she saw “a big improvement in people having access to care and the consistency of care since the Affordable Care Act went in place.”
The ACA required insurers to cover preventive care visits, for example.
“We could predict what was covered regardless of what insurance a patient was signed up with,” McMullen says. “That just makes it a lot easier for patients to get their care” — and also reduces the chance that providers would not get paid for their services.
To make insurance more affordable, the ACA included tax credit subsidies tied to the consumer’s income and available for people with household incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines. Those subsidies reduce, but don’t eliminate, the HealthCare.gov premium cost and reduce the annual out-of-pocket deductible that the patient has to pay.
Program improvements, record enrollments
In 2021, after President Joe Biden took office, Congress passed and Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), legislation to provide economic relief in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. ARPA included a provision that supercharged the premium tax credits and lowered patients’ out-of-pocket costs.
For the first time, subsidies were available to people with incomes more than four times the poverty guideline, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act extended those enhanced subsidies through the end of 2025.

The Biden administration increased funding for navigator agencies and extended the annual ACA open enrollment period to run from Nov. 1 to Jan. 15.
Those changes helped produce higher-than-ever HealthCare.gov enrollments in Wisconsin in the last few years, Houdek says.
For 2025 alone, a record 313,579 people signed up for coverage at HealthCare.gov. National marketplace enrollment for 2025 also reached a record, 24 million, according to KFF.
Since taking office President Donald Trump and his administration have made or proposed changes in how HealthCare.gov works.
In June the Trump-appointed administration at the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) filed a new administrative rule governing Healthcare.gov enrollment that also would add roadblocks for the premium subsidies and shorten the open enrollment period for HealthCare.gov in future years.
On Friday, however, a federal judge in Maryland issued an injunction halting several provisions in the rule pending the outcome of a lawsuit to overturn it.
Even if the new rule doesn’t get enacted, experts say other Trump administration changes to the ACA are almost certain to make health insurance more expensive for people who buy their own coverage.
Navigator cutbacks, mega-bill changes
The administration has cut back support for the nonprofit health care navigators.
Wisconsin’s navigator agency is Covering Wisconsin, part of the University of Wisconsin Extension. Over the course of 2024, the agency’s 41 navigators helped with 100,000 coverage issues, says Covering Wisconsin Director Allison Espeseth.
Those include about 10,000 people who needed assistance through the full process of enrollment at Healthcare.gov, she says. But navigators up to now have helped people with other related needs, such as getting people who qualify enrolled in Medicaid, called BadgerCare in Wisconsin.
“The role of the navigator is to be that hub,” Espeseth says. “To be that one person who understands the health system, hospitals, health plans, understands government.”

In May, Covering Wisconsin received word from the federal government that, like navigator programs across the country, the Wisconsin program would lose 90% of its federal funding, Espeseth says. The cutback took effect Wednesday, Aug. 27.
Espeseth said that will reduce the number of Covering Wisconsin navigators from 41 to 17. With just one-third the number of navigators, “it’s going to make it more difficult for sure to see as many consumers as we have in the past,” she says.
Espeseth says Covering Wisconsin is connecting with insurance agents and brokers who can help with HealthCare.gov marketplace enrollment. The nonprofit is also coordinating with county agencies that qualify and enroll people in Medicaid and other safety net programs.
During the Healthcare.gov open enrollment period, “Typically we help anybody with any coverage issue that comes up, not just for the marketplace,” Espeseth says. “But this year, we need to prioritize. So we’re going to be really focusing as much as we can on marketplace consumers [who] need to renew or find a plan [or] don’t have coverage.”
The tax-cut and spending cut reconciliation bill that Republicans in Congress passed this summer and Trump signed on July 4 includes new limits on who can qualify for the ACA’s premium tax credit subsidies.
Meanwhile, Trump and the congressional Republicans rejected appeals to keep the ARPA enhanced subsidies in place after 2025.
“The federal reconciliation bill is the biggest change to health care in this country since the passage of ACA, and it goes in the wrong direction,” says William Parke-Sutherland, government affairs director for Kids Forward, an advocacy organization for families and children.
The ARPA enhanced subsidies “made health insurance way more affordable for people under 250% of the federal poverty level,” he says — and also made it possible for middle class families who previously had no support to get “a little bit of support to help pay for the cost of their health insurance.”
KFF reported earlier in August that insurers on the ACA marketplace on average plan to increase premiums 18% for 2026. But without the enhanced subsidies, consumers’ out-of-pocket expenses for health coverage could increase by 75%, the research organization calculates.
“You could see 50,000 or more Wisconsin residents lose their ACA coverage because of some of the changes related to not extending the enhanced premium tax credits, increasing the maximum out-of-pocket cost for consumers, shortening the open enrollment period, reducing funding for navigators,” Houdek says. 
“All of these things are going to have a negative impact on people’s ability to access coverage through the Affordable Care Act.”

Mitchell County residents voiced concerns about environmental damage caused by unpermitted mining along Nolichucky River. (Drone shots courtesy of Leo Sharp) The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) turned down a mining permit application on Wednesday from Horizon 30 LLC, citing the Mining Act of 1971.
Horizon 30 filed the application to DEQ’s Division of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources for a mining operation near the town of Poplar in Mitchell County, according to a public notice from July.
The division received a barrage of comments during its public hearing period in late July, with many residents urging them to deny the permit.
Emily Young of Spruce Pine said her family has lived and worked in the mountains of Mitchell County since the 1700s.
“The Nolichucky River and the surrounding watershed are not just scenic places. They support farms, forests, wildlife, and communities that depend on clean water and stable land,” Young said in her written remarks. “When a company skips permits and blasts without basic erosion control, it is not just cutting corners. It is showing a complete disregard for the people and places that make this region what it is.”
Sloan Hess of Mills River highlighted in a July 29th email that Horizon 30 had ignored three previous orders to cease operations, disregarding DEQ’s instructions.
“The devastation is evident and will be irreversible if it does not get regulated and controlled by others who have concern for their environment. This environmental loss effects rafting companies, tourist agencies, fishermen, recreational boaters and visitors from across the nation, who drive through the beautiful environment of the Pisgah and Cherokee National Forest,” Hess wrote in his appeal.
Adam Parr, deputy director of the Division, said during this meeting that the North Carolina Mining Program reviews all mining permit applications as they relate to the 1971 law.
By mining without a valid permit, Horizon 30 violated the act.
The company was previously operating without a valid permit on a site of approximately 50 acres. The mine excavation covered approximately 23 acres, according to a press release from DEQ.
“At no time has [the division] advised Horizon 30, LLC that they are allowed to operate without a mining permit,” Parr said.
On Aug. 13, a Watauga Superior Court judge determined Horizon 30 was operating an unpermitted mine, which violated the Mining Act, according to the release. The judge issued a preliminary injunction demanding the company stop mining immediately.
DEQ followed this action by denying the permit application.
Department staff will continue to closely monitor the location to ensure the company follows requisite steps to bring the site back into compliance, according to the release.
A court date of Sept. 23 has been set for Horizon 30 to provide an update on its reclamation plan of the area.

One survey said the state saw 15,400 job losses in the second quarter of 2025. (Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
 Wobbly state finances

Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
 California and Texas

California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana General Assembly’s leaders on Wednesday broke their weekslong silence on the push to redraw the state’s congressional boundaries, a day after visiting the White House.
But neither House Speaker Todd Huston nor Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray took a position.
Meanwhile, voting rights advocates delivered two thick stacks of signatures opposing the move to their Statehouse offices.
Indiana isn’t due to redistrict until after the 2030 census. But President Donald Trump is pushing GOP-held states to add red districts and maintain the party’s hold on the U.S. House.
Huston, Bray and several dozen members of their caucuses met with Trump administration officials Tuesday for a pre-scheduled “White House State Leadership Conference” that included talk of new maps.
Bray and Huston met separately with President Trump, officials confirmed.

In a statement, Huston said he “appreciated the opportunity” to hear from Vice President JD Vance and others about the administration’s work.
“It was encouraging to hear how Indiana has been leading the way for many of their initiatives or was the genesis of policy ideas,” Huston said.
“A wide range of topics were discussed including education, energy, immigration, fiscal responsibility and redistricting, and members were able to ask questions and share their thoughts,” he continued. “We look forward to Indiana continuing to have a strong partnership with the Trump Administration.”
Bray also gave no hints as to his thinking.
He described being “grateful” for the opportunity and called the event “extremely productive.” Indiana was recognized for “leading the nation” on so-called school choice, election security and Medicaid changes — areas of “strong alignment” with Trump’s administration.
“While redistricting did come up and members were able to ask questions, we spent the bulk of our afternoon discussing issues like energy, immigration and preventing waste and fraud in government,” Bray said.
Gov. Mike Braun has repeatedly said that whether he’ll call a special session for early redistricting depends on the duo and their caucuses. He told reporters Wednesday that he hadn’t spoken with the leaders since their White House visit.
“That didn’t happen too long ago, and we’ll have plenty of time to do that,” Braun said. “And again, it’ll be done in a methodical, not rushed way. We’ll get to the point where they are going to feel comfortable with where they want to go and will act accordingly.”
A day after leading an energetic rally outside the Statehouse, opponents called on Huston and Bray to resist changes.

“There has been great pressure from outside the state on this issue,” Common Cause Indiana Executive Director Julia Vaughn said Wednesday. “We believe it’s pretty obvious that if this decision was left to the legislative leaders themselves, they probably would not entertain an idea of a special session for a partisan power grab.”
She and another voting rights advocate each wielded a stack of 4,139 signatures, gathered over the last week and a half.
“I wish that we could have included some of the comments, because people had a lot of choice words,” Vaughn added. That would’ve doubled the number of pages, however, and “I’m an environmentalist at heart.”
The group knocked first on the door to the Republican side of Indiana’s House, then the Senate. Staffers answered and accepted the pages of signatures promptly.

Wyoming's official motto celebrates equality, but that's not the reality, writes columnist David Romtvedt.
The post What if Wyoming were really the Equality State? appeared first on WyoFile .","The Great Seal of the State of Wyoming pictures in its center a draped female figure reminiscent of Lady Justice holding a staff flying a banner with the words “Equal Rights.” In 1935, the Legislature officially designated Wyoming as “The Equality State.” The motto institutionalized the long time nickname based on the fact that Wyoming was both the first territory and the first state to grant women the right to vote. Wyoming was the first state in which a woman served as governor and the first state in which a woman served as a justice of the peace. Wyoming was the first state in which women served on juries and the first with a woman court bailiff. In 1920, Jackson voters elected an all-female town council and mayor. One candidate defeated her male husband. The newly elected council then appointed women to serve as clerk, treasurer, health officer and marshal. It was the first time an American municipal government was managed entirely by women.

Opinion

It’s exciting to think of my home as a place committed to equality. So it was disheartening when I learned that a 2024 report from the Wyoming Women’s Foundation showed women in Wyoming earned 70 cents for every dollar men earned. An even more extreme wage difference was shown in the June 2024 Wyoming Workforce report on average annual income in the state — $37,986 for women and $57,574 for men, indicating that women earn just under 66 cents for each dollar men earn.
The state only rarely invokes its Equal Rights heritage, though. Mostly, we say we’re the Cowboy State, the cowboy being a romanticized and quintessentially male figure, notwithstanding the number of women who have been and are ranchers. Our automobile license plates feature a cowboy on a bucking bronco, as do the “Welcome to Wyoming” highway signs. When the University of Wyoming decided to create a marketing campaign for itself, begging the question of why a university needs a marketing campaign, it settled on the phrase, “The world needs more cowboys,” not “the world needs more equality.” In explaining its campaign, the university noted that to be a cowboy is to be curious and bold and that cowboys can be any race, any gender, any ethnicity. I want to see that cowboy movie. And I want us to speak more openly on behalf of equality for all. At least we could offer equal pay for equal work here in the Equality State.
In 2010, the Legislature reinforced the Cowboy State image by adopting as state law what lawmakers labeled the Code of the West, a code derived from a book called Cowboy Ethics. There were 10 points in the code, including: live each day with courage, take pride in your work, finish what you start, do what has to be done, keep your promises, know where to draw the line. These are pretty good guidelines, but they have no more to do with cowboys than with carpenters, sheep shearers, school teachers or legislators; that is, they have a lot to do with all of us.
Still, a few of the points in the code might give pause. Take this one: talk less, say more. Maybe, but we might amend this to: say what needs to be said — don’t keep your mouth shut when you should speak on behalf of what’s right. Another one I wonder about is, be tough but fair. In my experience, being tough is not always the right or most effective way to be fair. What if it read: be gentle and listen to the perspectives of all? Then there’s the most metaphoric of the Code’s tenets — ride for the brand. What do we do when the brand is wrong? What do we say to those who ride for the brand, knowing it’s causing harm? Ride for the brand can too easily become a call to put loyalty before ethics.
The last of the 10 points is one I wish we would more fully embrace — remember that some things are not for sale. More and more, we are taught that everything has a price, that every human interaction is transactional, that everything is a commodity to buy and sell. 
If we can live in the awareness that some things are not for sale — not our commitment to equality nor our commitment to the land we’ve worked — we can bring the Cowboy State and the Equality State together. Lady Justice, scales balanced in her hand, can climb up there on that horse and with the cowboy beside her, ride.

The documentary, “We the Public,” is being filmed entirely on public lands and features interviews with a range of public land enthusiasts including hunters, Native American tribal members, hikers, scientists, off-road trail users and more. 
Anderson refers to all public lands enthusiasts and users as public land owners – emphasizing the public nature of the land he seeks to celebrate. Despite the differences of each of the public land owners interviewed in the film, Anderson said all of them are united by a love of public lands and a commitment to protect them.
“I wanted to make a film that is going to unify all the parties, all of the public land owners,” Anderson said. “We need to bring them all into the same room and have a conversation about why public land is so important and why we need to keep it. That’s the impetus of the film.”
 A documentary unlike any other about public lands

“We the Public” is being filmed on a variety of public lands across the Western United States, including Idaho’s Bruneau Canyon and the Boundary Waters of Minnesota.
Anderson said filmmakers are heading to Montana in September to film interviews on public lands.
Battles over public lands loom even after sell-off proposal fails

Anderson is a retired Air Force firefighter who now works as a photographer and filmmaker. He was one of 10 photographers whose work was featured in a 2013 Super Bowl commercial set to a voiceover of the late radio broadcaster Paul Harvey’s  “So God Made a Farmer” speech. 
Anderson said he hopes to make a documentary unlike any other about public lands. As Anderson and the team of filmmakers work on their film, they plan to document America at a time when public lands face threats of being sold off to the highest bidder.
Earlier this year, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, made an unsuccessful attempt in Congress to make millions of acres of public lands – including in Idaho – available to be sold off. Lee pulled his proposal back following a massive public backlash, but Anderson said public lands still need protecting.
“Public land has been under a constant threat for many decades of either being sold off or taken  away, whatever you want to call it,” Anderson said. “But this last year, especially the last six months, was really kind of eye-opening for me.”
 Public lands filmmakers are at the filming, fundraising stages of making documentary

Anderson and a team of filmmakers are filming this summer and fall and seeking to raise $500,000 to produce the documentary. Plans call for releasing it in 2026 to movie theaters and streaming services, as well to educational audiences and students. 
 Filmmakers are trailing across America filming a forthcoming documentary entirely on public lands. “We the Public” is scheduled to be released widely in 2026. (Film logo courtesy of Andy Anderson/We the Public documentary film)
“From alpine peaks to desert canyons, dense forests to wide-open plains, national parks to local fishing holes — these lands represent freedom, access, and a shared American heritage,” Conor Callahan, one of the film’s producers, said in a written statement. “They drive tourism, support jobs, and give every American a place to find peace outdoors.”
“This film will explore what public lands mean to Americans with wide-ranging backgrounds and perspectives, to capture why the protection of our shared lands transcends political boundaries,” Callahan added.

Because these public lands are intact, they provide irreplaceable big game habitat and security cover which keeps elk on public land and provide the backcountry experiences many hunters seek. Hunters have long relied on these chunks of wild land to disperse pressure and, importantly, hold game. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), fewer roads mean more elk and greater hunter satisfaction. 
Yet despite a quarter century of success providing balanced, multiple-use public land management, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, has taken steps to repeal the Roadless Rule.
This week, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced that the agency will publish a notice of intent to rescind the Roadless Rule on Aug. 29. The public will have just 21 days, through Sept. 19, to comment. For an issue of this magnitude—one that will affect nearly 45 million acres of national forest land across the country—three weeks is not nearly enough. 
If this repeal happens, we could see new roads bulldozed into the backcountry, pushing elk onto private lands where they are often inaccessible to hunters.
So why undo something so favorable to sportsmen? One common argument is that more roads would allow hazardous fuels reduction work. However, research shows that roads actually lead to more fires, either from mechanical issues from vehicles, or simply because more roads mean more people, and people don’t always listen to Smokey Bear. Nearly nine of 10 wildfires are human-caused, and 78% of those start within a half-mile of a road.
Fire mitigation already happens in roadless areas. These are not wilderness areas; mechanized thinning and prescribed burning already occur here. Since the Roadless Rule was enacted in 2001, more than 350,000 acres in Montana roadless areas have been treated for hazardous fuels reduction, representing more than a quarter of all treatments in our state during this timeframe.
Then there’s maintenance. We can’t afford to maintain the 371,000 miles of roads already in our national forests. The Forest Service has an $8 billion maintenance backlog, half due solely to existing, dilapidated roads. What makes us think we can afford to build and maintain more?
The management of our public lands isn’t perfect, but more roads are not the answer—and the public agrees. When the Roadless Rule was created, hundreds of meetings were hosted across the country, including 24 in Montana, and more than 1.5 million public comments were submitted, with 67% of Montanans supporting strong safeguards for roadless areas. Now, the public has just 21 days to comment. That is unacceptable. 
Any public land hunter who uses mapping layers to find unpressured big game on national forests, especially elk, should support of our backcountry roadless lands. Otherwise, you can expect more hunters and fewer elk in your favorite spots.

U.S. Rep. John Rose of Cookeville gave his campaign a $5 million personal loan and has raised $1.1 million in a state account to gear up for the race. Most of those donations came from Tennessee residents.
In contrast, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Franklin hasn’t filed reports yet with the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance to open an account, even after announcing her candidacy in early August. But she has plenty of name recognition after nearly three decades in the Tennessee Legislature, U.S. House and Senate.
Rose, who lives in Cookeville but often talks about his family farm in Temperance, is a former Tennessee agriculture commissioner and third-term member of Congress. He held his campaign kickoff at the Tennessee Fairgrounds in Wilson County in March, drawing a large contingent of farmers.










Campaign finance laws have always been complicated, but they’ve never been this complicated. It’s a system that rewards creativity because the laws are so complicated people get very adept at being able to maneuver through them


– Kent Syler, Middle Tennessee State University


To continue bolstering her position, Blackburn is depending on two federal political action committees, Making A Responsible Stand for Households in America and Tennessee Victory Fund, both of which dole out money to some of the same consultants and firms. They are separate from Blackburn’s U.S. Senate campaign account, which has $4.4 million, none of which can be used to run her state election because of laws that govern campaign fundraising.
Blackburn appears to be using cash she has in federal accounts to her “maximum benefit while keeping it inside the law,” said Middle Tennessee State University political science professor Kent Syler, chief of staff for former Democratic U.S. Rep. Bart Gordon.
“Campaign finance laws have always been complicated, but they’ve never been this complicated,” Syler said. “It’s a system that rewards creativity because the laws are so complicated people get very adept at being able to maneuver through them.”

Neither can expect help from Gov. Bill Lee.
Lee is close to Blackburn, in part because they both hail from Williamson County. The governor introduced her before her 2024 Senate victory speech. 
But Rose is using Lee’s former campaign advisor, Chris Devaney, to run his race, giving him a connection to the governor. Thus, Lee is refusing to endorse a candidate in the primary.
“I’ve said I believe we will have a very strong governor for the 51st governor of our state to move us forward,” Lee said this week, reiterating his stance against picking a favored successor.
How they’re spending there money
Blackburn’s Making a Responsible Stand for Households in America brought in $369,031 during the first half of 2025 and spent $553,868, leaving it with $156,344. The PAC had $341,000 on hand at the start of the year.
She disbursed $70,000 to longtime political consultant Ward Baker, $17,500 to O’Donnell and Associates and more than $22,500 to Strategic Victory Solutions. 
The political action committee, which is allowed to make contributions, sent $105,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and is garnering support from Tennessee political leaders, giving $10,000 each to campaigns for Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson, Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County, Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson of Franklin, state Rep. Mark Cochran of McMinn County, $2,500 each campaigns for Sen. Bobby Harshbarger, Sen. Mark Pody and Sen. Adam Lowe, and $1,000 to Rep. Rick Scarbrough. Another $5,000 went to New Orleans Saints game tickets, and multiple disbursements went to county Republican parties across Tennessee.
During the last six months, Blackburn’s Tennessee Victory Fund PAC took in $3.8 million and spent $3.6 million, leaving it with $371,547. Some $65,000 went to the Making a Responsible Stand for Households PAC, $90,000 to Baker, $150,371 to Strategic Victory Solutions, and $1.9 million to Targeted Victory.
Over the same period, Blackburn’s U.S. Senate campaign disbursed $270,240 to Baker, $15,000 to O’Donnell and Associates and $48,800 to Strategic Victory Solutions.

Rose’s PAC, Republicans Offering Solutions for Everyone, wasn’t as active as Blackburn’s PACs this year, bringing in only $10,000, compared to $83,345 in 2023-24 and disbursing $104,640, leaving it with $19,600.
The PAC donated to Republican candidates across the country, including $6,600 to Blackburn’s Senate race against Democratic state Rep. Gloria Johnson in 2023. Another $2,000 went to U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado.
Rose’s Tennessee campaign account is bereft of legislative leaders, though it received $2,000 from Republican state Rep. Sabi Kumar of Springfield. Many of the donors are business owners or have agriculture connections. For instance, $10,600 came from Robert McCall, president of D.T. McCall & Sons furniture company for primary and general races,  and $10,600 from Rhedona Rose, vice president of Tennessee Farm Bureau.
Rose has spent $237,650 from the state account, the biggest item costing $49,000 for research and polling by McLaughlin & Associates.

The North Dakota Soybean Council provided an update on the crop Wednesday while hosting a trade delegation for China, typically a huge market for North Dakota soybeans. 
“This spring, we were very cold, so you push back the planting dates. Anytime you push back planting dates, your chances of a real big yield kind of go away,” said Milo Braaten, who farms west of Portland in eastern North Dakota. 
Because of its cooler climate, North Dakota soybeans yields are often lower than states farther south. Yields are typically highest in southeast North Dakota but drop off to the west and north. 
North Dakota farmers plant more acres to soybeans than any other crop, but acreage was down about 10% this year. Braaten attributed that to a poor market for soybeans and other crops showing more potential for profits.

North Dakota soybean harvest is expected to begin in about five weeks, in late September or early October.
North Dakota ranks fourth nationally in soybean production, with most of the crop exported through the Pacific Northwest to Asian markets, primarily China. 
Avery Hansen, international market development specialist for the North Dakota Soybean Council, gave a presentation to the China trade team. The trade delegation was also scheduled to visit a farm near Wahpeton and a grain elevator near Mooreton. 
It is unclear if China will buy U.S. soybeans in the near term as trade negotiations continue between the two countries. Trade issues were not discussed at the meeting.

As of Tuesday, the Palisades Power Plant is the first nuclear plant in the United States to transition from decommissioning status back to operations, according to the plant’s owner, Holtec International. 
The plant can begin receiving nuclear fuel and restart operations once certain conditions of the plant’s technical specifications are met.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While the company works on repairing the plant’s steam generators, alongside reassembling the main generator and turbine, Holtec says the plant is squarely in the final phase of its restart preparations. 
“This is a proud and historic moment for our team, for Michigan, and for the United States,” Holtec International President Kelly Trice said in a statement. “The [commision’s] approval to transition Palisades back to an operating license represents an unprecedented milestone in U.S. nuclear energy. Our mission remains clear: to restart Palisades safely, securely, reliably, and in support of America’s energy future – while supporting local jobs and economic growth for decades to come.”

Upon returning to operations, Holtec said the facility will produce 800 megawatts of electricity, enough to power over 800,000 homes and businesses.
While the plant has received support from Michigan Democrats and Republicans alike, the plant is not without its opponents, with Kevin Kamps of the anti-nuclear advocacy group Beyond Nuclear arguing lawmakers and regulators are “playing radioactive Russian roulette on the Lake Michigan shore.”
“Holtec’s Palisades zombie reactor restart scheme is not only unprecedented, but also unneeded, insanely expensive for taxpayers and ratepayers, and very risky for health, safety, security and the environment,” Kamps said in a statement.
Opponents of the plant’s restart have argued the funds used to restart the plant – including a $1.5 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and $300 million in state funding – could be better spent on renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

The Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence has long provided legal help to immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking. 
Effective June 30, however, the nonprofit’s immigrant legal clinic permanently closed after the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs, which decides how to allocate federal crime victim dollars, ended immigrant legal aid grants.
Jennifer Escue, the coalition’s CEO, said the elimination of grants will leave already vulnerable victims with few legal alternatives.
“The major concern is that this just drives these communities deeper underground,” Escue said. “They’re not going to get help, they’re not going to report and it’s one more thing their abusers can hold over them.”
The organization’s legal clinic provided victims without legal immigration status help in applying for special visas set aside for domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking victims who are cooperating with police.

Visas that provide temporary legal status – and a pathway to lawful permanent residence – have long been made available to certain crime victims, in part so they are willing to help law enforcement pursue perpetrators without fear of deportation. 
Visas are also made available to victims out of a recognition that an abusive spouse may hold the key to a partner’s immigration status as a sponsor of their immigration application, or may be using the threat of reporting a victim to immigration authorities as a tool to buy silence about the abuse. 
Escue’s organization provided legal services and representation to about 150 new victims each year and ongoing legal work for 400 to 500 others through a visa petition process she said can take a decade or more to complete.
The loss of the funding – $137,000 annually for the coalition – comes as other immigration lawyers and legal organizations experience crushing demands and wait lists amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, leaving victims with few alternatives.
“We had to refer them to new representation which is of course difficult to find, because there were never enough immigrant legal services, especially low cost or, in our case, free.” Escue said.
Emily Stotts, legal director for the nonprofit Justice for our Neighbors, said her nonprofit organization already had a high volume of immigrant victims when the coalition’s legal clinic closed. They are now seeing some of the coalition’s former clients, she said.
“We still have to turn away a lot of people who are seeking assistance especially through the U visa,” which was established as a pathway to legal immigration status for victims in order to help law enforcement investigate and prosecute crimes.
Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

“We already had a capacity issue and this is aggravating the capacity issue,” Stotts said. 
Asked to provide a reason for the grant funding cut, Jennifer Brinkman, executive director for the Office of Criminal Justices Programs, said the “contract which provided this funding had reached its end date and was not renewed.”
But the decision to end funding for immigrant legal services comes as the Trump administration attaches more strings to federal Victims of Crime Act funding that federal officials have explicitly said are in support of the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Among them is a new requirement that states receiving the funding, and the nonprofits that accept it, cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities.
A federal lawsuit filed by 21 Democratic state attorneys general is seeking to stop the U.S. Department of Justice from withholding crime victim funding to states that refuse to comply with the cooperation conditions.

But Idaho’s recent improvements on the Idaho Reading Indicator show that when communities, educators and families work together, those small steps can add up to real momentum for our youngest learners.
The reading indicator, which assesses early literacy skills in kindergarten through third grade, is more than just another test. It’s an early warning system — helping identify students who need extra support before reading struggles become lifelong barriers. And this year’s results offer encouraging news: more Idaho students are reading at or above grade level than we’ve seen in years and up 3% from last year.
Engaged reading practice fuels a child’s development. Here are some tips to get started.

Statewide, gains have been most notable in the earliest grades. Kindergarten and first-grade students — those at the very start of their reading journeys — are showing stronger foundational skills, from recognizing letter sounds to reading simple words with confidence. Statewide, kindergarten proficiency increased 13 percentage points from spring 2024 to 2025. And overall kindergarten proficiency grew 26 percentage points from fall 2024 to spring 2025. The first-grade cohort grew from 59% proficiency in the fall of 2024 to 67% proficiency in the spring of 2025.
In many districts, the percentage of students meeting grade-level benchmarks has climbed by several points. These improvements are not just statistical blips; they represent thousands of children who are now better prepared to succeed in every subject they encounter.
In Gooding, they are excited and proud of students, parents and staff as they celebrate some significant gains in their kindergarten cohort. Using professional development communities, teachers are analyzing data, setting benchmarks and creating instruction that meet the needs of individual students. 
The results? Only 24% of the incoming kindergarten class was at grade in the fall of 2024. Spring Idaho Reading Indicator testing showed that 82.7% of those kindergarten students were now at grade level. Congratulations!
Why is this happening across the state? The answer lies in a combination of strategic investment and relentless dedication. Targeted literacy funding (early literacy monies) from the state has allowed districts to hire reading specialists, provide high-quality training and mentoring for teachers, and offer more individualized support for students. Schools have also embraced evidence-based reading instruction — approaches grounded in the “science of reading” that emphasize phonics, vocabulary and comprehension skills.
But the unsung heroes of this story are Idaho’s educators and families. Teachers are putting in countless hours, often before and after school, to help students strengthen their reading. Parents and guardians are reading nightly with their children, building habits that will pay dividends for years to come.
These results matter because reading by the end of third grade is a powerful predictor of a child’s future success. Students who reach that milestone are far more likely to graduate on time, pursue higher education or career training, and participate fully in civic life. In other words, improving early literacy is not just an education win — it’s an economic and social investment in Idaho’s future. When Idaho’s children learn to read, they are also learning to dream, to discover, and to shape the future of our great state.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)A group of Colorado and national LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations filed an amicus brief this week defending Colorado’s 2019 law banning conversion therapy for minors in a case challenging the law before the U.S. Supreme Court.
One Colorado and Rocky Mountain Equality, two Colorado-based LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, as well as PFLAG, the National Center for Youth Law, the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, the National Health Law Program, and Services and Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Elders filed the brief arguing that the conduct of health care professionals is subject to regulation by the state and outlining the proven harms of conversion therapy on LGBTQ+ youth. 
“As organizations that have worked with LGBTQ survivors of conversion therapy, amici are well acquainted with the severe, long-term harm that conversion therapy causes for individuals, families, and communities,” the brief reads. “Colorado’s statute protecting minors from conversion therapy by licensed professionals is not only a reasonable means of addressing these harms, it directly and narrowly advances important, and indeed compelling, governmental interests.”

The case, Chiles v. Salazar, concerns a Colorado state law that bans conversion therapy, the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation, such as to eliminate same-sex attraction, or gender identity. Conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom represents the plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, a Colorado Springs counselor who argues the Colorado law violates a counselor’s right to free speech by prohibiting certain conversations related to gender and sexuality. 
The named defendant in the case is Patty Salazar, executive director of the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. The Supreme Court decided to hear the case in March, and will hear arguments during its term that starts in October. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office is defending the state in the case. 
The 2019 law prohibits licensed psychiatrists and mental health care providers from “engaging in conversion therapy” with patients under 18 years old, though it does not prevent providers from sharing information on conversion practices offered by religious entities or others who are not prohibited by the law. 
Bruce Parker, chief operating officer of Rocky Mountain Equality, said that conversion therapy is an outdated practice that “devastates the lives of young people and families.”
“Conversion therapy is not therapy, it is abuse,” Parker said in a statement. “Colorado’s law is a carefully crafted, evidence-based safeguard that ensures LGBTQ youth receive care and support that protects, rather than harms.”
The brief filed by the advocacy organizations argues that conversion therapy “divides youth from their families and promotes parental rejection of LGBTQ children.” It says the resulting family rejection harms LGBTQ youth in ways that can persist into adulthood, affecting their physical and mental health. 
“Rather than strengthening family bonds, conversion therapy fractures them, creating an adversarial dynamic that pits parents against their children,” the brief says. “The therapy’s fundamental premise—that core aspects of a child’s self are wrong and must be changed—sends a message of conditional love.”
The resulting family rejection and separation caused by conversion therapy leads to more societal harms, including increased rates of homelessness, placement in foster care, need for mental health care and involvement with the juvenile justice system, the brief argues. 
About half of U.S. states and Washington, D.C., ban conversion therapy, and the American Medical Association opposes it. The Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that advocates equality for all LGBTQ+ people, says “every mainstream medical and mental health organization” has rejected the practice for decades and that it can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicide, particularly for minors.
Other amicus briefs in support of the Colorado law were filed this week by national advocacy groups including The Trevor Project and the Conversion Therapy Survivor Network, as well as Democratic attorneys general from 21 states and nearly 200 Democratic members of Congress. An equal number of Republican-run states and a long list of conservative religious organizations were among those who filed briefs in support of the petitioners in June.
The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case on Oct. 7.

(Photo credit: Dr. Granville Morse) When Dr. Granville Morse began his shift at Charity Hospital’s emergency room on Aug. 27, 2005, neither he nor his colleagues knew they would admit what would be the last patients in the institution’s 269-year history. Even as Hurricane Katrina undermined New Orleans’ faulty levees and crippled its power infrastructure two days later, he and others on staff tended to a surge in people needing health care. 
They included nursing home residents evacuated to the hospital amidst rising floodwaters, only to be moved out once again after Charity’s basement became submerged and its generators were rendered useless. Morse helped bring patients across the flooded street to the helipad at Tulane Medical Center, which was conducting its own evacuation.  
“People were trying to do the best they could,” he said. “We figured out a way to care for them.”
Before Katrina, Charity and other local hospital emergency rooms were often the primary care provider for a substantial portion of New Orleans-area residents, more than 20% of whom had no health insurance in 2005 according to the Congressional Research Service. 
Out of 16 area hospitals, 13 had to close after the storm. Most have since reopened, some as specialty care centers, but Charity Hospital and Lindy Boggs Medical Center in Mid-City remain vacant. Two new acute-care facilities, University Medical Center and New Orleans East Hospital, have been added.  
The decision to abandon Charity created great angst among residents whose families had relied on the hospital for generations. Yet local medical industry leaders say the city and region are now delivering a better standard of care while also able to better withstand a major natural disaster. 
When Hurricane Ida knocked out power for much of the New Orleans region in 2021, University Medical Center operated off the grid for 11 days without incident, said Dr. John Heaton, president and chief medical officer of LCMC Health, which operates the hospital. 
“It’s gonna have to be a really big one for UMC to evacuate,” Heaton said. “UMC is built like a fortress. You can barely tell the wind’s blowing outside.” 
LCMC Health and Ochsner Health System, two of the state’s leading health care providers, own or run many medical facilities in the region. Both have also opened or acquired dozens of urgent care clinics, in part to meet post-Katrina care needs and in line with a national move away from hospital-based care.
“The shuttering of some of the hospitals after Katrina allowed us to back up and think about how to develop health care in actual neighborhoods … where patients are within walking or biking distance,” said Dr. Michael Griffin, CEO of DePaul Community Health Centers. The organization has expanded from one New Orleans-area clinic to 11 since 2005. 
Compared with other southeastern states, Louisiana has markedly better access to care, according to data from the United Health Foundation, which conducts one of the nation’s longest running state-by-state health assessments. However, the Pelican State has been unable to improve its overall health ranking from the worst in the nation. The foundation ranked Louisiana 50th both in 2004 and in its most recent report from 2024.      
Affordable Care Act fills care gaps 
In the immediate wake of Katrina’s devastation, a handful of local medical students and residents set up six makeshift medical aid stations around the city. Their goal was to care for the uninsured and marginalized populations that had previously relied on Charity Hospital.
This was the genesis for the community-centered model of health care for New Orleans, Morse said. 
Morse credits Tulane physician Dr. Karen DeSalvo for spearheading the community health model now present in Louisiana. She would go on to lead the city health department from 2011-14 and join the Obama administration as the assistant U.S. health secretary. DeSalvo is now chief medical officer for Google.    
“There was no doubt in my mind that we could not return to a system where we trained our students in hospital based clinics and miss the opportunity to embed them in the community.” DeSalvo told a congressional committee in 2009.
 In this Sept. 1, 2005, photo, airboats ferry Charity Hospital staff and patients across the street to access a rooftop helipad for evacuation three days after Hurricane Katrina’s flood waters left them stranded. (Photo credit: Dr. Granville Morse)
For generations, low-income, uninsured and largely minority citizens relied on Charity Hospital for their medical care. But the hospital was overwhelmed and underfunded, DeSalvo told lawmakers. If patients missed an appointment for any reason, it could be a 12-month wait until the next available appointment, so most patients accessed the system through the emergency room, she said.
The same was true at some of the city’s other hospitals, according to Griffin.
“Those were very vital and critical access points for the community,” he said.
Often when uninsured patients were treated at emergency rooms, they couldn’t afford follow-up care from Charity and other hospitals. At the time, Medicaid didn’t cover the entire cost for health care providers.   
“Many hospitals avoided taking Medicaid patients because they couldn’t afford to,” Heaton said. “A lot of advanced therapies just weren’t available (to patients).”
While urgent care and outpatient facilities changed the local health care landscape in the decade after Hurricane Katrina, medical professionals credit a major policy change with improving outcomes for their low-income patients. 
In 2016, Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards chose to expand Medicaid services through funding provided under the Affordable Care Act. His Republican predecessor, Bobby Jindal, had shunned expansion while in office.  
More than 433,000 Louisiana residents enrolled for the coverage within the first year it was available, state figures show. As of 2022, the number had increased to 638,000, largely the result of relaxed Medicaid rules during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
As of 2023, more than 133,000 New Orleans residents, or 36.5% of the city’s population, were covered under Medicaid. Updated official data isn’t available, but the count has likely dropped in the past two years through state efforts to cull the rolls once the pandemic standards expired. 
Studies have shown the Affordable Care Act helped fill health care gaps Katrina left in Louisiana through significant funding for federally qualified health centers, which provide care regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. The Louisiana Department of Health estimated 45 such centers existed in the state before Katrina. Over the past 20 years, that number has grown to more than 260, according to federal data.
The new federally qualified health centers include DePaul’s clinics, some of which offer services that were once only found at large hospitals. Its nonprofit clinics typically provide primary care, mental health, dental, podiatry, optometry and pharmacy services — all in one building or complex and often within walking or biking distance to the people who need it most, Griffin said.
“You’re always going to need hospitals,” Griffin said. “But access has definitely improved.”

Poverty rates unchanged over 20 years 
Dr. Gerry Cvitanovich opened his first urgent care clinic in Kenner in 2002 and was building a second one in Metairie right before Katrina hit. He reopened his Kenner clinic without electricity about 10 days after the storm and began seeing swarms of new patients with different kinds of ailments. Many needed medication refills because they ran out during the storm.
“We were overrun,” Cvitanovich said. “We were overrun with people who needed basic things.”
He recalls seeing patients who had relied on Charity Hospital for their care but had none of their medical records available. The move to digital medical records since the storm has been a great benefit, particularly when patients are displaced by disasters, he said.  
Cvitanovich went on to open 14 urgent care clinics in the New Orleans region, eventually selling them to Ochsner Health System in 2017. He’s now part of the system’s medical staff and has served as Jefferson Parish coroner since 2012.
The doctor agreed that health care has become more accessible since Katrina but said access is only one part of the equation to making people healthier. 
More change ahead for New Orleans public schools 20 years after Katrina

Studies have shown significant links between poverty and health. People with limited finances often have more difficulty obtaining health insurance or paying for expensive procedures and medications. Factors such as limited access to healthy foods and higher instances of violence can increase stress and the accompanying health risks. 
Residents of impoverished communities are at increased risk for chronic disease, higher mortality, lower life expectancy and mental disorders, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency also points to natural disasters and pollution as drivers of poverty and poor health in Louisiana. 
Before Katrina, approximately 23% of New Orleans residents were living below the federal poverty line — $19,350 for a family of four, according to federal data. Over 20 years, the city’s poverty rate has shown next to no progress, now sitting at 22.6%, according to the Federal Reserve. 
Louisiana as a whole has seen a similar trend. The state poverty rate was 19.4% in 2004 and is now at 18.9%, with the poverty line set at $32,150 for a four-person household.
Children make up the largest age group of those experiencing poverty, and this too is more prominent in Louisiana than any other state, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Childhood poverty is associated with developmental delays, toxic stress, chronic illness and nutritional deficits, according to the health department.

In response to these trends, Griffin said the community health care model has been adapted to include school-based clinics. DePaul now provides services, with parental consent, at 23 New Orleans-area schools. The basic idea is to treat patients where they are and closer to home because some people cannot take off work to see a doctor or have no means of reliable transportation, he said. 
When possible, LCMC Health goes beyond its medical care role to address public health issues, Heaton said. For example, it has distributed gun safes to parents at Children’s Hospital.
“It’s really not our purview,” Heaton said, adding that public agencies need to address underlying socioeconomic factors behind poor health outcomes in the state.
Morse agreed that the government and other organizations have a larger role to play when it comes to health care. 
“There’s only so much we can do,” Morse said. “Health systems are more prepared but only as good as the systems around it.”

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.











We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly. 


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office



State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
IVF pushback grows louder
This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
Out of obscurity
RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.











They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’


– Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine



Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
First in the nation
Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

About 1.5 million Tennesseans live in areas outside of non-metropolitan areas, according to the U.S. Census. But Tennessee ranks second in the nation for rural hospital closures from 2010 to 2025, according to a USDA report published in January. A recent report by the Physicians Advocacy Institute found that rural Tennessee patients lost access to 362 independent doctors and 344 independent medical practitioners as hospital systems consolidated between 2019 and 2024.
The Tennessee Rural Health Care Task Force remarked in its June 2023 report that “the need to invest in solutions to improve access to care and health outcomes for rural Tennesseans is urgent.” Establishing the Rural Health Care Center for Excellence was among that task force’s recommendations. 
Dunn will appoint a steering committee to serve as an advisory group for the center during its first year. The university plans to build on its existing partnerships throughout the state to provide technical assistance, research, workforce development and investments to increase access to care, Bailey said in the release. 
The UT Health Science Center, based in Memphis, also has educational and clinical campuses at hospitals in Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga, in addition to other clinical sites. The University of Tennessee’s Institute of Agriculture already runs extension offices that provide resources for farmers in all 95 counties, and can serve as an additional contact point for rural residents, the release states.
The center will have five core areas of focus:

Providing technical support and encouraging collaboration
Evaluating and sharing impact
Identifying and piloting innovative solutions
Sharing best practices throughout the state
Helping healthcare practices to find sustainable funding and optimize their practices

The UT Health Science Center has a history of partnerships and projects in rural Tennessee, including multiple mobile health clinics.
Its Nursing Mobile Health Unit tallied 504 patient encounters in Lake and Lauderdale counties over the last year. In Southeast Tennessee, the UT Chattanooga Mobile Medical Outreach Clinic provides care to older adults and their caregivers using a medical van. The school’s Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology began offering mobile services in rural East Tennessee in April.
The center’s Tennessee Population Health Consortium will also expand its Neighborhood Health Hub Program — which provides health screenings for obesity, hypertension and diabetes — into Hardin and Decatur counties.
Eleven students are expected to graduate from the College of Pharmacy’s Rural Health Certificate program in May 2026.

(FS Productions | Getty Images)As I visit communities around my beloved West Virginia to talk about the impacts and consequences of Capito Care, or HR 1, perhaps the most sweeping and arguably the worst piece of health care legislation to ever come out of our nation’s capital, it is the impact upon rural hospitals that is getting the most attention — and concern.
If you have attended one of the meetings or town halls where I have discussed the dire consequences of the $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, then you have also heard me discuss the vulnerability of our hospitals. Quite frankly, there is not a single hospital in our state that will not be affected. However, there are 10 hospitals and three nursing homes in our state that are either at high risk for closure or vulnerable to closure. You can find those hospitals and the supporting analysis in Rural Hospital Closures — Sheps Center at UNC Chapel Hill and Federal Medicaid Cuts Would Force Rural Hospitals to the Brink of Closure by Families USA, a national, non-partisan advocate for health care consumers. 
These hospitals are not in imminent danger of closure. They will, however, be in danger starting in 2027 as the provider tax, the funding mechanism that helps fund Medicaid, is rolled back and ultimately dismantled. 
The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program is touted as the solution to saving rural hospitals from the dismantling of the funding mechanism for Medicaid. Perhaps it is better than not having one, but barely. It was a last minute addition to appease the outcry of hospital administrators around the country who foresaw the existential threat of Medicaid cuts to their hospitals.   
Here is why the fund is inadequate to meet the moment:

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the fund will roughly offset only 37% of estimated cuts to Medicaid spending. States will have to make up the difference. 
Half of the funds — $25 billion — will be equally distributed among the states with approved applications (states must apply for these funds) irrespective of the rural population or financial health of the rural hospitals. This approach may not adequately address unique challenges faced by hospitals in states with large rural populations, or greater need of older or sicker populations. This certainly stands out to me as a red flag for West Virginia. 
The $50 billion fund may not be enough to overcome systemic issues, of which West Virginia has many. These include rural hospitals who have been operating on razor thin margins for years, or even negative revenue, declining patient volumes, and workforce shortages. 
West Virginia hospitals serve an older, sicker and poorer population. It is just a fact. Many of our hospitals rely heavily on government payers such as Medicaid and Medicare which reimburse at below cost of providing services. 

To add insult to this injury, these funds may not even go to rural hospitals. There is no guarantee. The law says that states should use the funds to pursue goals including improving access to hospitals and other providers, improving health outcomes, enhancing economic opportunity for health care workers, and prioritizing the use of emerging technologies. All good things worthy of funding. 
Dr. Mehmet Oz, a President Donald Trump appointee leading Medicare and Medicaid, will determine how to distribute the other $25 billion. The law says the money is to be used for such things as increasing robotics, upgrading cybersecurity and helping rural communities “to right size their health care delivery systems.”
And here is the real kicker, especially given the carrot and stick approach of the Trump administration: The law not only grants the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services broad discretion over the award and distribution of funds, but these funding decisions are not subject to administrative or judicial review.  
What could possibly go wrong? Capito Care is bad policy and it is not ameliorated by a mere $50 billion fund. We urge hospitals and supporting  associations to fight for adequate funding to protect health care in their communities.
If these rural hospitals close — and some will —we may never get them back. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito should revise Capito Care while there is still time, and turn it into legislation she would be proud of. Sen. Jim Justice and Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore should join her.

(Wisconsin SEA Grant)The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) announced that this year’s wild rice crop yield in northern Wisconsin is low, continuing a pattern of lower yields over recent years. Wild rice crops have been affected by heavy rainfall and powerful storms this year, contributing to an 18% decline in the wild rice crop compared to last year.
“The 2025 season has brought a mix of conditions, including several notable storm systems,” said Kathy Smith, Ganawandang manoomin (which means she who takes care of wild rice), with the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission. “A fast-moving windstorm in mid-June produced widespread wind damage and heavy rainfall across the upper Midwest. In late June, some areas saw 6-7 inches of rain in a short period, contributing to temporary high-water levels on seepage lakes.”
Using satellite-facilitated remote sensing technology, the commission was able to determine the 18% decline in the wild rice crop. A DNR press release notes that these technologies do not provide insights into local wild rice production, bed densities, or seed production. Early scouting reports help fill in the gaps, showing a “mixed bag of production,” the agency stated,  “with some top-producing lakes seeing declines in the crop from last year, while others appear to be rebounding.” 
Wild rice harvesting is open to all Wisconsin residents with a wild rice harvester license. The crop provides nutritious, naturally grown food to people across the upper Midwest. Wild rice also holds an important cultural place for indigenous tribal communities. Around late August through mid-September, the rice reaches maturity. Jason Fleener, a DNR wetland habitat specialist, stresses that it’s important to wait to harvest the rice until it falls with relatively gentle strokes or knocks from  ricing sticks. If no rice falls, then it’s best to wait a few more days before attempting to harvest. 
Harvesting immature beds can negatively affect the overall harvest, as well as the long-term sustainability of the rice. Besides climate effects, human activity such as boating (which creates waves that uproot growing rice plants) can also harm the crop.

Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.,"A worker installs a solar panel on a roof. (Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
Pa. and other states scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
Permitting
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly. 


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
Interconnection
Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The healthcare calamity unleashed by Republicans in Congress and Trump will ensure that hundreds of thousands of Coloradans lose coverage, and our healthcare system will be devastated.
The so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” supported by U.S. Reps. Gabe Evans, Jeff Hurd, Jeff Crank, and Lauren Boebert, is already having ugly consequences for Coloradans. Individual market insurance rates are spiking an average of 28% (38% in rural areas) as Republicans strangle the Affordable Care Act and slash Medicaid.
Because of the deliberate decision to terminate the enhanced ACA tax credits that have led to record enrollment, Coloradans are in for an excruciating shock when they renew their insurance this November. An estimated 36,000 Coloradans will lose access to financial assistance altogether and will see their premiums skyrocket; those who remain eligible for some tax credits will see their premiums spike an average of 170% statewide, with some rural areas seeing spikes over 300%.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This ugly bill adds paperwork and will kick refugees, asylees, and others off of coverage. Combined with the huge increase in premiums, 100,000 or more Coloradans are expected to lose private insurance coverage.
More Colorado families have been able to afford coverage in recent years because more financial assistance has been available. That is all getting yanked away. Just one change, the termination of enhanced premium tax credits, amounts to a roughly $230 million a year tax hike on Coloradans.
While Colorado worked to minimize the harm with legislation this special session by securing funding for state affordability programs for insurance, there is no way Colorado can make up the difference if these tax credits expire.
All of this is disastrous for the individual market, but insurance carriers shouldn’t be using this to take advantage of their members. Just recently, Rocky Mountain Health Plans, a for-profit subsidiary of United Healthcare, and Anthem, also for-profit in Colorado, announced they were planning to withdraw their individual market plans from the Denver metro area, and Anthem is planning to withdraw plans from additional areas, affecting 96,000 Coloradans and likely leading to more coverage losses. Rocky and Anthem represent the largest proposed rate increases for next year, at 36% and 34% on average, respectively.
The Colorado Consumer Health Initiative digs into the rate requests every year to identify areas where health insurers’ proposed rates may not be justified. For both Rocky and Anthem, it’s hard to see a clear rationale for pulling their plans back. There doesn’t seem to be evidence in their filings that these areas of the state are harming their bottom line.
Rocky has seen more fluctuations in claims and how much they’ve been paying out for healthcare, but seemed to be doing decently in the Denver area. Anthem, on the other hand, has often made so much that they had to actually issue refunds because they set their premiums too high and have not spent enough of their premium dollars on health care.. Under the ACA, they must spend at least 80% of premiums on healthcare.
The market turmoil creates a convenient smokescreen for carriers to make changes, but we have to question what is really motivating these changes. Anthem indicated to the Colorado Sun that it “might backtrack pending the outcome of the state’s regulatory review of its proposed rates.”
Is this a similar tactic to what CommonSpirit subjected Anthem to not too long ago, when the hospital corporation threatened to leave Anthem’s network to try to get significantly higher reimbursement rates across the state? Anthem cried foul then — largely rightfully so. Based on Anthem’s own statement, we have to wonder if this is merely an attempt to get our Division of Insurance to approve a higher rate increase and ignore the objections the DOI or consumer advocates like us have made in the rate review process?
While Republicans at the federal level have plunged our market into chaos, insurers must still be held accountable for their pricing, market behavior, and how they treat Coloradans at the state level.
There is a simple solution to avoid the massive premium spikes and protect Coloradans from losing coverage: Congress must act quickly to extend the enhanced ACA tax credits. This will stabilize the market, lead to smaller rate increases, and protect Coloradans from massive spikes in their health insurance.
This is squarely in Trump and Congressional Republicans’ hands. They can fix this, or they can be responsible for catastrophic harm to millions of Americans and roughly 300,000 Coloradans.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)The Department of the Interior, or DOI, has such a wide-ranging set of duties that it’s sometimes referred to in Washington, D.C., as “the department of everything else” — public lands, natural resources, wildlife regulations, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs all fall under its auspices. It is now also the tip of the spear in the Trump administration’s war on renewables.
On July 17, the DOI announced that all wind and solar projects would have to undergo “elevated review” from department Secretary Doug Burgum’s office. On July 29, Burgum ordered an end to “preferential treatment” for “unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources,” specifically wind and solar. The next day, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which sits within the DOI, rescinded all designated Wind Energy Areas along the continental shelf. Two days later, on Aug. 1, the DOI released a secretarial order that mandates all energy projects based on federal land be evaluated on their “capacity density,” or how much energy they are able to produce per square acre. The following week, the agency ordered the cancellation of the already-approved Lava Ridge Wind Project, a proposed wind farm in Idaho, arguing that it would “harm rural communities, livelihoods and the land.” And on Aug. 4, Burgum called for the use of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to request numbers of eagle deaths from wind developers.
Following these moves, President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to vow that the administration “will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar. The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!”
What Trump and the Interior Department are doing, experts say, is using environmentalists’ legal playbook against them to throttle renewable energy. Laws meant to protect and safeguard wildlife and public lands from mining, drilling, and habitat degradation — such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act’s prohibition against “unnecessary or undue degradation” — are instead being wielded as a cudgel against wind and solar.
“They are effectively trying to co-opt arguments that we have used for years to push back on fossil fuels,” said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, the executive director at the Western Environmental Law Center, a public interest firm.“But I think it should go without saying that they are abusing those laws.”
Schlenker-Goodrich pointed to the DOI’s recent capacity density order as a particularly troubling example. Secretarial orders are meant to function as internal guidance to agencies. “They are not intended to put in place substantive rules that dictate outcomes,” he said, in this case “a de facto prohibition against the siting and permitting of renewables on federal public lands.”










They are effectively trying to co-opt arguments that we have used for years to push back on fossil fuels. But I think it should go without saying that they are abusing those laws.


–  Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director, Western Environmental Law Center


Solar and wind farms will never technically be able to produce as much energy per acre as an oil and gas facility — but that is also not the best measure of impact. Wind turbines are only a handful of feet wide at the base — the land or water that surrounds them remains unaffected and can easily be used for farming or agriculture. Solar panels can be placed on brownfields or integrated on agricultural land. When a wind or solar farm is decommissioned, the equipment is removed, the ground is decompacted, and vegetation is replanted. Within a year or two, you can barely tell anything was there, and the land can immediately be reused — the possibilities are limited only by zoning laws.
In contrast, when a refinery or a fossil fuel plant shuts down, the ground is poisoned. Cancer-causing chemicals like benzene saturate the soil and remediation can take years, assuming it happens at all. And that doesn’t even account for the massive amount of energy spent producing and transporting fossil fuels to power plants.
“The DOI is fixating on this one metric, capacity density, to the exclusion of a holistic understanding of costs and benefits of a particular energy technology,” said Schlenker-Goodrich.
Refineries, gas plants, and nuclear plants also aren’t typically built on public land, nor are they likely to be. Private industry has little interest in dealing with even more federal regulations, according to Josh Axelrod, senior policy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit.
“The [DOI is] trying to come up with the facade of a rational reason to stop doing anything related to renewables, but this one especially is really mind-boggling,” said Axelrod. “Everything it compares wind and solar to — none of those types of facilities are built on federal land … There’s no comparison.”
Public and private impact
The Interior Department’s order that all wind and solar projects on federal land undergo “elevated review” is another misuse of environmental law, experts said. Routine procedures that would have previously been handled by a DOI bureaucrat will now need the secretary’s personal sign-off. And the restrictions will impact projects on private land just as much as on public land. A recent analysis from The American Clean Power Association found that 27 of the new procedures requiring Burgum’s sign-off — such as needing consultations around harm to wildlife and endangered species — will allow the DOI to effectively end development of renewable energy projects nationwide. The goal, it seems, is to create an impossible backlog that bleeds projects of funding before they can get off the ground.
All of this is in service of propping up dying industries, such as coal, said Alex Klass, an environmental law professor at the University of Michigan. “[The administration] can talk about energy dominance and talk about the need for new energy,” she said, “but before there was always an argument [that] you shouldn’t try to prop up an industry that can’t make it on its own. That’s basically what they’re doing.”
And it is being done with little concern for the environmental consequences.
Burgum cited concerns about migratory bird populations when he moved to cancel offshore areas for wind energy development. But on Tuesday, the DOI announced that it plans to hold 30 oil and gas lease auctions over the next 15 years — also offshore. Although the administration has declared an “energy emergency,” it’s clear that actual energy development is being approached from a position of political theater, rather than practicality.
Trump has claimed that offshore wind turbines “are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before,” but there is no evidence of that. Upon taking office, the administration almost immediately moved to fire scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration whose research centered around ensuring offshore wind was safe for whales. Offshore drilling, on the other hand, is proven to be enormously harmful to marine environments. Seismic blasting can result in hearing loss — affecting whales’ ability to breed and communicate — and animals are often killed by vessel strikes. When something goes wrong on a drill rig, it’s apocalyptic for the nearby environment. The Deepwater Horizon spill remains the worst environmental disaster in United States history.
Interior officials have also worked to roll back environmental regulations around mining, eliminate Biden-era regulations that provided protection for public lands, and fast-track mining despite local concerns of water scarcity. Given the administration’s aggressive antipathy for environmental regulations, experts say it’s impossible to believe that the Interior Department’s sudden conservationist concerns around solar and wind impacts are being made in good faith.
“It’s not like the Biden administration stopped permitting oil and gas development. There’s lots of oil and gas development,” said Klass. “They just also tried to prioritize wind and solar. Here they’re saying, ‘Not only are we not going to prioritize [wind and solar], we’re going to try to shut it down entirely.’”

Board of Elections vote Wednesday.
The Board is asking people who do not have a driver’s license number or partial Social Security number connected to their name to supply one of those identifiers. 
For certain voters, those identifying numbers may not be attached to their names as a result of a mismatch. If a name is misspelled, if voters change their names, if the numbers on a birth date are transposed, or one record has a middle name and another record doesn’t, for example, the numerical identifiers aren’t added to the voter registration file.
The three Republicans on the five-member Board voted to approve the plan that will require those voters who don’t have those identifiers connected to their names to cast provisional ballots and show an acceptable picture ID or document showing their residence when they vote. 
Provisional ballots are kept separate from regular ballots. Local boards of election decide whether to count them if the information voters supply checks out. 
Voters’ selections in federal races will count no matter what. But votes in local and state races could be thrown out in some circumstances.  
“It will help us collect the missing information, verify that missing information and at the same time allow voters to proceed and comply with HAVA (the Help America Vote Act) and also our state law and state constitution obligations,” said Board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV, a Republican.
Democrats on the Board were opposed. People whose names don’t have an identifier connected with their name will be repeatedly flagged. They will be required to cast provisional ballots — and fill out the voter registration form on the ballot with the identifiers — in election after election until their numbers validate. 
The burden will disproportionately fall on women who change their names after they marry but don’t notify the Social Security Administration, said Siobhan Millen, a Democrat. 
President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is suing North Carolina over the missing information in the voter rolls. State Elections Executive Director Sam Hayes has said the plan to collect the information may help settle the lawsuit. 
The DOJ lawsuit echoes arguments in lawsuits filed last year by GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin as he tried to have more than 60,000 votes thrown out with the aim of overturning Democratic Supreme Court Judge Allison Riggs’ election victory. Griffin’s lawsuit, in turn, mirrored arguments in a state GOP and Republican National Committee lawsuit that sought to kick more than 225,000 voters off the rolls before the 2024 election.
Eggers said he didn’t know of another way to collect the information and validate voters.
“I certainly don’t want to expose us to another Griffin and Riggs type situation, and this is the least intrusive option I’m aware of to accomplish this goal,” he said. 
Republicans nix Sunday voting plans
Republicans on the Board flexed their new majority by rejecting plans for Sunday voting in Davidson and Union counties during early voting this year. 
Democrats on the Board wanted to allow Sunday voting in those counties. 
Whether or not to open polls on Sundays has divided Democrats and Republicans for years.
Democrats tend to support Sunday voting, an important day for Black churches that organize Souls to the Polls events. 
Republicans tend to oppose Sunday voting, with some saying polls should be closed on the Christian day of rest. 
County boards of election and the the State Board have new Republican majorities this year, giving the GOP the upper hand in the Sunday voting issue. 
The State Board sets the early voting schedule when a local board cannot reach a unanimous decision and a county board member asks the state to step in. 
Davidson had Sunday voting in previous elections. A minority on the Davidson election board wanted the polls open one Sunday during the early voting period. 
“Every citizen should have fair access to the ballot box,” Brenda Clark, a member of the Davidson Board, said Wednesday. Sunday voting has the support of community ministers, she said. 
Adding a Sunday to the early voting schedule was “rooted in equity, fairness, and accessibility,” she said. “We know that voting is both a sacred right and a civic duty, yet many of our citizens face barriers when polls are open on weekdays and on Saturday.”
Davidson Board member Richard Johnson, who represented the majority on the board, said Sunday turnout was low and opening that day was expensive. 
Mail ballots are an option for people who can’t vote in person, he said. 
Eggers said he opposed Sunday voting because in many cases it forces the county elections directors to work 17 days without a break before Election Day. 
State Board member Jeff Carmon, a Democrat, said he will always vote in favor of Sunday voting. 
“I think it’s important that we be consistent and create an environment where, no matter what your job title or what your situation is, there’s a time when you’re able to vote,” Carmon said. 
The State Board put off discussion of whether it will feed voter information into the federal SAVE database that agencies use to verify immigration status and citizenship. 
The Department of Homeland Security asked the Board if it wanted to be part of a “soft launch” that allows states to submit voter information, including the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, to check immigration and citizenship status.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)A federal district court judge rejected defendants’ attempts to dismiss a voting rights case that first surfaced last summer when Gov. Glenn Youngkin ordered a purge of voter rolls that the U.S. Department of Justice, Democratic Virginia lawmakers and civil rights advocates said was too close to Election Day.
Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction

In what its plaintiffs are calling a “major win for voting rights,” U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia judge Patricia Tolliver Giles is allowing the case to proceed and move into the next phase of legal scrutiny. 
Filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrants’ Rights (VACIR), Virginia’s chapter of the League of Women Voters, and African Communities Together, the groups assert that Youngkin’s administration violated the federal National Voter Registration Act by removing people from voter rolls within 90 days of last November’s elections. 
The federal law entails a 90-day “quiet period” that both former President Joe Biden’s administration and the Virginia groups’ suits alleged Youngkin violated.
Voter purge lawsuits add to disenfranchisement allegations against Youngkin administration

Youngkin had issued an executive order on Aug. 7, 2024 — exactly 90 days before the 2024 elections — before touting it  on Fox News that same day. 
A 2006 law does allow removals from rolls if people fail to indicate U.S. citizenship on Department of Motor Vehicle paperwork. The information is then sent to the State Board of Elections monthly. Youngkin’s order ramped the process up to daily, which raised concern about eligible voters being inadvertently removed, along with its occurrence within the 90-day “quiet period.”
Purged Virginia voters say experience has been ‘worrying’

In the Aug. 7, 2024  interview with Sean Hannity, Youngkin said the “daily scrubbing” of voter rolls was necessary to “make sure that in fact if an illegal immigrant either mistakenly or maliciously registers to vote, that person will be cleaned off the ballot immediately and turned over to our prosecuting attorneys to make sure that they are prosecuted to the full extent.”
Election officials said at the time that there was already a process in place to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. The coalition’s suit argued that many removals were done without proper notification or investigation, leaving eligible voters unaware they could no longer cast their ballots. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit stressed that purges affect both longtime citizens who’d made paperwork errors and those who’d become naturalized citizens since their last Department of Motor Vehicles visits. Roughly 1,600 Virginians were affected, some of whom were able to get back on the rolls, but it was a challenge for them. 
“An attack on naturalized citizens is an attack on citizens,” VACIR director Monica Sarmiento said on a press call Wednesday celebrating the advancement of the case. 
Though the case sought an injunction last year,  the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the purge to take place. In the new U.S. District court ruling, the case can move forward again.
“Now we will have the opportunity to depose officials who were involved, seek additional information, find out who is responsible, and make sure this doesn’t happen again,” said Anna Dorman, legal counsel with Protect Democracy, which was also involved in the case. 
Beyond the lawsuit, state lawmakers tried to adjust the 2006 state law to further clarify federal law’s 90-day threshold. It cleared the legislature but was ultimately vetoed by Youngkin. 
If the lawsuit prevails, plaintiffs said their goal is to prevent voters from being negatively affected when they seek to vote in next year’s congressional midterm elections.

(Photo courtesy NBC12)Virginia students’ reading and math assessments in grades 3 through 8 for the 2024-25 school year improved despite the commonwealth making assessments more “rigorous” for students, according to data released by the Department of Education on Wednesday.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin credited the “Restoring Excellence to Education” plan, which included setting higher expectations and supporting schools with financial investments, improving transparency and accountability by providing “easy-to-understand” information for parents, and combating learning loss with the “ALL IN VA” initiative, which also improved student attendance.
As a result of the plan, Youngkin said at a Wednesday event touting the academic achievements at the state Capitol, Virginia’s Standards of Learning (SOL) pass rates for grades 3 through 8 in reading and math increased over the past three years. In reading, pass rates increased from 70.4% to 71.9%; in math, pass rates increased from 64.8% to 68.3%. Pass rates are scored on the proficient and advanced levels.
“We made the tests harder, and yet the students’ performance improved,”  Youngkin said. “That is a testament to the capabilities of Virginia students. When we set high expectations, the results improve. When we expect more from our students, they will deliver more. It is that fundamental belief that, I think, is the foundation of the future of education.”

Virginia uses the results of the SOL to measure student learning and achievement in mathematics, reading, science, writing, history and social science. SOL results also play an important role in determining whether schools are accredited, which impacts funding, support and intervention efforts.
Youngkin and his administration said some of the reasons for the previous decline in student achievement in math and reading scores are connected to prior Boards of Education and administrations’ “dismantling” of expectations and prolonging school closures due to the pandemic, which they said impacted students’ achievement.
“We took our foot off the gas, we lowered our vision and our expectations, and the system produced the results for which it was designed,” said Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera.
The governor explained that the commonwealth raised expectations by requiring students to demonstrate mastery of subjects, making math and English standards harder, and encouraging more students to take dual enrollment college courses, advanced math courses, and earn career and technical education credentials. 
Youngkin said the administration is not “trying to demean schools,” but instead is “trying to have a clear understanding of where the students are.”
The governor said the next step is to close the “honesty gap,” or the disparity between state-level proficiency standards and the more stringent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) benchmarks.
This week, the Board of Education is continuing its discussion about adjusting cut scores to determine whether K-12 students are meeting proficiency levels to better match the rigor of NAEP. 
Once approved, the updated performance standards will not take effect until spring 2026. 
Youngkin’s administration is pushing for Virginia to meet the NAEP’s “proficient” standard, which is defined as a student demonstrating a deeper understanding of complex topics and the ability to apply them in real-world situations. However, critics have questioned the effectiveness of this approach.
With the $418 million ALL IN VA initiative plan set to end next year, Youngkin said the success can continue if Virginia encourages businesses to invest in the commonwealth.
He also said the state is running on $10 billion in surpluses, and he plans to continue investing in education when he presents his final budget in December.
“There is still funding available to run ‘All In Virginia’ for the rest of this academic year, and that’s really exciting to me,” Youngkin said. “And then, when I have an opportunity to sit down and introduce my budget, we’re going to work through and prioritize a whole bunch of the shared priorities that I believe represent what Virginians need to go forward.”

Tucker High School student who was born in Afghanistan, was detained by ICE at Henrico County Courthouse on Friday, Aug. 8. He has a special visa which grants him legal immigration status in the U.S. (provided photo)The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Services’ detainment  of J.R. Tucker High School student Armand Momand’s constitutes a constitutional outrage.
Because of his father’s service to the U.S. government in Afghanistan, Momand has legal U.S. immigration status. Yet ICE agents took him into custody Aug. 8 after convictions in an Henrico County court for driving more than 20 miles an hour over the speed limit and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. 
Now, the government that Momand’s father risked his life to serve in fighting terrorism wants to deport his 19-year-old son, despite the young man’s lawful presence in the United States.
The deportation debacle ordered by President Donald has turned into a nightmare of lies and  unconstitutional behavior.
Trump’s demonization of immigrants in the name of nationalism doesn’t get much worse than betraying those who placed themselves in harm’s way to support this country.
On its website, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, better known as ICE, lists criminal convictions which would cause the service to detain an immigrant because they pose “a public safety or national security threat.”
The list includes burglaries and robberies. It includes kidnapping, homicide, sexual assault, and weapons offenses. It includes drug trafficking, and human trafficking.
What the list does not include are Momand’s convictions for reckless driving for going more than 20 miles an hour over the speed or misdemeanor disorderly conduct, a charge which prosecutors reduced from an original felony charge for eluding or disregarding police. 
To detain an immigrant, federal law requires ICE to have “probable cause” to believe the immigrant has committed a federal crime or is illegally residing in this country.
Momand has done neither, his lawyer, Mirian Airington-Fisher, told me in an interview.  
Public records that I looked at show that a Virginia district court judge gave Momand no jail time for his state convictions on July 8. Yet ICE detained him to consider for deportation.  
According to Airington-Fisher, Momand is a legal resident of this country who is pursuing permanent legal status and eventually U.S. citizenship.  
Momand was born in Afghanistan. Momand’s father received a Special Immigration Visa to bring his wife and children to America because he helped the U.S. military during its fight against Taliban terrorists in Afghanistan. The visas granted to Momand’s father and his family come with extensive vetting and reflect the deadly Taliban retribution faced by Afghanis who worked with Americans.
Virginia court records show no other criminal history for Momand. Airington-Fisher told me that is because the teenager has none. Ironically, Momand’s continued detention by ICE forced him to reschedule a green card interview set for Aug. 14, Airington-Fisher said.
ICE has offered no legal explanation for Momand’s imprisonment to his lawyers or family, Airington-Fisher added. 
“We received a notice to appear at a hearing to initiate deportation,” she explained.
That Aug. 25 hearing was postponed because of a “crowded” court docket, Airington-Fisher told me a day later. Now, to argue for bond, Momand, a legal U.S. resident, must wait until a rescheduled hearing on Sept. 8. He must spend a month in a federal detention center and miss the first two weeks of school. This is what passes for a speedy trial in Donald Trump’s nationalist crackdown on a legal teen immigrant.  
Momand, his family, and lawyers remain  “completely in the dark” about the legal justification for the young man’s imprisonment, Airington-Fisher said.  
“ICE can’t dissolve his visa status,” Airington-Fisher told me. “We do not believe his detention is legal.” 
The ICE detainee database shows Momand is being held at the Abyon Farmville Detention Center. 
On Aug. 19, I asked ICE if Momand had been charged with any crimes, and if so, what crimes.  The media office acknowledged my request, but has yet to get back to me with an answer. 
“You can’t just arrest someone and then figure out whether they did anything wrong,” immigration lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, a partner with the firm Murray Osorio, said in an interview on Aug. 19. “What was the probable cause to think this person committed a federal crime or was illegally in the country?”
Sandoval-Moshenberg represents Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the man ICE seized and was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration to a brutal El Salvadoran prison in defiance of a federal court order. 










ICE can’t dissolve (Arman Momand) visa status. We do not believe his detention is legal.


– Momand's lawyer Mirian Airington-Fisher


As Momand’s Aug. 25 hearing was being postponed in Virginia, ICE was again detaining Abrego Garcia for deportation three days after a judge ordered his release from custody as he awaits trial on federal criminal charges by the Trump administration. 
Sandoval-Moshenberg stressed that situations like Momand’s are very different from the Abrego Garcia case, which involves allegations of criminal felonies.
Momand’s case deals with basic constitutional rights such as being told of the charges against him and the right to a bond hearing so he could go to school between legal hearings and the constitutional requirement that the government must justify its legal right to deport him.
Most of all, Momand’s case involves the Trump administration’s  detention of immigrants living legally in the United States without probable cause.
Abrego Garcia arrested by ICE as judge orders postponement of deportation to Uganda

Finally, Momand’s case deals with Trump’s disrespect for the Special Immigration Visas meant to protect people who faced death constantly to help America fight ruthless terrorists. This is why the law provides Special Immigrant Visa holders an  opportunity to get a green card and an eventual path to American citizenship.
Asked about Momand’s detention by journalists, Virginia Gov. Glen Youngkin treated the young man as a dangerous criminal who deserved to be in custody while he is investigated charges that had already been litigated and resolved.  
Youngkin got it backwards. And he took the position that misdemeanor convictions in a traffic incident qualify as proof of a national security risk.
Under Trump’s indiscriminate immigrant removal policies, immigrants can no longer rely on being in the U.S. legally to protect themselves from being harassed and possibly deported, Adam Bates, senior supervisory lawyer for the International Refugee Assistance Project, told me.
“People now do everything they are supposed to, but they get grabbed off the street for doing nothing wrong,” Bates told me. 
I have met two Afghans who worked with the American government and who currently live in the U.S. One barely eluded capture by the Taliban as he set up forward communications systems for U.S. Marines. The other risked attack each day for translating in public for an American military contractor.
They, and others like them, worked knowing the fate of people like Sohail Pardis, an Afghani interpreter beheaded by the Taliban for aiding the American government.
The system for granting immigrants who helped America fight terrorism special visas is exhaustive and time-consuming.
For the Trump administration to now turn its back on foreigners who risked their lives on America’s behalf to pursue a nationalist deportation policy that demonizes all immigrants is cruel and self-destructive. The policy betrays constitutional and moral principles, not to mention national security. 
“It is horrific the extent to which we put people in mortal danger to help with our war effort and then toss them aside like used candy wrappers,” said Sandoval-Moshenberg. “It is going to have disastrous long-term foreign policy consequences.”
In Virginia, the ICE handling of Arman Momand should also have consequences. 
If it proves anything, it proves that immigrants are not and have never been America’s enemy.

Aug. 10, 2024. (Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)With a federal nutrition grant on pause, a state program that helps food insecure Mainers buy fresh produce is being downsized. 
Starting Sept. 1, Maine Harvest Bucks, which provides incentives for people who use Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, known as SNAP, or EBT payments at farmers markets to purchase fruit and vegetables, will cut its benefit in half because of pending funding constraints. Currently, the program offers a one to one match in a bonus voucher for every dollar spent at farmers markets. 
However, going forward, for every $2 in SNAP/EBT someone spends, the program will now provide $1 in Maine Harvest Bucks vouchers for fresh fruit, vegetables or seedlings. The Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets announced the change in its monthly email newsletter that went out Tuesday. 
Amid increased need, federal uncertainty, bill would double support for hunger relief program

Last year, the Maine Harvest Bucks program led to more than $680,000 in direct sales for farmers and market vendors, according to the federation’s website. The program is estimated to be responsible for about one in 10 sales for vegetables farmers at participating markets across the state. That increases to more than half of vendors’ sales at some rural markets. 
“Maine Harvest Bucks is a lifeline of stability for Mainers dealing with food insecurity and farmers alike,” the federation website says. 
However, funding hurdles have arisen since the federal grant that typically provides about $400,000 to Maine Harvest Bucks isn’t available for renewal. 
Jimmy DeBiasi, executive director of the Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets, said his team was ready to reapply for the grant earlier this year, but the application never opened. The current iteration of that grant is set to expire in May 2026. 
“Markets are going to feel it, the small businesses are going to feel it,” DeBiasi said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website said some processes for the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program grant have changed for this fiscal year. Funds will be distributed to existing projects, but the grant is not accepting applications this year, according to the agency’s website. It says applications could open again next year. The department did not respond to a request for comment by publication.
Without those funds being reupped, DeBiasi said the match is being cut in half to extend the lifespan of the program’s current funds. It also creates more time to fundraise or look for other grants to make up the difference.
“Instead of just hitting a wall where the program would basically end in May of 2026 or we would have to find a huge source of funding to cover that hole, we’re just stretching out our survival,” DeBiasi said. 
Some help from Augusta
Earlier this year, DeBiasi advocated for legislation in Augusta that, had it passed, could have covered the funding from the lapse in federal funding.

That bill, LD 468, would have provided an additional $1.2 million per year to the Fund to Address Food Insecurity and Provide Nutritional Incentives, which, like Maine Harvest Bucks, supports programs that allow low-income Mainers to use their benefits to buy produce from farmers.
The proposal passed both the Maine House of Representatives and Senate, but was not enacted due to a lack of funding. 
“Had we gotten that, we would have been OK,” DeBiasi said. 
However, DeBiasi was grateful that the supplemental budget that passed included ongoing funding of $600,000 a year for nutrition incentive programs like Maine Harvest Bucks.
Outside of filling the federal funding gap, the federation has been trying to fundraise $25,000 for the Harvest Bucks program in honor of its 10-year anniversary. So far, the group has raised about $10,000.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)
The fate of Lisa Cook, who is fighting attempts by President Donald Trump to remove her from the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, has huge implications for a keystone of good economic policy: central bank independence.
At the heart of her firing attempt – and other moves to undermine the Fed by the Trump administration – is a power struggle. Central banks, which are public institutions that manage a country’s currency and its monetary policy, have an extraordinary amount of power. By controlling the flow of money and credit in a country, they can affect economic growth, inflation, employment and financial stability.
These are powers that many politicians would like to control or at least manipulate. That’s because monetary policy can provide governments with economic boosts at key times, such as around elections or during periods of falling popularity.
The problem is that short-lived, politically motivated moves may be detrimental to the long-term economic well-being of a nation. They may, in other words, saddle the economy with problems further down the line.
That is why central banks across the globe tend to receive significant leeway to set interest rates independently and free from the electoral wishes of politicians.
In fact, monetary policymaking that is data-driven and technocratic, rather than politically motivated, has since the early 1990s been seen as the gold standard of governance of national finances and has largely achieved its main purpose of keeping inflation relatively low and stable.
But despite independence being seen to work, central banks over the past decade have come under increased pressure from politicians.
Trump is one recent example. In his first term as president, he criticized his own choice to head the U.S. Federal Reserve and demanded lower interest rates.
Attacks on the Fed have accelerated in Trump’s second administration. In April 2025, Trump lashed out at Fed Chair Jerome Powell in an online post accusing him of being “TOO LATE AND WRONG” on interest rate cuts, while suggesting that the central banker’s “termination cannot come fast enough!” Unable to force Powell out, Trump has now brought the power struggle to a head with his firing of Cook, nominally over allegations that the Fed governor falsified records in a mortgage application. Cook has said that the president does not have the grounds or authority to fire her.
As political economists, we are not surprised to see politicians try to exert influence on central banks. For one thing, central banks remain part of the government bureaucracy, and independence granted to them can always be reversed – either by changing laws or backtracking on established practices.
Moreover, the reason politicians may want to interfere in monetary policy is that low interest rates remain a potent, quick method to boost an economy. And while politicians know that there are costs to besieging an independent central bank – financial markets may react negatively or inflation may flare up – short-term control of a powerful policy tool can prove irresistible.
Legislating independence
If monetary policy is such a coveted policy tool, how have central banks held off politicians and stayed independent? And is this independence being eroded?
Broadly, central banks are protected by laws that offer long tenures to their leadership, allow them to focus policy primarily on inflation, and severely limit lending to the rest of the government.
Of course, such legislation cannot anticipate all future contingencies, which may open the door for political interference or for practices that break the law. And sometimes central bankers are unceremoniously fired.
However, laws do keep politicians in line. For example, even in authoritarian countries, laws protecting central banks from political interference have helped reduce inflation and restricted central bank lending to the government.
In our own research, we have detailed the ways that laws have insulated central banks from the rest of the government, but also the recent trend of eroding this legal independence.
Politicizing appointees
Around the world, appointments to central bank leadership are political – elected politicians select candidates based on career credentials, political affiliation and, importantly, their dislike or tolerance of inflation.
But lawmakers in different countries exercise different degrees of political control.
A 2025 study shows that the large majority of central bank leaders – about 70% – are appointed by the head of government alone or with the intervention of other members of the executive branch. This ensures that the preferences of the central bank are closer to the government’s, which can boost the central bank’s legitimacy in democratic countries, but at the risk of permeability to political influence.
Alternatively, appointments can involve the legislative power or even the central bank’s own board. In the U.S., while the president nominates members of the Federal Reserve Board, the Senate can and has rejected unconventional or incompetent candidates.
Moreover, even if appointments are political, many central bankers stay in office long after the people who appointed them have been voted out. By the end of 2023, the most common length of the governors’ appointment is five years, and in 41 countries the legal mandate was six years or longer. Powell is set to stay on as Fed chair until his term expires in 2026. The Fed chair position has traditionally been protected by law, as Powell himself acknowledged in November 2024: “We’re not removable except for cause. We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms. So we’re protected into law. Congress could change that law, but I don’t think there’s any danger of that.”
In the 2000s, several countries shortened the tenure of their central banks’ governors to four or five years. Sometimes, this was part of broader restrictions in central bank independence, as was the case in Iceland in 2001, Ghana in 2002 and Romania in 2004.
The low inflation objective
As of 2023, all but six central banks globally had low inflation as their main goal. Yet many central banks are required by law to try to achieve additional and sometimes conflicting goals, such as financial stability, full employment or support for the government’s policies.
This is the case for 38 central banks that either have the explicit dual mandate of price stability and employment or more complex goals. In Argentina, for example, the central bank’s mandate is to provide “employment and economic development with social equity.”
Conflicting objectives can open central banks to politicization. In the U.S. the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These goals are often complementary, and economists have argued that low inflation is a prerequisite for sustainable high levels of employment.
But in times of overlapping high inflation and high unemployment, such as in the late 1970s or when the COVID-19 crisis was winding down in 2022, the Fed’s dual mandate has become active territory for political wrangling.
Since 2000, at least 23 countries have expanded the focus of their central banks beyond just inflation.
Limits on government lending
The first central banks were created to help secure finance for governments fighting wars. But today, limiting lending to governments is at the core of protecting price stability from unsustainable fiscal spending.
History is dotted with the consequences of not doing so. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, central banks in Latin America printed money to support their governments’ spending goals. But it resulted in massive inflation while not securing growth or political stability.
Today, limits on lending are strongly associated with lower inflation in the developing world. And central banks with high levels of independence can reject a government’s financing requests or dictate the terms of loans.
Yet over the past two decades, almost 40 countries have made their central banks less able to limit central government funding. In the more extreme examples – such as in Belarus, Ecuador or even New Zealand – they have turned the central bank into a potential financier for the government.
Scapegoating central bankers
In recent years, governments have tried to influence central banks by pushing for lower interest rates, making statements criticizing bank policy or calling for meetings with central bank leadership.
At the same time, politicians have blamed the same central bankers for a number of perceived failings: not anticipating economic shocks such as the 2007-09 financial crisis; exceeding their authority with quantitative easing; or creating massive inequality or instability while trying to save the financial sector.
And since mid-2021, major central banks have struggled to keep inflation low, raising questions from populist and antidemocratic politicians about the merits of an arm’s-length relationship.
But chipping away at central bank independence, as Trump appears to be doing with his open criticism of the Fed chair and his removal of a member of the bank’s Board of Governors, is a historically sure way to high inflation.

(Photo by David Ryder/Getty Images)The airport, a jail, and a prison in Ohio’s Mahoning Valley have emerged as a major part of the network the Trump administration is using to conduct mass deportations. As it has, residents and advocates are raising concerns.
For his part, the county sheriff said he doesn’t have strong opinions in the deportation debate. He said he’s taking immigration detainees to supplement a thin budget.
The debate illustrates how moral and practical concerns can clash in the second Trump administration. The clash is particularly poignant in the Mahoning Valley, a place settled by immigrants who built an industrial powerhouse. That powerhouse has seen decades of decline in the wake of globalization and competition from overseas.
President Donald Trump ran last year on claims that the United States was overrun with violent criminals he would deport. Since then, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been rounding up undocumented immigrants — and some who are legally seeking asylum. He’s also seeking to deport hundreds of thousands of others who are legally here under temporary protected status.
Fewer than half of ICE arrests under Trump are convicted criminals

Despite Trump’s claim that he would focus deportation efforts on violent criminals, just 40% of the 112,000 arrested by ICE between Jan. 20 and late June had any criminal conviction. Only 7% had been convicted of violent crimes and just 5% of drug crimes, Stateline reported.
Even so, arrests have continued to surge. Nearly 60,000 people were in ICE custody as of Aug. 10, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
As they are, Youngstown and the Mahoning Valley are playing a big role. 
From February through July, 202 ICE planes carrying detainees traveled through the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport — the seventh most of any in the United States, according to Witness at the Border, which compiles the statistics. At the same time, the county jail and a private prison in Youngstown are housing about 500 ICE detainees, many of whom are shuttled to and from the airport.
Chris Harris, a local resident, said it’s wrong for local institutions to participate in what she sees as Trump’s needless persecution of a powerless minority.
“I’m fundamentally, morally, and spiritually opposed to our government rounding up immigrants, people of color, people who have or don’t have documentation, putting them into detainment, a lot of times with no due process,” she said in an interview last week. “Folks are just sitting in jail. A lot of times they have no way to contact an attorney, no way to contact family. People can’t find their loved ones in detainment. And then they’re getting shuttled from one detention center to another across the country. Fundamentally, I’m against that. I’m opposed to that. It’s a faith thing for me.”
Harris and a small group of others had been tracking and photographing ICE flights through the airport, which she said had usually taken place every morning and every night. But she said the flights now appear to have been moved out of public view.
As ICE planes have shuttled detainees around the country and overseas, they’ve prompted accusations that it’s a gambit to keep detainees out of touch with their attorneys and to deny participation in their legal proceedings. 
Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said it’s a system of injustice.
“I think it’s incredibly disturbing that we have set up this network of jails and charter flights,” she said. “We’re spending billions of dollars. We’re establishing prisons in foreign countries to house people who, up until the time of their arrest, were working and taking care of their families and following a legal process.”
Andrew Resnick is a spokesman for the Western Reserve Port Authority, which operates the Youngstown airport. He said his agency was aware of the Boeing 737 planes passing through the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport, but said they were there as a consequence of a federal lease with a fixed-base operator.
“It is important to note that the Port Authority serves as the commercial sponsor of the federally owned Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport (an FAA asset),” Resnick said in an email. “Our primary job is to ensure the ongoing operations of the facility through the safety and maintenance of airport facilities and grounds.”

While the port authority appears to have no say in the ICE presence at the airport, two jails in Youngstown are voluntarily housing around 500 ICE detainees daily. 
Every Thursday, Harris leads a prayer vigil at one or the other. She said nuns from a Catholic convent nearby and a few others regularly join her. But she said bigger numbers have been slow to materialize.
“People are scared. They don’t want to admit what’s happening. They don’t want to think about it,” Harris said. “We’ve got to stand up. If you’re not doing something, you’re part of the problem. I refuse to be part of this problem.” 
The larger of the two facilities is the Northeast Ohio Corrections Center. It’s owned by a private company, Nashville-based CoreCivic, which contracts with the federal and state governments. 
A spokesman was asked to confirm whether it housed 400 detainees in the Youngstown facility, as a source reported to the Capital Journal. The spokesman, Brian Todd, referred the question to ICE “out of respect.”
“Out of respect for our government partners at ICE, we kindly ask that you contact them directly regarding contractual/capacity questions,” he said in  an email. 
ICE didn’t respond to questions about the movement of detainees through the Mahoning Valley. Todd sent a February press release by CoreCivic indicating that the private prison company would take a major stake in Trump’s mass-deportation project.
Five weeks after Trump took office, the company announced “that it has entered into contract modifications to add capacity for up to a total of 784 detainees from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) at its 2,016-bed Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, its 1,072-bed Nevada Southern Detention Center, and its 1,600-bed Cimarron Correctional Facility in Oklahoma. In addition, CoreCivic has obtained a contract modification to specify that ICE may use up to 252 beds at its 2,672-bed Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi.”
Tramonte of the Immigrant Alliance said the money flowing to such private companies could be better used.
“That’s billions of taxpayer dollars that we could be spending on public education, health care, nutrition, priorities for American people instead of implementing a mass-deportation system,” she said. “It’s absolutely disturbing.”
The other Youngstown facility housing detainees, the Mahoning County Jail, typically houses about 100 a day. Sheriff Jerry Greene makes no bones about his motives for taking them — it’s for the money.
At $125 per-inmate, per-day, the department stands to take in an additional $4.5 million a year with most expenses other than food being covered by the feds, Greene said in an interview last week.

“I knew I had bed space,” he said. “The moment Trump won, I got on the phone with ICE in Cleveland and told them if they needed bed space, we’d like to put in for that. They jumped at that.”
Greene said his jail already housed prisoners for the U.S. Marshals Service, so all it took was a contract modification to take in the ICE detainees. He acknowledged that some members of the community objected to their presence in the jail, but he said they harbor some misconceptions.
“They’re accusing us of going out and kicking in doors and ripping people away from families, but really we’re just a number here,” Greene said. “Mahoning County has 100 beds. We get inmates from everywhere — from Maryland, Detroit, California, Florida you name it. We have a number we can take and they keep us full.” 
Greene, formerly a Democrat who last year switched his affiliation to Republican, said he doesn’t have an opinion about Trump’s deportation policies “other than I believe that if people are in this country illegally, they shouldn’t be. Would I call myself a fanatic about it? Absolutely not. But I agree with that part of it. If you’re not supposed to be here, you shouldn’t be here.”
It was pointed out that some of those being deported are in the country legally. Some are in the midst of asylum proceedings, and Trump is working to deport hundreds of thousands more with temporary-protected status. 
“When you peel this onion back, there’s probably going to be layers of good and bad to it,” Greene said. “But at the end of the day, I’m here to support the federal government, and this also benefits us.” 
During the first Trump administration, some Ohio counties were sued on claims that detainees were mistreated in their jails. Greene said mistreatment is not going to happen in his jail. In fact, he said, among his staff, ICE detainees are known to be good to work with.
“When you talk about mistreatment, it’s funny, because the comments that come from our medical staff and our deputies is that… the ICE inmates are great,” he said. “They don’t give the deputies problems like other inmates do.”
To Greene, the matter is simple: Somebody is going to house the detainees, so it might as well be Mahoning County where he says they’ll be well-cared for and the county’s depressed economy can benefit.
“If we didn’t house these hundred inmates, they’d be housed somewhere else,” he said. “They might be in a tent in the Everglades.”
But to Harris, the activist, it’s part of an anti-immigrant scheme that flies in the face of the region’s heritage.
“It’s so frustrating because we’re all immigrants over here in Youngstown. My dad came from East Germany,” she said. “He was a refugee seeking asylum. Folks, you’re Italian, you’re Irish, you’re Serbian, Ukrainian. This is your heritage.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/deportationplane-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-28 05:57:12.123906

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Trump’s bid to support coal could cost ratepayers billions, report finds

Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.

The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
Wobbly state finances
Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.










State layoff figures are giving us an early read.


– Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst known as “The Job Chick” on social media


In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
Medicaid cuts could mean hundreds of thousands of job losses annually, study finds

“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
California and Texas
California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

File photo. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA federal judge in Atlanta paused a challenge against school district policies targeting so-called divisive topics while a teacher fired under such a policy contests her termination in a separate state court case.
Just over two years ago, Cobb County fifth grade teacher Katie Rinderle was fired after reading “My Shadow is Purple,” a picture book with a nonbinary child protagonist, to a gifted class of 10- and 11-year olds.
Speaking after a Wednesday court hearing, attorney Craig Goodmark said Rinderle is “moving on” from the ordeal but still has concerns about her former employer.
“She continues to be an educator in Georgia,” Goodmark said. “She was attentive today, and I think she appreciated the judge’s thoughtful attention to what’s going on procedurally.
“She’s moving on with her life, but she continues to have concerns about the way Cobb County is creating outcasts out of an entire community of people,” he said, referring to LGBTQ Georgians.
The state case
Some parents complained that “My Shadow is Purple” presented a one-sided view of gender politics and that it violated their religious beliefs on the topic.
A disciplinary tribunal found that Rinderle made errors, including by not seeking advice from administrators before reading the book, but recommended against firing her. The Cobb County Board of Education rejected the recommendation and terminated her employment. Rinderle challenged that decision, but was rebuffed by the State Board of Education and the Superior Court of Cobb County.
“In sum, the record contains evidence that Rinderle knew about, and violated, CCSD’s rules governing use of supplemental resources and sensitive or controversial topics,” wrote Cobb Superior Court Judge Kimberly Childs in a January ruling. “The record also contains evidence that Rinderle was dishonest during CCDS’s investigation into her conduct. That evidence is enough for a local board to conclude that Rinderle engaged in willful neglect of duties by intentionally violating a known rule or policy.”
That challenge is now in front of the Georgia Court of Appeals, where it could be heard by the end of the year, after which it’s likely that one of the parties will appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.
The federal case
U.S. District Court Judge Tiffany Johnson ruled Tuesday that until Rinderle’s challenge over her termination is resolved, a separate federal challenge will be on hold.
Rinderle argued that she didn’t know the book, which she bought at a district-sponsored book fair, would run afoul of the district’s controversial materials rules. Her attorneys said those rules are so vague that they violate the 14th Amendment right to due process by preventing teachers from understanding what materials will subject them to adverse employment action.
Her attorneys also argue that because the district policies do not apply to discussions of characters whose gender expression or sexual orientation conforms with societal norms, the policies amount to a violation of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause.
“Defendants’ Censorship Policies effectuate the erasure, silencing, and stigmatization of gender nonconforming and LGBTQ students by singling their identities out for official disapproval as ‘controversial,’ denying them access to materials and curriculum that represent their identities and communities, and chilling CCSD teachers from affirming their identities and addressing anti-LGBTQ harassment,” Rinderle’s complaint reads.
The complaint alleges that Rinderle’s firing was unlawful retaliation for her “advocating for and supporting LGBTQ and gender nonconforming students.”
In a statement, the district expressed confidence that its decision to fire Rinderle will continue to be supported in court.
“Multiple rulings, in court and by the State Board, have confirmed what the District has maintained from the beginning of the case: the District’s decision was lawful and necessary,” a district spokesperson said. “Previous rulings have also affirmed Ms. Rinderle knowingly violated District rules and policy and also affirmed evidence of Ms. Rinderle being dishonest during the investigation.”
“Today’s procedural ruling does not change those facts, and we remain confident in the judicial process,” the district added. “In Cobb, we’re committed to following the law and focused on ensuring our classrooms remain centered on teaching and learning.”

(Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)The Trump administration’s cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis. Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.
The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the covid-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.
Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.

The divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.
In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”
The money in question wasn’t spent solely on covid-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
The Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reportedoutside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.
After its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.
Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.
In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.
“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.
At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.
Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.
“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”
Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.
Radabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.
Ashton said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.
Federal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.
The Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.
The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.
She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.
“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”
Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.
Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.
As of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.
Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.
“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.”
Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.
Some of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.
Brent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.
The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.
“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.



Methodology
KFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.
Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.
To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.
This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.

“We really focus on letting the kids progress and advance when they are ready, having instruction tailored to what they need, instead of a more arbitrary every first grader learns this, every second grader learns this, and leaving space as well for kids to have choice and agency,” Colas said. Their first school year started this week. 
Ohio has about 30 microschools — which are known for their smaller class size and individualized instruction, said National Microschooling Center CEO Don Soifer. 
“We’re looking for kids that could be thriving more than they are in their present setting,” he said. “The beauty of microschools is you really can build a microschool and operate it around the specific needs of the particular kid that you’re serving, which is just not an opportunity that you have in larger traditional settings.” 
Multi-age classrooms are the norm for microschools and the median number of students in a nonpublic microschool is 22, according to the 2025 National Microschooling Center report that surveyed 800 microschools across all 50 states. 
Microschools grew in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic and are typically driven by local demand, Soifer said. 
There is not a federal definition of a microschool, meaning microschools can vary by state.
“The regulatory frameworks and statutory frameworks for schools in this country were designed without having anticipated microschooling becoming popular,” Soifer said. 
Only a handful of states define microschools and Ohio is not one of those states, he said.
“State law does not include provisions for microschools; therefore, the Department does not oversee or track them,” Ohio Department of Education and Workforce Spokesperson Lacey Snoke said in an email. 
What are microschools? 
A little more than half of microschools operate under their state’s homeschool requirements and 30% operate as a nonpublic school within their state’s framework, according to the 2025 report. 
Only 22% of microschools are accredited and students receive letter grades in 29% of microschools, according to the 2025 report. 
Microschools predominately serve younger students and nearly three-fourths of microschools have tuition at or below $10,000, according to the report. 
Microschools can be housed in various locations. A commercial business or nonprofit space was the most common location (39%), followed by places of worship (29%), according to the 2025 report. 
Microschools get their curriculum from multiple places. When asked to check all that apply, 60% said they use curriculum from a company, 52% created their own curriculum, 51% use online learning tools, 50% use curriculum from other educators and 5% said they do not use curriculum, according to the report. 
It is estimated that between 750,000 and 2.1 million students currently attend microschools, according to a 2024 report by the RAND Corporation. 
“We do as well on the left, probably more so than on the right,” Soifer said. “We serve families of children with neurodiversities or other special needs.”
Microschools are growing in popularity, but state regulations haven’t caught up

Forest City Academy 
Forest City is inspired by Montessori education and does combined-age learning, Colas said. The plan is to add a grade level each year through fifth grade, according to their school’s website. They currently have two-full time faculty members and two part-time faculty members and are leasing classrooms from a local church. 
Forest City’s tuition is $12,000 and families can use Ohio’s school vouchers to help pay for tuition. 
“I’m super committed to ensuring that we’re an accessible school,” Colas said. “I think half of our families aren’t going to pay out of pocket. So the accessibility from the vouchers made it go from seeing cool concepts out there to we could do something like that here.”
Ohio lawmakers expanded the Education Choice-Expansion eligibility to 450% of the poverty line through the 2023 state budget — creating near-universal school vouchers. K-8 students can receive a $6,166 scholarship and high schoolers can receive a $8,408 scholarship in state funding under the expansion. 
Microschools, he said, can help students recognize and develop their passions and interests.  
“There’s not a one-size-fits-all solution for every child,” Colas said. 
He has worked in education since 2013. 
“Being in the traditional setting, I was very disheartened that for many kids, the only choices they got to make in a typical day were what they did at recess and possibly who they met with at lunch,” Colas said. “Otherwise you were told what to learn, how to learn, where to go — there was just not any choice available for them.” 
Azalea Montessori School
Azalea Montessori School near Cincinnati has a preschool and a kindergarten program that serves 54 children ages three, four and five, said Jeana Olszewski, the school’s founding teacher leader.
“We focus on independence and individualized education,” she said. “It’s not like everybody’s learning all of these things at the same time. … We do small group lessons, we do individual lessons, and then big group lessons.” 
Azalea Montessori, which accepts private school vouchers, opened in 2019 with 15 students. It is located in an old school building connected to a church and has an outdoor program that involves going to a nearby park. 
Preschool tuition is $9,000 and kindergarten tuition is $11,000, but Olszewski said kindergarten tuition is normally around $5,000 with a voucher. 
“If you don’t get the full EdChoice dollars, we would cap your tuition at $9,000, so no family is ever going to pay more than $9,000,” she said.

Brittany Watts’ miscarriage made national headlines after the Warren resident was arrested, despite her claims that she went to St. Joseph Warren Hospital in Youngstown twice for care and waited for hours without receiving the proper medical attention. Attorneys for Watts say she was diagnosed with “placental abruption,” which could have endangered the pregnancy.

Still, she claims she waited eight hours at the hospital with “no meaningful treatment or guidance,” only to leave and come back the next day.
When she returned the next day, she was told her “pregnancy was doomed” and she risked hemorrhaging, sepsis and death,” according to the lawsuit.
Attorneys say she went 10 more hours being “effectively untreated” before going home again and suffering a miscarriage in her bathroom.
After her miscarriage, Watts said she returned to the hospital, where hospital staff reported a crime to police, and officers questioned her, with court documents saying investigators suggested Watts had “birthed a live baby and hidden it ‘in a cabinet.’”
Watts was charged with abuse of a corpse, but a grand jury declined to indict her on the charges.
Watts is now suing the hospital and individuals that were involved in her time at the hospital and her arrest, claiming they “violated her constitutional rights, committed medical negligence, inflicted severe emotional distress and deprived her of her liberty without probable cause, among other misconduct.”
The lawsuit against St. Joseph Warren Hospital, its parent company Bon Secours Mercy Health, the city of Warren, and its police officers cites violations of her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, along with violations of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which establishes the right to receive emergency treatment regardless of insurance status or the ability to pay.
The suit was filed in January of this year in U.S. District Court. Along with the allegations of constitutional rights violations, Watts is accusing hospital staff of medical negligence, unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information and emotional distress.
Law enforcement are accused of malicious prosecution and false arrest, according to the lawsuit.
The court has been working through document deadlines and other procedural parts before it can consider a decision in the case.
Aug. 1 was a deadline to add parties to the lawsuit or amend certain documents. Before the deadline passed, Watts’ attorneys filed a document requesting that a worker from the hospital’s risk management department and a police officer at the hospital be added as parties.
According to the request, a hospital nurse involved in Watts’ care said she contacted both of the individuals to advise her on the situation.
After talking with the risk management staffer and the police officer, the nurse called 911 to “falsely report that (Watts) had committed a crime when she miscarried at home,” according to Watts’ attorneys.
“If (the nurse’s) account is accurate, these individuals participated in violations of (Watts’) rights, including by initiating a malicious prosecution and by violating her medical privacy rights,” the attorneys stated in a filing to the court. “They are rightfully defendants in this case.”
The newly amended complaint claims that although the hospital staff and law enforcement involved “knew Ms. Watts had committed no crime, they saw to it that she would face criminal charges for having an experience shared by hundreds of thousands of women every year.”
A status report filed by lawyers on both sides of the case said mediation by Bon Secours Mercy Health and St. Joseph Warren Hospital was “unsuccessful.”
Parties in the case, including the hospital, acknowledged to the court that Watts was told “the baby was too early from a gestational age for any reasonable chance of survival,” and that a doctor “recommended induction of labor, documented proceeding with treatment before Ms. Watts was on ‘death’s door.’”
Watts was also told that “a delay could increase the risk of hemorrhage and/or sepsis, and … the treatment plan was not initiated or completed because Ms. Watts left St. Joseph Warren Hospital a second time against medical advice,” according to a response to the lawsuit filed in March.
The city of Warren, law enforcement and hospital staff have all denied wrongdoing in the case.

Amid signs that a hoped-for recovery of Atlantic striped bass may be faltering, East Coast fisheries managers are moving to further tighten already restricted catch limits on the popular but beleaguered migratory fish.
At a meeting on Aug. 6 in Arlington, Virginia, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s striped bass management board voted to proceed with a plan to impose a 12% reduction in 2026 on both recreational and commercial catch of the prized species.
The plan, if adopted later this year, would trim the commercial harvest quota by that amount, while it would require East Coast states to curb the recreational catch by shortening the fishing season or adjusting the size limits for legally catchable fish.
Striped bass are found in the Atlantic from Maine to the Carolinas, but the Chesapeake Bay, where they’re also called rockfish, is the primary spawning and nursery ground for 70% to 90% of the entire stock.
The coastwide striped bass population is currently struggling to recover from years of being overfished, a problem exacerbated by poor reproduction in the bay — for six straight years in Maryland waters and for the past two years in Virginia. Striped bass spawning tends to vary year to year, but it has never been this low for this long, and scientists aren’t sure why.
The fisheries commission ordered catch restrictions in the bay and along the coast in 2020 and again in 2024 to halt overfishing and rebuild the stock. But higher-than-expected recreational fishing in 2024, mainly along the mid-Atlantic coast, cast a shadow over the projected recovery, lowering the odds the stock could reach a healthy level by 2029, as federal law requires.

Commission members had considered acting last December after being warned that the catch could surge still more in 2025 when the last bumper crop of striped bass spawned in the Bay reached legally catchable size. But they held off then, deciding to take more time to gather information and weigh options.
Though the 2025 fishing season is still underway, preliminary data confirmed an uptick in fishing pressure, reducing the odds of rebuilding the stock by 2029 to below 50%.
The commission’s plan, known as Draft Addendum III, contains a menu of measures under consideration for states to choose from for achieving the required catch reductions. It was posted this month for public comment, which is open until Oct. 3.
Commission members debated proposals for “no-targeting” season closures, during which sports anglers would be barred even from the popular practice of catch-and-release fishing for striped bass.
The commission’s technical experts had estimated that coastwide about 9% of all striped bass caught and released died anyway. But in summer, especially when shallower Bay water heats up, mortality of released fish can go much higher. Virginia already closes striped bass season during the summer, and Maryland has imposed no-targeting closures in spring and the last two weeks of July.
Some commissioners criticized “no-targeting” season closures in the plan, saying they are unenforceable because anglers might accidentally hook a striped bass while fishing for something else. But others argued that something is needed to curtail catch-and-release, which the commission estimates kills as many fish as are hooked and kept.
Coastwide, sports anglers harvested an estimated 1.7 million striped bass in 2024, according to the commission, roughly three times the size of the commercial harvest.
Ultimately, the commission retained no-targeting closures as an option, which if adopted by a state could slightly reduce the number of additional days anglers would be prohibited from catching and keeping striped bass to achieve the 12% reduction.
Further catch restrictions are unwelcome news for sport anglers, but they’re likely to hurt the livelihoods of watermen, proprietors of bait and tackle shops and charter fishing captains. Brian Hardman, head of the Maryland Charter Boat Association, said his group’s members saw their business drop by 75%-80% after the last round of cuts took effect in 2024.
Conservationists acknowledge more catch restrictions will hurt those businesses but say striped bass need more protection now from fishing pressure to have a chance to recover.
“Additional regulations will have real impacts, but they pale in comparison to the threat of continued striped bass decline,” Allison Colden, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said in a statement. The commission “must err on the side of conservation,” she said, warning that recent surveys indicate the stock is “facing a looming disaster.”

The commission’s plan also includes a proposal to revamp Maryland’s fishing season, lifting the state’s current ban on any fishing for striped bass, including catch-and-release, during their spring spawning season. Sports anglers had chafed at the spring catch-and-release ban and pressed for the change.
Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources said it wants to simplify its regulations and align the state’s striped bass fishing season more closely with Virginia and the separately regulated Potomac River. It also wants to give anglers more incentive to fish in the spring. Mike Luisi, DNR’s fisheries assessment manager, said the spring no-targeting closure drives anglers off the water and hurts the business of tackle shops and some fishing guides.
Maryland said its plan would not increase striped bass mortality, nor would it affect their spawning behavior. Some commission members voiced doubts about the latter claim, but the panel’s technical experts said data were lacking to evaluate it, and a pair of published studies came to conflicting conclusions.
The commission will seek public feedback in writing or at a series of public hearings to be held over the next several weeks. A final decision is expected at the commission’s October meeting in Dewey Beach, Delaware.
Whatever the commission decides to do then, Doug Grout, a New Hampshire representative, warned that even if tighter catch limits help striped bass reach their population target by 2029, the recovery is likely to be short-lived unless reproduction in the Bay improves.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A bipartisan group of Ohio lawmakers has introduced a bill making hate crimes illegal, increasing penalties for assaulting or terrorizing someone based on their race, sex, and even political affiliation.
Over the past year, the Ohio Statehouse has had to increase security due to upticks in threats against lawmakers.
The FBI charged a New Albany man in May for sending white powder and a bullet to Attorney General Dave Yost. Along with the threats to the state’s top cop, the suspect sent powder and violent messages to dozens of other public officials, like Sec. of State Frank LaRose and Treasurer Robert Sprague.
A Dayton man was arrested in July for leaving a threatening voicemail to Congressman Jim Jordan.
Over the past two years, Congresswoman Shontel Brown, Yost, and several state lawmakers have been “swatted,” with individuals falsely reporting serious crimes occurring at their addresses. This hoax has the goal of sending a large police presence, or a SWAT team, to approach an unsuspecting victim.
But when a man assassinated the Minnesota Speaker of the House and tried to kill other Democratic representatives in June, more troopers were deployed to monitor the Capitol Square area.
“We certainly do get our share of nasty correspondence and the occasional threat of physical violence,” state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, said.
Fischer joined the legislature in 2024, two years after a man mailed feces to each GOP state senator. He, however, has received threatening voicemails and messages, he said.
“I had one person encourage me to take my own life during the budget process,” Fischer said.
A slew of Republicans like him have joined Democrats like Rep. Dontavius Jarrells in cosponsoring Ohio House Bill 306. It would prohibit hate crimes and allow victims to take civil action against the perpetrators, potentially resulting in up to $25,000 in fines. The legislation also includes that a threat of violence could include making a false report, which could be in reference to swatting.
Jarrells and state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, are the primary sponsors and say that state law needs to be updated.
“Our laws don’t go far enough in terms of legal recourse when a hate crime does indeed occur, and so that’s what started our journey and really looking at our current existing law and saying, ‘What can we do to make it better?'” Jarrells said.
Current Ohio law doesn’t have a hate crime statute.
Civil rights attorney Jessie Hill explained that the state does have ethnic intimidation, which elevates a crime like menacing from a misdemeanor to a felony if the suspect targets someone based on their “race, color, religion, or national origin.”
“This legislation provides much more sweeping protections,” Hill said about H.B. 306. “It includes a really broad set of categories that are protected against intimidation or violence.”
H.B. 306 creates a new provision, protecting race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, familial status, military status, disability, the person’s position in a labor dispute, and political affiliation or position.
“One category that is not explicitly protected by this law, and it was kind of surprising to see that it was omitted given how broad this law is, is sexual orientation and sexual identity, gender identity,” Hill said.
This bill was a compromise, Jarrells said, but he believes that if someone commits a crime against a member of the LGBTQ+ community, it would fall under the “sex” protection.
“We were able to settle on ‘sex’ being kind of the umbrella term that covers all the gamut,” Jarrells said.
Hill acknowledged that in some cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has included sexual orientation under the sex category. Still, this provides an opening to interpret the law as not necessarily including sexuality or gender, she said.
The lawmakers say the bill makes sure to protect free speech, since someone can only be charged if a perpetrator makes a direct threat, acts in reckless disregard and has the “apparent ability” to carry out violence. The victim must also be afraid that they are in danger.
Hill agreed that this bill, from her reading, does not infringe on the First Amendment the way it is written, and it more closely mirrors federal law than current statute.
“Making sure that we can have that robust, free political discourse without people having to fear for their own safety or their family’s safety is really important,” Fischer said.
Legislators hope the bill helps lower the political temperature while also showing that threats have consequences.

About 1,500 Kansans packed a town hall at Wichita State University to engage in a once regular but now rare political conversation — one that was open to the public, unscripted, respectful, and deeply rooted in the urgent questions facing our state and nation.
The event wasn’t hosted by one of our own elected officials. It was organized by Leading Kansas, a nonpartisan civic engagement organization that I help lead, and featured U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida. These out-of-state Democratic lawmakers showed up to listen, to answer questions, and to model what accountability looks like.
The response from Kansans was overwhelming. The hunger for real dialogue was palpable. And yet, even with 1,500 of their own constituents gathered in one place, demanding answers, our Kansas federal delegation has yet to respond. Not a single one of our members of Congress commented on the event.
That silence is telling.
It has now been months — seven years in the case of Rep. Ron Estes — since our Republican federal lawmakers have held an open, public town hall with everyday Kansans. To my knowledge, none of them have public appearances scheduled during the August congressional recess that don’t charge an entrance fee, despite the tradition of lawmakers using this time to meet with their constituents face to face.
When we call their offices, we are told, “I’ll pass along your concerns.” But those concerns vanish into a void. There is no forum for follow-up, no venue to press for answers, no real conversation. Just boilerplate emails sent weeks — sometimes months — late, spouting the party line but offering little by way of facts or specifics.
This isn’t just a matter of disagreeing on the issues or politics as usual. It’s about the health of our democracy. The only goal that seems to be consistently pursued by our current Republican delegation is that which ensures that Kansans don’t talk to one another about the perilous state of our democracy. If they can shut down civic engagement, they can avoid governing entirely — still collecting a paycheck while evading difficult questions.
The late Democratic U.S. Rep. John Lewis once said: “Democracy is not a state. It is an act.”
That means democracy depends on participation, transparency, and accountability, not secrecy and silence. It means our leaders have an obligation to face their constituents, even when it’s uncomfortable.
In Kansas, we pride ourselves on straight talk and honest dealing. Our representatives should be willing to look us in the eye and explain their votes, their priorities, and their vision for our state’s future. When they refuse to do so, they aren’t just dodging difficult conversations, they are eroding the foundation of representative government.
At Leading Kansas, we’ve decided that waiting around for our lawmakers to find their courage is a waste of precious time. That’s why we’ve launched the “Coffee & Kansas Voices” tour — a series of Saturday conversations across the 1st Congressional District during the August recess.
We’ve invited Republican Rep. Tracy Mann to join us. We’ve offered to host him at a public forum of his choosing, at a date and location that works for him. So far, we’ve heard nothing.
So, we’ve started without him. We’ve met with folks in Salina, Garden City, and Hays, and we’re headed to Manhattan next. We buy the coffee and you bring your voice. We’re meeting people where they are, with a commitment to pass along any concerns we hear directly to the representative himself.
To that end, we offer the following summary of what we’ve heard thus far:

Economic strain from federal policies: Tariffs, the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the end of the Food for Peace Program are hurting Kansas businesses and farmers.
Rising costs and inflation: Families and small businesses alike are feeling the pressure, with sharp price increases and declining sales.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement disrupting communities: Agriculture and meatpacking — key industries that sustain towns like Garden City — face labor crises, while immigrant families live in fear, afraid to send their children to school, and even when they do, knowing that educational programs designed to help them overcome language and culture barriers have been cut.
Cuts to Medicaid and rural hospital closures: Rural Kansans fear how Medicaid cuts will affect their access to care and their already fragile health care systems, including the potential closure of the regional hospital (St. Catherine’s) that serves Garden City residents.
Other notable concerns, though eclipsed by economic challenges, included: gender equality for women, the rise of white supremacy, and the dangerous spread of misinformation.

Overshadowing this litany of concerns, of course, is Kansans’ deep frustration with the silence from our elected representatives. This silence is not only disappointing, it is a fundamental failure by our lawmakers’ to fulfill their most basic responsibility: answering to the people they represent. Kansans are showing up and listening to one another. We are naming the problems and seeking solutions. It is time that our elected officials did the same.
So, we’ve started without him. We’ve met with folks in Salina, Garden City, and Hays, and we’re headed to Manhattan next. We’re meeting people where they are. We’ll buy the coffee and you bring your voice. We’ll listen, record stories for our new Kansas Voices Rising initiative, and make sure our representatives in Washington hear what Kansans have to say, whether they show up or not.

(Stock photo by Henry Redman/States Newsroom.)In the conventional wisdom of yore, politicking for elected office didn’t start in earnest until after Labor Day. Nobody wanted to eat, sleep and breathe political noise in the summertime. That could start later. Much. But there is nothing remotely conventional about American politics in 2025.
A convicted felon sits in the White House consumed with extracting revenge and seizing power. The Justice Department has mobilized to make people on Donald Trump’s enemies list suffer with bogus prosecutions and showy FBI raids. 
On a manufactured crisis, the President of the United States commandeers an armed police state occupying the nation’s capital as a trial-run to more militarized takeovers of American cities. Citizens fear Trump’s unprovoked show of force in a free country is a pretext for martial law. 
We are so far from normal, in terms of acceptable political conduct in this country, it is hardly shocking to watch Ohio’s unorthodox rollout of a seemingly fixed slate of GOP wins ahead of next year’s elections.    
In January, term-limited Republicans, who hold a monopoly on every statewide office in Ohio, declared their intentions to switch seats with each other in 2026.
And just like that the GOP dance card in the state was filled — almost two years before the midterms. Republican officeholders needed a place to park to stay in play. Done and done. 
Meanwhile, Ohio Democrats continued to overthink (and underplay?) the urgency of the moment for an unsparing opposition party. They dithered over how to fill their dance card in the state with a shallow bench and also-rans. Still no party prospects for state auditor or treasurer. 
The declared Democratic candidate for state attorney general, up against Republican Keith Faber, current Ohio auditor, is a former state lawmaker reprimanded by his own caucus for confrontational behavior with colleagues and constituents. No other Democrat has announced a run for the state’s chief law enforcement office.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Last week former Ohio House minority leader Allison Russo finally entered the race for state secretary of state. Her Democratic primary opponent, Dr. Bryan Hambley of Cincinnati, has been traveling the state since January to introduce himself to voters. 
On the Republican side is retired Air Force officer Marcell Strbich and current State Treasurer Robert Sprague, who initially considered a run for governor but changed his mind after Trump-endorsed Vivek Ramaswamy set his sights on the job. 
Ramaswamy is the slick marketer who made a fortune in pharmaceuticals and biotech and figured that qualified him for the presidency. He personally bankrolled a campaign to “out-Trump” the frontrunner in the 2024 presidential race but dropped out early, after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses. 
The then-38-year-old quickly pivoted to a leading surrogate role in the Trump camp and his slavish sycophancy paid off when Trump was reelected. Ramaswamy was appointed to co-lead a government cost-cutting task force with Elon Musk. But first thing Musk cut was his co-leader and Ramaswamy pivoted again to run, this time, for governor in Ohio — after moving his company to Texas.
Dr. Amy Acton is his only Democratic opponent. The former director of Ohio’s Department of Health was a public lifeline during the frightening onset of the COVID-19 pandemic but ultimately faced withering partisan backlash about decisions to minimize exposure to the deadly virus. 
Like the other doctor running for statewide office, Acton has been making her case to be Ohio’s next governor for months already. She may yet face a primary challenger if ex-congressman Tim Ryan, who lost a U.S. Senate campaign to JD Vance in 2022, chooses to run. But for now, Acton is banking on her years of community service in public health and welfare to gain traction against a billionaire with a massive war chest.  
The only other statewide question Ohioans will answer in15 months — besides whether the sole Democrat on the Ohio Supreme Court, survives a GOP attempt to turn the turn bench into a solid red panel — is who will serve the remaining term of JD Vance’s U.S. Senate seat. 
Former Lt. Gov. Jon Husted was appointed to that position when Vance became vice-president but must run for the final two years of that term in 2026. Former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the three-term Democrat who lost his re-election to Republican newcomer Bernie Moreno in 2024, recently launched a comeback bid against Husted. 
But even with a long career in public office and greater name recognition than Husted, Brown starts from behind.
A new Emerson College Polling survey of Ohio voters found Husted leading Brown 50% to 44%. 
The conventional, play-it-safe politicking that characterized Brown’s last statewide campaign — mocked by his opponent as timid — won’t cut it in 2026 either. 
The same poll showed Ramaswamy leading Acton by 10 points. 
It will be difficult, if not impossible, for statewide Democratic candidates to upset favored Ohio Republicans (backed by far greater funding) if they refuse to throw caution to the wind and cling to customary.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

(File photo by Rosanne Skirble/Maryland Matters)In Maryland, as mass layoffs ripple through a workforce heavily tied to government jobs, it is Community Action Agencies that stand ready to catch families before they fall into deeper hardship. They are the flexible thread that weaves together different funding sources, creating a collective impact that keeps communities stable and resilient.
In 1962, Michael Harrington’s “The Other America” revealed a hidden layer of poverty that many chose not to see. Today, we must not turn a blind eye to what it means for social safety net programs to fade away — risking yet another “Other America.”
Programs such as Community Action Agencies are the steady support Maryland’s hardworking families depend on when times are tough and it’s just not enough. These agencies are essential to Maryland’s resilience, especially during times of economic disruption.
Community Action Agencies don’t just provide temporary relief; they offer ongoing, adaptable emergency response that meets each new crisis. When other aid fades away, these agencies remain — helping people with employment support, energy conservation, childcare, senior services, and more.

They are, in essence, a lifeline that has always been here, and one that must remain strong if we want our communities to thrive.
Maria, a single mother who lost her job during a round of mass layoffs, was helped by her local Community Action Agency. They stepped in, providing emergency energy assistance to lower her utility bills, enrolling her in workforce and entrepreneurship training programs, connecting her with food resources, and helping her secure child care services.
Within months, Maria was on a clear path to regaining financial stability. Her story is just one example of the thousands of Maryland families who turn hardship into hope with the support of Community Action Agencies.
Even if you have never needed the help of a Community Action Agency, you benefit from their work. When families regain stability, the whole community grows stronger. Parents can return to the workforce. Children can focus on succeeding in school. Seniors can remain in their homes with dignity.
Right now, proposed cuts to Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) funding threaten to dismantle this safety net of Community Action Agencies. Imagine a community facing rising job losses while losing the very agencies that have held it together for decades.
This is why we cannot stand idly by. We must recognize these agencies for what they are — essential, enduring emergency responders.
Without stable CSBG funding, the strong support system for Maryland’s hardworking families will weaken — and the cost will be felt across communities.
In 2024, Maryland’s Community Action Agencies helped nearly 280,000 families bridge the gap from crisis to stability. These are parents juggling multiple jobs to keep a roof overhead, seniors stretching fixed incomes to cover rising costs and neighbors reentering the workforce after sudden layoffs.
History has already shown us the danger of ignoring what we cannot see — or choose not to. Just as Harrington brought to light the unseen struggles of the past, we must now shine a light on the critical impact of these agencies. Let’s not allow their vital work to be quietly erased from the budget.
Instead, let’s stand up, speak out, and ensure they remain the resilient foundation of our communities. Our call to action is simple: let’s not allow these emergency responders fade away.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/thumbnail_5.Clopper-Mill-Pantry--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-28 04:57:47.410140

(File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)The Board of Public works approved a $300 million IT contract Wednesday despite concerns about transparency and whether Maryland businesses and state agencies could be at a disadvantage in the deal.
Under the nine-year contract, a pool of eight preapproved companies will provide digital services to state agencies, with contracts awarded on a rotating basis between the companies.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman questioned the contract’s effects on competition and its costs to state agencies as well as the fact that the deal would have the effect of limiting future review of high-dollar contracts by the board.
“Vendors have expressed frustration to me … because when work is assigned on a rotational basis, vendors have very little agency over what work they’re performing on the contract,” Lierman said. “And if they decline a work order, they risk not being assigned another opportunity until the state works its way through the entire list.
“I have concerns, I guess, about this type of vehicle moving forward, and I hope, I hope I don’t see it again,” she said to the Department of General Services officials presenting the contract.
The contract, approved by a 2-1 vote of the board, is the latest chapter in an effort to revamp how state technology projects are handled. It is an effort that has drawn scrutiny from board members and criticism from some lawmakers.
 Maryland Department of Information Technology Secretary Katie Savage. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
Katie Savage, secretary of the Department of Information Technology, said Wednesday the contract “will help us improve digital services for Marylanders, help address accessibility issues, the political cybersecurity issues we’re facing, and create economic opportunities for Maryland companies.”
The master contract approved by the board preapproves eight firms — only two of which are headquartered in Maryland — to provide technology services. Projects are awarded using a work order model instead of individually bidding out projects. The orders are handed out round-robin style with each approved company being assigned a project in turn.
Savage noted that three of the winning bidders — while not headquartered within Maryland —”have satellite offices” in the state. And Gov. Wes Moore (D), who sits on the board, noted the contract is tied to 1,400 jobs in the state and “all these firms plan to hire additional Marylanders as needed.”
Moore was joined by Deputy Treasurer Jonathan Martin, who filled in for Treasurer Dereck Davis, in voting to approve the contract.
Lierman said concerns — including the elimination of competition — prevented her from voting for the request.
“I worry there’s now eight firms for the next umpteen years that will be able to have a work order in this way, and that cuts out a lot of other potential Maryland based firms from doing this work unless an agency goes through and full RFP [request for proposals] process, which, of course, is longer than many of us would like,” Lierman said.
Because the work orders are not bid out, the Board of Public Works would have no oversight, Lierman noted. Additionally, a lack of competition could mean projects end up costing more, or that agencies and contractors are mismatched resulting in poor outcomes.
Lierman lamented the lack of Maryland-based businesses involved in the contract. State law allows departments favor bidders headquartered within the state.
Comptroller’s Office issues guidance to help businesses brace for 3% ‘tech tax’

“But it’s only good if it’s used,” Lierman said.
Chief Procurement Officer Wallace Sermons defended the removal of the Maryland business preference from the contract, saying the preference could backfire on a Maryland firm doing business in another state.
“If we were to give a 10% preference, let’s say, for instance, for a Maryland-based firm, then if that Maryland-based firm, the majority of their work was, let’s say in New York, New York, through their reciprocity, could then reduce that firm’s score by 10%.” Sermons said.
“Since we don’t know for each firm in Maryland how much work they have out of state at this point, we don’t put that in. We don’t use that,” he said of the in-state preference.
Lierman rejected that argument calling it “completely hypothetical.”
“We’ve never been given evidence of a single factual situation where a state outside of Maryland has imposed some sort of penalty on any other company, or has even threatened to,” Lierman said. “I mean, we don’t track what our businesses are doing out of state. So, it’s a challenge to prove that right now.”
The comptroller — the state’s chief tax collector — added that she is also concerned about the effect of a new sales tax on companies that provide IT services. The contract approved by the board was bid out last year, before the tax was even proposed.
“And because this was spit out and people responded to it prior to that, I think that we now don’t have a necessarily accurate answer of what is going to happen,” Lierman said. “Every day I talk to Maryland businesses about the tech tax and about locating in Maryland. So, it’s even more important to me now that we’re working with our Maryland based firms.”
She said the levy changes “the underlying economics” of such contracts and the actual costs of state contracts.
“I think it’s just going to change the economics of the contracts that companies are doing,” Lierman said. “I’m not saying that’s good or bad. It just changes it.”

It began operations last week. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)The United Auto Workers claimed a narrow victory Wednesday night in a unionization vote at an electric vehicle battery plant in Hardin County, though the election’s outcome remains uncertain because dozens of ballots have been challenged. 
The preliminary tally from the election at BlueOval SK in Glendale was not immediately available from the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency overseeing the election. 
A spokesperson for BlueOval SK told the Lantern the vote was 526-515 in favor of the union and that 41 challenged ballots had yet to be tabulated.
In an emailed statement, the Detroit-based union claimed a “hard-fought victory” and “a major step forward for workers who stood up against intense company opposition and chose to join the UAW.” 
The union said the challenged ballots were “illegitimate” and represented “nothing more than an employer tactic to flood the unit and undermine the outcome.”
“We will fight these challenges to defend the democratic choices of these workers, as we always do when corporations try to interfere with workers’ democratic choice,” the UAW wrote. “The challenged ballots are not part of the group of workers who built their union from the bottom up. They deserve to have their own union, in an appropriate bargaining unit with a representative of their own choosing.” 
The union in its statement, issued shortly before midnight, called on Ford Motor Co. to “acknowledge the democratic decision of its workforce” and “drop their anti-democratic effort to undermine the outcome of the election.” BlueOval SK is a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and South Korea-based SK On. 
Mallory Cooke, a spokesperson for BlueOval SK, in a statement said the outcome of the election would depend on the National Labor Relations Board’s decision of whether the challenged ballots will be counted. 
“BlueOval SK will urge the board to count each eligible vote because every voice matters,” Cooke said. “We remain focused on the safety and wellbeing of our team and our commitment to build best-in-class batteries together!” 
The preliminary vote must be certified by the National Labor Relations Board to become official. The agency fields and reviews potential objections to ballots and election conduct before certifying the result. 
The votes cast over Tuesday and Wednesday culminated a nine-month campaign by the UAW to unionize the electric vehicle battery manufacturing complex, which began production last week. State officials previously described the complex as the “single-largest economic development investment in state history” that would employ 5,000 people when a second planned plant becomes operational. 
If the UAW is successful in the election, it would mark another victory for the union after successfully organizing other electric vehicle battery plants including most recently in Indiana. The UAW’s efforts are part of its broader push to unionize electric vehicle battery plants across the country, although organizing in the South has been more challenging. 
Tensions had flared leading up to the election between the UAW and the BlueOval SK over workplace safety issues, and the union called on the National Labor Relations Board last month to investigate what it alleged was a “scorched-earth” anti-union campaign by BlueOval SK. The company had denied assertions from workers about workplace safety and had dismissed the UAW’s call for an investigation as a “dishonest tactic.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blueoval_08-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-28 01:56:45.862302

(Photo via Georgia DNR)How many chances should you give a bad actor? A screw-up? A company that fouled the ocean and the coast and killed lots of wildlife? I ask this because BP, the British oil giant responsible for the worst spill in U.S. history, is asking for a do-over.
This marks the company’s first major attempt at a comeback since the 2010 spill that went on for months and left four states — one of them Florida — coping with floating toxic blobs.
This time, instead of the darkly ironic “Deepwater Horizon” name, BP has dubbed its project “Kaskida.” To me that name sounds less like an oil field and more like a clunky car model: “I recently bought a new Chevy Kaskida, but it’s already been recalled.”
The Houston Business Journal says BP’s new oil field is about 250 miles off New Orleans and, when completed, should produce 80,000 barrels of oil per day. Ideally the oil will go into barrels only, not into the water.
If I seem overly skeptical of BP, you have to understand: I covered that massive 2010 spill and saw all of its nastiness up close.
I saw beautiful white Panhandle beaches that I’d played on as a child that were tainted with BP’s stinky glop.
I saw workers in hazardous materials suits patrolling the coastlines of eight Florida counties, cleaning up the mess that showed up there almost every day for months on end.
I even spent a day with a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission crew who ventured out in a 50-foot boat to try to spot — and stop — the floating tar mats that had made it as far as our state. One of the crew members told me that they were looking for “rainbow sheen, metallic sheen, or Charlie Sheen.”
So you’ll have to forgive me for not swooning as BP trumpets the wonderful future that will open once this new well is tapped. “Developing Kaskida will unlock the potential of … the Gulf of Mexico for BP, building on our decades of experience in the region,” one vice president boasted last year.
BP’s abysmal track record has a lot of environmental groups nervous about the idea of the company drilling a new well — this time going even deeper than Deepwater Horizon.
 Martha Collins via Healthy Gulf
“Kaskida is a reckless gamble with the Gulf’s future,” Martha Collins, executive director of the environmental group Healthy Gulf, told me this week. “The history is right there in your face, and everybody is refusing to see it and learn from it.”
This is not some remote risk they’re worrying about. Our extremely pro-fossil fuel federal government is expected to rubber stamp the BP permit by Friday of this week.
If you’re wondering when the public gets to comment on this, I’m sorry to say you missed it. Several folks I talked to told me they believe that the comment period was kept quiet to avoid alarming the public. Nevertheless, five members of Congress and tens of thousands of people wrote in to oppose the permit.
“Wait a minute,” you may be thinking, “surely BP learned its lesson from that horrible 2010 disaster. After all, it cost the company billions of dollars in penalties.”
Alas, as Alicia Silverstone put it so succinctly in “Clueless,” “As IF!”
An Earth Day disaster
For those who don’t remember, weren’t born yet, or are suffering from a brain-eating worm, here’s how the last BP oil spill happened.
BP started Deepwater Horizon drilling in 2009. The project earned that name because it was deeper than Barry White crooning a love song. The Deepwater Horizon drilling occurred in about 5,000 feet of water and then went down more than 18,000 feet in the rock below.
But the depth of the well became a major factor in the disaster to follow.
On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded, killing 11 people and injuring 16 more, then quickly sank to the floor of the Gulf.
Two days later — on Earth Day, of all things! — the damaged rig began spewing oil. No one could easily get down to the sea floor to stop it, either. It wound up coating coastlines in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The spill badly damaged tourism, commercial fishing, and other industries that depend on clean beaches and uncontaminated water.
Unable to easily send humans to so deep a place, the company dispatched robot subs to try to shut down the flow — the first time such an operation had been mounted at this depth. Unfortunately, the robots turned out to be just as inept as the humans controlling them.
The spectacle of the unstoppable gushing oil held the nation spellbound for months. BP’s engineers struggled with a variety of gadgets and inventions that also failed to stop the spew of black gold. More than 130 million gallons would gush into the Gulf from the broken well.
Desperate, the company sprayed 1.8 million gallons of a chemical dispersant called Corexit on the oil to prevent it from reaching shore. This was an unprecedented amount of dispersant, some of it sprayed directly at the wellhead.
Unfortunately, Corexit didn’t correct anything. It created a mixture that spread even more widely and was even more toxic.
The company also tried burning the mats of oil floating on the surface, which created air pollution to go with the water pollution. The burning left a residue of toxic chemicals that drifted down to the bottom as something resembling dirty snow, which was particularly bad for coral reefs.
After 87 days, BP engineers finally figured out how to shut off the well. By the end, some 2.5 million pounds of BP oil slathered Florida’s coastline. And the damage – to wildlife as well as humans – has continued for years afterward.
Here’s a fun fact about Kaskida: BP found that deposit of oil in 2006 using the same drilling rig that it used for Deepwater Horizon. OK, maybe that fact isn’t so fun after all.
To get to the Kaskida oil field will require drilling down even deeper than the Deepwater Horizon well — 5,900 feet to the gulf bottom, then another 32,500 feet in the rock.
“The safety of our people and the environment will remain our highest priority throughout this project and in all our operations,” a BP spokesman told me this week.
Still, I have an uneasy feeling that, with this latest BP project, we’re all about to channel Steely Dan and go back, Jack, and do it again.
Sea lions, seals and otters, oh my!
Following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, BP’s oil spill response plan drew widespread attention — and widespread mockery.
“BP mentions sea lions, seals, sea otters, [and] walruses in its Oil Spill Response Plan for the Gulf of Mexico region,” Grist reported in May 2010. “The geniuses who wrote the plan either don’t know jack about wildlife, or they cribbed text out of a plan for the Arctic region.”
There was plenty more to ridicule. The plan referred to a Japanese home shopping site as a resource for rapid deployment of spill response resources. And it contained no information about tracking sub-surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts. Oops!
The only thing worse than seeing BP’s error-filled spill plan is knowing that the federal agency that permitted the drilling didn’t catch those problems either.
The depth of Deepwater Horizon signaled a need for greater caution, and critics say Kaskida should send the same signal. Going very, very deep makes the odds of a huge mistake much more likely.

“The deeper you go into the ocean to drill, the greater the risk of a spill,” said Jackson Chiappinelli of Earthjustice, another environmental group that’s opposed to the new BP project.
Given what happened with Deepwater Horizon, you might think BP would do a better job on its oil spill response plan for Kaskida. I have to say, there’s no mention of sea lions or Japanese home shopping sites this time. But there’s not much else, either.
“Their plan fails to adequately analyze the risk of an oil spill and the extent of harm that it could cause,” said Kristen Monsell of the Center for Biological Diversity, yet another environmental group that’s opposing the permit.
 Kristen Monsell via Center for Biological Diversity
Its only plan for dealing with a spill from this deeper well is basically “spray lots more Corexit on it.” But as we learned from Deepwater Horizon, Corexit is “an incredibly dangerous dispersant,” Monsell said.
Long-term studies after Deepwater Horizon found that the cleanup workers who came into contact with the Corexit-oil mixture had more health problems than those who did not.
In the decade-plus since the spill, Dale Sandler of the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences  has been leading a study of the effects on 33,000 of the people who worked to clean up BP’s oil. (And so far, RFK Jr. hasn’t shut the study down.)
 Dr. Dale Sandler via NIEHS
From spending just six to nine months doing clean-up work, Sandler told me, people developed increased risks of heart attacks, diabetes, rashes, and other skin conditions that have continued to this day.
The dispersant made the chemicals from the oil more accessible to affect the clean-up crews, Sandler told me. And she pointed out that most of the clean-up crews were made up of poor and unemployed people who couldn’t afford top-notch care, so they already had health problems.
“The oil spill was not good for you,” Sandler said, “but those other things were not good for you either.”

Sliming the shrimp
Almost as soon as word spread about BP’s spill, scientists from the University of South Florida’s College of Marine Sciences began planning where to dispatch their research ship. They wanted to see the effect the oil had on the wildlife of the Gulf.
Their first gulfwide survey found that there were more sick fish in the area of the oil spill than anywhere else. There were red snapper and sheepshead with lesions, fin rot, and parasite infections.
They and other scientists kept monitoring the damage done — the dolphins stranded, the oysters spoiled, the shrimp slimed. An estimated one-fifth of the entire population of the rare Rice’s whale was wiped out.
By 2020, USF scientists had sampled more than 2,500 fish representing 91 species from 359 locations across the Gulf and found evidence of oil exposure in all of them.
“Quite a number of species still haven’t recovered,” Steve Murawski, a fisheries biologist with the University of South Florida’s College of Marine Science, told me at the time. “And there are (still) two major pools of Deepwater Horizon oil in the environment – one in the estuaries, and one in the deep sea.”
Only 3,000 dead sea birds turned up after the spill, but scientists believe the true number of avian casualties from Deepwater Horizon to be closer to 800,000. That’s a staggering number of birds lost — enough for a modern-day sequel to Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring.”
Now picture the oil from a spill at Kaskida, coming from much deeper, under much greater pressure, and with a full load of Corexit making it more likely to spread far and wide.
Not needed
If the decision on this new BP permit were up to me, this Panhandle native woud tell them, “Negatory, good buddy.”
After all, it’s not like we need more oil right now. The U.S. became the world’s top producer of crude oil in 2018 and it’s topped the list every year since then.
In a nice irony, that fossil fuel surge mostly occurred while the president was Joe Biden, a big fan of weaning the U.S. off fossil fuels. He pushed Congress to pass bills to promote even more solar (good news for the Sunshine State, where our utilities are building lots of solar farms) and wind power.
But now the president is the guy who told oil execs he’d repeal every environmental rule if they would give him $1 billion for his campaign. He’s already begun paying them back with big tax breaks and incentives galore.
 Matt Giacona via BOEM
He’s also been installing a fox in every federal henhouse. The decision on BP’s permit is up to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The bureau’s acting boss is Matt Giacona, a former lobbyist for offshore oil drilling companies.
Something tells me that when it comes to requests from the members of the oil industry, the word “no” is not in his vocabulary.
I do wish this was something our Florida state government would jump up and fight. But right now, the governor seems totally preoccupied with protecting us from the dangers of rainbow crosswalks.
Maybe the only way to keep BOEM from giving BP a green light is to convince that guy in the White House that the company has expressed a deep commitment to supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion. He seems to really hate that.
Besides, they’re British! Why should they get to exploit the Gulf that he’s now named for America?

Another 17 people were injured — 14 children and three parishioners in their 80s — and are being treated at area hospitals. One adult and six children were in critical condition Wednesday afternoon, according to Hennepin Healthcare.
Annunciation Principal Matt DeBoer said teachers acted within seconds of gunfire erupting to shelter children under pews.
“It could have been significantly worse without their heroic action,” DeBoer said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “We lost two angels today. Please continue to pray for those still receiving care. We can’t change the past, but we can do something about the future.”

The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, barricaded the door of the church with a wood board and shot dozens of rounds through the window using a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.
“The coward that shot these victims took his own life in the rear of the church,” O’Hara said.
Outside the school after the shooting, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.
Susan Ruff, a neighbor whose children attended the school at Annunciation and has a grandson currently enrolled, said she saw the shooting from her window.
She witnessed a man dressed in black, wearing a helmet, with a long gun, shooting at the church from the outside. She heard 25 or 30 gun shots. “It sounded like someone was dropping a dumpster. That loud bang. But I kept hearing it, so I thought, that’s not a dumpster.” Her grandson was unhurt in the shooting.
Westman purchased the weapons legally and did not have a criminal record, O’Hara said. He said law enforcement were not seeking other suspects.
Court records show a Mary Westman, who retired from Annunciation Catholic School in 2021 according to a now-deleted Facebook post, requested a name change for her child from Robert to Robin in 2019 saying “minor identifies as female.” O’Hara said he could not confirm the suspect’s connection to the school or that the suspect changed their name.
O’Hara said investigators believe Westman is behind videos scheduled to post on YouTube on Wednesday morning, which have since been taken down. One video opens with a four-page handwritten screed that begins, “I don’t expect forgiveness … I do apologize for the effects my actions will have on your lives.”
It also showed an arsenal of guns and ammunition with writing on them reading “Where Is Your God?” and “Suck On This!” Other writings, some in Russian, target President Donald Trump and wish death upon Jewish people.
Numerous law enforcement agencies were on the scene including the FBI, ATF and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office.
O’Hara said law enforcement are executing four search warrants, one at the church and three others at residences in the metro area connected to the suspect where firearms are being recovered.
“We are all working tirelessly to uncover the full scope of what happened, to try and identify a motive, why it happened, and whether there are any other further details,” O’Hara said.

Neighbors and former students said they were shaken by the shooting in the typically quiet southwestern Minneapolis neighborhood.
Jack Friedman, 25, went to the school and lives in the area. He said, “You never think that it’s going to happen at the school you went to, but then you start thinking how naïve to believe that. Because it happens everywhere.”
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, speaking at a news conference outside the school, called for action — not just thoughts and prayers, which has become a rote response to mass shootings.
“Don’t just say, this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” he said. “These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.”
Vigils are planned Wednesday night for the victims. Annunciation Church announced a prayer vigil at 7 p.m. in the Holy Angels Gym. Anti-gun violence group Moms Demand Action announced a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m. at Minneapolis Lynnhurst Park.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for Mess With Texas Project)A Maryland Democratic senator filed a bill Wednesday that would redraw the state’s congressional districts, in response to a similar effort by Texas Republican legislators who redistricted in time for the 2026 midterm elections.
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard), the sponsor of the Maryland bill, said the idea is simple: If red states want to redistrict early, with the goal of picking up additional seats in Congress, blue states should do the same.
“Hopefully, we don’t have to go down this path,” Lam said. “But I think it’s important to send that warning shot across their bows that the effort that they take could all be for naught.”
Even if they go through with it, Maryland Democrats could only pick up one seat: The solidly Republican 1st District, which sprawls over the Eastern Shore and Harford County, is the only one of the state’s eight congressional districts held by a Republican. But that did not deter Lam.
“There are ways to be able to draw a map that would make it more Democratic-leaning. It’s not easy,” Lam said. “But I think it can be done.”
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the sole GOP member of the state’s congressional delegation, warned in a statement Wednesday that any attempt to reconfigure the state’s districts could backfire on Democrats.
“If the Democrats want to roll the dice, let them roll the dice. I look forward to having more Republican colleagues from the state in Congress, and I think that’s what the result is going to be,” Harris said.
But Lam said his biggest reason for filing the bill request was to send a message to any other Republican states considering a mid-decade redistricting push that Democratic states stand ready to fight back.

Lam’s bill would revive the third of four options offered in 2021 by the state’s Legislative Redistricting Advisory Commission. Among other changes, it would tie most of the Eastern Shore in with part of Anne Arundel County in a new 1st District.
Cecil and Harford counties would be split off, with Cecil joining a new 2nd District that hugs the Chesapeake Bay in Harford and Baltimore counties and Baltimore City. The rest of Harford would join a new 3rd District bending around the city into Howard.
States typically redraw congressional and legislative boundaries every 10 years, after the decennial census. But Lam is not the first Maryland Democrat to float the idea of an early redistricting.
House Majority Leader Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery) initially floated the idea in July, before Texas acted.
In a statement Wednesday, Moon said he is “continuing to work on two proposals, including both a 50-state treaty to ban mid-decade redistricting and a plan to redistrict Maryland’s congressional districts in response to what’s going on.”
“As we can see, the Texas redistricting continues to generate interest from Maryland officials to draw new congressional maps,” Moon said.
During an appearance on “Face the Nation” Sunday, Gov. Wes Moore (D), who has the power to call a special session of the legislature, said “all options need to be on the table.”
“If the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters’ voices can actually be heard,” Moore said.
With the encouragement of President Donald Trump (R), Texas Republicans last week gave final approval to a redrawn map favoring their party, after Democrats stalled the measure by leaving the state earlier in the month. Other states are mulling similar bids. Deep-blue California will hold a special election in November to let voters decide whether the state should adopt a map designed to help Democrats pick up more seats.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lam acknowledges the procedure to redistrict would be “messy.”
For one thing, he believes the General Assembly would likely have to convene for a special session before its typical January return, in order to approve new maps in time for the February 2026 filing deadline for candidates running in the midterms.
Completing a new map during a special session would allow more time for it to potentially work its way through the courts, Lam said, since, “We highly suspect whatever is passed will be sued.”
That’s what happened after the 2020 Census, when a court challenge derailed the legislature’s original map and forced it to select another.
Lam said his proposed map is not the one shot down by the courts, but is an earlier version of that map that was proposed by the Legislative Redistricting Advisory Commission but tweaked by lawmakers.
Lam’s proposal also includes something of an olive branch for red states. It would require Maryland to redistrict using a commission independent of the legislature, which Lam considers “good governance.” But only if a mix of other states do the same: California, Texas, Illinois, New York, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
“We’re not just going to do the right thing while everyone else steps all over us,” Lam said.
He acknowledges that his proposal would “fight fire with fire,” by redistricting for political reasons, just like Texas did. But he argues the situation demands it.
“Democrats have been shy about using every single tool we have to protect our communities,” Lam said. “Republicans have not.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2228525555-newsletter-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-27 23:56:35.540927

During the meeting, lawmakers also said goodbye to DCF Commissioner Jodi Hill-Lilly, who is leaving the department for a new position at a national nonprofit.
The June audit found that children went missing from DCF care about 3,700 times from fiscal years 2021 to 2023. Over that time period, the number of incidents increased by 42%. The audit also found that DCF hadn’t followed the law in some cases and had failed to implement internal controls to make sure children stayed safe. The vast majority of the cases were teenagers, with fewer than two dozen incidences of children 12 and under running from care.
At Wednesday’s presentation, auditors also highlighted the failure by DCF to track their work on such cases, in about a third of cases failing to document why a child ran away.
The presentation was met with a combination of concern and skepticism by lawmakers from the Committee on Children and the Government Oversight Committee. Some lawmakers pushed back on auditors, questioning whether the audit put too much blame at the feet of DCF, and urged the public to consider the wider array of issues — from lack of funding from the legislature to the complexity of children’s mental health during the COVID pandemic and after.
Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said that some sections of the report read as “rather insulting” to DCF, such as a finding that the lack of assessment in cases of children missing from care “squanders an opportunity to implement strategies to prevent children from going missing from care.”
“I know through my five, six years on [the Committee on Children] that [DCF] is actively working on trying to prevent children from leaving, these are children with high acuity care needs,” Welander said.
Rep. Lucy Dathan, D-New Canaan, asked auditors if there was evidence in the report that DCF was not the following law, or whether the flaws auditors found were merely operational.
Auditor Scott Simoneau, one of the co-authors of the audit, responded that the gaps in tracking information by DCF made it impossible to verify whether the agency was or wasn’t in compliance in many instances. He said that in some cases it was clear that DCF was not following the law, specifically the failure to universally screen children for sex trafficking after they return from being missing from care. In fact, the audit found that in 94% of the cases auditors examined closely, DCF didn’t document whether they screened children for sex trafficking after they’d been returned to care.
“In general if you’re not measuring, you’re not managing well,” Simoneau said. He said that DCF should have a plan of action for identifying children who have been sex trafficked and then a plan for helping them in the aftermath. 
Hill-Lilly spoke to the lawmakers in what she said would be her last appearance before a Connecticut legislative committee, on the eve of her retirement from the agency.
Hill-Lilly pointed out that there are differences in the categories of children who go missing from care. The vast majority are children who leave a placement and are not truly “missing,” rather their whereabouts are known to the department. Many times they leave a placement and go to a former home or to stay with a friend. Hill-Lilly said that 70% of children who went missing from care were gone for a day or less.
“It’s important to state that while documentation could have certainly been better maintained, and the policy and practice guide update provides clear guidance on that, follow-up with children missing from care, especially for longer periods and who might be subject to trafficking, has always occurred,” Hill-Lilly told lawmakers. 
The outgoing commissioner also said that DCF facilities are all unlocked and staff do not have the right to physically restrain children in order to keep them from leaving.
Hill-Lilly acknowledged that DCF has had an “unsophisticated data system” that the agency is currently replacing.
Part of Wednesday’s discussion centered on the issue of children with significant behavioral health issues who may be going through an acute issue but didn’t meet the criteria for an in-patient hospitalization, “yet residential programs reported that they couldn’t adequately treat them either because the service level was too low,” Simoneau said. “So these gaps meant that children cycled through temporary and even unsafe settings while racking up hundreds of episodes.”
“Once we’ve filled in some of these gaps of some of these services, I hope you’ll see less running away,” Hill-Lilly said. “There is no question about whether or not we need different level of service array to address children’s behavior, which is why we’re standing up these services.” 
Dr. Frank Gregory, DCF’s administrator of children’s behavioral health community services, also testified, saying that children often run away because they’ve been told they are expendable, and running away can be a form of despair or protest. He said more resources were needed to prevent children from wanting to run away in the first place. 
“Do we have the resources for how this young person and their family got there?” Gregory said. “What are we running short of?” 
Hill-Lilly also offered some words of what needs to happen next as a “parting gift,” as she leaves her role as leader of the agency after 37 years of service at DCF. 
“I urge you to approach this challenge of children missing from care, not solely as a DCF issue, but one that reflects broader systemic realities,” Hill-Lilly said. 
The shadow pandemic, Hill-Lilly said, is a phenomenon of unresolved trauma among the state’s youth that is resulting in mental health, substance abuse issues and developmental disorders. “These complex needs are surfacing in ways that no single system alone can resolve.” She urged collaboration as federal shifts in funding threaten to impact children in the care of DCF.
Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, co-chair of the Committee on Children, was among several legislators who took the opportunity to thank Hill-Lilly for her work at DCF. He said her departure from the department, as someone who had worked her way up from the bottom of the agency to become its leader, was a huge loss for the state. Paris also requested that Hill-Lilly provide recommendations and next steps for the next commissioner, including what she considers to be the agency’s successes as well as its biggest pitfalls.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3936-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-27 21:56:55.523678

The investigation “has found evidence that indicates some data has been exfiltrated, or moved outside of our state network, by the malicious actors,” said Tim Galluzi, the executive director of the Governor’s Technology Office.
“At this stage of our intensive investigation, we cannot yet identify or classify the specific nature of this data,” Galluzi said, adding “speculation on what data was affected before we have definitive proof would be irresponsible.”
The FBI is “continuing to collect intelligence,” said Nathaniel Holland, FBI assistant special agent in charge. Holland also urged anyone with tips to contact the FBI tip line. 
Galluzi, Holland, and other state and federal officials repeatedly declined to answer multiple questions about the scope or type of data that had been extracted, the characteristics of the cyber attack, or the status or nature of the investigation into it.
Also unanswered at the briefing: why the governor wasn’t there.
Lombardo “is getting regularly, hourly updates from his staff,” said Ryan Cherry, his chief of staff. “He is engaged in providing direction on this. He was just unable to participate in this press conference,” Cherry said.
“And to be clear,” Cherry added, “his absence in this press conference is not indicative of any lack of engagement at all. That is not the case. We are making sure that he is up to speed and he is providing guidance to us on what he would like to see done in terms of addressing the customer-facing services that Nevadans so desperately need on a daily basis that are impacted by this event.”
Several state officials provided assurances regarding those services. 
For instance, “DETR is up and running and serving Nevadans,” said Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation director  Christopher Sewell. “Claims are being processed and clients are getting paid.”
The governor’s finance office assured state employees that they “will receive their scheduled pay this Friday, without disruption.”
The Nevada Health Authority provided a statement assuring Nevadans that “existing Medicaid coverage and provider payments remain operational and secure,” and neither access to care nor Nevada Health Link, the state’s health insurance marketplace, had been affected.
Officials said a website providing updates and information on the impacts of the attack and the status of state services is being created.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/statebldgdoublecropped-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-08-27 21:56:55.523678

Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse said Reed, 86, had worked more than 80 consecutive elections and had “never missed an election,” including during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We’re where the tire meets the road,” Reed said. “We’re out in the field. We are at the elections. If we did not have good people to run the elections … we would not be here today.”
The state’s top election official, Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen, said he and Reed were among the only attendees Wednesday who remember John F. Kennedy’s win in 1960.
“One of the signal attributes of elections in the State of Nebraska is how secure and accurate they are, and that is a tribute to election workers in all 93 counties,” Evnen said.
For the 2024 presidential election, Reed was one of about 3,000 poll workers in Nebraska’s most populous county. He worked as a runner, driving supplies to some of 233 local polling places. 
Reed worked for 45 years at the Metropolitan Utilities District, Omaha’s natural gas and water utility. Family joined him Wednesday, including a daughter who flew in from Boston.
Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Wayne Bena elicited a smile from Reed by sharing that Gov. Jim Pillen had appointed him an admiral in the fictitious Nebraska Navy.

Evnen handed Reed an award from the National Association of Secretaries of State — its NASS Medallion Award for outstanding service in the mission of the group, including elections.
Bena, a former Sarpy County election commissioner, joined his boss Evnen in using the attention on Reed to recruit new poll workers by joking that Reed was welcome to cross “the train tracks” of Harrison Street and volunteer for Sarpy elections.
State and local election officials have been asking more people to sign up as poll workers at their county election or clerk’s offices as a reliable group of retirees ages out of the job.
Bena and Evnen joined county officials in also thanking the 21 poll workers headed to the county Hall of Fame for their election work, where each joined Reed, a 2010 inductee.
Kruse, grinning at Wayne, said he looked forward to having Reed working Douglas County elections in 2026 and beyond. Reed, Kruse said, is right where he belongs, making elections better.

Mary Gay Scanlon (D-5th District) said she was denied entry to the largest immigration detention center in the northeast on Wednesday.
The privately operated Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Clearfield County was the subject of a high-profile complaint by civil rights advocates last year. Scanlon told the Capital-Star she has heard concerns about constituents from her suburban Philadelphia being held in the center under poor conditions including inadequate medical and mental health care.
“We’ve had reports about folks being unable to get adequate food. Either they were going hungry or they were … forced to purchase their own food from the commissary,” Scanlon said.
Despite a provision in a 2024 federal appropriations bill giving members of congress the authority to make unannounced oversight visits, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials refused her request to enter the facility.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“They said they would not be letting me in specifically to do the oversight visit, because they were under orders not to do so by the secretary of DHS Krisi Noem,” Scanlon said. “And they repeatedly said they were aware of the fact that there is a federal law.”
Scanlon is the second member of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation to be turned away by officials at Moshannon Valley this week. On Monday, U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-12th District) was denied entry to the center to conduct oversight after the death earlier this month of a Chinese national being held there. 
Lee said in a statement Monday her denied entry into Moshannon Valley is an example of the Trump administration’s executive overreach.
“With numerous allegations of human rights abuses, our communities deserve to know how people are being treated inside these taxpayer-funded facilities,” Lee said. “Transparency and accountability are non-negotiables in a democracy, and ICE cannot be allowed to operate in the shadows.”
Similar scenes have played out at detention centers elsewhere in the nation in recent months. Notably, Democratic New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver and other lawmakers were involved in a confrontation with federal officials outside a recently reopened facility in Newark in May.  
McIver was later indicted on three counts of “assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering” with federal officers, which she has said are politically motivated.

Moshannon Valley, which Scanlon said has recently housed between 1,200 and 1,700 people, is a former federal prison operated on behalf of ICE by private prison operator GEO Group. The company operates 97 facilities, including the one in Newark where McIver was denied entry.
GEO Group’s contract is with Clearfield County, which provides the space to ICE in an arrangement that circumvents a Biden-era ban on for-profit prisons.
Scanlon said the complaint the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Legal Services of New Jersey and the University of Pennsylvania law school filed with the Department of Homeland Security has not been resolved. That’s in part, she claimed, because the Trump administration gutted the DHS Office of Civil Rights that was handling it. 
The Sheller Center for Social Justice at Temple University Beasley School of Law and the immigrant rights group Juntos also released a report last year based on interviews with 70 people held at Moshannon Valley. 
It called for the center to be closed, alleging immigrants and asylum seekers are subject to physical and psychological abuse, lack adequate access to health care, and face retaliation for standing up against mistreatment.
“There are problems that we’re hearing about from a variety of sources, and that’s why we need to be able to get in there and see what the situation is,” Scanlon said.
Scanlon said federal immigration officials have historically been willing to work with members of Congress and advocates to address concerns about conditions in immigration facilities. With the Trump administration’s “rampant ramp up” of deportation and the Republican budget reconciliation bill adding $45 billion to ICE’s budget, Congressional oversight is more important than ever, she said. 
“What we’re seeing now is, first of all, a total lack of transparency,” Scanlon said, noting that families, their lawyers and advocates are having difficulty locating people within the immigration system. “There’s a whole host of issues which, if you have transparency, you can then begin to address all of this,” she said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_8034-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-27 20:57:06.154044

(Photo by Austin Fisher/Source New Mexico)U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer is making a visit to Cranston Thursday afternoon as part of her “America at Work” listening tour, Rhode Island Current has learned.
Cpt. Ryan Tellier, a member of the Cranston firefighters union’s executive board, confirmed that Chavez-DeRemer is scheduled to visit the Pontiac Avenue station around 1 p.m. to have lunch with firefighters, tour the station, and observe a hazmat training class.
Her stop is expected to last about 90 minutes, Tellier said.
“Here at the union in Cranston we work hard to make sure we have close relations with our representatives in Washington,” Tellier said. “We’re fortunate to have the secretary come down and spend the afternoon with us.”
Chavez-DeRemer’s visit to Rhode Island comes less than a week after the Trump administration issued a stop work order on Revolution Wind, the state’s first large-scale offshore wind project. The Aug. 22 order issued by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy has left an estimated 1,000 unionized workers involved in the multibillion dollar offshore wind farm in limbo. The project is 80% complete, with 45 of 65 turbines already in the water off Block Island’s coastline. 
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who joined the rest of the state’s congressional delegation in deriding the Trump administration’s move to halt Revolution Wind at a press event Monday at Quonset Point, saw irony in the timing of Chavez-DeRemer’s scheduled visit in a post on X.

.@SecretaryLCD is headed to the Ocean State, likely to spout talking points about how Trump is “putting workers first.”
She should try telling that to the thousands of union workers who Trump just fired through his stop-work order on a nearly complete wind farm in Rhode Island.

Texas passed a landmark law in June 2025, supported by former Gov. Rick Perry, that allocates US$50 million to support research on ibogaine, one of the most powerful psychedelics, for treating opioid addiction and treatment-resistant PTSD.
Arizona passed a similar law in May, funding research on ibogaine’s effectiveness for treating veterans and those with traumatic brain injuries.
These laws come on the heels of states such as Oregon, Colorado, Kentucky and Georgia legalizing ketamine – a psychedelic that has been used in emergency rooms as anesthesia – for therapeutic purposes in the past two years.
Psychedelics, broadly defined, are a class of psychoactive substances that alter perception, cognition and mood through their interaction with neurotransmitters such as serotonin.
As a medical anthropologist I have spent the past 25 years studying the rise of alternative approaches to mental health treatments and have specifically focused in the past four years on the impact of psychedelics on consciousness and spirituality.
The push to legalize psychedelics in America is not new. What distinguishes the latest round of advocacy, however, is its backing by a holy trinity of supporters: some scientists, politicians and clergy.
Several religious groups have historically used psychedelics for sacred healing. Some clergy who have been exposed to these medicines in the past few years are advocating their use for gaining mystical insights.
What does the science say?
There are several kinds of psychedelics. Classic psychedelics include compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD; psilocybin – the active component in “magic mushrooms”; and mescaline, which is derived from peyote and San Pedro cacti. Another psychedelic is N,N-dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, found in ayahuasca and other plants.
Beyond the “classic” category, other psychoactive compounds sometimes grouped with psychedelics include substances such as MDMA, a class of psychoactive drugs that can induce feelings of love, empathy and connectedness with others. A 2021 study on MDMA showed a 67% reduction of PTSD symptoms after three sessions of MDMA therapy. While the study had a limited sample size of 104, it marked a turning point in how the psychologists understood MDMA as a potential healing modality.
Dissociative agents such as ketamine, which can produce altered states of consciousness, are also included as a category of their own. Traditionally used as a medical anesthetic, ketamine has more recently gained attention for mental health treatment, particularly for its antidepressant effects.
Derived from the iboga plant native to West Africa, ibogaine induces powerful visions and dreams. It has a long history of being used by traditional healers in villages throughout Africa to treat mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. A 2022 National Institutes of Health review of 24 studies showed that ibogaine significantly reduced depression, PTSD and opioid addiction in at least two-thirds of the 743 study participants. This mirrors the scientific evidence provided in the 2024 Stanford brain study, which showed an 88% decrease in PTSD symptoms following use of ibogaine in 30 military veterans.
Clergy and psychedelics
Several mental health practitioners and scientists have been staunch advocates of psychedelic-assisted therapy based on this research. What is somewhat new, however, is the addition of a handful of high-profile clergy to the list of supporters.
A recent study published by New York University and Johns Hopkins University highlights a number of religious practitioners, ranging from Episcopal ministers to Catholic priests, rabbis and Zen monks: 24 of the 29 participants made the case that psychedelics can lead to profound spiritual experiences.
A May 2025 article in The New Yorker noted that several of the clergy who participated in the NYU/Johns Hopkins study went on to become vocal advocates of psychedelics as spiritual medicine. While the sample size was small and heavily composed of Christian religious leaders, the findings are noteworthy. Some 96% of study participants described the use of psychedelics as one of the top five “most spiritually significant experiences of their lives.”
An NIH study conducted in 2019 focused on spiritual encounters experienced through DMT, or N,N-dimethyltryptamine. The study revealed that 75% of the 42 participants reported an “intense mystical encounter” and believed that it brought them closer to the divine. They narrated the experience as one in which they saw flashes of white light, heard angelic sounds, felt tingling in their bodies and had an overall sensation of God’s love.
A ‘chairlift to God’
Leaders and members of churches that use psychedelics as “sacrament” describe the role of these substances as facilitating a deeper connection with the divine. The psychedelics are offered at the beginning of weekly services by the religious leader, and then the congregants move into singing, chanting or prayer. Several leaders of such churches whom I have interviewed have described the role of the psychedelics as facilitating a deeper focus on God for longer periods of time.
The Native American Church, which is considered the largest Indigenous church in America and is located throughout the Southwest, has been legally using peyote, a hallucinogen, for services since the 1990s.
The 1994 American Indian Religious Freedom Act allows Native American churches to use and transport peyote, even though it is a Schedule 1 substance, meaning that its use is technically illegal outside of special circumstances as provided by exemptions to the law. Congregants in the church note that they have been using natural plants like peyote for as long as they can remember – even before it was officially legal.
More recently there have been a series of churches opening up across the U.S. that use ayahuasca as their sacrament.
In May 2025, the Gaia Church in Spokane, Washington, became one of the first churches in America to receive the Drug Enforcement Administration exemption for the use of ayahuasca in religious ceremonies. The DEA exemption makes the use of the substances completely legal for all members of the church as long as it is taken as a sacrament and provided by the spiritual leaders.
One shaman who runs an ayahuasca-focused church in Hawaii whom I interviewed last year described psychedelics as a “chairlift to God” because of the numbers of people in his congregation who report seeing, feeling, glimpsing or sensing God after drinking ayahuasca.
“There is no doubt that psychedelics can induce profound spiritual experiences,” one priest who has become a psilocybin advocate told me. “If this is what can bring people back together and back to the church, then harmonizing the ways of the ancients with plant medicines, modern technologies and religion might be the way to heal societal ills.”
Proceeding with caution
Although most classic psychedelics are considered safe and nonaddictive, they also carry some risks. Psychedelic use can induce acute anxiety, cause panic attacks or lead to paranoia. In rare cases, they could lead to psychotic breakdowns and suicidal thoughts, particularly among individuals with a personal or family history of schizophrenia or other severe mental illnesses.
Psychedelics can also temporarily impair judgment and coordination, which may increase the risk of accidents or unsafe behaviors if taken in recreational settings. Risks can also be amplified by uncertain dosage, adulterated substances and the absence of certified and trained facilitators.
Most mental health practitioners and advocates of these medicines suggest that they be taken under the care of medical or spiritual professionals who have trained in administering and facilitating preparation and aftercare for psychedelic use.
Shamans and Indigenous practitioners have long regarded these substances as sacred medicines and used them for healing. Modern-day science is confirming some of their benefits in supporting future treatments of trauma and addiction. Moreover, the mystical experiences that these medicines offer as pathways to connect people to the divine are profound.

Spencer Cox speaks at the launch of the Nucleus Institute on Aug. 27, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)State officials and higher education leaders have launched the Nucleus Institute, an organization they hope to see become a crucial tool for Utah innovators to compete at a global level, finding solutions for emerging energy needs and developing technologies like artificial intelligence.
The organization stems from a law passed in the 2025 legislative session that restructured the Utah Innovation Lab and created the institute as “an independent, nonprofit, quasi-public corporation.” The goal is to connect higher education, industry and government to make ideas become reality. 
With the institute, researchers and entrepreneurs can search for solutions to early-stage funding challenges, moving forward from concept to market, or finding spaces to collaborate.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said during the launch on Wednesday the institute will help make Utahns’ lives easier by finding solutions to keep energy prices low, decarbonizing the atmosphere and other challenges the country faces.
“We are never going to regulate our way out of the most difficult problems that we’re facing as a country,” Cox said. “We can only innovate, and the state does play a role in that, and so does higher ed, but especially the private sector.”
The institute is expected to collaborate with different innovation campuses across the state, including those in authorities like the Point of the Mountain and the Inland Port, but also other innovation labs in public universities.
And with the help of those partnerships, Cox said, this and future generations of Utahns will be able to build their innovation skills in a thriving environment.
“It is all about passing that knowledge of innovation, those skills that are so necessary to compete on a global scale, and passing them on to the next generation,” Cox said. “It’s about investing in companies that are going to solve those wicked problems that we’re facing right now as a country. We know that the solutions are out there. We just need to discover them.” 
In a way, the new organization is a response to the unprecedented speed of change in different technologies, said Jefferson Moss, director of the Utah Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity, and now, also leader of the Nucleus Institute.

“We led the nation on AI. We led the nation on data privacy. We’re leading the nation on energy. We can do that because we have people in the government that actually get along and want to get stuff done,” Moss said. “And then you take that and combine it with both the great things we’re doing in education.”
President of the University of Utah, Taylor Randall said he was excited to be part of the initiative since the state’s flagship university dedicates almost $800 million a year in research, including important medical advancements like the first artificial heart implant for a human. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“But that research is no good if it stays in the lab,” Randall said. Nucleus, he added, is a way to step on the gas to incorporate those types of discoveries into people’s lives.
The Legislature allocated $555,400 from the Income Tax Fund for compensation and benefits for the institute board’s executive director, for the compensation of the chair of the innovation fund, and an annual contracted audit during years 2026 and 2027, according to the bill’s fiscal note. 
Senate Majority Leader, Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, who sponsored the legislation in the Senate, said that while the institute is expected to collaborate with for-profit industries, it’s still a nonprofit structure.
“The goal is to boost the economy in Utah, to boost the workforce in Utah, to boost innovation and commercialization of that innovation here,” Cullimore said. “So it’s not really a business idea, and it’s government-esque, but playing in that more innovation and entrepreneurial space to kind of help facilitate all these things.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, parent agency of the U.S. Forest Service, announced Wednesday that it is moving ahead with plans to rescind a rule that has restricted logging and construction on millions of acres of federal lands in the American West for more than two decades.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a written statement that the agency intends to open public comments Friday on its proposal to end the so-called “Roadless Rule,” an act that will affect as much as 45 million acres of federal land as well as millions of Americans who live near it.
Opening a public comment period is the first step in repealing the rule. According to Rollins’ statement, members of the public will have until Sept. 19 to offer their opinions on the repeal, a timeframe that opponents of the plan denounced as inadequate.
Roads are a key prerequisite for large-scale logging and mining projects, and the rule — enacted in 2001 at the end of the Clinton administration — has limited the number of development projects on Forest Service land.
Rollins’ announcement was expected. She had announced the Trump administration’s intent at a conference of western governors in June. The first Trump administration also attempted to eliminate the Roadless Rule, but that move was halted by lawsuits, and the Biden administration dropped the effort.
In Wednesday’s announcement, Rollins said rescinding the roadless rule would allow local land managers to make decisions on development and logging.
“It is vital that we properly manage our federal lands to create healthy, resilient, and productive forests for generations to come. We look forward to hearing directly from the people and communities we serve as we work together to implement productive and commonsense policy for forest land management,” she said.
Tree thinning could also reduce wildfire risks, she suggested.
Environmental groups, already prepared for Rollins’ announcement, were quick to denounce it as harmful and out of touch.
“America’s national forests give us clean air, water, wildlife, and the freedom for all to enjoy the outdoors,” said Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society, in a prepared statement, “but now they are the latest target in this administration’s unpopular push to give away our lands to drill, mine, and log. Gutting the Roadless Rule — which has protected our forests for 25 years — would be the single largest rollback of conservation protections in our nation’s history.”
The Roadless Rule has been the subject of lawsuits for decades, and forests in Colorado and Idaho have already been exempted from it under state-specific guidelines.
Ninety-six percent of the Forest Service’s inventoried roadless areas are located in 12 western states, and no state is more affected than Alaska, which has almost a third of the 45 million acres affected by the pending change.
Alaska is home to the Tongass National Forest, a West Virginia-sized stretch of islands and waterways in the Southeast Alaska panhandle that make up the largest surviving temperate rainforest in the world.
Until the 1980s, the area was also home to a vast logging program and pulp wood mills that employed thousands of people.
“Across Southeast Alaska, we see the irreparable damage from so many decades of unsustainable clear-cut logging in the scarred landscapes and decimated fish and wildlife habitats — we cannot and will not go back to that, and we know that’s what public comment will show once again,” said Maggie Rabb, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, in a statement released Wednesday.
Some Alaska Native tribes in the region support keeping the rule in place, as do some tourism businesses.
“Rescinding the Roadless Rule will devastate our community just as we are beginning to heal from clear-cut logging of the past. It’s clear the people making these decisions in Washington, D.C., don’t care about how it will harm those of us who live here and have lived here for thousands of years,” said President Joel Jackson of the Organized Village of Kake, which has repeatedly intervened in lawsuits seeking to defend the rule. 
“We are the people of the forest and salmon people — our lives and our voices should count — this process makes it clear they won’t,” Jackson said.
Repealing the Roadless Rule also has powerful support in the region. Local electric utilities have advocated a repeal in order to ease the construction of clean hydroelectric power plants. The Alaska Forest Association, representing the logging industry, supports it, as do mining proponents.
Ten members of the U.S. House’s Committee on Natural Resources were in Anchorage on Wednesday as part of a weeklong tour of the state.
U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, said he believes the Roadless Rule “has really handicapped us in a number of areas,” including in firefighting.
In July, a wildfire swept through parts of Grand Canyon National Park, destroying a historic lodge and dozens of other structures.
Gosar said he believes the federal government needs to take a new approach on federal land in order to thin trees and reduce wildfire risks.
In Utah, which has 4 million acres of inventoried roadless land, Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy said she frequently hears from constituents upset about restrictions on the public use of federal land and supports the repeal.
“One of the complaints my constituents have frequently is that the federal government manages a lot of our resources but isn’t always great at listening to the people who live among the resources. … This Roadless Rule decision is a direct result of complaints from people who live with the Roadless Rule and the unintended consequences it’s having on economies and on resources,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle is a Democrat from Oregon also traveling with the committee. Her state has almost 2 million acres of inventoried roadless area, much of it in her district, but she said she would like to see a more balanced approach than the one being offered by the Trump administration.
“We have to protect our federal lands. We have to make sure that the public has access to our public land, and we have to make sure that we aren’t just wholesale taking out the protections that we worked really, really hard for, because we owe it to the people of this country to protect those lands that truly are theirs,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, is the top Democratic member of the resources committee, and wasn’t on the trip to Alaska.
In an emailed statement, he said Rollins “is steamrolling ahead with Trump’s plan to deliver America’s last wild forests to corporate polluters.”
“Democrats will fight this reckless scheme and stand with Tribes, hunters, anglers, and families who rely on these forests — not corporations looking to cash in,” he said.

The letter and guidance was reissued in the wake of the University of Michigan announcing Monday that it would end gender-affirming care after the U.S. Department of Justice issued a subpoena as part of a criminal and civil investigation into the practice.
Many saw the move from U of M as bowing to pressure from the administration of President Donald Trump.
Nessel’s office noted that Trump has, since taking office, made steps to limit health care options for transgender minors, including through executive orders to halt care, threatening federal funding and subpoenaing health care facilities and providers under the guise of investigating health care practices.
Nessel wrote that the availability of federal funding has no bearing on Michigander’s right to seek and receive services without discrimination. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Moreover, access to federal funds does not relieve Michigan healthcare facilities and providers of the obligation to comply with Michigan laws, including those that prohibit discrimination against individuals based on their membership in a protected class, such as religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity or expression, or marital status,” Nessel wrote. “Refusing healthcare services to a class of individuals based on their protected status, such as withholding the availability of services from transgender individuals based on their gender identity or their diagnosis of gender dysphoria, while offering such services to cisgender individuals, may constitute discrimination under Michigan law.”
Nessel called the U of M decision “shameful, dangerous, and potentially illegal.”
“This cowardly acquiescence to political pressure from this president and his administration is not what patients have come to expect from an institution that has labeled itself, ‘the leaders and the best,’ and my department will be considering all of our options if they violate Michigan law,” Nessel said in a statement. “This administration draws most of its power from the willingness of its targets to capitulate without a fight, abandoning their own principles and interests, and throwing disfavored populations under the bus.”
Nessel said that despite repeated successful legal challenges to actions by the Trump administration, the university has chosen instead “to sacrifice the health, well-being, and likely the very lives of Michigan children, to protect itself from the ire of an administration who, oftentimes, engages in unlawful actions itself.”
In a statement, Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, expressed deep gratitude for Nessel and her “unequivocal condemnation” of U of M’s decision.
“We are heartened to see the Attorney General so clearly affirm that discrimination has no place in Michigan’s healthcare system, and that denying medically necessary care to transgender young people is not only wrong – it may also be unlawful,” Knott said. “Her words provide reassurance to trans young people, their families, and the broader LGBTQ+ community that they are not alone, and that Michigan’s laws remain a shield against discrimination.”
Progress Michigan called U of M’s move a cave to Trump and a let down to patients in need.
“Patients across the state, trans youth included, rely on health care providers in the Michigan Medicine network,” Sam Inglot, executive director of Progress Michigan, said in a statement. “Serving those patients should always be the priority – but instead, management has caved to threats from the Trump administration and opted to stop offering safe, effective treatments that their patients need. This is another devastating blow to young trans folks who are already facing numerous attacks on their rights, their safety, and their ability to live authentically.”
Inglot said ceding ground in the hope of being spared from future attacks “has never been an effective way to fight fascism, and this case is no different.”
“The way we prevent that slow creep is by fighting back constantly and consistently and ensuring that not a single inch they gain toward achieving their backward, dystopian agenda comes easily. They are coming for health care today and they will be coming after even more in the days ahead,” Inglot said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2762-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-27 20:57:06.154044

The federal money for high-speed internet coverage is expected to expand to another 71,975 locations across the state. Department of Administration director Misty Ann Giles, a member of the council, said 32 grant applications had been selected. 
Federal rules changed for the program, which led to something of a scramble, committee members said Monday. Those changes included prioritizing “speed and scalability,” said Rep. Ed Buttrey, who leads the committee. He added that the changes also put less emphasis on what type of internet connection — fiber optic or satellite — grant applicants model their business around.
“We were given an unbelievable short period of 90 days to open up the application process again, and to do our work and determine the awards,” Buttrey told the committee on Monday. “Personally, I was a skeptic that we could pull this off in 90 days. It appears, with actions that I hope we take today, that we will have accomplished that task. And that’s no small task.”
The approval process requires Gov. Greg Gianforte to sign off on the use of funds. At a Monday event in Boulder he expressed optimism around the broadband efforts.
The state has received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for better internet and divided out some money it had received through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, which is more commonly referred to as “BEAD.” 
Montana is receiving about $148 million in matching funds by companies doing the work, Giles said. The state has about $557 million in BEAD funding, which is the source of the money approved by the commission on Monday.
Importantly, not all of the BEAD money is going to fiber-optic companies. In fact, a significant chunk of the investment will be going to companies that provide satellite internet services, including Amazon and StarLink.
A little more than 16% of the funding is going to what’s called “non-geostationary satellite” internet, which will cover about 65% of the new locations that will be serviced. Those locations are referred to as “Broadband Serviceable Location” or BSLs, which essentially means an address that can get high-speed internet. Amazon alone applied for about 40,000 BSL’s, Giles told the committee.
StarLink could get around $33 million in BEAD funding from Montana, while that number is about $16 million for Amazon. 
Giles also provided a thorough breakdown of every application that has been approved by ConnectMT during the meeting. Fiber optic companies include Blackfoot Communications, which is getting around $26 million in BEAD funding, and a number of “Community Anchor Institutions” which are places like libraries. 
Charter Spectrum will receive about $26 million for 2,400 connections, Giles said.
Some companies, including Blackfoot and Ziply Fiber, which also received approval on some of its work, have recently had trouble completing projects. Blackfoot had to narrow its projects, saying in a a letter to the FCC earlier this year that it was hoping to apply and receive BEAD funding, which it did.
Giles said that some companies “bit off more than they could chew” on Monday, and said that not every company got everything they asked for.
“They’re still getting a good chunk of change and some great projects,” Giles told the committee. 
About $600 million has been invested into Montana’s broadband infrastructure since 2020, according to the Department of Administration. Some of that includes active construction projects, Giles said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-161098250-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 20:57:06.154044

NORWICH — Last week, Nancy LeSourd was gardening at her home on Beaver Meadow Road in Norwich Village when a yellow jacket stung her. LeSourd, 81, found herself going into anaphylactic shock. Avoiding calling an ambulance in fear of the bill, she tried neighbors and the community nurse, but no one picked-up.
“I staggered up to Dan & Whit’s,” she said. “I just wanted to be around people. I walked it off for an-hour-and-a-half at Dan & Whit’s.”
On Friday evening, LeSourd, along with a few hundred others, gathered at the Norwich Historical Society for the opening of the exhibit “Dan & Whit’s at 70: Photographs & Memories.” Later, community members made their way up to the general store to celebrate its 70th anniversary. As LeSourd’s experience suggests, all those years of history add up to something more than an ordinary relationship between a store and its customers.
“Dan & Whit’s is family,” Sarah Rooker, the director of the historical society said at the event. “It provides a feeling of belonging.”
Previously Merrill’s, the building Dan & Whit’s is in has been a general store for close to 200 years, Rooker said.
Neighbors Dan Fraser and Whit Hicks began operating the store together in 1955. Hicks retired in 1972 and Fraser purchased the property. The store has been in the Fraser family ever since and about 20 Frasers from four different generations have worked there over the decades.
Nancy LeSourd talks with store owner George Fraser during a 70th birthday celebration for Dan & Whit’s on Friday, Aug. 22.

“My whole family worked there. My mom, dad, siblings, their kids, my kids,” Jane Britton, Dan Fraser’s daughter said.
Britton worked at the store on and off when she was a teenager and then full-time when she moved back to Norwich in 1988. She’s since retired but still lives in Norwich and goes to the store a couple times a week, she said.
“Of course there was drama, and fun, and no secrets,” she said about working with family. “If one of my kids cut a class their teacher would come in and say ‘by the way your son wasn’t in my class today.’ The kids realized they couldn’t get away with anything pretty quickly.”
Britton’s brother George Fraser is currently one of the owners of the store, along with his son Matt Fraser.

“I feel very fortunate that the community has supported the store for so long,” George Fraser, 83, said.
George Fraser ran the store with his brother Howard “Jack” Fraser for decades. (Jack Fraser died in 2019.) He recalled a time when a young employee said he couldn’t make it to work due to snowy weather.
“I said I’ll be there in 10 minutes to pick you up,” George Fraser said. “He was like ‘OK, OK I’m coming in’.”
Matt Fraser is the only one in the family who now works at the store full-time.

“It’s not so much me carrying on, but me doing what I’ve always done,” Matt Fraser said.
Matt Fraser, who’s now in his 50s, started working at the store part-time when he was “old enough,” he said. Fraser helps with grocery, dairy and his favorite: firewood. His least favorite part of working at the store is “dealing with people,” he said. To commemorate the store’s long history, the historical society curated an exhibit with both photos, information and quotes about the store’s past and the present.
As he walked through the historical society, Lebanon resident Daniel Moore took in a room of photographs of the store in its current state taken by Norwich resident Kay McCabe. Moore, who grew up in Norwich, started working at Dan & Whit’s in 1972 when he was 15. “All the people were so good,” he said.

Over the six-or-so years he worked there, Moore remembers staying open until noon on Christmas and Thanksgiving so residents could make last minute purchases. 
At the invitation of the historical society, U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, a longtime Upper Valley resident, gave a speech at the event. Welch spoke about stopping in at Dan & Whit’s when he worked at a law firm in the area and then later while on the campaign trail.
“When I first started in politics, I had to come to general stores to try to meet folks, and you and Jack were there, and you had to kind of keep an eye on me, because I was a little bit liberal,” Welch said to George Fraser who sat in the front row of the crowd and chuckled.
“A lot of us are dismayed about what’s going on in the country, but all of us believe deep down, in our soul that what we can do, and what we should aspire to do is build a community, to build that community where we live,” Welch said. “…This gift that the Fraser family has given to the town of Norwich, to each of us, is so vital to the well being of our community.”
Name tags from Dan & Whit’s are part of the exhibit on the store at the Norwich Historical Society in Norwich. The grand opening of the Dan & Whit’s exhibit was held on Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in conjunction with a 70th birthday party at the store. Photo by Jennifer Hauck/Valley News
At 6 p.m., community members began making the short walk up Main Street to Dan & Whit’s for live music, raffles and free pizza and ice cream.
Approximately 40 current and former employees of all ages gathered in front of the store for a photo.
“The team is phenomenal,” Matt Fraser said. The store struggled to find employees during the coronavirus pandemic but community members volunteered their time to keep it open.
Now, though, “things have been clicking. Everything’s been working in our favor,” Matt Fraser said.
“Dan & Whit’s at 70: Photographs & Memories” is on view at the Norwich Historical Society and Community Center through Dec. 31.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Louisiana is calling on the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in a case that could toss out the state’s congressional boundaries and limit the extent race can be considered in the redistricting process nationwide. 
The state filed a brief Wednesday in response to the high court’s request that parties to Louisiana v. Callais, a lawsuit that non-Black voters filed over a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House, address whether the legislature’s creation of that district violated the 14th 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race.   
If the justices determine Louisiana violated the Constitution, it could undermine the Voting Rights Act. The legislation was approved in 1965 to bolster protections granted in the 14th and 15th amendments. It has been amended five times since then to strengthen its provisions, though voting rights advocates note federal court rulings over the past decade have chipped away at the law.
The state reluctantly drew a second majority Black district in 2024 in response to a federal judge ruling the state violated the Voting Rights Act with its 2022 map, which kept a single Black-majority district among Louisiana’s six U.S. House seats. Attorney General Liz Murrill, who previously defended the second Black district,now argues that adding another Black district was unconstitutional. 
“I am grateful that the Court has now asked the parties to brief whether this entire system is constitutional. My answer: it is not,” Murrill said in a news release Wednesday. “Our Constitution sees neither black voters nor white voters; it sees only American voters.” 
The justices’ new questions in the case came after the court made the rare move of punting their decision and scheduling additional arguments for Oct. 15. Murrill’s response to the court has ended state Republican leaders’ strange bedfellowship with Black voters who challenged the 2022 version of the congressional district map. Both supported the 2024 map, but their alliance came to an end once Black voters filed their own brief defending the constitutionality of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
“[Section 2] remains an appropriate and rational means of enforcing the Reconstruction Amendments,” lawyers for the Black voters wrote in their brief. 
In a separate redistricting case, the state has already argued that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional. In Nairne v. Louisiana, Black voters challenged the constitutionality of state legislative maps that did not increase the number of majority Black districts to correspond with an increase in the share of Black residents in the state, 
The Supreme Court’s decision in the Callais case could set the standard for the degree to which race can be considered during the election map-drawing process that must occur after each decennial census. 
White voters in the Callais case who have challenged Louisiana’s current congressional districts have until Sept. 17 to respond to the briefs.

(Photo: Greg Childress)Orange County residents displaced by Tropical Storm Chantal got a reprieve Tuesday when county commissioners put up $20,000 to extend their stays at local hotels.
Funding for was due to run out Friday but commissioners agreed to take $20,000 from the county’s Social Justice Reserve Fund to extend hotel stays.
The money will be administered by the Orange County Department of Social Services. It may also be used to help residents pay for expenses such as rental application fees, security deposits and essential household items.
Commissioners could add more money to the pot if needed. That will be determined after a committee overseeing community donations totaling $83,500 meets on Thursday to decide how to spend that money.
“Then we’ll meet again on Sept. 4 and we’ll have an update by then in case we need to move more money,” said County Commissioner Chairwoman Jamezetta Bedford.

Before commissioner’s agreed to spend the $20,000, several speakers told them that the amount is not enough to take care of residents who lost everything in the storm.
“This money, that’s going to the hotel or that’s money that’s going to landlords for rental application fees,” said C.R. Clark, a volunteer with Triangle Tenant Union. “Where is the funding that is going to directly support these people as they move on with their lives and get set up in new homes?”
Clark noted that federal Individual Assistance Grants for people displaced from homes due to natural or man-made disasters won’t reach residents until October.
“So, what is going to happen to these folks in the next month, in a month plus, as we have people who still don’t have housing lined up?” Clark said.
Residents with mental and physical disabilities need help finding appropriate housing, Clark said.
“We have some people here with disabilities and mobility issues that have been offered third-and fourth-floor apartments that they can’t get to,” Clark said.
 Heather Gibbs (Photo: Greg Childress)
Heather Gibbs, a former resident of flood-prone Camelot Village, said she didn’t know about the flooding problem at the townhome community until she went to sign her lease.
Gibbs shared that she has several disabilities, which makes such housing inappropriate for her and others with mobility issues.
“I would not live there again,” Gibbs told commissioners. “I can’t go through that again.”
Quinten Simmons, a Camelot Village resident who uses a wheelchair, said he almost lost his life in the July flood before being rescued by neighbors.
“Even when it’s not flooding, every time it rains, the paranoia just kills you, because you don’t know when it’s gonna flood,” Simmons said.
Devin Gilgor, a volunteer with Triangle Mutual Aid, said $20,000 won’t fix the flooding problem in places such as Camelot Village.
“We are housing vulnerable people in a flood setting, and someone’s going to die,” Gilgor said.
Residents lost documents needed to get new driver’s licenses, birth certificates and to rent apartments, Gilgor. He said the county and town must do more to help replace those items.
“I would like for one of you up there to try to go to the DMV and get your license without any form of ID, no birth certificate, no social security card,” Gilgor said.
Orange County Manager Travis Myren shared a PowerPoint showing that the county and the Town of Chapel Hill partnered to place residents in hotels on July 11, with the town kicking in $100,000 to cover the cost of hotel rooms. By August 22, the county and the town were supporting 20 hotel rooms for displaced residents. The town also provided 29 hotel rooms for residents displaced for Chapel Hill’s public housing.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-4-1024x768.png,,,2025-08-27 19:58:10.251318

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Two children, ages 8 and 10, were killed by a shooter who opened fire outside Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis, where students at the Catholic school were gathered Wednesday for Mass to celebrate the beginning of the school year.
Another 17 people were injured — 14 children and three parishioners in their 80s — and are being treated at area hospitals. One adult and six children were in critical condition Wednesday afternoon, according to Hennepin Healthcare.
Annunciation Principal Matt DeBoer said teachers acted within seconds of gunfire erupting to shelter children under pews.
“It could have been significantly worse without their heroic action,” DeBoer said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “We lost two angels today. Please continue to pray for those still receiving care. We can’t change the past, but we can do something about the future.”

The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, barricaded the door of the church with a wood board and shot dozens of rounds through the window using a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.
“The coward that shot these victims took his own life in the rear of the church,” O’Hara said.
Outside the school after the shooting, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.
Susan Ruff, a neighbor whose children attended the school at Annunciation and has a grandson currently enrolled, said she saw the shooting from her window.
She witnessed a man dressed in black, wearing a helmet, with a long gun, shooting at the church from the outside. She heard 25 or 30 gun shots. “It sounded like someone was dropping a dumpster. That loud bang. But I kept hearing it, so I thought, that’s not a dumpster.” Her grandson was unhurt in the shooting.
Westman purchased the weapons legally and did not have a criminal record, O’Hara said. He said law enforcement were not seeking other suspects.
Court records show a Mary Westman, who retired from Annunciation Catholic School in 2021 according to a now-deleted Facebook post, requested a name change for her child from Robert to Robin in 2019 saying “minor identifies as female.” O’Hara said he could not confirm the suspect’s connection to the school or that the suspect changed their name.
O’Hara said investigators believe Westman is behind videos scheduled to post on YouTube on Wednesday morning, which have since been taken down. One video opens with a four-page handwritten screed that begins, “I don’t expect forgiveness … I do apologize for the effects my actions will have on your lives.”
It also showed an arsenal of guns and ammunition with writing on them reading “Where Is Your God?” and “Suck On This!” Other writings, some in Russian, target President Donald Trump and wish death upon Jewish people.
Numerous law enforcement agencies were on the scene including the FBI, ATF and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office.
O’Hara said law enforcement are executing four search warrants, one at the church and three others at residences in the metro area connected to the suspect where firearms are being recovered.
“We are all working tirelessly to uncover the full scope of what happened, to try and identify a motive, why it happened, and whether there are any other further details,” O’Hara said.

Neighbors and former students said they were shaken by the shooting in the typically quiet southwestern Minneapolis neighborhood.
Jack Friedman, 25, went to the school and lives in the area. He said, “You never think that it’s going to happen at the school you went to, but then you start thinking how naïve to believe that. Because it happens everywhere.”
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, speaking at a news conference outside the school, called for action — not just thoughts and prayers, which has become a rote response to mass shootings.
“Don’t just say, this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” he said. “These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.”
Vigils are planned Wednesday night for the victims. Annunciation Church announced a prayer vigil at 7 p.m. in the Holy Angels Gym. Anti-gun violence group Moms Demand Action announced a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m. at Minneapolis Lynnhurst Park.

In response to tribal interest, the Bureau of Land Management is leading an effort to examine the potential disposal of federal land deemed unnecessary to the Riverton Reclamation Project decades ago. 
The post Tribes call on Trump to ‘do right for Indian country,’ return federal land within Wind River Reservation’s bounds appeared first on WyoFile .","The Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes have reignited their long-stalled effort to repatriate more than 100 square miles of federal government property within the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
Land the tribes are seeking has been designated as excess and unnecessary to the water infrastructure that took it out of tribal hands.
Mostly arid Bureau of Reclamation property west of Boysen Reservoir, the region in question is known as Muddy Ridge — and there’s a decades-long history of the tribes attempting to reacquire the area and classify it instead as tribal lands. Over the course of the summer, the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes and their joint Wind River Inter-Tribal Council have each sent the Trump administration’s Interior Department letters urging the federal government to move on the conveyance process. 
“It has been the Wind River Tribes’ view for eighty years that these lands, which were part of the 1868 Treaty, should be returned to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes as part of the Wind River Indian Reservation,” states a July 15 letter from the Eastern Shoshone Business Council. 

The Bureau of Reclamation has identified tens of thousands of acres of land within the Riverton Reclamation Project area as being “excess” and no longer needed for irrigation. The Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes are trying to reacquire roughly 69,000 acres, which are within the boundaries of the Wind River Indian Reservation. (Provided)
The letter was addressed to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. It details tribes’ unsuccessful efforts to acquire the land during the Biden administration, when Deb Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, helmed Interior. 
“The Department and its Bureaus appeared uncommitted to upholding the federal trust responsibility to the Tribes,” the Eastern Shoshone letter states. “Now, under the Trump administration, the Department of Interior can bring closure to an eighty-year-long effort by the Tribes and Repatriate our ancestral lands within the Reservation boundary. The Trump administration can do right for Indian country.” 
Although there were no decisions made during the Biden administration, there were administrative steps that moved the Bureau of Reclamation in the direction of disposing of its excess property. The tribes’ interest spurred the reignited disposal process, Bureau of Reclamation Wyoming Area Manager Lyle Myler said. 
“Our regional director, working with the BLM state director, reinvigorated this process,” Myler said.

Back in the 1990s, Myler explained, some 56,000 acres of agency land in the area were identified as “not needed for project purposes.” During that era, the agency submitted a “notice of intent to relinquish the land,” but subsequently the effort “languished,” he said. 
After the tribes kicked the process back into gear in 2021, the Bureau of Land Management — an Interior sibling agency to Bureau of Reclamation engaged in the disposal process — started mapping and inventorying the land at issue.  
“We’ve identified another approximately 10,000 acres that will be included in the request for revocation or relinquishment,” Myler said. 
The redefined legal descriptions for those acres were recently published in the Federal Register, he said, and the total acreage now being examined is roughly 66,000 acres.
The tribes, meanwhile, are urging the federal government to repatriate “roughly 69,000 acres,” according to the letters sent to Burgum. Additionally, the Eastern Shoshone letter asks the federal government to “commit to discussing the repatriation of an additional 35,000 acres of disputed excess lands.”

According to the Eastern Shoshone’s letter, there is historic precedent for returning lands within the reservation that were taken from the tribes, but never developed. Some 70,000 acres were restored in 1953 near Boysen Reservoir and another 120 acres near Thermopolis were returned to the tribes in 1988, the letter states. 
Today, updated maps and the precise accounting of the “excess” land that’s being examined for disposal is not yet publicly available. The majority of the property is located between Fivemile and Muddy creeks in the area known as Muddy Ridge, Myler said, but there are also “spatterings” of non-contiguous parcels. A photo of a map sent to WyoFile shows that some of the smaller tracts are located to the south, nearer to Shoshoni and Riverton. 
Although the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s Sand Mesa Wildlife Habitat Management Area is located on Bureau of Reclamation property and borders excess lands being examined, the state-managed ground is not part of the revocation request, Myler said.

(Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
The next step for the Bureau of Reclamation is to review the updated “packet” that its regional director will send to the Bureau of Land Management’s Wyoming director, who is currently Kris Kirby in an acting role. After it is received and reviewed, a Federal Register notice will go out, BLM-Wyoming Senior Advisor Brad Purdy said. 
“There’ll be a press release and everything,” Purdy said. “That’s when we’re going to do the public comment.” 
The timeframe isn’t cemented, but BLM is aiming to publish Muddy Ridge “environmental site assessment” documents in the winter, he said. 
Those documents will not necessarily propose taking a specific action. 
“Folks are looking for, ‘What direction is this taking? What are the possible outcomes?’” Purdy said. “That’s where we’re struggling. I don’t know. We have to do this process first.”
Although tribal interest stimulated the process, it’s not necessarily geared toward conveying the land to the tribes — though that could be the outcome, Purdy said. In the end, one person will make the call about what becomes of the land. 
“The ultimate decision on what happens lies with the [Interior] Secretary [Burgum],” Purdy said. “You’ll get some indication when that environmental site assessment is [completed]. But there’s not going to be … like a preferred alternative in it.”
The Eastern Shoshone Tribe’s letter, which was prepared with support from the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, urges Burgum to “immediately repatriate” the lands. There’s “no question” he has the authority, it states. 
“The solution is simple,” the letter reads. “It requires one pen and your signature.”

The missive cites a 1993 BLM document, “Report on Return of Excess Lands Wind River Reservation, WY,” which includes the statement: “The appropriateness of returning these lands to the Tribes was recognized by the United States as early as 1943.” It also details a Haaland Secretarial Order, 3403, which calls for the Interior Department to: “Identify and support Tribal opportunities to consolidate Tribal homelands and empower Tribal stewardship of those resources.” 
As of Tuesday, the tribes had not yet heard back from Burgum’s Interior Department, according to Wes Martel, a Greater Yellowstone Coalition senior conservation associate who’s been engaged in the issue and formerly served on the Eastern Shoshone Business Council. 
But a response is being prepared, Purdy said. “We will send a letter explaining everything out,” he said.

Meantime, some Eastern Shoshone members who’ve tracked the issue aren’t optimistic that the Trump administration will heed the request. 
“It’s going to be extremely difficult,” said Richard Baldes, a retired biologist who worked on returning the Muddy Ridge lands to the Wind River tribes in the 1990s. 
“It’s more than Muddy Ridge,” Baldes added. “They took a lot of land out of the reservation they were supposed to use for irrigation. Those additional lands that they didn’t use for irrigation were supposed to revert back to the tribes. They never did.”

March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Thirteen progressive state lawmakers called on the chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Judiciary Committee to host a public hearing into a federal-state plan to morph a state prison into an immigration detention center.
The Wednesday letter to State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln calls on Bosn to use her authority to call a hearing on the planned repurposing of the Nebraska Work Ethic Camp in McCook. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a state-federal plan Aug. 19 to convert the nearly 200-bed dormitory-style, rehabilitative-focused prison facility into a 300-bed ICE detention facility over the next 45 days.

Pillen, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and other state officials called the rebranded facility the “Cornhusker Clink.”
“There was no meaningful notice to the Legislature, local officials or the public about this agreement,” the senators wrote Wednesday in a letter shared publicly and with the Examiner. “The governor’s disregard for including the Legislature — the people’s branch — is deeply problematic. Nebraskans deserve answers.”
Almost every legislative committee introduces a resolution each year to examine any issues that might arise between legislative sessions within a committee’s jurisdiction. Bosn’s committee has Legislative Resolution 108, which is signed by all eight committee members.
Bosn said she received the letter late Wednesday afternoon and was still reviewing it. She said she would have a response Thursday.
‘How democracy works’
Lawmakers signing the letter were State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Machaela Cavanaugh, Danielle Conrad, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Megan Hunt, Margo Juarez, Terrell McKinney, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree and Ashlei Spivey.
“This is not about partisanship. It is about process, constitutional authority and protecting  Nebraskans,” Hunt, a nonpartisan progressive, said in a statement. “The governor cannot secretly cut deals to hand over state facilities to ICE without public input or legislative oversight. That is not how democracy works.”

The other dozen lawmakers who signed are Democrats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature. 
The three legislative Democrats who did not sign the letter are State Sens. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and Jason Prokop of Lincoln. DeBoer is vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, which is split 5-3, majority Republicans. McKinney and Rountree also serve on the committee.
DeBoer could not be reached for comment Wednesday. The Governor’s Office and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services had no immediate responses, either.
Nebraska’s plans to keep the repurposed Work Ethic Camp state-owned and operated would likely leave it open to legislative oversight, a power that lawmakers have worked to clarify and strengthen over the past two years.
Legal authority
Some of the lawmakers’ questions revolve around whether the governor has the authority to enter an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to convert a state prison into an ICE detention facility without legislative action. They also want to probe whether the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services can house ICE detainees at all.

The letter notes Article IV, Section 19 of the Nebraska Constitution, which gives the Legislature power over the “management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.” 
Senators argued Pillen is “unilaterally” bypassing the Nebraska Constitution and multiple state laws that dictate the prison system’s powers and outline the purpose of the Work Ethic Camp in statute.
While the letter alludes to fiscal questions, lawmakers did not include any specific questions on the finances of the new facility.
Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, have said the federal government will fully reimburse Nebraska for the $9.5 million facility plus daily bed costs. They have said the deal could financially benefit Nebraska.
Previous Judiciary Committee reactions
Rountree, who represents a purple legislative district that elected him and voted for President Donald Trump in November, previously told the Nebraska Examiner that he approaches immigration enforcement from a “humanitarian viewpoint” and from his 30 years as a veteran.
“There’s a place for the rule of law to exist along with humanitarian effort,” Rountree said.
What to know about Nebraska-ICE plan to retool McCook Work Ethic Camp

State Sens. Tanya Storer of Whitman and Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, who also serve on the Judiciary Committee, said they had been briefed on the federal plan and were more confident in its direction. Both said they were assured Nebraska facilities would not be hurt by the plan.
“I think if Nebraska is in a position to help be part of that effort in a positive way, that’s a good thing,” Storer said at the time.
Hearing requested with ‘deliberate speed’
Among the letter’s other questions Wednesday:

What impact does this agreement have on Nebraskans who are incarcerated and front-line prison system employees, who are already facing overcrowding and staffing issues?
Will employees at the Work Ethic Camp be reassigned to work at other facilities? Will they be trained to work at the converted facility? Will federal officials also work at the converted facility? Will federal officials replace or supplement current staff at the Work Ethic Camp?
Where will the incarcerated Nebraskans now housed at the Work Ethic Camp be moved to? How does the recent significant damage and forced relocation of inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary impact prisoner relocation efforts? What impact will the relocation have on rehabilitation-focused programming and eligibility for parole?
Who will be detained or placed in the converted ICE detention facility?
If Nebraska has prison space to give away to the Trump administration, why are state lawmakers spending more than $313 million to build a new state prison?

“These and other subjects are deserving of a public hearing on the record at which officials can provide additional information and answer questions, and where Nebraskans can be heard,” the letter states.
The senators asked Bosn, a former prosecutor appointed to the Legislature in 2023 and elected in 2024, to inform her colleagues and the public of the answers to these questions if she can. 
If Bosn cannot answer, the letter adds, “We encourage you to stand in your power and set and publicize the hearing date to take this matter up with all deliberate speed as the governor notes this transition will be happening within a few short weeks.”

Sublette County residents express gratitude as Dollar Lake Fire remains a top firefighting priority in the region. 
The post Crews capitalize on favorable weather to corral western Wyoming fire  appeared first on WyoFile .","PINEDALE—In the week since the Dollar Lake Fire was discovered near Green River Lakes on Aug. 21, the fast-moving wildland fire has consumed more than 13,450 acres of heavy timber 32 miles north of Pinedale. 
The fire is burning in a dense mix of lodgepole pine, aspen and conifer forest, with dead and down trees that are receptive to isolated torching, according to officials. The dead and down 1,000-hour fuels produced active to extreme fire behavior, sustained crown runs and spotting with long-range spotting. Crews on scene have reported crown fires in the timber with “100-foot flame lengths” as the fire burns above the Green River Lake campground and into the Bridger Wilderness. 
In addition to an engine from Sublette County Unified Fire, there are some 450 firefighters from around the United States battling the blaze across five divisions, according to August Isernhagen, the incident commander from the Sierra Front/Nevada Team 5. Isernhagen explained the overall strategy for the coming days. 
“Big picture is we want to hold [the fire to] the river and road system on the north and east side. We want to establish control lines and get containment in the south, and we want to steer this thing into the rocks to the east, with our finite resources,” he said.
The Dollar Lake Fire remains the No. 1 priority in the Great Basin Geographic Area Coordination Center, Isernhagen said at a community fire meeting Tuesday in Pinedale. Five helicopters are assigned to the fire, along with planes equipped to scoop water from alpine lakes and other aircraft dropping retardant. 
“There’s been retardant drops completely surrounding the Red Cliff Bible Camp and all along the cabins and homes in there,” Isernhagen said. “They’ve got a tremendous plan in place in order to reduce the intensity of the oncoming flame front as it gets closer and closer to the subdivision.” 
Containment and operations
As of press time Wednesday, the fire was 8% contained. Its cause remains undetermined. The current estimation for containment is Oct. 15. 
“Containment in and of itself means we have a control feature around the fire and crews have checked 3-5 times to be sure there is no ember source,”  Isernhagen explained. “This means going in on hands and knees and feeling for hot spots with the back of an ungloved hand.” 
Firefighters are conducting burning operations, plowing in dozer lines, and using other tactics to drive the flames into the rocky outcroppings and away from private property and grazing allotments. 
“As you work around the entire perimeter of the fire, all of those critical values at risk have been addressed and mitigated. There’s been work done to limb up the trees, reduce the hazardous fuels that are close and put in the structure protection that’s necessary,” Isernhagen said. “We’ve done as much as we could with the time that we had to get the resources where they needed to be.”

Weather predictions
Incident meteorologist, Noah Myers, from the National Weather Service Office in Riverton, said Tuesday that firefighters would try to take advantage of cooler, wetter conditions over the next few days. 
“Wednesday will be our wettest day,” Myers said. “Thursday will be similar. I’m forecasting three-quarters of an inch to an inch-and-a-quarter of rain, which could really temper fire behavior. Regardless of accumulations, I’m confident we will see elevated humidity both during the burning period in the afternoon and overnight, and that will help a lot.” 
Also likely to help quell the fire is a notable lack of wind the next few days, Myers added. Smoke from the Dollar Lake Fire is traveling down the Green River drainage at night and into the Upper Green River Basin, impacting the air quality in and around the Kendall Valley, Cora, Daniel and Pinedale, Myers said.
A grateful community
Sublette County Unified Fire Chief Shad Cooper said local volunteer firefighters were the first to respond to the fire when it was discovered on the afternoon of Aug. 21, evacuating campers, outfitters and homeowners from the area and working 24 hours straight. The local crew was relieved when the Type 3 interagency fire team arrived the next day.
“We roam all over the country doing fires like this, and few, if any, communities have been as welcoming as your community. We appreciate that from the bottom of our hearts,” Isernhagen told the crowd of 100 people gathered Tuesday night at the Pinedale Library.

The entrances to the facility were lined with handmade signs expressing gratitude to the first responders. Electronic marquee signs at local businesses throughout Sublette County were updated to share messages of appreciation for the firefighters and other personnel assigned to the Dollar Lake Fire. Culinary students at Pinedale High School baked hundreds of cookies for the fire crews on Tuesday, and local businesses donated hot meals and cold drinks to the hardworking folks on the fire line throughout the week.
Sublette County residents took to the newly created Facebook group “Dollar Lake Fire Help” — which had garnered more than 250 members as of press time — to provide resources and assistance to impacted homeowners and ranchers. From running errands for anyone trying to avoid the smoke to hauling trailers and assisting with evacuations, area residents have flooded the page with heartening offers to help. About 400 cattle were evacuated Tuesday from a grazing allotment near the fire.
The American Red Cross Disaster Action Team for Sublette County is prepared to open a shelter at Pinedale High School if needed, said Maureen Hutchinson. 
WyoFile reported earlier this week that Todd Stevie, operator of Thompson Outfitters on the Bridger-Teton National Forest near Green River Lakes, received a call from Kim Cannon when the fire ignited. Cannon was many counties away, but three of his horses were corralled right near Green River Lakes.
The Dollar Lake Fire was racing toward Cannon’s horses. Pushed by winds, the blaze was galloping toward the corral and Stevie’s basecamp.
Stevie, his wife Bev and guide Dustin Lindley, drove miles along a dirt and gravel road toward the corral, reached the horses on Aug. 22 and rode them across the Green River at a ford. They loaded the mounts into a trailer, then drove like hell as roadside heat and flames spurred them on.
“It was a little sketchy and a little warm,” Stevie told WyoFile on Monday. Lindley drove a 1996 GMC one-ton pulling a gooseneck trailer and the horses. “I drove it like I stole it and hoped to hell there was no leak in the fuel pump,” Cannon said of Lindley’s account.

Two women were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Monday at their Manchester homes, a local official and an advocate said. 
Jill Martin Diaz, executive director of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, confirmed ICE’s presence in town and said at least one person arrested is a parent of young children.
“There’s been ICE presence in Manchester. They’ve been making arrests,” Martin Diaz said Wednesday. “I understand that people are really afraid.” 
Will Lambek, of the advocacy organization Migrant Justice, said one of the women detained Monday is Davona Williams, known by her nickname Candy by friends and family who called the organization this week. Originally from Jamaica, Williams is a mother and has lived in the United States for 18 years, Lambek said. 
Williams, 42, was checked in to the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility at 5:14 p.m. Monday, according to the Vermont Department of Corrections database.
As of Wednesday, Williams is detained at the state facility and is on federal immigration hold, Department of Corrections spokesperson Haley Sommer wrote in an email to VTDigger. Sommer referred other inquiries from VTDigger to ICE.
The presence of immigration enforcement at the two women’s homes at the Torrey Knoll housing development in Manchester was “unbeknownst to the town or the police department,” said Scott Murphy, town manager of Manchester, in Bennington County.
“It caused some consternation among a lot of people, especially our workers in town,” he said. “We have a lot of workers that are from another country that have been relocated here legally.”
Manchester community members plan to help the family and children of the detained individuals by providing counselors and reaching out to the local food pantry to deliver food, Murphy said. 
Lambek said in an interview that the ICE arrests in Manchester are an “awful situation” and are part of an ongoing pattern of detentions across the state. Since the arrest on Monday in Manchester, Lambek said Migrant Justice has received information about two other possible ICE arrests in Rutland and Winooski on Wednesday. 
“ICE’s actions seek to terrorize immigrant families. This latest detention is part of an escalating wave of attacks from Trump’s deportation agents to detain workers and separate families, both in Vermont and around the country,” Lambek wrote in a statement to VTDigger. “Vermonters must stand up to this violence and protect our neighbors.”
Neither Murphy nor Lambek nor Martin Diaz could confirm the identity of the other individual arrested in Manchester or other information on the arrest. 
ICE officials and the Manchester police chief did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The ACLU of Missouri believes the proposal, which was drafted by state lawmakers, violates the state constitution because it includes multiple subjects. The group also contends the summary that would appear on the ballot is misleading.
If the courts decide to keep the measure on the ballot, plaintiffs are asking that the ballot summary be revised to explicitly state that the measure would ban abortion.
If approved by a simple majority of voters, the abortion ban amendment would repeal a citizen-led reproductive rights amendment that passed last November legalizing  abortion in Missouri up until the point of fetal viability and enshrining other reproductive rights in the constitution, including in-vitro fertilization and contraceptives.
The new amendment would reinstate an abortion ban, allowing limited exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomolies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
The current language written by the Missouri General Assembly makes no mention of the ban it would enact. 
Instead, Missourians would be asked if they want to amend the Missouri constitution to: 

Guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies, and miscarriages;
Ensure women’s safety during abortions;
Ensure parental consent for minors;
Allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest;
Require physicians to provide medically accurate information; and
Protect children from gender transition?

Missouri statute states “petitions for laws shall contain not more than one subject which shall be expressed clearly in the title.” 
Chuck Hatfield, an attorney with Stinson LLP representing the plaintiff on Wednesday argued that the inclusion of the gender-affirming health care ban was “ballot candy” meant to win over more voters but is a separate issue from reproductive health care. 
Recent polling by St. Louis University/YouGov shows that while the majority of polled Missouri voters support access to abortion, the majority also oppose access to gender-affirming health care for minors. 
“You can’t say to the people, ‘Here’s a proposal whether the Chiefs should stay in Kansas City and to ban crypto,’” Hatfield said.
Missouri Solicitor General Louis Capozzi, defending the proposed amendment, told Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green on Wednesday that gender-affirming procedures can cause the loss of fertility. Therefore, he believes reproductive health care “applies to all people who are thinking about whether to have children.”
Capozzi said the latest proposed amendment “ensures that Missouri children are able to make the choice whether to reproduce when they are adults,” adding that if someone is “unable to reproduce, they can’t access reproductive health care.”
Last year, anti-abortion leaders were unsuccessful in convincing the courts to throw the abortion rights amendment off the ballot by claiming it violated the single subject rule. At the time, an attorney for the Thomas Moore Society argued unsuccessfully that the subject of that amendment, “a person’s fundamental right to reproductive freedom,” encompassed “infinite subjects.”
As rural maternity care units close, Missouri families lose options

Hatfield on Wednesday accused the legislature and Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins of misrepresenting what the amendment would do through both the language voters will see on the ballot and the ballot language posted at every polling station around the state next to sample ballots. 
Hoskins’ ballot language currently reads: “A ‘no’ vote will not amend the Missouri Constitution to allow abortion in cases of medical emergency, fetal anomaly, rape, or incest, or to protect children from gender transition.”
Under the current law, abortion is legal up until the point of fetal viability in Missouri and gender-affirming health care for minors is banned. 
“It’s ridiculous; it’s wrong,” Hatfield said of the ballot language. “The current constitution guarantees those rights and to imply otherwise is wrong, it’s highly argumentative.”
Capozzi argued the legislature was working with a word limit and that it was more important to state what the amendment would do. Summary statements, he said, need not detail specific exceptions.
The proposed amendment also requires any lawsuits related to reproductive health care to be filed in Cole County and gives the Attorney General’s Office the right to intervene in these cases. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said there is not a legitimate connection to reproductive health care, as “health care is not generally provided in court rooms.”
Hatfield suggested Green “tell the General Assembly to give it another shot in compliance with the constitution.” 
Green did not immediately rule on the challenge to the abortion ban amendment. A day earlier, he also heard arguments in a case challenging a new law set to go into effect Thursday that changes the deadlines and procedures for challenging and revising ballot language. Green’s determination in that case could affect how he’s allowed to proceed in regarding the ballot language. 
Despite the current law, abortion access remains tenuous in Missouri. 
Three Planned Parenthood clinics — in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis — have resumed procedural abortions on a limited schedule that was briefly interrupted over the summer when the courts overturned and then reinstated a temporary injunction allowing some abortions to resume ahead of a trial slated for January.
But Planned Parenthood and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office are slated to meet in court a handful of times before then.
At a hearing set for Sept. 10 in Kansas City, Planned Parenthood plans to argue in favor of undoing a number of laws they say are currently preventing its clinics from prescribing medication abortion in Missouri. 
That same day, down the street, the Western District Court of Appeals is slated to hear the Missouri Attorney General’s Office’s appeal of an injunction that allowed procedural abortions to resume in Missouri in February.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-27 18:58:02.147749

File photoThe Fulton County Board of Commissioners has been held in civil contempt of court after defying a court order mandating that they appoint two GOP nominees to the county board of elections. 
In a Wednesday ruling, Senior Superior Court Judge David Emerson said the county will be fined $10,000 per day until the board agrees to approve Julie Adams and Jason Frazier’s appointments to the elections board.
“The court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the Board of Commissioners has failed to comply with this court’s order,” Emerson wrote in his ruling. 
The judge declined to hold any of the commissioners in criminal contempt of court, but ordered that the board of commissioners must pay the Fulton County Republican Party’s legal fees in the case. While normally the fees would be paid to the county government, Emerson said the fines would instead be paid to the superior court clerk and transferred to the state of Georgia. 
The ruling is the latest development in a case that stretches back to May, when the Fulton County Republican Party attempted to nominate Adams, an incumbent board member, and Frazier, a newcomer, to the county board of elections. 
The Democratic-led board of commissioners voted 5-2 to reject the nominations, citing concerns about Adams and Frazier’s past actions and arguing that they were not qualified for the position. During her first term as an elections board member, Adams refused to certify the results of the 2024 primary until Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that she was required to do so. Frazier, a right-wing activist, has singlehandedly challenged the voter registrations of tens of thousands of Georgia residents, and was one of the main proponents of a series of last-minute State Election Board rule changes, some of which were ultimately struck down by the state Supreme Court.
In June, the Fulton County Republican Party filed a lawsuit in Fulton County Superior Court, claiming that commissioners do not have the power to reject nominations from political parties. State law says the members of the board “shall” appoint two members appointed by each major party, while the chair is appointed by the board of commissioners. The debate over the meaning of the word “shall” was also at the center of the 2024 case over Adams’ refusal to certify election results.
In an Aug. 3 ruling, Emerson sided with the Fulton County Republican Party, ordering the commissioners to approve the nominations.
“There is nothing in the statute to support the BOC theory that the county commissioners can veto the chairperson’s nominees other than for failure of the nominee to meet the two qualifications and one restriction,” Emerson wrote.

But when the board reconvened on Aug. 20 for another vote to approve Adams and Frazier, the measure once again failed, with Commissioners Dana Barrett and Mo Ivory casting votes against the nomination. Three other members of the commission were absent on the day of the vote. The Fulton County GOP then filed a request for the commissioners to be ruled in contempt of court.
Fulton GOP officials have been attempting to appoint Frazier to the Fulton County elections board since 2023, but faced roadblocks getting Frazier approved by the county commissioners, leading the GOP to file a similar lawsuit in 2023. However, they ultimately withdrew the suit according to court records, nominating Adams instead. This time, it appears, they could be more successful. 
“The local legislation does not include language authorizing the Commission to veto the selection of any qualified nominee, nor does it authorize the Commission to require any specific number of nominees,” Emerson wrote in his ruling Wednesday.
Georgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon, who had called for Emerson to jail the commissioners who rejected the Republican appointees, applauded the court’s decision.
“Our major victory today could not have been possible without our partners — the RNC and the Fulton County Republican Party,” McKoon said in a statement. “Thank you to former RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, current RNC Chairman Joe Gruters, Fulton County Chair Stephanie Endres, and of course Julie Adams and Jason Frazier for your steadfast leadership that made this win possible.”

Ivory, one of the commissioners who voted against Adams and Frazier’s appointments, condemned Emerson’s ruling.
“Today’s court ruling is deeply concerning because it attempts to strip elected officials of the very power and discretion that come with the office,” she said in a statement. “If our role is reduced to automatic approval, then the voice of the people who chose us is silenced. This is not about politics—it is about principle. My duty is to safeguard our democracy, and I stand firmly by the decision I made.”
Ivory did not respond to questions about whether she would vote to approve Adams and Frazier’s appointments. Barrett did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Fair Fight, a voter advocacy organization, expressed relief that Emerson did not impose jail time on the commissioners who voted against the GOP’s appointments.
“It’s good to see courts not bowing to the Republican Party’s authoritarian thirst,” said Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo. “Let’s be clear: the GOP is trying to criminalize democracy itself, demanding elected officials be held in criminal contempt and face jail time for doing their jobs.”

(Courtesy of the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation)The Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF) has recently come up with a new design for the state’s Agent Orange Memorial. The monument’s original design was modified in order to make it more inclusive. 
The new change affects the panels on the back of the memorial. The original design included an image of the Three Servicemen statue and to its left was the Vietnam Women’s Memorial. Beneath the statues was the inscription “They served, they fought, they died and received neither their country’s glory nor their country’s compassion.”
The new version of the monument’s back side has an image of a C-123 aircraft spraying Agent Orange. While the toxic herbicide was sprayed in other ways, such as by Huey helicopters, the Air Force C-123 Provider was the most commonly used aircraft. 
Below the image of the C-123, are the words “In honor of the warriors who bore the invisible wounds of Agent Orange.” This refers to all of the Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and includes service members from the five branches of the military: Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. 
The sentence that follows reads “and in steadfast recognition of all veterans exposed to toxic battlefields, from the jungles of Vietnam to the burn pits of the modern era.” This inclusive sentence recognizes post-Vietnam era veterans who were exposed to toxic chemicals during the Gulf War and other eras. 
The final sentence states that “This memorial stands as a promise: That their sacrifice will never be forgotten, their voices will never be silenced, and those who follow will be protected.” This sentence emphasizes the educational aspect of the memorial. Part of its purpose is to help future generations learn from the mistakes of the past.
To help aid this learning process, the UAOVF has designed an information stand that will be placed in front of the Agent Orange Memorial. The stand will measure 51 inches long and 24 inches wide, and it will display four informative sections, which are currently in draft form.
Section 1 will include a map of south Vietnam indicating areas that were affected by Agent Orange. Section 2 will include a list of countries affected by Agent Orange and corresponding dates. Section 3 will include a list of diseases associated with Agent Orange. The final section of the information stand will list diseases and exposure compensation criteria in the PACT Act of 2022. 
The PACT Act is officially known as the “Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics” Act. It significantly increased health care and benefits for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances from the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and post-9/11 era.
The UAOVF is currently on schedule with plans to get the Agent Orange Memorial in Sunset Veterans Park in time to dedicate it on Veterans Day 2025. That ceremony will formalize one of the most momentous veteran advocacy efforts in the annals of the Beehive State.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Updated-Agent-Orange-memorial-e1756334570165.jpg,,,2025-08-27 18:58:02.147749

(Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin)Since 1990, New Hampshire public schools have been required to give students with disabilities personalized plans. Known as individualized education programs, the plans are the key mechanism by which parents ensure that their child has services and accommodations for their disability. 
But a group of school districts argue a new “anti-DEI” state law signed into the budget this year could disrupt those plans. And they’re seeking to convince a federal court to strike the law down for being unconstitutionally vague. 
The state’s attorney general’s office counters that the law will not affect special education services, and is instead targeted at programs that unfairly advantage certain demographics over others. And lawyers for the state said the law is clear. “It is our position that this is not a vague statute,” said Senior Assistant Attorney General Brandon Chase.
But during oral arguments between plaintiffs and the state Wednesday, Judge Landya McCafferty of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire appeared sympathetic to plaintiffs’ contentions that the new law is difficult to understand and comply with and could muzzle free speech.
The law, passed as part of the House Bill 2 budget trailer bill, states that “no school district shall implement, promote, or otherwise engage in any DEI-related initiatives, programs, training, or policies.” It also prohibits districts from entering into contracts that contain such policies. DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
For districts, the potential penalties are steep: If found by the New Hampshire Department of Education to have violated the law, the commissioner of that department must “immediately halt all sources of public funding to that public school,” until the school has come back into compliance. That punishment applies whether the district did so “knowingly or unknowingly.”
“Even if (school districts) do not know, the commissioner shall immediately halt all sources of public funding,” McCafferty said during the hearing, adding that the risks for districts are high. 
Proponents of the law, which was added to the budget in April and did not receive a public hearing, say the law is meant to ensure that all students are treated fairly. It simply states that no hiring program, school policy, or training may give anyone a leg up “for the purpose of achieving demographic outcomes, rather than treating individuals equally under the law,” supporters say.

The budget bill, signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte in June, also extended the anti-DEI ban to all public entities, including local government and state government agencies. 
But lawyers for plaintiffs said the law would unconstitutionally interfere with many programs offered by public school districts. And they noted that the law provides no appeal options for a district whose funding is denied by the department; districts must comply or lose the money.
“This law isn’t just designed to address quotas; it’s designed to suppress ideas,” said Gilles Bissonnette, the ACLU of New Hampshire legal director, addressing the court Wednesday. 
The lawsuit echoes two others brought before the New Hampshire federal district court in recent years, both of which had outcomes that favored the plaintiffs.
In 2024, Judge Paul Barbadoro struck down state legislation known as the “divisive concepts” law, which prohibited teachers and government employees from promoting a certain concept about racism, sexism, and oppression. In that case, Barbadoro found the law was unconstitutionally vague. 










The New Hampshire Department of Education is the judge, jury and the executioner here.

And in April, McCafferty granted an injunction against a “Dear Colleague” letter sent by the Trump administration to state education departments instructing public schools to drop DEI programs and positions or face a loss in federal funding. That order temporarily stopped the U.S. Department of Education from acting on the promises in the letter. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs referred to those cases often Wednesday.
‘Judge, jury and executioner’
The lawsuit was partly prompted by a series of letters sent out by the New Hampshire Department of Education informing school districts about the new requirements. Those letters drew attention to a Sept. 30 deadline – the date laid out in the new law by which school districts must certify if they are in compliance with the law and report any contracts or programs they have that include DEI-related programs. 
Bissonnette argued the law is “impossible to follow” and “easy to violate.” Districts “do not know how to comply, and if they guess wrong, funding is on the line,” he said.
The law is especially easy to violate because of the lack of a requirement that districts “knowingly” violated the law in order to be punished, Bissonnette added.
And he said that because of the lack of an appeal process, whether or not districts face penalties depends on the determinations of the state. 
“The New Hampshire Department of Education is the judge, jury and the executioner here,” Bissonnette said.
The law extends beyond schools, plaintiffs argue. Bissonnette named a few potential programs that could be at risk, such as the “30×30 Initiative” — a pledge taken by the Manchester police department and others to try to recruit 30% female officers by 2030. He pointed to the policy of free state park entry for New Hampshire residents over 65, of tuition waivers for college students over 65, and about lax fitness standards for older police officers. Those programs arguably have the purpose of achieving demographic outcomes, Bissonnette said. 
Questions of intent
Attorneys for the state said that plaintiffs should not receive an injunction because they had not shown they are at risk of suffering immediate harm. 
They also argued the law is not unclear, and that its meaning could be understood by the average person. The intent of the law is to prevent some groups to be disadvantaged or placed at an advantage over others, said Assistant Attorney General Sam Gonyea. 










We discern the purpose of conduct all the time in law.


– New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Sam Gonyea


Speaking to the concerns about accommodations for students with disabilities, Gonyea argued that the new law does not prevent those accommodations and did not pre-empt the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act. He said individual disability arrangements are specific accommodations to specific students, and are not meant to provide demographic outcomes. 
Gonyea also said the new law would not prevent school districts from establishing girls sports teams. 
But Gonyea did agree that some of the examples named by Bissonnette, such as the program to recruit more female officers, could be interpreted to be prohibited by the law. 
The difference between those programs that would be prohibited and those that would not be, Gonyea argued, lies in whether they provide equality or unfair advantage. The establishment of the girls’ sports team, he said, provides equality with the boys’ sports teams, and allows everyone access to a sports team. The female recruitment initiative, meanwhile, affected the hiring chances of people who are not female, and would thus violate the law.
Gonyea said a government entity could not create an all-Jewish basketball team because that would not be an equal playing field. “That’s discrimination. And New Hampshire wants to get rid of it.”
Asked by McCafferty whether a school that had recently experienced an anti-Semitic hate crime committed by a student — like a swastika drawn on a whiteboard — could hold Holocaust awareness classes to help protect Jewish students, Gonyea argued that it could not, under the law, if the purpose was to protect Jewish students. If the purpose was to educate all students about the Holocaust in response to the incident, the school could likely proceed, he said.
“A lesson like that should be taught to everybody, for the same purpose,” he said.
Zoe Brennan-Krohn, the director of the ACLU’s disability rights program, said before the court that Gonyea’s interpretation of the ADA and IDEA is wrong: “The idea of differential treatment is foundational to the structure of these laws,” she said.
New Hampshire’s anti-DEI law, which prohibits that differential treatment is fundamentally in opposition to those laws, she said. “They simply can’t coexist,” she said.
Bissonnette, meanwhile, said the number of times when lawyers for the state had opined that one program would be subject to the law and another would not was an indication of the subjectiveness of the law.
“This is becoming a bit of a line reading exercise,” he said.
Gonyea countered that the fact there are easy cases of interpretation and harder cases does not make the law vague. “We discern the purpose of conduct all the time in law,” he said. 
Uncertain next moves
Throughout the oral arguments, McCafferty appeared skeptical that the state law could pass constitutional muster. She dismissed arguments by the state that the plaintiffs lacked standing. And she noted in multiple comments that the new law does not allow for school districts to contest a funding decision made by the department against them — unlike the “divisive concepts” law, in which teachers could appeal.
“Where is the appeal process?” she asked the state attorneys. 
She also appeared to side with the plaintiffs’ arguments about the conflicts between the federal disability laws and the state law. “I’m just not understanding how you’re interpreting this language with respect to special education,” she said. 
It is not clear when McCafferty might make a ruling. 
But even if she issues an injunction, McCafferty could be constrained by the June U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. CASA, Inc. That decision limits the ability of district court judges to issue nationwide injunctions and requires most injunctions to affect only the people who have filed the lawsuit.
McCafferty noted to the plaintiffs that they could come back with more plaintiffs should any injunction she issues be too narrow.  
And she asked the state whether it would stop enforcing the law if she issued an injunction specifically to the plaintiffs. 
Chase said the state could not guarantee it would.

The program, launched in 2022, is now open to individuals and private employers.

Gov. Phil Scott used his weekly press conference to spotlight the benefits of the state’s voluntary paid family and medical leave program, which recently opened up participation to include individuals and small businesses with just one employee.
While more than 10,000 Vermonters are participating almost three years into its phased launch, the insurance program is primarily covering state employees, and officials hope more businesses and individuals will consider joining. According to The Hartford insurance company, which manages the program for the state, about 1,800 current participants work for private businesses, and fewer than 100 are individually insured. 
Kim Rudeen, head of absence management at the Connecticut-based insurance company, acknowledged that Vermont’s program is in its infancy, but said that uptake in the state mirrored that of programs elsewhere.

Launched in 2022, the state’s partnership with The Hartford first rolled out for state employees before expanding to private businesses in 2024 and individuals this year. The Vermont Family and Medical Leave Insurance program offers plans for people who need to take time off work to care for a child or family member, recover from illness or for leave related to a family member’s military service.
“These are not unusual circumstances,” Kendal Smith, interim commissioner of the Vermont Department of Labor, said at the press conference Wednesday. “This is part of being human.”
Plans on offer range from six to 26 weeks of paid leave per year and pay 60% or more of an employee’s standard wages. Businesses can choose the structure of the plan for their employees and how much to contribute. 
For years, Scott and Democrats in the Legislature butted heads about how to enact paid leave in Vermont. 
Democrats and advocates have long argued a mandatory program is necessary to ensure a sufficiently large risk pool — one capable of providing robust benefits to the workers that need them the most. But Scott, a Republican, balked at the payroll tax that Democrats pitched to make a universal paid leave plan work, vetoing bills in 2018 and 2020 that would have created a mandatory initiative. 
While he called the voluntary program progress, a universal program would lower costs for individuals and help small businesses compete for workers, according to Emmett Avery, manager of the Vermont Paid Leave Coalition. He pointed to data indicating almost 80% of Vermonters support a state paid leave program.  
Thirteen states and Washington DC now offer a mandatory paid family and medical leave program, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while New Hampshire has also implemented a voluntary program.
On Wednesday, Scott said his voluntary program was a great way to “test drive” how the leave insurance works for Vermonters, and he didn’t rule out the possibility that the program could evolve. As of last year, the program costs the state about $2 million annually.

(Commissioner of Political Practices)Two Montana Democrat state lawmakers have filed complaints with the Commissioner of Political Practices detailing how their campaign treasurer allegedly stole thousands of dollars. 
Sen. Cora Neumann, of Bozeman, and Rep. Zooey Zephyr, of Missoula, filed their COPP complaints after their former treasurer, Abbey Lee Cook, signed a plea agreement with the federal government admitting to an embezzlement scheme of more than $250 million. 
The two lawmakers confirmed they are two of six unnamed victims listed in federal court documents that detail Cook’s scheme of transferring funds from campaign accounts to her own personal account, as well as failing to file forms and making late payments.
“While I do not know every victim of Ms. Cook, I know that there were several. I knew that we were working with the FBI to make sure they had everything they needed,” Zephyr told the Daily Montanan last week. 
In her complaint, Zooey alleges that Cook used her position to “intentionally misrepresent donations to my campaign as well as expenditures from my campaign in order to embezzle those funds,” and that she had submitted fraudulent statements to COPP to hide her actions. 
According to the complaint, Cook told Zephyr following the 2024 election that there was “around $25,000” left in her campaign account. Zephyr instructed Cook to close the account and donate the surplus funds to a series of nonprofits and the Montana Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. 
But Zephyr stated that the organizations did not receive the funds, Cook repeatedly made excuses as to why they hadn’t been sent, and the campaign account could only be accessed by Cook. 
“Following the FBI investigation, it is my belief that Ms. Cook understated the surplus amount by at least half, and there was approximately $52,100 remaining in the account at the time of the campaign’s conclusion,” according to the complaint. 
Zephyr also reported Cook repeatedly filed inaccurate or late filings to COPP, and often attributed the late filings to problems with the state’s computer system. 
Neumann, who told the Daily Montanan she had “raised the red flag” on Cook’s dealings and alerted Zephyr to the potential illegal activity, wrote in her complaint that Cook had failed to pay invoices on time, lost or failed to process nearly $10,000 in campaign checks, filed late, or incorrect expense reports and COPP filings and paid herself an extra $1,600 from campaign accounts. 
Following the series of issues with Cook’s work, a lack of communication with Neumann, and a failure to reconcile the extra payments, the lawmaker terminated Cook’s services in August 2024. 
Neumann’s complaint alleges Cook violated three of Montana’s campaign finance laws related to misuse of campaign funds, record keeping duties of a campaign treasurer, and campaign finance reporting. 
According to the complaint, Neumann found a nearly $10,000 discrepancy between reported contributions to the campaign and deposits made to the campaign bank account, and at least one donor reached out to note their check had not been cashed. 
“As Abbey Cook oversaw P.O. Box and its contents at the time, it’s impossible to know how many donor checks may still be outstanding or simply lost,” the complaint states. 
Neumann also details a lack of communication from Cook throughout the eight months she worked for the campaign, including failing to provide spreadsheets detailing campaign finances and failing to respond to texts and emails “requesting basic information.”
Cook also blamed late campaign finance reports on problems with COPP’s system or staff, but Neumann wrote in an email that “it has recently become clear after communication with other Democratic candidates that the issue is you.”
During the 2024 election cycle Cook worked for multiple Democratic candidates and progressive-aligned political committees including Ben Alke, the Democratic candidate for Attorney General, and Jeremiah Lynch, who ran for the Montana State Supreme Court. 
Another of Cook’s confirmed victims was the Montana Senior Vote Action Fund, which is overseen by the advocacy group Big Sky 55+, though the two groups have separate boards.
In a statement, Big Sky 55+ Executive Director Trent Bolger said Cook took $18,000 from the action fund’s account without permission, which has not yet been returned. 
“There is a legal process that will play out in the future, and we hope that justice will be done,” Bolger said.
Earlier this month, Cook signed a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s office to plead guilty to three counts of wire fraud in exchange for the federal government not recommending jail time. She will also pay $253,000 in restitution. Each count of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release.
Cook’s arraignment and change of plea hearing is scheduled for Sept. 9 in the federal courthouse in Great Falls.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-14-at-4.58.34-PM-1024x628.png,,,2025-08-27 18:58:02.147749

(Courtesy of Indigenized Energy)The Trump administration’s cancellation of solar energy grants benefiting low-income households is “catastrophic for Indian Country,” according to a grant recipient that was working with tribes.
Projects for tribal and rural areas in and around South Dakota had been awarded about $260 million from the Solar for All program during the Biden administration.
The Trump administration canceled nearly $7 billion in grants from the initiative earlier this month, after the Environmental Protection Agency said the fund for the program was eliminated in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump.  


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Indigenized Energy was managing $135.6 million awarded to the Northern Plains Tribal Coalition. The five-state, 14-tribe effort included the South Dakota-based Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate and the Flandreau Santee, Standing Rock, Oglala and Rosebud Sioux tribes.
Indigenized Energy Founder and Executive Director Cody Two Bears, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, said the group planned to complete thousands of projects in the region — more than 1,000 in South Dakota alone. Two Bears sees solar energy as a path to job creation and skills training, as well as an opportunity to bolster tribal sovereignty and independence.
“It was just another broken promise to Native tribes,” Two Bears said. “It’s one of those things where we were promised opportunity and hope in these communities and for these jobs, and that was taken away by a stroke of a pen.”
Two Bears said Indigenized Energy hadn’t spent much of the grant award yet, since it was in the midst of planning and hiring for the projects. Indigenized Energy hired 20 people to carry out the projects in tribal communities and planned to hire another 70. Those 20 staff members were laid off earlier this month.
The company was able to complete two projects late last year, including a solar panel installation at a private home that leaders of the Oglala Sioux Tribe identified as a “great need.”
The nonprofit installed a residential solar system on the property with storage batteries. The system is expected to save the homeowners about $1,225 a year on electricity.

“Solar energy is going to be the option for Native tribes,” Two Bears said, “because solar is getting cheaper more and more every day, while the cost of electricity is only getting higher every month.”
Thirty Oglala Lakota tribal members participated in the installation and training. Six of the people were later hired by a solar panel installation company.
The nonprofit will likely incur more costs to close out the Solar For All program without federal reimbursements. Indigenized Energy is seeking alternative funding for the projects they had “teed up,” Two Bears said.
Trump EPA claws back $7B in solar funding already promised to states

“It’s really our responsibility to make sure that all the work we put in up to this point was not for nothing.”
The state of South Dakota didn’t apply for any of the funding on the government level, making it one of a few states to have skipped the opportunity.
Aside from the tribal coalition, a Washington, D.C.-based “green bank” called Coalition for Green Capital pulled in another $125 million for tribal and rural projects across the Dakotas, with $62.5 million earmarked for South Dakota. The organization did not respond to South Dakota Searchlight interview requests.
Rick Bell is on the Dakota Rural Action board of directors, which helped the organization with community outreach. The group was hoping to start the project with an installation at low-income housing developments in the Rapid City area, Bell said.
“It’s a sin and a shame this is being yanked out again,” Bell said, referring to the administrative freeze on the funding earlier this year. 
Even if there is another legal battle involving the funding and it is reauthorized, Bell worries the group won’t be able to meet the grant’s five-year schedule and deadline.

The stuck-in-amber nature of Mississippi’s capital city was highlighted by a moment when Rep. Chris Bell, a Democratic lawmaker from Jackson who sits on the Capital City Revitalization Committee, asked Horhn about a state-funded study on gangs. 
The 2016 study, paid for with $500,000 in funding Horhn secured while senator, found in part that Jackson’s gangs were mainly neighborhood cliques of young adult men. 
“Are these some of the same issues that we’re seeing back then and we still have today?” Bell asked. 
“Absolutely,” Horhn responded.

It was Horhn’s first time to publicly address his former colleagues through the select committee, formed by Republican House Speaker Jason White in 2024 to focus on issues in the capital city, since the former senator left the Legislature to become mayor in July. 
For about an hour, Horhn gave the bipartisan committee a rundown of the issues on the top of his agenda, including reducing crime, rebuilding what he described as the “decimated” Public Works Department and eliminating blight in “parts of Jackson that look like a bomb has been set off.” 
Horhn also gave lawmakers suggestions for how they can help. By the end of the week, he said the city will have calculated the dollar figure – a basis for potential state or federal funding – it will take to reduce blight. If the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers approves a plan to reduce flooding on the Pearl River, Horhn said he hopes to see lawmakers vote to allow a casino in Jackson. And he’d like the state to expand tax incentives for developers, such as enterprise and opportunity zones, to make Jackson a more attractive place for warehousing. 
“We think Jackson ought to have a data center too,” he said, referencing similar projects in surrounding suburbs.
When Horhn finished speaking, Rep. Shanda Yates, an independent who co-chairs the committee, called him a “breath of fresh air.” 
Then Yates fired off a series of questions.
Does the city have a plan for a jail? 
“Right now the city depends on Hinds County,” Horhn said. 
What is his position on the Jackson Zoo? 
The zoo is rapidly losing money, Horhn said, but he believes relocating it is no longer an option after the previous administration chose not to pursue that deal. Since the zoo is on the National Register of Historic Places, Horhn said he is looking at potential state and federal historic tax credits. 
How many homeless centers are in the city and who is operating them? 
Horhn said he didn’t know but that the centers are not well coordinated despite scraping for resources. 
Yates responded that if Jackson is going to ask the state for more funding, the city needs to know what resources it already has. “Is that fair?” she asked. 
“More than fair,” Horhn said, adding that he thinks Yates’ request could be “the carrot on the stick to get these organizations working more cohesively together.” 
Finally, Yates asked Horhn about his goal for the city to eventually take back control of Jackson’s embattled water system. What does he envision? 
“A public-private partnership,” he said.

Jackson-area representatives, including Democrats Stephanie Foster and Justis Gibbs, asked Horhn to consider striping the roads to help elderly citizens drive at night or if the city had a plan to enforce liens on blighted properties. 
“No m’am, we do not,” he said. 
Lastly, Rep. Jill Ford told Horhn that she had spoken to the mayors of Madison and Ridgeland and they were excited for Jackson. 
“We’re all rooting for you,” she said.

Then much of the room cleared out. The committee heard from the Capitol Police Chief Bo Luckey and Tyree Jones, the soon to be combination interim police chief-sheriff of Jackson and Hinds County, who spoke in outgoing Jackson Police Chief Joseph Wade’s stead. 
Much of Jones’ discussion concerned the state of homelessness in Jackson. Since Yates’ bill requiring a permit for panhandling went into effect on July 1, the department has seen a reduction in the number of homeless people on thoroughfares such as Lakeland Drive or Ridgewood Road. 
At the same time, the number of people incarcerated at the Hinds County Detention Center has increased, Jones said, placing a strain on county resources. As of this morning, the jail housed more than 900 people. 
“When they leave, they go two places: They go home or they go to prison,” Jones said, adding that the longer people stay at the center, the longer the county is “stuck with having to provide services to them.” 
Luckey added that the city needs more resources for homeless people who do not belong in jail. 
“I completely agree the criminal justice system in Hinds County is bogged down,” Luckey said. “I will say the CCID (Capitol Complex Improvement District) court has been running very well.” 
A brief testimony from the Secretary of State’s office concerned legislation passed earlier this year to use tax incentives to put Jackson’s state-owned, tax-forfeited properties back on the market and into private hands. 
Bill Cheney, the assistant secretary of public lands, noted that lawmakers still need to address the state’s tax sale loophole – the subject of a recent Mississippi Today report – that results in tax-forfeited falling into limbo when investors who buy the property at a tax sale do not request a deed. 
“Nobody really owns it because nobody has requested the deed,” he said.

Kevin Felsher, the Republican representative from Biloxi, and Sam Creekmore, the Republican representative from Starkville, then addressed the committee about public health issues, including the opioid settlement fund that cities can use with “no restrictions.” 
“There should be substantial funds available for Jackson and Hinds County,” Creekmore said.
This alarmed some lawmakers. 
“When you say no restrictions on the funds, that terrifies me,” Yates said. “Can they use it, can they rehab the zoo?”
“That is my understanding,” Creekmore replied.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/27124935/3X0A3559.jpg,,,2025-08-27 18:58:02.147749

The Arkansas Department of Health is warning residents to safeguard against the spread of a mosquito-borne illness.
The department says eight cases of West Nile virus have been detected in residents of five Arkansas counties, leading to one death.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mississippi, Faulkner, Dallas and Craighead counties have each reported one case, while four cases have been identified in Pulaski County.
The majority of people infected with West Nile do not show symptoms. Mild illness can occur in up to 20% of people infected with the virus, with symptoms like fever, headache, nausea and vomiting.
People over the age of 50 or those with compromised immune systems are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Diagnoses are typically made through a blood test or spinal tap procedure.
West Nile was first identified in the U.S. in 1999, and recognized in Arkansas in 2002. Nearly 13,000 people have had serious illness related to West Nile in the U.S. since it was first identified, with more than 1,200 deaths.

While Republicans and Democrats had the same schedule — starting with the Iowa caucuses, followed by the New Hampshire primary — that calendar was changed after the 2020 election. In the 2024 nominating cycle, Democrats had South Carolina kick off the process, followed by Nevada, New Hampshire, Georgia and Michigan.
The DNC agreed it would revisit the nominating schedule ahead of 2028 — a conversation that started Tuesday.
DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee Co-Chair Minyon Moore said at the meeting that the Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet again in September to “discuss and adopt a resolution formalizing a process for states to submit applications to move in the (early) window in 2028.”
State party leaders also went through the process of submitting applications for waivers to hold 2024 early presidential nominating contests. Though the DNC had approved a new calendar in 2022 which granted five states the ability to hold early contests, this calendar faced challenges as New Hampshire and Georgia’s Republican secretaries of state said they were unable to comply with the DNC’s nominating cycle which put them out of sync with state laws or Republicans’ nominating calendar.
The 2028 nominating calendar could face similar challenges. Just as New Hampshire held its 2024 Democratic primary on Jan. 23, 2024, outside of compliance with the national party, Iowa Democrats have also signaled they would consider holding a “rogue” contest in the next presidential election cycle.
The Iowa Democratic Party began asking for Iowa Democratic caucusgoers’ opinions on the presidential nominating contests through a “Family Conversation Survey” last week, which includes questions about whether Iowa Democrats should go “rogue” and hold the caucuses first even if they are not returned to the first-in-the-nation spot in 2028. The survey also includes questions about whether the state should resume in-person caucuses, which Iowa Democrats had stopped in 2024 in favor of a mail-in presidential preference cards system to address concerns about accessibility brought up by national Democrats.
Martin told NBC News earlier in August, “every state who wants to be considered in the early states window will have an opportunity to bid just like they did last time, including Iowa, and other states.”
Though the DNC will consider Iowa as an early state candidate, the state’s chances look slim heading into the process. In June, Scott Brennan of Iowa lost his long-held seat on the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee member, while New Hampshire gained a second seat.
Jim Roosevelt, the other co-chair of the Rules and Bylaws committee, said at the Tuesday meeting the DNC process for deciding which states can hold presidential nominating contests before Super Tuesday will remain similar to previous election cycles.
“I would just point out the process of applying to be in the early window is one we adopted several cycles ago,” Roosevelt said. “And state parties have the opportunity to make the case why they should be in the first group of states to hold primaries.”
The committee also discussed several amendments to party rules, led by Martin, aimed at making the DNC more inclusive. These measures included increasing the number of members selected by Asian American and Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ and Native American caucuse, requiring DNC staff and officers. remain neutral in Democratic primary races, and increasing oversight abilities of the budget committee.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/caucusnight.ballots2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-27 18:58:02.147749

Tom Cotton in 2026 at the Arkansas Capitol on Wednesday, August 27, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Five Arkansas Democrats are expected to vie for the party’s nomination to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton’s reelection bid next year, with one candidate formally announcing his campaign Wednesday at the state Capitol.
James Russell III of Little Rock had previously announced on social media that he would seek to challenge Cotton. Russell was among five Democratic candidates in the 2022 gubernatorial primary election, losing to Chris Jones.
“We need elected leaders in office who are willing to work for the people, not for the corporations and not for the special interests,” Russell told reporters Wednesday. “We need someone who will come down and listen to them here in public, have the difficult conversations and then have the spine to stand up for their convictions… That leader, I feel, is me.”
Russell is from Shreveport, Louisiana, and moved to Arkansas in 1991. He holds a bachelor’s degree in general studies from the University of Central Arkansas.
His wife, Wendy Newsam, is a mental health counselor, and Russell’s work running “the business side” of her practice has made him familiar with the mental health field and the health insurance industry, he said.
“I deal with people when they are at their worst because they’re suffering, and to be perfectly honest, a lot of what we’ve seen in the past 11 years has been suffering directly because of policies put in place by people like Tom Cotton,” Russell said.
He criticized Cotton for “begging for funds” from the federal government after severe storms hit Arkansas last year. Cotton has a history of voting against federal disaster relief.
Russell said his political values include standing up for human rights, such as supporting women’s reproductive autonomy and opposing Israel’s mass killings of civilians in occupied Palestinian territory.
He said he believes it’s possible for a Democratic candidate to defeat Cotton, a two-term incumbent in a state that has put Republicans in statewide office consistently for a decade.
“Democrats in this state have a long history of talking about these mythical voters they can’t reach, but I genuinely think it’s because they’re not offering the [right] policies, they’re not speaking to the voters who choose to stay at home” instead of voting, Russell said.

He said he plans to travel throughout the state to connect with voters and will meet with the Lonoke County Democrats on Thursday.
Any of his Democratic primary opponents are welcome to speak at his campaign stops because “it is not all about me, it is all about us” during what he expects to be “a heavily contested but ultimately very fruitful primary season,” Russell said.
Hallie Shoffner, a Newport farmer and businesswoman, was the first Democratic candidate to announce her plans to challenge Cotton in May. Lewisville Mayor Ethan Dunbar filed a Federal Election Commission statement of candidacy in the primary on Aug. 19.
Additionally, Jonathan Pittman of Forrest City and Dan Whitfield of Bella Vista have both filed FEC statements of candidacy in the Democratic Senate primary.
So far no one has announced a campaign or filed paperwork to challenge Cotton in the Republican primary.
Cotton officially announced his re-election campaign on Feb. 27. He was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is chairman of the Intelligence Committee.

Jeff Landry defended the state’s decision to spend $7 million to bring a Saudi Arabia-owned LIV Golf League event to New Orleans next summer. 
The governor announced Wednesday the tournament will take place June 26-28 at Bayou Oaks golf course at New Orleans City Park. It’s a time of year when New Orleans struggles to attract major events because of the high temperatures and humidity. 
“We wanted to try to get something in the city during the summertime,” Landry said in an interview with reporters after his announcement. “We want New Orleans to be a city where people come January to December.”

The tournament will be broadcast internationally, putting Louisiana in front of a global audience, Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois said in an interview. Some of LIV Golf’s largest television audiences are in Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom – all places the state is targeting for business deals. 

“It brings this tournament not only to the United States but around the world as well, so it’s just a great opportunity,” the governor said. 
Landry, Bourgeois and several other New Orleans-area officials gathered at City Park for a flashy, official coming out party for the tournament. It included a DJ, brass band, sparklers and a professional wrestling-style hype man for the governor and LIV Golf representatives. 

Bubba Watson, a Pensacola, Florida, native who is one of the biggest stars on the LIV Golf tour, was also in attendance.

The tour, which launched a competitor to the PGA Tour in 2022, remains controversial. 

Its owner is Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, one of the richest sovereign wealth funds in the world with nearly $1 trillion in assets. The money is overseen by Saudi Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a strongman who has been accused of human rights abuses. 
 U.S. intelligence officials concluded the Prince Mohammed was responsible for the death of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had criticized the Saudi leader in columns for The Washington Post. Saudi officials killed Khashoggi in 2018, while he was visiting the Saudi consulate in Turkey to get documents for his upcoming marriage. 

Landry largely dismissed concerns about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record this week, saying making deals with Saudi officials is nothing new. 

“I think that the Saudis have been doing business with Louisiana for quite some time. God knows how much oil they have sent our refineries,” Landry said. “It’s sort of like, why are we worried?” 
There have also been questions about whether Louisiana should be paying LIV Golf millions of dollars, when the tour has financial resources that dwarf the state’s.

When LIV Golf debuted three years ago, Saudi Arabia’s leadership offered pro golfers far larger sums of money than the PGA Tour, including multimillion-dollar signing bonuses. 

Of the $7 million Louisiana is putting toward the event, $2 million will go toward upgrading the public Bayou Oaks course, and the remaining $5 million will go to LIV Golf as a hosting fee. International golf legend Greg Norman will lead the redesign of the course layout for the event.
“This gives us an opportunity to give City Park a facelift, right, and make it great again,” Landry said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
Louisiana’s $7 million for the LIV Golf tournament comes from the state’s major events incentive fund, which provides public dollars for large tourist-driven events. In the past, the fund has been used to lure the Super Bowl, Essence Festival and NCAA Final Four for men’s basketball to Louisiana. 

Other events getting money from the fund in the state budget for the year that started July 1 include the U.S. Bowling Congress Tournament ($5 million), an Ultimate Fighting Championship event ($1.5 million), the 2026 Southeastern Conference Gymnastics Championship ($750,000), the U.S. Gymnastics National Championships ($750,000), the Barksdale Defenders of Liberty Air Show ($500,000) and the State Fair of Louisiana ($100,000). 
Bourgeois said the state may be giving LIV Golf $5 million, but the golf tour is putting up far more money for the tournament – somewhere in the neighborhood of $55 million to $60 million for this one stop alone. 
State officials have declined to say how many people they think the tournament will bring to New Orleans, but Bourgeois said LIV Golf events in other markets have attracted between 40,000 and 60,000 spectators.

There’s also the question of whether fans will be particularly interested in standing outside in the heat in New Orleans in late June. Bourgeois and Landry are both optimistic that spectators will come to watch golf despite the weather, since other LIV Golf events in other hot climates were successful this year. 
“LIV just played in Singapore and I don’t think it gets hotter than Singapore,” Landry said. “Whether we have to adjust the dates after this go around, we’ll see.” 
Bourgeois said LIV Golf is excited about staging an event in New Orleans because the golf course is in the heart of the city. In other U.S. cities that have hosted LIV events, the golf course is typically further removed from tourist attractions. 

Landry also dismissed questions about the LIV Golf tournament competing with the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, a decades-old PGA Tour event held each spring at the TPC Louisiana golf course in Avondale. 
The governor said he believes PGA and LIV events appeal to different audiences. PGA tournaments tend to be restrained, while LIV incorporates live music and other spectacles to give their events more of a party atmosphere, he said. 
“That’s why I love LIV Golf. There are no quiet signs. It’s a party,” said Landry, who admitted he doesn’t play the sport, in part because he is “not a quiet person.” 

“You got to be quiet at Zurich. You don’t have to be quiet at LIV,” he said in an interview.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LIV-Golf-Adelaide-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 18:58:02.147749

Ben Ray Luján said the 2026 midterm elections would play an important role in addressing the concerns attendees had expressed throughout the night (the fate of education, Social Security and democracy, to name a few).
“It’s going to take a little bit of the midterm to be able to right some of this,” the New Mexico Democrat said, prompting more than one person to call out: “We can’t wait.”
“I know we can’t wait,” he responded. “But I’ll tell you what: When it comes to completely reversing this, we need votes in one of the chambers to put a stop.”
At least one member of the audience had already expressed trepidation about waiting for the midterms, noting that he believed Trump would “do everything possible so that we don’t have midterm elections.”

In an interview this week with Source New Mexico, David Becker, executive director and founder of the nonpartisan, non-profit Washington, D.C.-based Center for Election Innovation & Research, says that concern is not unfounded.
“I think we’re going to need to be very vigilant to make sure that things we took for granted in our history continue to happen,” he said. “I don’t think it’s an automatic that the 2026 election is going to happen. I think it will happen. I think any efforts to try to cancel or postpone the election will fail.”

The voter rolls

One of the most salient signs of the Trump administration’s interest in the 2026 midterm elections came in July, when the U.S. Department of Justice began asking state election officials for their voter rolls.

New Mexico heard from the USDOJ on July 10, when Paul Hayden, senior counsel for the DOJ’s Criminal Division, and Scott Laragy, principal deputy director of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, sent an email to New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver asking to speak with her or an election official about a “potential information sharing agreement.”
The email also referenced a separate request to New Mexico from the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division about “collecting voter information.”
Toulouse Oliver told Source New Mexico her office recently received a follow-up request for that voter information, but never received the initial one.
“We just responded back by saying, ‘Hey, we never actually received a request from you. So, if you’d like to make one, you know, here’s how you go about it.”
Toulouse Oliver said the office typically responds to such requests by sending publicly available information.
“We’re reviewing whether or not we are legally able to prevent sending the private data, which would be Social Security, all dates of birth and driver’s license numbers,” she said. “That’s what the attorneys are currently working on.”
As of publication, the Secretary of State’s Office was slated to speak with officials from the USDOJ on Friday, Aug. 29.
Subsequent emails about the requests, which Source NM reviewed following a public records request, show the Secretary of State’s Office also reached out to the New Mexico Department of Justice after receiving the federal request for a meeting. The two offices already had teamed up in April to denounce Trump’s March executive order regarding elections, which included new rules requiring voters produce proof of citizenship and that all mail-in ballots be received by Election Day. New Mexico also joined a multistate lawsuit challenging the order, which  at present has been temporarily blocked, according to court records. The Trump administration filed an appeal at the end of July.

NMDOJ Chief of Staff Lauren Rodriguez declined Source’s request to make someone available for an interview.
“Because this matter is currently in litigation, the NMDOJ is limited in what we can share at this time,” Rodriguez wrote via email. “We are pleased to be working alongside Secretary Toulouse Oliver’s office on this case and remain committed to addressing the issues at hand.”
State election autonomy
The issues at hand, though multifaceted, fall under the heading of federal intervention into elections. Earlier in August, Trump also said he planned to lead a movement to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines.
For Toulouse Oliver, the moves continue a trajectory that took off in 2020 when Trump challenged the results of the presidential election and so-called “election denialism.”

“I’m trying to be diplomatic, but I have stronger words [about Trump meeting] with a dictator who routinely rigs elections and executes political opponents and getting ideas from him about how to run elections,” she said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, also reportedly a critic of mail-in ballots.
“Mail ballots, obviously, are incredibly secure,” she said, “And the idea of getting rid of voting machines…First of all, the accuracy of the vote count, especially considering how many things are on a ballot, you have exhausted human beings trying to do that, rather than a machine that’s been programmed, tested on the front end, tested on the back end, audited, etc. It’s just a ludicrous idea.”
Toulouse Oliver has testified to Congress about threats to election integrity and election officials more than once, and went to court when the Otero County Commission refused to certify its election results. She’s also run several campaigns geared at debunking election misinformation and anticipates she’ll run another one next year.

“We definitely are intending to do a voter outreach campaign,” she said. “It really just depends on what are the emergent issues at that time. Obviously, election security and mis- and dis-information are sort of continuous…but it’s hard to say a year from now, or even nine months from now, what are going to be the issues that are rising to the surface.”
The federal government’s interest in voter rolls certainly highlights their importance, Becker said.
“I’ve been working on voter lists for almost my entire career,” he said. “Accurate, complete voter lists [are] absolutely essential, and you won’t find any disagreement from the most liberal to the most conservative election official on that, but it is left, constitutionally, and I think very smartly, to the states to do that work.”
Proof of citizenship
Trump’s disputed executive order regarding elections focuses on a Republican-backed push to require proof of citizenship at the polls.
Becker’s organization released research in July on allegations of non-citizen registration and voting in all states, as well as the investigations of those allegations.
“The vast majority of allegations of noncitizen registration or voting appear to arise from misunderstandings, mischaracterizations, or outright fabrications about complex voter data,” the report notes. “When investigations do turn up instances of improper registration or voting, officials take swift action to ensure that American elections remain secure.”
GOP, Trump build on immigration fears to push voting restrictions in states

In other words, “these cases are extremely rare,” Becker said. “States already have adequate tools to flag these records. And by the way…the risk reward analysis for non-citizen voting is extremely weighted against the non-citizen. The non-citizen would know if they get caught, they’re going to face criminal prosecution and deportation, and their possible benefit is to cast one more ballot in an election in which 160 million ballots are cast. It makes no sense.”
A law requiring proof of citizenship,  the “Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act” or “SAVE Act” already passed the U.S. House and is pending in the U.S. Senate. The Trump administration’s reported to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool — intended to help states verify immigration status for people seeking benefit — while seeking voter roll information has also prompted questions about how the Trump administration intends to use the data.
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

 
Whatever the federal administration intends to do with voter roll information, Becker says “that data cannot yield the results they claim. It cannot help them find ineligible voters that the states missed. The states have better data already. It cannot help states keep voter lists more accurate than they already are doing.”
But if the push for voter information isn’t about policy or results, then what is the aim?

“I suspect that this is all being possibly used to set the stage for claiming that future elections are illegitimate when they’re not politically advantageous to the president,” he said.
New Mexico’s midterm elections will also bring about a change for the oversight of future elections. Toulouse Oliver is not eligible to run again. Thus far, three Democrats, two of them county clerks, have filed to run. All the candidates take a dim view of the Trump administration’s outreach to New Mexico’s Secretary of State’s office.
“For me, it is as simple as, if you can control access to the polls, you can control who is the electorate,” Department of Veterans Services Secretary Sonya Smith said. “We know what this is about. We know that this is just another way of hand picking who they want to show up at the polls and to influence the vote.”
Santa Fe County Clerk Katharine Clark noted that the National Association of Counties, for which she said she serves as vice chair on an elections subcommittee, had passed a resolution in July opposing federal interference in local elections.
“The reason why you want your local election official controlling voter data is they know their communities,” she said. “They have a better understanding of who is living in that community, who’s moving in and out of that community, and is a partner in making sure that that voter file is accurate.”
Doña Ana County Clerk Amanda López Askin, who has faced election denialism and death threats in her current position, characterized the Trump administration’s requests for voter roll data as “overreach that really undermines, basically what I view as a checks and balances that is specifically designed to keep elections locally accountable, so to speak.”
Like Becker, she questions the ultimate goal of the federal government’s use of the data.
“The requests aren’t rooted in any kind of evidence of fraud,” she said. “It’s more like a broader political narrative to continue to cast doubt on elections and to maybe even potentially intimidate state officials or county clerks or those of us who do administer elections in our communities…it’s what we often call a solution looking for a problem.”
As for Toulouse Oliver, she’s not running for any other office either. She’s finishing up her Ph.D in political science at the University of New Mexico, she said, and anticipates it will take a few more years for her to finish her dissertation. The topic?

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)While the days of waiting in line at the box office have largely come and gone, online ticket sales have raised repeated headaches with consumers as resellers and bad actors invade the marketplace. 
Rep. Nancy Jenkins-Arno (R-Clayton) said her own experience with a deceitful ticket seller was the driving force that brought her to introduce legislation barring individuals from misleading customers under the guise of selling tickets. 
“My sister was visiting, and my brother and I decided to take her out to a play at the Croswell Opera House in Adrian. And I went online and went to purchase tickets. I thought I was on the Croswell’s webpage and went through the whole process. And by the time I was finished – had made my way through and was gone to check out – It was only then that they had disclosed the full cost of the tickets,” Jenkins-Arno told members of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
The final cost of the tickets was at least double what Jenkins-Arno said she’d initially thought the cost was due to several fees and other charges. 
“I never got the tickets and I had to call my credit card company and ask them to stop payment on that purchase,” Jenkins-Arno said. 
Out of that experience came House Bill 4755, which would place additional provisions in the Michigan Consumer Protections Act to protect Michiganders from fake ticket sellers and unexpected fees. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Specifically, the bill prevents a person from using a website with a domain name or subdomain that features the name of an entertainment venue, the name of an event, or the name of an individual who is scheduled to perform or appear in their URL without prior authorization. 
It also prevents bad actors from using a website with text, images, website design or an internet address that could mislead customers into believing this website belongs to a venue operator without authorization. 
The policy also blocks individuals from selling tickets without disclosing the full price including fees, selling tickets without clearly differentiating between the ticket cost and the cost of fees, displaying any costs in a more prominent way than the total cost, or making a false or misleading disclosure on any component of the ticket’s total cost. 
Additionally, the bill bars individuals from increasing the cost of tickets after initially displaying the cost to the customer, with the exception of two scenarios. The first is if the sale window times out and the consumer has not purchased a ticket. The second is if the increase is due to sales tax or a fee for delivering physical tickets based on the cost of delivery to the consumer’s address or the delivery method selected by the consumer. However, the seller must disclose the amount of each delivery fee.
Brian Young, vice president of the Sports Fans Coalition, a national group advocating for sports fans, gave his support to the policy, 
“Fans deserve a more transparent and fair marketplace. Much like elsewhere in the economy, drip pricing in the live event industry is detrimental to consumers as it inhibits a fan’s ability to accurately comparison shop,” Young said. “When individuals purchase tickets, whether on the primary or secondary market, they are routinely confronted with substantial add on fees atop the tickets face value, much like was discussed earlier, shockingly, these extra costs are seldom, if ever, disclosed in initial advertisements, and they only emerge as the fan enters the checkout process.”
While the Federal Trade Commission’s Junk Fee Rule has largely addressed this issue, having a strong state law in place would help Michigan law enforcement address violations, Young said. 
Additionally, other states have already taken steps to bar bad actors from using websites that mislead consumers to believe they are buying tickets from an official box office, Young said. He noted that Jenkins-Arno’s bill is largely based on Colorado’s law, which is considered the gold standard in banning deceptive websites. 
Representatives from StubHub, Live Nation also offered support for the bill, but did not testify before the committee.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)On Wednesday, Gov. Tony Evers formally requested a presidential disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to direct federal assistance to parts of Wisconsin still dealing with the aftermath of unprecedented rainfall and flooding earlier this month. The request for additional support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance Program includes Milwaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties, as well as support from FEMA’s Public Assistance Program for Door, Grant, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington, and Waukesha counties. 
The move comes following joint preliminary damage assessments conducted by FEMA and Wisconsin Emergency Management in Milwaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties, which found over 1,500 residential structures which were either destroyed or sustained major damage, racking up an estimated price tag of over $33 million. Many people lost homes, personal property or were displaced after the historic, 1,000-year storm, which dumped a summer’s worth of rain in a single day. Scientists have long warned that climate change would lead to more intense rainfall and flooding events in Wisconsin.

Local officials have been on the ground surveying flood damage across neighborhoods. “Having been on the ground to see firsthand some of the areas that have been hit hardest by the disastrous storms and flash floods that have affected folks across our state, it’s clear it’s going to take a significant amount of time and resources to recover,” Evers said in a statement. “My administration and I have been working diligently to respond and support clean-up efforts, but it’s clear more help is needed to support the people of Wisconsin and ensure we can rebuild.”
Evers is calling on Trump to “do the right thing and make the appropriate presidential disaster declaration in coordination with the preliminary damage assessment — and quickly and without delay.” The governor added that, “folks and families whose homes, businesses, schools, and community centers were severely damaged by this severe weather event are counting on this relief.” 
WEM Administrator Greg Engle applauded “the swift and collaborative effort for these assessments” as “a powerful demonstration of unity between counties, the state of Wisconsin, and FEMA to get help to those in crisis after this historical flooding event…The speed and precision in which this was accomplished speaks volumes. When different agencies come together, the road to recovery reaches the people who need it faster.”

Initial damage reports collected by the state suggest that over $43 million in public sector damage occurred across six Wisconsin counties. Residents with damaged property are encouraged to save all receipts for damage repair, and to continue calling 211 to make an official record, which will also help support the case for federal support. FEMA’s ability to provide assistance to Wisconsin has been up in the air as  the Trump administration threatens agency cuts . Recently, several FEMA employees were placed on administrative leave just a day after signing a public letter accusing the Trump administration of politicized firings and “uninformed cost-cutting” at the agency. 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley also announced that preliminary assessments were completed by FEMA on Aug. 22, and that Wisconsin had likely surpassed the threshold to be eligible for federal support. Crowley said that residents “have shown incredible resilience in the face of this disaster,” adding that the completion of FEMA’s assessment is “an important milestone, but it’s just one step in the process toward federal assistance.” Crowley said in a statement that “we will continue to stand with our communities, fight for the resources families need, and keep residents informed every step of the way….This collaboration helps us respond to disasters with both speed and compassion.”
An emergency shelter in Milwaukee established at Marshall High School will close Wednesday due to the start of the school year. Individuals who were housed at the shelter will be moved to the Milwaukee Environmental Sciences Academy (6600 W Melvina St, Milwaukee, WI, 53216). People displaced from their homes are encouraged to call the American Red Cross at 1-800-RED-CROSS for shelter assistance. Volunteers for clean up operations and to help staff the emergency shelters are also still needed.

The partnership allows officials to use more than $2 million that the borough will receive from a national opioid settlement to pay for a wide array of addiction treatment, prevention, recovery, and harm-reduction programs in the region.
The Matanuska-Susitna Borough Assembly unanimously approved the measure during a regular meeting Tuesday.
The funding will be distributed through a borough-run grant program overseen by a committee that will include city representatives as well as addiction treatment advocates, Assistant Borough Manager George Hays said during the meeting. Grants will be distributed over a three- to five-year period, he said.
Just how that money is passed out will follow a plan approved by the Assembly in 2023, which requires the borough to spend 30% of the settlement money on treatment, 30% on prevention, 10% on recovery, 10% on harm reduction, and, for the first five years only, 20% on media efforts about the grant program.
A specific plan for forming the committee is still under development and will be presented to the assembly at a future meeting, Hays said.
Mat-Su has the highest rate of opioid overdoses in Alaska, according to state data. Alaska was one of five states to see an increase in opioid deaths between 2023 and 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The funding is part of more than $50 billion in settlement payments from opioid pharmaceutical companies distributed to states and local governments nationwide. The borough has received $850,000 so far and expects to see up to $3 million by 2038, borough Attorney Nick Spiropoulos said during the meeting. It is one of nine Alaska municipalities to receive the payout, he said.
The borough first received settlement funds in 2023 but has been unable to distribute them beyond training and education programs because it lacks health powers under the state constitution.
The new partnership with the cities will unlock that funding by allowing the borough to distribute the money by temporarily borrowing a limited version of those powers from Palmer, Wasilla, and Houston. Without that arrangement, the borough would need to obtain health powers through a ballot measure.

Rules overseeing the plan, and approved by each of the cities, require the borough to use the shared powers only for opioid addiction treatment-related efforts.
While the Houston and Wasilla city councils unanimously approved the plan earlier this year, the topic sparked tense debate in Palmer.
The types of services allowed under the national settlement, such as needle exchange and Suboxone distribution, could draw individuals seeking those services to city streets, one Palmer city council member said.
“When you want a late-night snack from Taco Bell at nine o’clock at night and you go outside to get in your car, and there’s the Red Cross there – because they’ve been given money to come out into your streets and literally sit out there and hand out needles and Suboxone to the community – then you have people that are running around in your little area where they just handed them out, drugged out on synthetic heroin. I’m sorry, but that’s what’s going to happen here,” Council member Victoria Hudson said during a July 8 Palmer City Council meeting. “It’s going to be really crazy when you have a naked person taking a shower on your front porch.”
Borough officials said they have no specific plans to fund needle exchange or Suboxone programs. Any grant applications will require committee approval, they said. The cities may also revoke the shared powers at any time, according to the measure.
The Palmer City Council ultimately approved the health powers measure in a 5-1 vote, with Hudson voting no.

Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia said Wednesday that it was “probable” Orange County employees tried to hide information when his DOGE team began examining spending practices with the county government.
Therefore, he said, he was issuing investigative subpoenas to all county employees his office believes were involved in grant programs for DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) efforts.
Ingoglia made those remarks while speaking at a press conference with Gov. Ron DeSantis in Orlando.
DeSantis said some of the staff seemed to be reading from a prepared script, which he believes raises suspicions.
“They wouldn’t fully answer the questions and really left a lot of our folks not satisfied that they were getting all the answers that they could. So there’s a lot of different things to unpack here,” the governor said.
DOGE auditors had received a tip from “someone inside county government” that employees were changing the names of files to obscure certain key words, Ingoglia said — specifically, diversity, equity, and inclusion. His staff ended up gathering about 1.2 million emails related to six grants that had been given out for DEI programs. During the search of those million emails, he said, five of those grants were never alluded to.
“So, I wonder what happened with those emails?” he said. “So, it’s telling me that it is probable that we have county employees [who] tried to hide some of this information.”
‘Freaking out’
Auditors with Florida DOGE — Department of Government Efficiency — have conducted onsite audits throughout the state since DeSantis named Ingoglia as chief financial officer in July, including Broward, Hillsborough, Pinellas, and Orange counties and cities like St. Petersburg and Gainesville.
Ingoglia suggested he was probably “freaking out Orange County employees” when describing the subpoenas, and urged them when they are interviewed to be truthful. (He did not call out any employees by name during the press conference).
“Don’t lie to us, because, if we have to, we will bring in FDLE and digital forensic units to find out exactly who did what, so please be truthful with us,” he said.
This is not the first time Ingoglia has claimed unnamed sources had informed his agency that local officials in governments targeted with DOGE audits have tried to delete or hide financial information, but this is the first time his office is going to investigate.
DeSantis and Ingoglia have been campaigning for more than a month on the promise that Floridians will vote on a proposed constitutional amendment in November 2026 that will either substantially reduce or outright eliminate property taxes for those who own homestead properties in the state — something no other state has ever done.
The measure is likely to be proposed during next year’s legislative session, although what it will say has not been determined at this time.
The two Republicans argue it’s important to detect any questionable spending now to get ahead of complaints by local government officials that reducing or eliminating property taxes would severely harm services like public safety.
DeSantis later dismissed comments by Orange County officials that they have complied with all of the requests made by Ingoglia’s DOGE team.
“The CFO would not have issued the subpoenas if all of the questions were answered,” the governor said.
“This is not performative. He wants answers and, under the law, he’s entitled to answers. And I know you haven’t seen CFOs necessarily flex those muscles in the past. This has been part of their authority for a long time.” He added that the CFO’s office received more authority regarding local government spending in the most recent state budget.
The Phoenix has reached out to Orange County officials for comment, and will update this story if that is provided.

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)MINNEAPOLIS — Two children, ages 8 and 10, were killed by a shooter who opened fire outside Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis, where students at the Catholic school were gathered Wednesday for Mass to celebrate the beginning of the school year.
Another 17 people were injured — 14 children and three parishioners in their 80s — and are being treated at area hospitals. One adult and six children were in critical condition Wednesday afternoon, according to Hennepin Healthcare.
Annunciation Principal Matt DeBoer said teachers acted within seconds of gunfire erupting to shelter children under pews.
“It could have been significantly worse without their heroic action,” DeBoer said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “We lost two angels today. Please continue to pray for those still receiving care. We can’t change the past, but we can do something about the future.”

The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, barricaded the door of the church with plywood and shot dozens of rounds through the window using a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.
“The coward that shot these victims took his own life in the rear of the church,” O’Hara said.
Outside the school after the shooting, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.
Susan Ruff, a neighbor whose children attended the school at Annunciation and has a grandson currently enrolled, said she saw the shooting from her window.
She witnessed a man dressed in black, wearing a helmet, with a long gun, shooting at the church from the outside. She heard 25 or 30 gun shots. “It sounded like someone was dropping a dumpster. That loud bang. But I kept hearing it, so I thought, that’s not a dumpster.” Her grandson was unhurt in the shooting.
Westman purchased the weapons legally and did not have a criminal record, O’Hara said. He said law enforcement were not seeking other suspects.
Court records show a Mary Westman, who retired from Annunciation Catholic School in 2021 according to a now-deleted Facebook post, requested a name change for her child from Robert to Robin in 2019 saying “minor identifies as female.” O’Hara said he could not confirm the suspect’s connection to the school or that the suspect changed their name.
O’Hara said investigators believe Westman is behind a video scheduled to post on YouTube on Wednesday morning, which has since been taken down. The video opened with a four-page handwritten screed that begins, “I don’t expect forgiveness … I do apologize for the effects my actions will have on your lives.”
It also showed an arsenal of guns and ammunition with writing on them reading “Where Is Your God?” and “Suck On This!” Other writings, some in Russian, target President Donald Trump and wish death upon Jewish people.
Numerous law enforcement agencies were on the scene including the FBI, ATF and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office.
O’Hara said law enforcement are executing four search warrants, one at the church and three others at residences in the metro area connected to the suspect where firearms are being recovered.
“We are all working tirelessly to uncover the full scope of what happened, to try and identify a motive, why it happened, and whether there are any other further details,” O’Hara said.

Neighbors and former students said they were shaken by the shooting in the typically quiet southwestern Minneapolis neighborhood.
Jack Freedman, 25, went to the school and lives in the area. He said, “You never think that it’s going to happen at the school you went to, but then you start thinking how naïve to believe that. Because it happens everywhere.”
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, speaking at a news conference outside the school, called for action — not just thoughts and prayers, which has become a rote response to mass shootings.
“Don’t just say, this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” he said. “These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.”
Vigils are planned Wednesday night for the victims. Annunciation Church announced a prayer vigil at 7 p.m. in the Holy Angels Gym. Anti-gun violence group Moms Demand Action announced a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m. at Minneapolis Lynnhurst Park.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Democratic lawmakers want to align gun laws for Wisconsin colleges and universities with those in place for K-12 schools by prohibiting concealed carry on campuses.
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Rep. Brienne Brown (D-Whitewater) said during a press conference Wednesday that the bill would help protect students at a time when schools continue to be targets of gun violence.
“We know that responsible gun safety measures, when they’re implemented in states — they do work. They reduce the incidence of firearm injury and death,” Roys said. “But we have a patchwork across the country. Until more states and the federal government step forward to enact gun safety measures, we are still going to make a public policy choice that allows an unprecedented amount of gun violence in this country.” 
The bill would ban possession of a firearm on public and private college campuses even with a permit. If someone violated the prohibition, they would be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
State law currently prohibits people from carrying a gun in a building owned by the state, but this does not apply to someone with a license to carry a concealed weapon. 
Wisconsin’s concealed carry law does not permit people to be armed in certain buildings owned by the state including police stations, prisons, courthouses and schools, and if someone violates this, they are guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. This doesn’t currently include college or university buildings.
Colleges do have the option, under state law, to post notice on a building to prevent someone from entering with a firearm. In this case, a person, even with a license, would be guilty of trespassing and is subject to a Class B forfeiture, which is a forfeiture not to exceed $1,000.
While there is not a state statute prohibiting concealed carry on campuses, University of Wisconsin system policy does prohibit people from carrying, possessing or using any dangerous weapon on university property and in university buildings and facilities, including dorms.
The bill has a slim number of exceptions including for a law enforcement officer, for military personnel in the line of duty and for someone who possesses the firearm for use in a program approved by the university or college, such as if the school has a shooting range. 
Lawmakers made the announcement just a few hours after reports of a shooting four-and-a-half hours away from the Wisconsin State Capitol at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. Students, who attend the Catholic school, had gathered for mass to celebrate the start of the school year. Two children are dead and 17 others, including 14 children, were injured. 
Brown, who represents UW-Whitewater, said she had just heard the news out of Minneapolis. 
“I’m pretty frustrated,” said Brown, who was tearing up. She said she has been constantly asked by students, staff and faculty what can be done about gun violence at universities, adding that they can’t handle the issue on their own. 
“This is a generation that has grown up with school lockdown drills. We have absorbed images of children dying at the hands of armed shooters,” Brown said. “We have witnessed adults doing nothing about it or weakening the laws that were already in place… School should not be another place where they can be victimized by gun violence. As the mother of teens who will soon be off to college, we need to do better.”
According to a CNN review of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety, there have been 44 school shootings in the U.S. this year, as of August 27. Of those, 22 were on college campuses. 
Wisconsin Democrats’ proposal also comes amid about a dozen college campuses across several states, including Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, facing disruptions this week due to hoax calls reporting school shooters. UW-Madison received an unsubstantiated call about an active shooter on Monday. According to WPR, the call was determined to be false quickly, so the campus did not activate its campus emergency alert system. 
Nessa Bleill, founder and president of the University of Wisconsin-Madison chapter of Students Demand Action and a survivor of a mass shooting at a parade in Illinois in 2022, said she has feared for her life at school since kindergarten. 
“I fear for my life on campus now, going to class each day with the knowledge that, at any moment, my lecture hall might become the site of a shooting, my classmates the victims shown on television, my parents the ones receiving frantic texts of ‘I love you,’” Bleill said. “This fear lives in the mind of every American student… We deserve better than this violent reality and the fear it causes…. There is a solution to this fear — ensuring that no kid has any reason to be scared for their life at school — that solution, however, takes action from students like me and especially action from lawmakers.”
Roys said the legislation could also help reduce incidents of suicides among students. 
“One-third of college students have contemplated suicide within the past year,” Roys said. “As we know that suicide by gun is the most lethal form that it can take. With access to a gun, 90% of suicides are completed… but if you do not have access to a gun, only 4% of suicide attempts are completed. This is an important, life-saving measure.” 
Support from Republican lawmakers, who hold the majority in the Assembly and Senate, will be necessary for the bill to advance. 
Roys said the bill will be circulating for cosponsorship, but seemed to doubt Republicans would support the proposal.
“Republicans have been pretty reticent to sign on to gun safety regulation,” Roys said, adding that gun control measures are supported by an array of voters. 
The bill authors noted in a press release that Republicans have not signed on to other proposals Democrats have introduced this legislative session. Some of those bills include one requiring a 48-hour waiting period to purchase a gun, one prohibiting undetectable firearms, one requiring gun owners to store their firearms in a safe if they live with a child and one prohibiting the sale of firearms without a background check and going through a federally licensed firearms dealer.
Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill to create a sales tax exemption for gun safes to encourage more gun owners to purchase them and another bill that would allow teachers to carry guns in the classroom as a way to address school shootings.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)North Carolina Democratic leaders on Wednesday called out Republican legislators for failing to pass a state budget, warning of consequences for state employees and vulnerable populations. 
At a press conference in the legislative building, Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch and House Democratic Leader Robert Reives criticized Republican colleagues for their failure to pass a budget in the fourth consecutive legislative session.
The General Assembly adjourned in late July with no deal on the two-year spending plan, passing a resolution to meet only one day a month until the 2026 short session begins in April. 
Batch drew a parallel between the budget failure and the financial realities of ordinary citizens. “Every hard working North Carolinian knows you can’t run a household without a budget,” Batch said. “Parents across this state sit at the kitchen table late into the night trying to make their dollars stretch, because if they don’t, their families will suffer.” 
Batch also warned that the budget failure threatens an ankle monitoring system that protects victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Calling it a “disgrace,” she said “imagine telling a mother, a daughter, a victim of violence, that her safety hangs in the balance because Republicans at the state legislature can’t do their job.”
House Democrats, Reives said, had initially supported the Republican budget proposal as a good-faith compromise. “We showed a willingness to understand that we’re not going to get everything we want,” he said, “but that we can contribute to the process nonetheless.” 
The Democratic leaders accused Republican legislators of prioritizing tax cuts for wealthy constituents over meaningful investments in public education, healthcare and state infrastructure.
Impact on Education
The budget impasse has broader implications for North Carolina’s workforce and economic stability, affecting both state employees and public schools. State employees face uncertainty about raises and job security, while schools are relying on a stopgap spending plan that only covers immediate needs.
The “mini-budget” bill Gov. Josh Stein signed this month, House Bill 125, prevents disruptions in state operations after lawmakers failed to agree on a comprehensive budget before temporarily adjourning for the summer.
“This Band-Aid budget fails to invest in our teachers and students, fails to keep families safe, fails to value hardworking state employees, and fails to fully fund health care,” the governor said in a statement after signing the bill.
But the temporary plan leaves out the kind of multi-year commitments districts count on to launch new programs, fill long-term positions, or undertake major building projects.
The Democrats called for an immediate return to legislative session and criticized Republican leadership for what they described as a “wait and see” approach that leaves state residents in a precarious position. 
Reives also blasted Republican lawmakers for what he called a misplaced focus on “culture war” bills.
“Not one of these culture war bills puts more money in your pocket,” Reives said. “Not one of these bills brings your prices down or gets your healthcare costs under control.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xgr_826.jpg,,,2025-08-27 17:57:08.585738

He originally selected former Florida U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon to run the CDC shortly after he secured election to the Oval Office in November. But the White House pulled Weldon’s nomination in March, after it appeared he couldn’t secure the votes needed for confirmation.Later that month, Trump announced his plans to nominate Monarez in a social media post.“Dr. Monarez brings decades of experience championing Innovation, Transparency, and strong Public Health Systems,” Trump wrote. “She has a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, and PostDoctoral training in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine.“As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Monarez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future. Americans have lost confidence in the CDC due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement.

The committee voted 12-11 in July to send her nomination to the Senate floor, where Republicans approved her to the post later that month. Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., said during the committee’s markup that he believed Monarez would put science first and help to restore public trust in the agency. “The United States needs a CDC director who makes decisions rooted in science, a leader who will reform the agency and work to restore public trust in health institutions,” Cassidy said at the time. “With decades of proven experience as a public health official, Dr. Monarez is ready to take on this challenge.”",,,,2025-08-27 17:57:08.585738

Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign.”The statement from Monarez’s attorneys came just hours after the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, wrote on social media that she was no longer running the agency. “Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” the post stated. “We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at@CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.”The Washington Post first reported the news. The U.S. Senate voted along party lines to confirm Monarez as CDC director in late July, giving her just weeks in one of the nation’s top public health roles.Monarez’s last post on social media from her official account was on Aug. 22, marking the death of a police officer after a gunman opened fire at the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta. “A large group of CDC employees and I attended today's memorial for Officer David Rose, whose Tour of Duty ended on August 8 when he responded to shots fired,” Monarez wrote. “He leaves behind a legacy of love, courage, and service to the community that will never be forgotten.”Monarez second choice after WeldonMonarez was President Donald Trump’s second choice for CDC director. He originally selected former Florida U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon to run the CDC shortly after he secured election to the Oval Office in November. But the White House pulled Weldon’s nomination in March, after it appeared he couldn’t secure the votes needed for confirmation.Later that month, Trump announced his plans to nominate Monarez in a social media post.“Dr. Monarez brings decades of experience championing Innovation, Transparency, and strong Public Health Systems,” Trump wrote. “She has a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, and PostDoctoral training in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine.“As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Monarez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future. Americans have lost confidence in the CDC due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement. Dr. Monarez will work closely with our GREAT Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert Kennedy Jr. Together, they will prioritize Accountability, High Standards, and Disease Prevention to finally address the Chronic Disease Epidemic and, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN!”Restoring trust in CDCMonarez testified in front of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions in June as part of her confirmation process. The committee voted 12-11 in July to send her nomination to the Senate floor, where Republicans approved her to the post later that month. Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., said during the committee’s markup that he believed Monarez would put science first and help to restore public trust in the agency. “The United States needs a CDC director who makes decisions rooted in science, a leader who will reform the agency and work to restore public trust in health institutions,” Cassidy said at the time. “With decades of proven experience as a public health official, Dr. Monarez is ready to take on this challenge.”",,,,2025-08-27 19:58:10.251318

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas officials brought clarity to a new law that bans financial contributions from foreign nationals to campaigns for or against state constitutional amendments, a law at the center of an ongoing lawsuit.
The case in federal court has stagnated while parties waited for the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission, formerly known as the governmental ethics commission, to straighten out details of the law.
A Wednesday meeting was one of the first times commissioners were able to publicly weigh the law’s framework and craft rules for enforcement. Now, it’s up to a judge whether the court case will continue.
In a motion to dismiss the case filed June 16, the defendants, who include commission members and staff, argued that the lawsuit was premature.
“Premature federal intervention would usurp the Commission’s delegated authority under the Kansas Campaign Finance Act, raise substantial federalism concerns, and require this Court to interpret a state campaign finance statute in the first instance, despite the Kansas Legislature’s express delegation of that authority to the Commission,” a June court filing said.
The law, which was passed as House Bill 2106 during the 2025 legislative session, went into effect July 1. It targets organizations that accept financial contributions from foreign donors. The advocacy organization that brought the suit, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, attempted to block the law without success. Leaders of the organization have advocated against constitutional amendments in the past, namely the 2022 amendment allowing lawmakers to ban abortion, and have said they intend to do so in the future.
The commission unanimously approved details such as paperwork establishing expenditure reporting requirements and a 48-hour window for reporting those expenditures.
Tess Ramirez, a commissioner, attorney and advocate, said during the meeting that requiring paper copies of expenditure reports within 48 hours was “unreasonable.” She urged offering a digital option, which would be up to the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office to create.
The lawsuit has not seen any activity since June 30, when Judge Daniel Crabtree denied Kansans for Constitutional Freedom’s request for a preliminary injunction, which would have prevented the law from going into effect. Attorneys gave notice in July of the commission’s intention to discuss the law at an upcoming meeting.
The lawsuit named nine members of the commission; the commission’s executive director, Wade Wiebe; and Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who can bring criminal charges under the law against anyone who violates its provisions. The commission can bring civil action against anyone who violates the law.
It was one of a handful of laws the Legislature passed this year that fall under the commission’s purview. One law increased campaign contribution limits for certain elected offices, House Bill 2054. Another loosened rules for state officials accepting free or specially discounted tickets to entertainment, sporting events or recreational activities, House Bill 2060.
As the commission’s responsibility grows and its budget tightens, staffing issues have proved to be roadblocks to progress. The Legislature implemented 1.5% cuts to all state departments’ operating budgets for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
The commission’s general counsel position has been empty for five months. A general counsel is an in-house attorney offering key legal advice to a board or commission. The position is currently listed as offering an $82,000 annual salary for full-time, in-person work, but commissioners recognized something needed to change. Without a general counsel, the commission cannot conduct hearings or fully authorize opinions.
The vacancy has stalled business, said Nick Hale, chairman of the commission.
Two attorneys from the Kansas Attorney General’s Office are filling in while the search continues. In recent months, no more than four candidates have applied for the position, said Wiebe, who took over the role as executive director earlier this year.
Commissioners unanimously approved Wednesday to update the job listing to include an annual salary range up to $90,000 and a hybrid option allowing for one remote work day.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin ushered through a slate of amendments to the party rules Tuesday meant to make the Democrats’ governing body more inclusive.
Martin presented eight amendments to the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting in downtown Minneapolis on Tuesday, and all were approved with strong support.
“This package of reforms is historic. It is transformative. It’s inclusive. It helps us rebuild trust with voters, and it gives people…a sense that we listen, and we learn — that we will do better, and that we are open and inclusive,” Martin said.
Earlier in the day, tensions among DNC members were on display as they debated whether to approve a resolution outlining the party’s stance on Israel’s war in Gaza, ultimately deciding to postpone the issue for now. Martin is also confronting early dissatisfaction with his leadership, flagging donations and a voter base anxious to fight back against President Donald Trump.
Tuesday evening, however, Martin found strong support in favor of rule changes that would place limits on his own power.
The rule changes reduce the number of members selected by the party chair and instead gives those slots to the party’s Asian American and Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ and Native American caucuses; increase the scope and oversight powers of the budget committee; limit the number of chair-appointed members who serve on the party’s major committees; and require DNC staff and officers to stay neutral in Democratic primary races.
The rule requiring Democratic officers to remain neutral comes on the heels of a bitter dispute between party leaders and former DNC Vice Chair David Hogg. The 25-year-old gun safety activist was pushed out of his official party role over his plans to fund younger politicians’ primary challenges to older Democrats in safe districts.
And, in 2016, supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign accused the DNC of backing his opponent Hillary Clinton in the primary race.
The neutrality policy means “you can’t help your friends who are running,” Martin told the committee members.
Shasti Conrad, chair of the Washington State Democratic Party and one of Martin’s vice chair appointees, said the neutrality policy is “incredibly important.”
“For far too long, I think many people — progressives, people of color, young people — have felt that at times, institutions like these have put thumbs on the scales and have made it harder for people to be able to feel like they have a fair chance,” Conrad said.
Martin, the former chair of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, founded and led the Association of State Democratic Chairs. Martin leaned on his state party connections to win his campaign to lead the DNC, and he delivered for those state parties on Tuesday by putting forth an amendment that would give state party chairs and vice chairs a minimum of 25% of the seats on all major DNC committees.
Behind the scenes and sometimes in public view, DNC members are lobbying for their states to be one of the early primary states. For decades, Iowa was the first state in the nation to begin the process of selecting presidential nominees; under former President Joe Biden, that honor was conferred instead on South Carolina as a nod to the Black voters who helped Biden to victory in 2020.
Rules and Bylaws Committee co-chair Minyon Moore said next month states will begin the process of making their case for the early primary window.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A federal judge Tuesday threw out what he called a “novel and potentially calamitous” attempt by the Trump administration to sue the entire federal court in Maryland over an order that put a two-day pause on deportations.
When a party disagrees with a court action, there is “a tried-and-true recourse,” wrote Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia — file an appeal. But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk, and the court itself.
Given recent conflicts between the White House and the courts, “it’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely,” wrote Cullen, who was nominated by Trump in 2019. “Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”
But judges enjoy broad immunity for judicial acts, wrote Cullen in a 37-page ruling, adding that when co-equal branches of government are involved, “there is no right — express or implied — to litigate that grievance in this manner.”
“Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” wrote Cullen, who was assigned the case because of the conflict of Maryland judges hearing it.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Judge George L. Russell III, chief judge of the Maryland district and the prime target of the administration’s lawsuit.
It was Russell’s order in May that sparked the lawsuit. Faced with a flood of habeas corpus petitions from immigrants facing deportation under the administration’s amped-up immigration enforcement, Russell ordered that deportations of those petitioning the court would be put on hold for at least two days, so that judges could schedule and review their cases.
On June 25, the Justice Department announced that it filed a complaint against the Maryland District Court judges, arguing that they had exceeded their authority with the 48-hour freeze on deportations because it interfered with the administration’s exclusive right to enforce immigration law.
“President Trump’s executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a written statement at the time. “The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.”
But Cullen agreed with the Maryland judges that the Trump administration chose the wrong avenue to raise its issues with Russell’s order.
“If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” Cullen said. “And under normal circumstances, it would not be surprising if the Executive raised these concerns through the channels Congress prescribed — that is, by challenging the orders as applied to a particular habeas proceeding through a direct appeal to the Fourth Circuit or, as expressly authorized by federal statute, by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules.”
“All of this isn’t to say that the Executive is without any recourse; far from it,” Cullen wrote. “If the Executive truly believes that Defendants’ standing orders violate the law, it should avail itself of the tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants: It should appeal.”
Stunt?
Mark Graber, regents professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, believes that the case was more of a stunt than an earnest legal challenge from the Trump administration.
“Issuing an injunction against judges is a guaranteed loser,” he said. “What the Trump people were trying to accomplish may simply to have been noise and publicity …  Whether they really thought they could ever win this case is doubtful — and if somebody thought that they should ever win that case, that person should be fired for incompetence.”
Graber said that allowing the case to move forward would have “fundamentally changed the way our judicial system works.”
“The implications would be startling,” he said. “This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision. That’s not the way the separation of powers works. There’s a judicial system; it has a way of correcting errors – it’s called appeals.”
Graber compared the case to being charged for a crime in Maryland and then asking a judge in another state to issue an injunction against the judge who handed down the sentence.
“This is Law 101 — it is Law 101 to the point where virtually all non-lawyers know this,” he said.
Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.
“What the Trump administration is claiming – and this is not a horrible legal argument – is that the court could only issue orders with respect to the people before the court,” Graber said.
“There’s a legitimate debate on this, and if they appealed it, who knows what the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court would have done?” he said. “The problem is they didn’t appeal it in the normal way.”

Discrepancies between Vergennes’ tax maps and city charter have left some residents unsure which municipality they actually live in, and worried about impacts to city finances.

Vergennes and Panton officials are attempting to clarify the boundary between the municipalities, after local officials identified a discrepancy between Vergennes tax maps and the city charter. The inconsistency may also have repercussions for other surrounding communities. 
Vergennes’ tax maps show the city occupying over 1,600 acres, whereas the city’s charter sets the municipal limits at 1,200 acres. A recent survey resurfaced decades-old questions about the city’s boundary lines that current leaders are now trying to resolve. 
The uncertainty has left some Vergennes residents unsure which municipality they will end up living in. Others have concerns about the financial implications of a boundary change, while officials hope an agreement between the municipalities can be reached smoothly and with relative speed.
The land in question between Vergennes and Panton totals some 178 acres of residential and commercial property, and both municipal governments will need to agree — through discussion or arbitration — to any new boundary proposal for approval by the state legislature.
At a packed Vergennes Fire Department on Tuesday evening, mayor Chris Bearor called to order “the first of probably many meetings” on the Panton boundary. Several meetings have also been held in Panton.
At times, Tuesday’s meeting grew contentious.
Travis Scribner, who lives on part of the disputed land, said if the boundary moves, he effectively “didn’t get to choose which town I get to live in.”
“I’ve been a resident of Vergennes for 22 years,” he said after the meeting. “It’s really a bizarre situation.”
Martha DeGraaf, a longtime Panton resident, said Wednesday that while she didn’t want to be “stomped all over by Vergennes anymore,” the tone of the previous day’s meeting was “not healthy.”
“We are two strong communities, and we can come together and find a reasonable solution,” she said.

‘Significant discrepancies’
Historical documents provided by Vergennes and Panton municipalities indicate that officials became aware of the boundary issue in the 1990s, when correspondence on the subject was exchanged between residents, Ferrisburgh officials, legal representatives, and then-Secretary of State Jim Milne.
A 1995 letter from Bob Mitchell, a member of the Ferrisburgh Historical Society, described “significant discrepancies” at several of Vergennes’ borders with the surrounding towns, which included not only Panton but Ferrisburgh and Waltham as well. 
Talks between Vergennes and the latter two towns have not yet begun. Ferrisburgh officials declined to comment on the issue, and the Waltham town office did not respond to requests for comment.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Vergennes Alderman Mark Koenig called the current issue with Panton “the first of three,” and anticipates future talks with the other two affected towns.
The current tax maps in Vergennes were drawn in the early 1990s by former city manager Mel Hawley, who said he used a combination of property surveys and town highway markers as his main reference points. 
Hawley said in an interview he was aware of the discrepancy between the tax map and the city charter, but that a “mountain of evidence” dating back to 1788 shows Vergennes encompassing more than 1,600 acres rather than the 1,200 stated in the charter. He also referenced a now-amended statute which stated that, in the absence of a clear boundary, mutually agreed town boundaries lasting over a century would be binding.
The disagreement was never resolved.

Tim Cowan, a local surveyor who first worked on the issue 30 years ago and has been hired again this year, said because of statutory complications — which have since changed — and a lack of perceived urgency, the discussion of Vergennes’ borders “just kinda went to sleep.”
Vergennes City Manager Ron Redmond said the issue had arisen again partly because of a grant from the Addison County Regional Planning Commission to explore a potential highway bypass of Vergennes to avoid extreme truck traffic through town. The state-sponsored study included a survey of town boundary lines, he said.
‘A functional resolution’
Redmond said he and Panton Town Manager Kyle Rowe had a shared goal of making any town line transition as smooth as possible. They have proposed, for example, guaranteeing access to the Vergennes sewer system for customers it currently serves.
“The only thing that should change is where you vote and where you pay your taxes,” Rowe said.

Vergennes resident Craig Miner said he was concerned moving the boundary would cause the city to give up land that could become more valuable in the future (a rough valuation of the 178 acres of property is about $10 million). Miner is also worried that taxes will increase due to the change.
“I think it’ll separate the community and create a dysfunctional combination of towns,” he said. “I think there’s a lot at stake.”
Rowe and Redmond have made a “starting proposal” for a new boundary, which would give some land to Panton while retaining certain parcels in Vergennes that might be more complicated to transfer. Rowe estimated the change would cause a roughly 1-cent tax increase for Vergennes residents. Since both municipalities use the same regional schools, education taxes won’t be significantly impacted.
While any land Vergennes gives to Panton could potentially gain value, Redmond added, recent speculation about the extent of its future worth was “maybe not realistic.”

“I understand the concern (from) community members who are being impacted by this proposal,” Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes, said.
In addition to representing the city, Birong chairs the House Committee on Government Operations and Military Affairs, which would review any proposed changes to the city’s charter or boundary lines.
“Last night left me encouraged that we’ll find a functional resolution to this long-standing border issue,” Birong said Wednesday.

Each was given a year of probation and ordered to pay $28,000 in restitution for dumping about 10 barrels of oilfield waste on BLM property in Carbon County.
The post Two oilfield workers sentenced for illegal dumping on federal land in southern Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","A judge this week sentenced two Wyoming residents to one year of supervised probation and ordered them to pay $28,330 in restitution for their roles in illegally dumping oilfield waste on federal land in Carbon County.
Darwin Crawford and Mark Orchard, both of Baggs, pleaded guilty earlier this year to “willful injury and depredation of government property,” according to the U.S. Department of Justice. U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson handed down their sentences Monday.
The oilfield supervisors allegedly instructed “crew members” to dump about 10 barrels of waste “generated from oil-water separators and maintenance operations performed on produced water storage tanks” at the East Echo Springs Saltwater disposal facility in the spring of 2018, court documents state. The facility is located on U.S. Bureau of Land Management property southwest of Rawlins.
“The defendants instructed other crew members to ‘dig a hole and dump stuff from the junk tank’ into the pit, and to backfill the hole,” the DOJ said. Petroleum hydrocarbon levels at the illegal dump site measured 11,000-15,200 parts per million compared to a level of 18 ppm for an uncontaminated soil sample, according to a BLM investigation cited by the DOJ.

Crawford and Orchard worked as field operation managers for Crowheart Energy, which “cooperated fully in the prosecution,” according to Lori Hogan, a DOJ public affairs contractor. A roustabout for another company was part of a crew asked to do the dumping and notified the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which initiated an investigation, then handed it over to the BLM.
“The defendants’ actions caused permanent damage to U.S. lands owned by the taxpayers and endangered potential nesting sites” for the greater sage grouse and sage thrasher, Hogan told WyoFile via email.
Crowheart Energy cleaned the dumping site in 2024 to meet BLM standards, Hogan added. Multiple state and federal regulatory agencies confirmed with WyoFile that no company was cited for violations related to the criminal activity.
Reached by WyoFile, an attorney representing Crawford declined to comment. An attorney representing Orchard has yet to respond to WyoFile’s inquiry.
Both men pleaded guilty as part of an agreement with prosecutors, court records show. The terms of those plea deals were sealed, but when government lawyers asked earlier this year to reschedule the men’s sentencing dates, they noted that both defendants, as part of the agreement, pleaded guilty to a less severe version of the “willful injury and depredation of government property” charge.
The original charge carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But the lesser charge — which is for damage less than $1,000 — carries a maximum penalty of a year behind bars.
A second charge against both men, “knowing and willful use of public lands in violation of Interior Department regulations,” was dismissed, according to court documents.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Ten mostly Spanish-speaking unionized janitors waited for a half hour outside a conference room at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport Wednesday morning as airport officials met in closed session to discuss a new contract for janitorial services.
The workers, organized under SEIU 32BJ, hoped to stop the Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s (RIAC) board of directors from reducing the number of hours they work per month in the proposal under consideration.
But after the board returned to open session and the workers tasked with keeping T.F. Green clean were ushered back into the room, there was no opportunity for public comment. Instead, all five board members present voted to authorize CEO Iftikhar Ahmad to begin contract negotiations with the lowest bidder among seven janitorial service companies that responded to a 163-page Notice of Intent. 
The name of the vendor was not given during the vote.
A minute after the public session resumed, the meeting adjourned. 
“So what just happened is that they gave permission for the CEO to sign the contract — but they haven’t yet,” Roxana Martinez-Gracias, a communications specialist for the union, interpreted in Spanish to the workers. “We are doing everything we can to make sure that the contract has the sufficient number of hours and workers.”
One of the workers shrugged. “We have no choice,” he said in English.
Janitorial services have been handled for the past 15 years by Denmark-based ISS Facilities, but airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said the company chose not to bid on a new five-year contract after its current one expires at the end of October.
Airport officials seemed to appreciate the opportunity to move on from ISS Facilities with a new vendor.
“RIAC has been dissatisfied with their performance and has received multiple complaints from airline partners regarding the cleanliness of certain areas of the airport,” Fischer said in an emailed statement.
A spokesperson for ISS Facilities acknowledged a request for comment but did not provide one as of late Wednesday afternoon.
Fischer declined to name the vendor selected by the board. The Warwick Beacon reported Aug. 21 that California-based SBM Corporation was set to receive a contract worth $6.5 million from the airport. 
A receptionist who answered the phone at SBM said she would pass on a request for comment from Rhode Island Current.
Despite the concerns of airport officials, the cleanliness of T.F. Green helped  the Warwick airport reach the distinction of being the best in the world, according to Travel + Leisure magazine.
The airport’s board of directors delayed an Aug. 14 vote on entering contract negotiations after the union raised concerns that bid language suggested a dozen of the 26 full time janitors would be off the job. 
That staffing cut was based on a cost proposal sheet that noted janitors would work a collective 2,700 hours per month over the five-year contract terms. Under prior contracts, janitors worked between 4,300 hours and 5,000 per month, Kevin Brown, executive vice president for the union, said in a phone interview ahead of the meeting.
“The last place you want to slash staffing is in an airport with high usage,” Brown said. “I just don’t know what they’re thinking.”
Brown said janitors earn on average about $17.70 an hour and receive benefits including paid time off and health insurance.

Fischer said airport officials determined the max cap of 2,700 hours “thorough evaluation of current service levels” and that any critique of the hours required is “misplaced.”
“The focus should instead be on comparing these hours to the actual hours worked by the current provider, which are only one-third of what’s being requested,” he said.
Fischer said airport officials believe the new hour requirements will actually increase cleaning service time by 37%. But that’s not how one janitor sees it.
“The airport has grown, they’re remodeling, and the bathrooms are huge,” Maria Cole, who worked as an airport janitor for nearly 22 years, told Rhode Island Current in Spanish after the meeting. “To have less people will cause more problems.”
But that’s assuming Cole will still even be among those working should RIAC execute a new contract. At 75, she acknowledged she should probably retire soon. But Cole said she still enjoys working at the airport.
“I still have plenty of energy to do this job,” she said.
Absent from Wednesday’s board meeting were Vice Chairman Michael Traficante and Deborah Thomas.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Supreme Court Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman, the first woman to serve on the state’s high court and its longest-serving current member, announced her retirement effective Oct. 31.
Miller-Lerman was appointed to the seven-member state Supreme Court in 1998 by former Gov. Ben Nelson, the state’s last Democrat to serve in that role. When Nebraska created a Court of Appeals in 1991, she was tapped to be one of its first judges.
“It has been a privilege to serve the citizens of Nebraska as an appellate judge since 1992,” Miller-Lerman said in a statement released by Gov. Jim Pillen’s office.

Pillen, in a three-paragraph statement Tuesday, thanked Miller-Lerman for her  service.
A feature story from Columbia Law School in 2023 interviewed Miller-Lerman, Class of 1973, who said her worst grade at the law school was in the first course taught by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, class of 1959.
The subject was sex discrimination and the law and Miller-Lerman said that her teacher was way ahead of the legal curve. “I really didn’t get it,” she said. “Her thinking was so far evolved.” 
But since then, the story said, Miller-Lerman went on to spend a 50-year career “pathmarking” as a woman in the law.
In 1980, when she was named partner at the Omaha law firm Kutak Rock, the promotion made the front page of The Wall Street Journal because she worked part time. 
Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke described Miller-Lerman as a trailblazer her entire life.
“Her legal career is marked by dedicated, professional and intellectual service to the State of Nebraska,” he said.
The entire Court extended its “deepest appreciation” to their colleague, he said, for her many years of service.
Funke said Miller-Lerman has shown “extraordinary legal intellect and a steadfast commitment to the rule of law.” He said her opinions reflected both clarity of thought and deep respect for people and institutions of Nebraska.
Her contributions leave a lasting impact on the legal system of the state, Funke said, adding that she was kind, caring and that working alongside her was a “genuine pleasure.”
The Judicial Nominating Commission for the Supreme Court’s Second District, which consists of Douglas County, will seek names of potential nominees to be presented to Pillen, who will make the appointment.
That nominating commission is chaired by Justice Stephanie Stacy, the second woman to serve on the Nebraska Supreme Court.
The commission includes a high court justice and eight lawyers, half of whom are appointed by the governor and the others picked by the State Bar Association. Protocol calls for the commission to hold a public meeting to hear from candidates and forward at least two names to the governor.
Justices are paid a salary of $228,431.
The Chief Justice represents the state at large, and the six associate judges each represent one of the state’s six judicial districts.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)A high-profile mass shooting in Las Cruces earlier this year loomed large over state lawmakers’ deliberations this week as they considered whether to pursue legislation endorsed by local police that would make it easier to detain children accused of crimes even if they are found incompetent to stand trial.
The March 21 shooting at a park in Southern New Mexico’s largest city injured 15 people and killed three. Four people, including three children, face first-degree murder charges for the shooting and are in jail awaiting trial. The Las Cruces police chief in the days that followed joined Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in criticizing lawmakers for not passing a bill that would have allowed more young people to be prosecuted as adults.
Prosecutors in the case are conducting pre-trial interviews with police and civilian witnesses this week, and a three-week trial is scheduled to begin in February, according to court records. 
On Tuesday, two Las Cruces Police Department officers showed the interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee a compilation of videos other young people posted to social media depicting themselves shooting guns at public parks and from moving vehicles in the city’s residential neighborhoods. They played excerpts of recorded jail phone calls depicting young people bragging to their friends about shooting people and later getting their cases dismissed. The videos and audio recordings did not identify the speakers.
Officer Benjamin Berling told the committee that youth charged with felonies or firearms-related offenses who are found incompetent to stand trial often face dismissal of charges without meaningful treatment or accountability.
He and Sgt. Mark Renteria proposed lawmakers in the next legislative session change New Mexico’s law governing competency proceedings for children to mirror the changes they made earlier this year when it comes to the same proceedings for adults.
They shared with the committee a draft bill that would prohibit judges from dismissing a case solely based on the child’s competency until they have received mental health treatment. If a person under the age of 18 is charged with a misdemeanor and found incompetent, state law requires a judge to dismiss the case, Quintero told the committee.
“There needs to be something that we can do — that you guys can do as a Legislature — to alleviate this problem, because this is a giant glaring hole,” Berling said.
Most of the committee’s discussion focused on Berling’s juvenile competency proposal, but he also suggested legislators make it a felony to give a firearm to someone who goes on to use it to commit a violent crime; empower juvenile probation officers to immediately arrest and jail a child found to be violating probation; reconsider a proposal to include digital communication like text messages in the state’s telephonic harassment law; and lengthen prison sentences for people convicted of crimes related to gang activity.
Then on Wednesday, the committee heard from Third Judicial Deputy District Attorney Jeanne Quintero and Chief Public Defender Bennett Baur who said New Mexico needs more juvenile competency evaluators and more resources for courts to rehabilitate children facing criminal charges.
Quintero, who manages competency cases for the Las Cruces prosecutor’s office, said only two competency evaluators in New Mexico take juvenile cases, and only one speaks Spanish.
“That’s kind of disheartening because it’s hard to get an appointment, because both of them do adults as well, so they’re juggling time and space,” said Quintero, who is prosecuting the mass shooting case along with District Attorney Fernando Macias.
Baur, who was a prosecutor in Santa Fe for five years — including two years in juvenile court — cautioned the committee against enacting new statewide laws based solely on the incidents in Las Cruces depicted in the videos and jail calls.
“In speaking to people who work in the juvenile field, all of those things we saw happened, those children are real, some of those attitudes are real, but I would tell you that I think there’s a consensus that’s not what’s going on everywhere around the state of New Mexico,” Baur said. “We need to trace back and see what’s going on with those children and what we can learn, but we can’t make statewide laws based upon those.”
Lindsay McDonnell-Benatar, who supervises the juvenile division at the LOPD’s Las Cruces office, told the committee since the Young Park shooting, she has not seen any other children charged with actually shooting people but has seen cases in which minors are accused of possessing a firearm.
Quintero said she agrees with McDonnell-Benatar that actual shootings and killings are rare. She said she reviewed every case brought in children’s court in Doña Ana County between Jan. 1, 2023 to July 2025 and found that all gun crimes involving young people have spiked over the last year, with most charges being for possession. She said she thinks the increase is explained by Las Cruces police being “incredibly proactive in looking at juveniles with firearms.”
Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) said when lawmakers amended the competency law for adults earlier this year, they found that cases where competency was raised accounted for approximately 4% to 7% of all criminal cases, and she asked if there is a similar percentage among juvenile cases.
Baur said it’s roughly the same percentage, and McDonnell-Benatar said more community-based mental health resources are needed in Las Cruces and across the state.
“We’ve been talking a lot about kids that are at the end stage, they’re at their worst moment,” McDonnell-Benatar said. “But what we need are more resources, from bottom to top. We don’t have hardly anything that we need in order to help the kids at the crucial moment, before we get to this point where we’re dealing with shootings.”

(File/Getty Images)Every K-12 public school in the state will have the money to hire a full-time police officer this year, Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday.
McMaster began pushing for every school in the state to hire a school resource officer in charge of security in 2018, though his calls intensified after the Valentine’s Day school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that year that left 17 students and staff dead.
“For years, we have made it our mission to ensure that every student, teacher, and staff member is protected by an armed, certified, full-time school resource officer in every school, in every county, all day, every day – and now we have finished the job,” McMaster said in a news release. “This achievement makes South Carolina a national leader in school safety and provides us all peace of mind knowing our schools are protected.”
At that point, 406 of the state’s more than 1,200 schools had full-time resource officers. By the time school started last year, that number had nearly tripled to 1,106, according to the governor’s office.
Since 2018, the Legislature has spent nearly $160 million helping schools hire and retain officers. That includes $29.5 million in the budget that took effect last month. Of that amount, which matched McMaster’s request in his executive budget, $8.3 million is one-time money for officer equipment and training.
The state Department of Public Safety distributes the money through a grant program.
Since July 1, the agency has provided money to 58 additional schools to hire full-time police officers. That leaves 119 of the state’s 1,283 public schools without an officer, according to the governor’s office.
The agency is working to fill those remaining positions, said Mike Oliver, deputy director of the public safety department.
“Our priority is keeping kids safe, and we are fortunate to have an administration that looks out for our teachers and law enforcement,” Oliver said in a news release.
Addressing a legislative panel Wednesday, state Superintendent Ellen Weaver noted the difficulties of hiring officers.
“You all have now provided enough funds for a school resource officer in every school in South Carolina. The challenge is finding enough SROs, but the funding is there,” she told a House oversight subcommittee when asked about school safety issues. “The No. 1 thing we have to do in terms of that personnel side is to make sure we have hired and found all of those SROs we need.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-08-27 16:56:56.415770

Article Summary

Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias alleged that Flock Safety, a police tech company, illegally shared data with federal border enforcement. This escalates an ongoing conflict between Giannoulias and the agency.
Flock officials admit they didn’t create strong enough compliance protocols, but they disagree with Giannoulias’ legal conclusions.
Hundreds of law enforcement agencies outside the state have access to Flock data from Flock license plate cameras and Illinois readers.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO — An automatic license plate reader company used by hundreds of police departments around Illinois broke state law by allowing federal border enforcement officers to access Illinois license plate camera data, according to Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.
The company, Flock Safety, was also allegedly used by out-of-state police earlier this year to look for a woman who recently had an abortion. That situation sparked the secretary of state’s office to audit Flock.
License plate readers are cameras which can automatically detect the license plate, make, model and other details of cars while they’re driving. These details are logged and entered into a database that can be searched and shared between law enforcement agencies, governments and private companies.
A 2023 state law, which was backed by Giannoulias, prohibits operators of license plate readers from sharing the data they collect for the purpose of enforcing immigration or abortion-related laws.
Giannoulias alleges that Flock gave U.S. Customs and Border Patrol access to Illinois data as part of a pilot program. Flock also didn’t have any safeguards to prevent other out-of-state police from violating Illinois’ license plate reader law, according to Giannoulias.

Giannoulias said the company’s actions “put them in direct violation of Illinois law” in a video statement Monday.
“We will not tolerate any violations to our data sharing and privacy laws,” Giannoulias said. “Moving forward, we encourage local law enforcement to closely examine their relationship with Flock and ensure that their use of this technology is compliant with the law.”
The law prohibiting this kind of data sharing does not contain any specific penalties for violating it.
Giannoulias’ office told Capitol News Illinois it is “conducting an investigation” into the matter. The office has been in talks with the state’s attorney general, although it declined to describe specifics.
At least one city, Evanston, has deactivated its Flock cameras and begun the process of canceling its contract with the surveillance company. In a statement, the city called the situation “deeply troubling.”
A spokesperson for Flock, meanwhile, said that they were unaware of any ongoing investigation and that the company disagreed with the secretary of state’s legal assertions.
“We clearly communicated poorly,” Flock CEO Garrett Langley wrote in a blog post earlier this week. “We also didn’t create distinct permissions and protocols in the Flock system to ensure local compliance for federal agency users.”
In that statement, Langley said the company had paused all pilot programs with federal agencies. Langley also said he tasked the company’s top lawyer with overseeing the rollout of new compliance tools.
Flock cameras’ prevalence 
Flock does not disclose its customers, but a database based on news reports and company statements assembled by the Electronic Frontier Foundation found about 90 police departments in Illinois that are confirmed to use Flock cameras.
Flock customers can elect to share information about their system through pages hosted by the company that disclose what types of information is collected, how many vehicles have been detected by their system and how long data is stored.
Police departments can disclose what other law enforcement agencies have access to the data collected by their cameras. In Illinois, at least 27 police departments disclose information in this way, including 14 which list the other agencies that have access to their data.
More than 461 police departments, prosecutors, dispatch agencies, state universities, transit agencies and railroads in Illinois had access to Flock data, according to these disclosures. All of the transparency reports have been updated within the past week.
The attorney general’s office and Illinois State Police both have access to Flock data. ISP pays the company about $50,000 per year, according to state records. The agency can access Flock’s data for investigations but doesn’t operate any Flock cameras and doesn’t share its own data with Flock, according to an ISP spokesperson.
While license plate reader cameras are frequently associated with Chicagoland — in part due to a major state-backed program in the region — downstate municipalities use them too. Flock transparency reports indicate that the Champaign Police Department has 46 cameras. Normal has 51 license plate readers and other cameras, while Springfield has 135.
Out-of-state data sharing 
The 14 agencies that disclose data sharing also share information with 551 agencies outside the state, including with law enforcement organizations in Texas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana and more.
These out-of-state agencies that have access to Illinois license plate data include police departments, universities and state agencies. The list of organizations also includes the federal General Services Administration Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and a U.S. Air Force base, according to Flock transparency reports.
State law requires that police departments and other license plate camera operators in Illinois obtain a written declaration from all out-of-state law enforcement agencies saying that they will not use license plate reader data to enforce abortion restrictions or immigration enforcement.

The Vermont Conversation with David Goodman is a VTDigger podcast that features in-depth interviews on local and national issues. Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.



Bill McKibben is one of the world’s leading writers and organizers on the issue of climate change. He admits that his message about the perils of a warming planet can leave some people in despair. Now, with the U.S. at an authoritarian tipping point, McKibben has chosen an improbable time to offer hope.
McKibben has a new book, “Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization.” He takes readers on a far-flung journey to show how solar and wind energy have suddenly become the cheapest power in the world. People are installing solar panels equivalent to a coal-fired power plant every 18 hours. This is the fastest energy transition in history — and it may just help save democracy.
“There is one big good thing happening on planet Earth and it’s so big and so good that it actually has the capacity to help not only with the overwhelming climate crisis, but also with the crisis of inequality and of democracy that we’re facing now,” McKibben told The Vermont Conversation. “That one big thing is this sudden surge of clean energy, especially from the sun, that over the last 36 months, has begun to really rewrite what power means on planet Earth.”
McKibben explained that what used to be called “alternative energy” is now mainstream. “Four years ago or so we passed some invisible line where it became cheaper to produce power from the sun and the wind than from burning things. And that’s a completely epochal moment. Most days, California is generating more than 100% of its power for long stretches from renewable energy.”
“Here’s a statistic just to stick in your mind that will give you hope, too,” he offered. “A single boatload of solar panels coming from someplace like China will, over the course of its lifetime, produce 500 times as much energy as that same ship filled with coal. We’re not talking about a slightly better version of what we have now. We’re talking about a very different world.”
McKibben is currently spearheading Sun Day, which will take place on Sept. 21, 2025. It will be a global day of action celebrating solar and wind power and the movement to leave fossil fuels behind.
“Think about what the foreign policy, the geopolitics of planet Earth would have looked like in the last 70 years if oil was not a valuable commodity,” he said. “Human beings are extremely good at figuring out how to start wars, but figuring out how to start one over sunshine is going to be a trick.”
Vermont is already feeling the impact of this energy shift. “The biggest single power plant in Vermont is now the collection of batteries that Green Mountain Power has helped people put in their basements and garages and that they can call on in time of need to provide power,” he said
Bill McKibben is the author of over 20 books and a regular contributor to The New Yorker, the New York Times, and his Substack, The Crucial Years. He is the Schumann Distinguished Scholar in Environmental Studies at Middlebury College. He has won the Gandhi Peace Prize and the Right Livelihood Award, known as the alternative Nobel Prize.
Alongside his writing, the Ripton resident has founded the global grassroots climate action group 350.org, and Third Act, a political movement of people over 60 to use their “unparalleled generational power to safeguard our climate and democracy.” The organization now boasts some 70,000 members.
As the country and world teeter on a precipice, what gives McKibben hope?
“Just that we’re still here and fighting and that we have this new tool. It’s like a Hollywood movie: the bad stuff is happening all around us and here’s this new force riding to the rescue over the hills carrying not carbines and repeater rifles but carrying solar panels and lithium ion batteries.”

The layoffs will affect two Memphis distribution centers at 4155 Quest Way and 5800 Challenge Drive — both of which are distribution locations for automotive parts manufacturer Cummins. Cummins contracted with FedEx Supply Chain in 2019 to distribute component parts, rebuild kits and remanufactured engines for the facilities.
Cummins is transitioning part of its Memphis-based aftermarket parts distribution to a new logistics partner at a facility in Indianapolis, a company spokesperson said Wednesday. The change is “driven by our need to improve efficiency and better support our customers,” the spokesperson said.
FedEx will retain “a portion of the business at this location,” and the transition is expected to conclude in October, according to a company statement.
FedEx Supply Chain notified employees of the layoffs earlier this month. Many affected employees will be eligible for other roles in the company, according to its statement. 
FedEx Corporation, an umbrella organization encompassing multiple FedEx companies, employs more than 39,000 people in Tennessee, the company reports. FedEx Supply Chain has more than 12,500 employees throughout more than 130 warehouses and distribution centers in the United States and Canada.
“We are committed to supporting affected employees — through job placement assistance, relocation aid, or severance, as applicable, including at other nearby FedEx facilities in the area,” the company stated.
A FedEx representative confirmed Wednesday that the layoffs are not related to the company’s ongoing “Network 2.0” plan, which aims to streamline FedEx’s package network.
This is the company’s second reported layoff this year; 217 employees were laid off at a Middle Tennessee facility in March, according to a notice filed with the state’s labor department.

(Photo illustration includes Board of Medicine letter as redacted in Polk County District Court files. Main photo by Getty Images.) A pediatric neurologist who has accused the Iowa Board of Medicine of metaphorically holding a knife to his throat as part of a campaign to “get him, no matter what,” is pursuing legal action against the licensing board.
Dr. Hamza Alsayouf, a child neurologist and epileptologist who once worked as a pediatric neurologist at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines, first took the board to court last year in an effort to gain access to its confidential, investigative records.
Alsayouf claimed that in February 2024, he received an “investigative inquiry” from the board notifying him that it was conducting an investigation based on allegations that he had been convicted, in absentia, of some sort of a crime by a court in Dubai.

Denying any knowledge of such legal proceedings, Alsayouf asked the board in April 2024 to provide him with a copy of its investigative file so he could respond to the allegations. The board refused, arguing that because it had not filed any charges against Alsayouf at that point the investigative material was not accessible to him under Iowa law.
Alsayouf then went to court, asking a judge to issue an order temporarily preventing the board from continuing to pursue its investigation. The court refused and stated that while there is no argument that licensees are entitled to the board’s investigative file once charges are filed, the Iowa Supreme Court has ruled in the past that such disclosure “is barred unless or until a disciplinary proceeding against the licensee is initiated.”
The court’s decision cleared the way for the board to continue its investigation without turning over its records. Alsayouf appealed the decision, after which the board notified him it was continuing to investigate the claims first referenced in the 2024 letter.
Doctor: ‘Army of Iowa officials’ are out to get him
Now, Alsayouf is pursuing additional legal action against the board and is again seeking a court order to halt any further board action against him. His attorney, Michael Sellers, argues that the board has now embarked on a fundamentally different investigation as evidenced by the new allegation that the alleged misconduct involves Alsayouf failing to notify the board of the purported conviction in Dubai.
Sellers also argues that Alsayouf’s Iowa medical license is now expired and, as a result, he is barred from practicing in Iowa – making it impossible for the board to claim it is addressing any sort of threat to the public. “There is virtually no way to support a claim that the public interest of Iowans is somehow in play here,” Sellers argues in court filings.
Sellers also alleges the board’s current actions are part of an effort to sanction Alsayouf before he can expose decades of “egregious” actions taken by all of the state’s 30 licensing boards due to their “expansive, internal misinterpretations” of law.
“There is no law, rule or case law that allows evidence in a proceeding based on ‘alleged’ proceedings in a foreign country by an anonymous complainant to be a basis of the destruction of a professional career,” Sellers argues, adding that the Board of Medicine has “had a knife at the throat of Dr. Alsayouf for nearly a year and a half.”
The board, he says, has “put Dr. Alsayouf on notice that an army of Iowa officials are starting over and will get him, no matter what.”
In court filings, attorneys for the state argue “there is only one board investigation” and that Alsayouf’s new effort to halt that investigation must be denied because Alsayouf’s pending appeal “means that only the Iowa Supreme Court has jurisdiction to decide whether the board investigation should be stayed.”
Sellers has countered that argument by asserting that under Iowa law, physicians are not required to report convictions for offenses in foreign countries, and that the board isn’t authorized to investigate someone not currently licensed in Iowa.
“The Iowa Board of Medicine does not understand legislative or Iowa Supreme Court edicts, commands and direct orders,” Sellers argues in a recent brief filed with the court. “Now it is time for the courts to speak and to ‘explain’ what this clear and unambiguous language means.”
During Alsayouf’s years practicing in Des Moines, he served as an assistant professor at Des Moines University College of Osteopathic, and then, in 2012, he began a nine-year stint practicing pediatric neurology in Abu Dhabi. Since 2021, he has practiced in Amman, Jordan.
Although Alsayouf doesn’t currently practice in Iowa, his board certification requires him to maintain an active, unrestricted medical license in at least one state in the United States for that certification to be recognized around the world.

(Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A former nuclear inspector charged with threatening to kill multiple presidents is too delusional to stand trial until he receives mental health treatment, a psychologist said during a federal court hearing Wednesday.
Travis Lang was arrested in March on charges of threatening to kill President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, as well as their vice presidents and several South Carolina elected officials. The threats came through various direct messages and social media posts. The 47-year-old Irmo resident has delusions that make him unable to understand his case or help his attorneys, psychologist Lauren Schumacher said.

Lang pleaded not guilty soon after his arrest. He remains in the Lexington County Detention Center.
Schumacher, who works for the federal Bureau of Prisons in Miami, diagnosed Lang with a delusional disorder after seven formal meetings. Each lasted between 20 minutes and two hours, she said.
Lang told Schumacher that government officials are trying to silence his knowledge of various conspiracies and keep him from running for president, she told District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie.
Lang filed as a Republican candidate for president in the 2024 election, but he didn’t pay to appear on the ballot in South Carolina. His campaign funds consisted of $6,000 of his own money, of which he spent about $2,500, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
Lang had a good grasp on the way the legal system works in theory, but he couldn’t apply those facts to his own case, Schumacher said.
For instance, when Schumacher asked about a hypothetical situation, Lang said defense attorneys are meant to represent their clients’ best interests and that judges are impartial decision-makers. But when Schumacher asked about his own case, Lang said his defense attorneys and the judge are part of the conspiracy he believes is working against him, she said.
Lang believes the government is targeting him because he knows secret information about the V.C. Summer nuclear power plant, where he worked as an inspector until its utility owners abandoned their expansion project in 2017, Schumacher said. He claims to know about a racketeering conspiracy and secret information about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. He says he has communicated with Biden and that various public officials are covering up crimes such as treason and murder, she said.
None of Lang’s claims, many of which he said were secret, had any evidence to back them up, Schumacher said. He refused to back down from his beliefs, even when presented with evidence to the contrary, she said.
Those beliefs seem to echo some of the social media posts investigators said Lang wrote about elected officials.
Lang posted on X asking if Biden’s administration ran “counter to the mission at hand,” without clarifying what that mission was, before threatening to kill Biden, investigators said. Also on X, Lang wrote that he would execute Biden and Trump, as well as former vice presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence, for “abuse and misuse of office,” when he won the presidential election, investigators said.
All of the threatening posts investigators claim Lang made have since been deleted. An account on X that appears to belong to Lang told Trump to withdraw from office and put Lang in his place and made unfounded accusations that various state and federal politicians have committed treason and murder.
Ahead of the hearing, Lang, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, could be clearly heard muttering to his attorneys about someone trying to hide crimes, including murder and extortion. In his minutes-long rant before the judge walked in, Lang also called the president’s actions an embarrassment to the world, though it’s unclear which president he was talking about.
During psychological testing, Lang seemed to minimize any symptoms he was having, despite being obviously distraught about the conspiracy he believed existed, Schumacher said.
“He denied minor faults or shortcomings most people would acknowledge,” such as minor anxiety or stress, Schumacher said.
Under federal law, a person must understand the nature or consequences of their case and be able to effectively communicate with their attorneys in order to be found competent. Lang didn’t meet either requirement, since his belief that he was caught up in a conspiracy hindered his understanding of his case, and his mistrust of his attorneys made it likely he wouldn’t give them all the information they needed for his case, she said.

Most people with similar mental conditions can become competent after taking medication, Schumacher said. Whether the same would be true for Lang is unclear, she said.
Lang took a mental health drug prescribed during an involuntary hospitalization in 2021, but he felt the medication slowed him down, Schumacher said. She offered Lang multiple chances to speak with a psychiatrist about other medication, potentially including those for more minor issues such as the anxiety he felt over his perceived persecution, but he declined each time.
Lang believes himself to be competent, said his public defender, Jeremy Thompson.
Lang has been adamant that he will not take any medication for his mental health, Thompson said. If Currie finds Lang incompetent to stand trial, attorneys would almost certainly have to return to court to ask Currie for permission to force Lang to take medication, Thompson said.
Thompson asked for a second opinion from another, independent psychologist, citing Lang’s distrust of anyone working for the federal government. Currie declined, saying Schumacher’s analysis seemed fair and honest.
Currie might recommend a second evaluation by a psychologist and psychiatrist before sending Lang to a psychiatric hospital for treatment, she said.
The judge gave no final decision Wednesday, though she told attorneys to expect an order soon laying out the next steps.

“She was implying, essentially, that I was letting my child down, probably because if I’m obese, he’ll probably be obese,” said Usner, 40, who is from Metairie, Louisiana. 
She also described how the doctor looked through her Apple Watch “to see if she could find a pedometer that would let her know how many steps I had made the day before.”

This was about a year and a half ago, and the experience made her so uncomfortable she switched doctors.
“I know I need to manage my weight better,” Usner said, “but bullying and shame is definitely not the way I want to be motivated.” 
The Florida-based nonprofit organization Obesity Action Coalition promotes a different approach to obesity. Its Your Weight Matters Regional events provide free information from experts about weight loss and health in cities around the country.
Usner drove three hours to attend the latest event Saturday in Ridgeland, Mississippi.
Michelle Vicari is the senior program manager at the Obesity Action Coalition. She said the ultimate goal of these events is to get people to talk to their doctors about their weight and health.

“Going to your doctor and saying, ‘I need help,’ is not a moral failing,” Vicari said. “It’s something that you deserve. You’re worthy of care.”
Speakers gave presentations on nutrition, mental health, obesity treatment options and more. Paul Davidson, an independent concierge consultant and health coach with a doctorate in clinical psychology, spoke about managing stress and stress’ relationship to weight.
“How many of you got stressed, your brain tells you to eat, and you reach for Brussels sprouts?” he asked the crowd, getting several laughs.
Between presentations, attendees opened up about struggles they face in trying to manage their weight and health.

Georgia Lewis, 52, is a child care provider from Yazoo City. She has multiple family members with obesity and noticed some weight problems of her own. 
“I started seeing some weight kind of sticking a little bit with me because I was at a certain size,” Lewis said. “And when I guess I passed menopause, the weight started sticking a little bit more.” 
She sought information about how to keep herself and the children in her care healthy. 
Chandra James, 48, lives in Jackson and is a single mother of two daughters. She has family members who are borderline obese, including herself.

“Well for me, I’m looking at the future of my kids, myself, my family, and I’m trying to learn, educate myself, to help keep us healthy,” James said. However, she said she finds it difficult to afford healthy foods.
Like Lewis and James, Usner has family members with obesity and other health problems. She also has trouble choosing healthy food options.
“I have a toddler, so it’s harder to get him to eat things that aren’t Spaghetti O’s and stuff like that,” Usner said. “So that’s the things you end up surrounding yourself with just out of necessity to get through the day.”
Obesity is a complex chronic disease defined by having too much body fat. Factors such as food insecurity, diet, certain medications and genetics can all lead to obesity. It is linked to several other chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers.

The Obesity Action Coalition, which advocates and supports those impacted by the disease, brought Your Weight Matters Regional to Mississippi specifically because of the state’s high obesity prevalence. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mississippi has the second-highest prevalence of obesity in the county, 40.1%. Nationwide, it’s estimated that three-quarters of American adults have obesity.

People with obesity also face problems accessing treatment. Many insurance companies don’t cover obesity management services. Many doctors outside of the speciality are underinformed about how to treat patients with the disease.
“Many people still are in the old-school thinking that if you just eat less and move more, the problem will go away. And we now know that is not true at all,” Davidson said.
Lisa Sudderth is clinic administrator for Premier Medical Weight Loss of Mississippi, which had a table at the event. In addition to doctors not being informed, patients may not have enough time or enough information, or may be too intimidated to ask questions, she said.

“Look for somebody who is trained in the field, and who is specialized in the field of bariatric medicine and make sure it’s being done right,” Sudderth advised.
Lewis said she learned more about the science behind obesity and the stigma surrounding it.
Usner said her most important takeaway was “not to blame myself for my weight because it’s defeatist and inaccurate.”
James said she learned that if someone is struggling with obesity, “You’re not out there alone, that there’s organizations out there that can help you out.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/23105916/3X0A2986.jpg,,,2025-08-27 16:56:56.415770

School was challenging, but she stayed focused on her dream: college and a career in social justice. In high school, she enrolled in Early College to get ahead and build the resilience she’d need to succeed.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Pascaline Furaha defies doub[...]","When Pascaline Furaha was about to enroll in Early College at the start of her senior year at Winooski High School, she had her share of detractors. “Several people told me it was risky, and that I might not finish,” she says. But rather than listen to the doubters, she stayed focused. “It wasn’t about them. It’s about me.”
Early College is a program for Vermont high school seniors that allows them to spend their year taking college courses at a Vermont college, simultaneously fulfilling their high school graduation requirements and earning college credit toward a degree.
While Pascaline knew the college work would be a challenge, she also believed she could do it. “I’ve watched other people who came from Africa before me go on to earn degrees. I can also be the one to keep going and go that far.”
Pascaline came to the United States at age 12 from a refugee camp in Burundi, east Africa, where she was born after her parents fled their native Congo to escape war. While life in the camp was hard in many respects, Pascaline remembers the feeling of togetherness in the community, visiting the market with her aunts and playing with all the other kids in the rain. When someone would die—as her own mother did during their time in Burundi—everyone in the camp would come together to comfort the family. As more Africans emigrated to Vermont, she, her father, and her five siblings are starting to rebuild the strong community ties they remember. 
When Pascaline arrived in Vermont in 2019, she only spoke Swahili and a little bit of Kurundi. “Learning English was challenging for me. It was very complicated,” she recalls. Now, she faces a different language challenge, as she finds she’s starting to forget her Swahili. “When I see someone who speaks the same language as me, it’s hard to speak Swahili the whole time without using English,” she says. 
At home, her family speaks a mix of languages, but the conversations have moved more to English as they’ve all improved their fluency. Pascaline’s dad works at UVM Medical Center, and her two older brothers—23 and 22—are now working as well after taking some college courses. Pascaline, now 19, is continuing her studies at the Community College of Vermont, while her younger siblings, ages 18, 15 and 13, are at Burlington High School and Edmunds Middle School.  
Pascaline enjoyed the diverse and supportive community at Winooski High School, which provided a weekly opportunity for the students from Congo, Somalia, and other African nations to share their cultural experiences. The Friday program, called Story, sees students read poems, share memories of pastimes and celebrations, play cultural music and explain cultural patterns of dress, “to break stereotypes about Africa and help Americans understand that it’s not just a place of war,” Pascaline explains. “My school encouraged that diversity, and I really enjoyed that,” she says. 
Pascaline also appreciates the strong relationships she formed with her teachers. “It was always very important to me to build good friendships with my teachers, because they were able to help me and my family.”
Pascaline also found a lot of help and support in VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program, which she participated in from the ninth grade. GEAR UP offers support to students who wish to continue their education after high school, either through traditional college or through technical and career training programs, by providing financial assistance, scholarships, and college and career counseling. 
Stevya Mukuzo, the VSAC Outreach Counselor who works with students at Winooski, got to know Pascaline well during her four years. “Pascaline’s dedication to her studies is truly inspiring. She consistently seeks out challenging coursework and goes above and beyond to master each subject. Her peers call her a ‘go-getter’ because her positive attitude sheds light on the ability to achieve anything if there is a will.” 
Pascaline knew she was college-bound since she arrived in America. At first, her family encouraged her to become a doctor, but her aspirations shifted as she became more drawn to social justice. Her current career plan is to pursue social work, then hopefully go on to law school.
“I’ve seen so many people struggling in this world, and it hurts me. I’d like to be able to make a difference,” Pascaline says. “There are so many ways to help people, but social work and law is what appeals most to me. I’m very passionate for standing up for what is right, and I want to live in a world where I feel like I have done something to help.”
Having watched her two older brothers struggle with the transition from high school to college, Pascaline took a different path to help build more resilience. VSAC introduced her to the Early College program, and Pascaline was all in. 
“I went for Early College because I didn’t want to jump right into university. I wanted to learn more about college first,” she explains. “I made the best decision. I’m now confident I can go to college and be ready for it, because I’ve already experienced it.” 
Last year, Pascaline took classes in anthropology, intercultural communication, psychology, English, and race and ethnicity. This year, she plans to complete her associate’s degree at CCV before applying to schools for her bachelor’s. She’s intrigued by UVM’s “plus-one” program, where she could study an additional year to earn a master’s degree. 
While she’s had to work hard in school, she’s felt a wealth of support, from her teachers to her VSAC counselor, to leaders of her family and her faith. Her father’s pride has been a major source of encouragement. “I know my dad is talking about me, continuing my school, and that pushes me a lot,” says Pascaline. Her Pentecostal faith is also an important part of her life, and various spiritual leaders—from prayer leaders in Burundi, to those in an online group she’s been active in since arriving in America—have always told her to take school seriously. 
Pascaline has found the work very challenging and stressful at times. But whenever she heard the words “you’re failing” in her head, she also told herself, “I was the one who chose this, and I will be the one to finish it.”   
“It may be difficult, but in the end, I know I will see the benefits, and I’ll be thankful I didn’t give up. School is very important to me. A college degree opens doors.” 
The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency. We advocate for Vermont students and their families to ensure that they have the tools they need to achieve their education and training goals.

It eliminated a matrix of different housing programs and replaced them with a single, block grant program for projects. (Getty Images)Native American housing advocates are calling on Congress to help them meet growing and urgent affordable housing needs on tribal lands by reauthorizing a law that expired more than a decade ago.
Tribal housing leaders discussed what they say is an affordable housing crisis among their communities at a webinar Tuesday held by the Western Governors’ Association — a nonprofit organization of the governors of 22 states — and urged reauthorization of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, a law Congress first passed in 1996 that gave tribes more flexibility in how they could use federal housing funds to meet their communities’ needs. It eliminated a matrix of different housing programs and replaced them with a single, block grant program for projects.
“This isn’t really a handout in any way, shape or form,” said Rudy Soto, executive director of the National American Indian Housing Council and member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation. “Our ancestors of tribal nations, early as the country was forming, had the foresight to forge these treaties and legal agreements while conceding lands for the purposes of housing, education and health care.”
Native Americans have some of the lowest rates of homeownership in the country, and updating the law is the single most important way to boost home construction and homeownership among Native Americans, the housing leaders said.
“If people really want to help, they can help us reauthorize (the act) to improve the legislation and ensure this funding well into the future,” said Paul Lumley, a citizen of the Yakama Nation and chief advancement officer at the Native American Youth and Family Center in Portland.
The last time the act was reauthorized was in 2008, and it expired in 2013. While Congress still funds Native American housing assistance programs through other appropriations bills — even increasing funding for tribal housing needs in 2024 under the Biden administration — tribal leaders said the act itself needs to be reauthorized and updated to reduce red tape for housing projects.
Soto said his organization is working with Oregon’s U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum, a Democrat representing the state’s 5th Congressional District, and Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, of Montana, to introduce legislation reauthorizing the law.
Neither congressional office immediately responded to requests for comment from the Capital Chronicle.
Barriers to Native American homeownership goes beyond policy 
The Native American homeownership rate in the U.S. sits at 54% — less than the rate of 72% for white households and 63% for Asian households, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Native American homeownership rate is, however, higher than the rate of Black homeownership at 45%, and slightly more than the 51% Hispanic homeownership rate.
Advocates at the meeting pointed to a variety of barriers to owning homes, such as lower income levels and mortgage lending constraints on tribal land. Research also shows that Native American communities disproportionately experience overcrowded homes, and a lack of infrastructure and housing in remote areas where many Native Americans live on or near reservations.
Jody Cahoon Perez, executive director of the Salish and Kootenai Housing Authority based on the Flathead Reservation in Montana, said beyond policy, cultural and historical injustices play a role in the barriers Native Americans face when trying to own a home.
“Our whole way of life has changed, and we now live in homes that are stationary and we get mortgages on them when we never used to,” she said at the webinar. “We moved with the seasons, with the food we migrated. It was different. So it’s like we’re having to catch up with centuries of progress on the non-tribal side and also surviving genocide.”

“This new secure microchip facility not only strengthens our national security, it also positions North Louisiana as a hub for advanced manufacturing, bringing new jobs and technical expertise that allow us to embrace higher education partnerships and new possibilities,” Landry said in a news release.
The new facility expands Radiance’s existing presence in Ruston, where it’s a tenant at Louisiana Tech’s Enterprise Campus research park. The company has tapped into the university for faculty expertise, trained graduates and students seeking hands-on experience. 
“This partnership is a win-win opportunity that will benefit Radiance, Tech, Ruston and the entire state,” Radiance CEO Bill Bailey said in a news release from the Louisiana Economic Development agency. 
To secure the project, the state has agreed to provide $20 million to the Louisiana Tech University Foundation to buy equipment for Radiance at the new manufacturing facility. The funding will be tied to undisclosed project milestones. 
Louisiana Economic Development will also give $17 million to Louisiana Tech to upgrade its research equipment and create specialized training programs in secure chip manufacturing.
Construction on the Radiance facility is expected to begin next spring with completion anticipated in summer 2027.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/538838730_122234677508179824_4281926377339827022_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 16:56:56.415770

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The new memorial on the north side of the University of Kansas’ football stadium honors 2nd Lt. Charles Seward, a track and field star who left the university as a junior to enlist in the U.S. Army and train with Canada’s Royal Army Flying Corps to become a combat pilot.
Seward, who was born in Neodesha, was assigned to the 139th Aero Squadron and deployed to France in early 1918 as U.S. forces surged troops into World War I. He died in a plane crash April 6, 1918.
The new memorial at the stadium also pays tribute to Lucy McLinden, who grew up in Cedar Point and was a sophomore at KU when she volunteered as a nurse in military barracks located on campus in 1918. The barracks helped care for students sick with influenza. She contracted the virus within weeks, suffered from pneumonia and died in the university’s hospital.
The memorial also recognizes 2nd Lt. Albert Ellis Birch, who was born in Oak Hill and attended KU from 1915 to 1917. He was in the Kansas National Guard before commissioned a U.S. Army officer. He sailed to France in June 1918 with Company A, 342nd Machine Gun Battalion, 89th Division. He was wounded Nov. 1 by an artillery shell, but stayed with his soldiers at the front line and earned the Distinguished Service Cross.
Hours before the armistice took effect Nov. 11, 1918, Birch was killed when a shell landed close to his position. His final letter home, dated Oct. 30, was signed, “a soldier of democracy.”
On Friday, KU plans a rededication ceremony at Kansas Memorial Stadium with recognition of large panels honoring 130 students, faculty or alumni who died during World War I.
The two-year conversion of the stadium into David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium included construction of the WWI memorial. There are aluminum panels with names of 130 KU-affiliated individuals who gave their lives during the war. Additional panels offer historical information about the war, including a timeline and mapping of key battles.
The stadium was initially completed in 1922 and dedicated on Armistice Day as KU’s first WWI memorial. Although named to honor former students and faculty, the stadium itself didn’t have a commemorative monument. Plaques located in the Kansas Memorial Union honored those who died in military service in WWI.
KU Chancellor Douglas Girod said addition of the stadium memorial reflected a commitment to remembering this group of Jayhawks and upholding ideals they defended.
“I encourage veterans, active military, reservists, KU community members and the general public to join us in honoring the Jayhawks who made the ultimate sacrifice, as we open a new chapter in the storied history of this World War I memorial stadium,” Girod said.
The rededication is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Friday on the Garlinghouse Plaza outside a new convention center on the northeast side of the stadium.
KU campus parking lots and the Mississippi Parking Garage will be closed at that time to regular faculty, staff and student parking to accommodate the KU football game set to start at 6:30 p.m. Friday. Parking will be available at no charge in the Allen Fieldhouse garage. Shuttle buses can carry people to David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium.
U.S. Army Capt. Harrison Manlove, a KU graduate, conducted research on the 130 deceased people while an ROTC student. He discovered one person who had been inadvertently excluded from original listings.
Retired U.S. Marine Corps Col. Mike Denning, KU assistant vice chancellor for national defense initiatives, said the memorial would serve as a visual reminder freedom had to be built upon sacrifice.
“At the heart of being a Jayhawk is a tradition of selfless service,” he said. “Through this remembrance, their legacy remains vivid and tangible.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/KU-WWI-memorial-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-27 15:57:12.386784

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Republicans wasted no time pouncing on Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger’s promise to rescind Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s directive that requires Virginia law enforcement to help federal immigration authorities, casting it as a dangerous move that would undermine public safety and turn the state into a “sanctuary” for undocumented immigrants.
The former CIA officer and three-term congresswoman said in an interview with The Mercury published Wednesday that if elected, she would rescind Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which requires state and local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. 
The directive, issued in February, ordered the Virginia State Police to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with arrests and created a Homeland Security Task Force to expand coordination on gang and immigration enforcement.
On Wednesday, Republicans framed Spanberger’s position as a liability in the high-stakes governor’s race. Youngkin took to social media, warning Virginians that her first move in office would jeopardize their safety.
“In her very first act as governor, @SpanbergerForVA promises to turn Virginia into a sanctuary state for dangerous illegal immigrants,” Youngkin wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “@winwithwinsome promises to keep dangerous criminals off our streets. Could the choice be any more clear, Virginia? Your safety is on the ballot this November.”
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee for governor and Spanberger’s opponent, echoed the criticism in sharper terms. 
Pointing to the Democrat’s opposition in Congress to the Laken Riley Act — legislation requiring detention of certain undocumented immigrants charged with crimes — Earle-Sears argued her rival had consistently sided against law enforcement.
“Abigail Spanberger voted against the Laken Riley Act after Laken was murdered by an illegal immigrant,” Earle-Sears posted on X. “Now she says her first act as governor will be to stop State Police from helping ICE. Abigail puts criminals over Virginians. Every. Single. Time.”
In the interview, Spanberger argued Youngkin’s order diverts state resources from local policing and erodes trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. She said Virginia should not “politicize” immigration enforcement at the expense of community safety. But Republicans contend her stance reflects a pattern of being soft on crime.
Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said rescinding the order “isn’t about compassion. It’s about weakening immigration enforcement and making Virginia less safe.”
In a statement, Kilgore said Youngkin’s order “gave our sheriffs and state police the tools they need to keep criminal illegal immigrants off our streets. That’s not politics. That’s public safety.” 
He accused Spanberger of putting ideology over security, adding: “A Republican House of Delegates will stop her. Republicans will always stand with the men and women protecting our communities.”
The GOP’s coordinated response reflects the central role immigration is likely to play in the fall campaign. Youngkin has made the issue a signature of his final year in office, spotlighting ICE courthouse arrests and multi-agency sweeps targeting alleged gang members and undocumented immigrants. 
His administration has insisted the cooperation agreements with federal agents are critical to public safety, though Democrats have questioned the scope of the arrests and their impact on immigrant families.
Republican strategists also see an opportunity to repeat their 2021 playbook, when a single debate remark by then-the Democratic nominee and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe about parents and schools fueled a wave of suburban backlash that helped clear Youngkin’s path to the Governor’s Mansion. 
Sean Spicer, former White House communications director during President Donald Trump’s first term, likened Spanberger’s vow to undo Youngkin’s directive to McAuliffe’s fateful comment.
On X, Spicer called it “her Terry McAuliffe moment,” implying that Spanberger had handed Republicans a potent soundbite to mobilize voters concerned about border security and crime.
Earle-Sears, an immigrant from Jamaica who often highlights her own journey to citizenship, has made law-and-order themes central to her campaign. By tying Spanberger to opposition of both the Laken Riley Act and Youngkin’s enforcement order, she is sharpening a contrast Republicans believe will resonate in battleground suburbs and rural communities alike.
For Spanberger, who has emphasized pragmatism and bipartisan credentials in Washington, the backlash underscores the political risks of tackling immigration enforcement head-on in a state still divided over its role in local policing. 
In the interview, she argued that Youngkin’s directive was more about national politics than Virginia’s needs, and that communities are safer when immigrants can report crimes without fear of deportation.
“The idea that we would take local police officers or local sheriff’s deputies in amid all the things that they have to do, like community policing or staffing our jails or investigating real crimes, so that they can go and tear families apart … that is a misuse of those resources,” Spanberger said.

(Photo courtesy of Maine Dept. of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry) Typically, Maine has fewer than a hundred wildfires throughout July and August, but this year it’s close to triple that. 
As of Wednesday, the state has already seen 280 fires since July 1, said Terri Teller, a forest fire prevention specialist for the Maine Forest Service. 
“We haven’t had a year like this in a long time in Maine,” she said. 
Without much measurable rain and dry soil conditions, the number of fires has ticked up dramatically. For the past two and a half weeks, southern and central Maine have been at an elevated danger, Teller said, adding that the northern part of the state has been “luckier” with more precipitation. 
A drought monitor from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows one million Maine residents living in drought conditions as of this week. Most of the state is listed as being in “abnormally dry” to “severe drought” conditions.
Though Teller said she couldn’t confirm that number herself, it tracks with the state’s core population centers being at a higher wildfire risk. Roughly 95% of fires each year are caused by humans, she said, whether that be through open burning, vehicle fires that spread or other equipment malfunctions. 
The timing of this most recent dry spell has driven up the fire danger, Teller said. There seemed to be an average number of fires through mid-June, but once the regular rainfall stopped, the danger increased. And add to that the pleasant temperatures in recent days that have encouraged more outdoor recreation, which includes campfires. 
This increase in wildfire activity comes on the brink of the state’s usual fall fire season, which runs from mid-September through October, Teller said. 
“We are keeping a close eye on precipitation and how that will play out,” she said. “If we are already dry going into that season it may compound the activity we are seeing.”
More frequent, bigger fires
The 280 fires in the past two months have burned nearly 125 acres, which is less than an acre per fire, Teller said. While her team’s goal is to keep them as small as possible, more recent fires have exceeded one acre. 
Last week, there was a 2.3 acre fire in Eliot from an improperly extinguished campfire in the woods. There’s also been a 30-acre fire in Baileyville, and several others that exceeded five acres, Teller said. 
Windy conditions can cause fires to spread more, but Teller said the state hasn’t seen too many windy days — “That’s been a helpful factor for us.”
While her agency wasn’t expecting to have such an atypical year, Teller said it’s been ramping up resources as conditions have worsened in recent weeks. For example, she said the Forest Service has civilian firefighters available to help increase staffing. 
Additionally, the agency usually has helicopters in Augusta and Old Town, but on the higher fire danger days that has increased to two in each location or shifting one to the northern region to better access remote areas. 
What can be done
With the rain patterns out of their control, Teller said one of the biggest fire prevention tools at the state’s disposal is the online burn permit portal. State law requires a burn permit for any open debris burning throughout the state, but when fire danger is high that system gets shut down to reduce potential ignition sources. 
Teller said local fire departments have been following suit by not offering handwritten permits in those circumstances. Additionally, some municipalities have gone a step further by utilizing local ordinances to restrict fires. 
People are also advised to be mindful of the conditions by checking the daily fire danger, which is updated at 9 a.m. each day. For Wednesday, most of the state was under “high” fire danger.

[[...]","A sign displayed by U.S. Senate Democrats at a Washington, DC press conference on Feb. 19, 2025. (Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)North Carolina Democrats held a press conference Tuesday to attack Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley, portraying him as a threat to rural healthcare. They pointed to Whatley’s support for the so-called “one big beautiful bill” which state health officials say could cut nearly $50 billion in Medicaid funding in North Carolina over the next decade.
Nearly 680,000 North Carolinians have gained coverage since the expansion of Medicaid in 2023, but the passage of “one big beautiful bill,” a sweeping tax and spending package signed into law by President Trump earlier this summer, could put that coverage and the survival of some rural hospitals at risk.
Whatley has described the passage as a “huge win,” while Democrats are making it clear they plan to use that against him  in the 2026 election campaign.
A spokesperson for the North Carolina Republican Party, Matt Mercer, pushed back Wednesday on the Democrats’ claims, saying in a statement that the federal tax and spending bill would actually help working families.
Mercer said that Democrats “have shown they don’t care about working families and are the party of elitists who despise hard-working Americans, especially those in rural North Carolina. That’s why they’ve shed hundreds of thousands of voters across our state and will soon be relegated to third place on the voter rolls.”
Tuesday’s virtual event featured Ahoskie Mayor Weyling White and a patient from Blue Ridge Regional Hospital, who spoke about how the changes could impact their communities, and framed Whatley, a longtime Republican strategist, as backing policies that would hurt local communities and put lives at risk across the state.
“It feels like we took three steps forward, and now we’re taking five steps back,” said White. “With Medicaid expansion, families had more opportunity to get ahead, and it’s devastating to watch that unravel.”
Blue Ridge Regional Hospital, where Lea Charlton is a patient, is one of five facilities state officials say are at risk of closing. Losing it, Charlton said, would mean longer ambulance rides and delays in treatment. “If my husband and I have to drive an hour during an emergency, it could cost us our lives, and I am not kidding about that,” she said. “These decisions have real consequences for families.”

For many rural communities, hospitals are often the biggest employers and sometimes the only option for emergency care.
White, who is also a healthcare professional, said Whatley is choosing the wealthy instead of protecting access to healthcare for his own community.
Whatley, who recently left his role as RNC chair, announced his run for the U.S. Senate last month. His announcement came after former Governor Roy Cooper said he was running for the seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. The race is widely expected to be one of the most expensive of the 2026 midterms.
Democrats’ early focus on health care reveals their intent to make the issue central to the Senate race. Whatley, who has never held elected office, will have to defend his support for Trump’s budget cuts and his record as party chair.
An August 1 poll by Emerson College found that many North Carolinians are still unfamiliar with Whatley, with 36% responding that they “have never heard of this person.” Another 30% said they had no opinion or were unsure how they felt about him. That presents an opening for Democrats to define him as a Washington insider tied to unpopular policies.
Earlier this month, Democrats sought to cast Whatley as an extremist by highlighting his ties to former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who lost his gubernatorial bid last year after a series of inflammatory remarks.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-27 15:57:12.386784

Patrick Morrisey. (Photo by Kristian Thacker/West Virginia Watch)A resident of one of the four long-term care facilities the state of West Virginia plans to sell intends to sue the governor and a state health official over the move.
Mary Devito, a resident of the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont, is represented by Joey Garcia, an attorney and Democrat who represents Fairmont in the West Virginia Senate. 
Garcia announced Tuesday afternoon he had filed a 30-day notice of intent to sue Gov. Patrick Morrisey and state Health Facilities Secretary Mike Caruso. 
The lawsuit will aim to stop the sale of the Manchin facility to Marx Development Group or to any other entity, Garcia said. DeVito also will pursue a writ of mandamus requiring Caruso and Morrisey to continue to operate the facility pursuant to statutory requirements set out in a law concerning the reorganization of the state’s health department. 
“There is no statutory authority for Gov. Morrisey or Sec. Caruso to abdicate their administrative responsibilities to the patients of the John Manchin Sr. nursing home and other state-run facilities by selling them to Marx Development Group or any other private corporation,” Garcia said in a statement Tuesday. 
“Proposed legislation to privatize the John Manchin facility has repeatedly failed. Furthermore, the Governor’s Office has failed to make public the written agreement to sell these facilities, and my client and other residents have many concerns but very little information other than a potential sales deadline of Sept. 30, 2025. The only way to protect the residents of John Manchin Sr. now is to fight this in court.” 
Morrisey announced Aug. 12 that the state had reached a deal with New York-based MDG to purchase four state long-term care facilities for $60 million. Along with John Manchin Sr., the facilities include Hopemont Hospital in Terra Alta, Jackie Withrow Hospital in Beckley and Lakin Hospital in West Columbia.
The sale is expected to close Sept. 30 with a possible 30-day extension. The governor’s office hasn’t released the contract for public review. Several lawmakers said they haven’t received the contract despite requests.
West Virginia Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request Aug. 20 asking to review the contract and related documents. An attorney in the governor’s office said non-exempt documents will be shared Sept. 26.
The four state-owned hospitals often house and take care of elderly patients — some with complex medical problems and disabilities — who have nowhere else to go. Many patients rely on Medicaid and can’t afford private care.
Morrisey said Marx Development Group will retain the elderly patients and improve their care. Community members and state leaders worry what the sale could mean for elderly patients now and in the future. 
MDG owns and operates long-term care facilities in states around the region, according to a news release from Morrisey. Through its subsidiaries, Majestic Care and Bluegrass Consulting Group, it owns 55 properties with more than 5,000 licensed beds.
Morrisey said the facilities all operate at a loss and would require the state to invest $100 million over the next few years to rebuild and renovate. 
As part of the deal, the company has agreed to build three to five new facilities to replace aging facilities and source the materials and labor from West Virginia, Morrisey said. 
Morrisey said the state continues to pursue the potential sale of its other facilities, which include Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital, Welch Community Hospital and William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital. The long-term goal is to eliminate most of the need for the state’s Department of Health Facilities, he said.
Garcia on Wednesday noted he’s not the first lawmaker to file a lawsuit against a sitting governor. Former Democrat Del. Isaac Sponaugle, an attorney, sued former Gov. Jim Justice, alleging he violated the constitution by not residing in the seat of government. Garcia noted that the circumstances around that lawsuit are different than with the one he intends to bring against Morrisey. 
“I’m a private practice attorney,” Garcia said. “I have a client that came to me, and so I think that’s the thing about having a part-time Legislature. When I look at my advocacy, I think as somebody who is representing this area that’s separate than the legal arguments that I’ll be making in this case.”
In an email to West Virginia Watch Wednesday, Morrisey’s Deputy Press Secretary Drew Galang said the governor’s office had received the notice to sue and stand behind the sale’s legality. 
“This common-sense sale will help advance quality for our most vulnerable citizens and produce real savings for taxpayers,” he wrote.

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)A Wisconsin Court of Appeals on Wednesday ruled that the state Department of Natural Resources has the authority to require that factory farms obtain water pollution permits, affirming a previous Calumet County court decision. 
Two groups representing Wisconsin’s factory farms, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, filed the lawsuit in 2023, arguing that the state did not have the authority to require permits under the DNR’s Wisconsin Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) program. The program requires any entity that discharges pollution into the state’s waterways to obtain a permit. 
The lobbying groups, Venture Dairy Cooperative and the Wisconsin Dairy Alliance, are themselves led by factory farm operators who have been cited by the DNR for contaminating the state’s water through manure spills. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby, has also been involved in the lawsuit. 
State law requires an application for a WPDES permit must be made within 90 days of becoming a factory farm or expanding. The permits last for five years before they must be renewed. CAFOs — factory farms with more than 1,000 “animal units,” which is equivalent to about 700 milking cows — are also required to submit plans to the DNR for how they intend to manage the manure created on the farm. 
Over the last two decades, the number of CAFOs operating in Wisconsin has more than doubled, creating an increasing amount of manure that sits in lagoons, gets spread onto fields and potentially runs off into local waterways. 
If a manure spill occurs, the permit requires the owner to notify the agency and is responsible for the cleanup. The permits also need to be reapproved whenever an operation is planning to expand and every permit application is subject to a public comment period. 
A manure spill can cause harmful substances such as nitrates, E. coli and phosphorus to enter the state’s ground and surface waters — potentially making drinking water dangerous to consume and causing fish to die. 
Four years ago, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the DNR had the authority to use the WPDES permits to impose conditions on factory farms as a way to control their environmental effects. In recent years, WMC has filed several lawsuits seeking to weaken the DNR’s authority and undermine its ability to regulate water pollution across the state. 
The lawsuit argued that having to comply with the “time-consuming, costly process” of obtaining a permit that imposes “substantial costs and regulatory burdens” on the farms, is against the law because of two previous federal court decisions in 2005 and 2011 about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s own permit requirements for polluters.
On Wednesday, the District II Court of Appeals, which covers 12 counties in southeastern Wisconsin, found that the DNR does have the authority to create the rules the dairy groups challenged. 
“The challenged rules do not exceed the DNR’s statutory authority and do not conflict with state law,” the three judge panel, controlled by a conservative majority, wrote.
After the decision, advocates for the environment and smaller farms said it would help the state protect water quality. 
“This decision is a win for every rural community that depends on clean water,” Wisconsin Farmers Union President Darin Von Ruden said in a statement. “Family farmers understand that stewardship of the land and water is key to long-term success. Ensuring that large livestock operations follow commonsense permitting rules protects our shared resources and the future of farming in Wisconsin.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-27 19:23:26+00:00,CT Mirror,CT starts AI-driven ‘virtual power plant’ energy storage program,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/27/ct-virtual-power-plant-ai/,The Connecticut Green Bank and a California company hope to boost participation in CT's energy storage program through a new AI platform.,"Connecticut officials are hoping to boost participation in the state’s nascent energy storage program through the use of a new artificial intelligence platform designed to create networks of home batteries known as “virtual power plants.”
Earlier this month, the Connecticut Green Bank announced a partnership with GoodLeap, a financial technology company based in California that helps customers install and aggregate solar and battery-storage systems.
The company has also developed its own AI software, known as GoodGrid, to operate its virtual power plants — a broad term used to describe any network of interconnected devices such as batteries, smart thermostats and electric vehicle chargers that can be be controlled remotely to reduce strain on the electric grid.
The company launched its first GoodGrid virtual power plant in California last year and has since signed up more than 2,000 subscribers in that state and in Texas.
During periods of demand such as a hot summer afternoon, GoodGrid’s software can access the power stored by its subscribers by remotely switching their homes to run off battery power — thus freeing up electric capacity — or even sending excess power back onto the grid. 
In addition, company officials say, the software is capable of responding to more unexpected events, such as a power plant going offline suddenly.
“Within five minutes, we can aggregate all these systems and manage to dispatch that energy back into the grid,” said Daniel Lotano, the company’s chief operating and strategy officer.
GoodLeap would not be the first company to operate such a system in Connecticut, but it has set an ambitious goal to sign up more than 3,000 subscribers in its first year of operation, with a total capacity of about 25 megawatts of electricity.
That far exceeds the number of residential customers already signed up for similar programs, according to the Green Bank. Currently, about 500 households with a combined capacity of 5.8 megawatts in battery storage have connected their systems to VPPs. 
“Solar today is being deployed at record numbers in Connecticut,” said Bryan Garcia, the president of the Green Bank. “It’s just they’re not being deployed including batteries. So we are working hard to showcase a sign: Connecticut, we are open for business for storage too.”
Customers who wish to sign up for a battery-storage VPP program are eligible to receive an up-front rebate of between $7,000 and $8,000 from the Green Bank to partially offset the cost of installing the equipment, Garcia said. In exchange, the customer must agree to program their batteries to discharge stored power during weekday afternoons from June to August.
In addition, customers can receive additional “performance” incentives by allowing their systems to discharge at other times of peak demand.
The cost of those incentives is paid for by the state’s Energy Storage Solutions Program, which in turn is funded through a portion of the public benefits charge on utility bills. Garcia said the program is designed to lower the overall cost of this bills, however, by reducing peak electric demand.
Claire Coleman, the head of the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, said in a statement that she supports the deployment of VPPs, “where cost effective.” 
“They are an important tool in increasing demand flexibility and improved integration of distributed energy resources to better support grid needs,” she said.
In addition to battery-storage programs funded by Green Bank, utility customers can also participate in VPPs through the use of smart thermostats or as part of an electric vehicle charging system.
Jamie Ratliff, a spokeswoman for Eversource, said that more than 46 megawatts of battery storage was being managed as part of VPP programs across utility’s service area in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
“We support using local clean energy resources as virtual power plants (VPPs), which can help address grid needs, defer system upgrades when possible, and help lower costs for customers,” Ratliff said in a statement.
In addition to harnessing stored energy, VPP operators can also use their networks to reduce the strain on the electric grid even further by having subscribers manage their consumption more efficiently. That can include steps such as adjusting the thermostat or recharging an electric vehicle at night, when demand is typically lower.
There have been some concerns raised about the ability of VPPs to access a user’s system remotely, without the user’s control. But Lotano said GoodLeap makes more noticeable adjustments, such as reducing air conditioning, optional for its subscribers.
“We’re trying to make this as least intrusive as possible,” Lotano said. “You want engagement, you don’t want people to feel forced into doing something.”
In addition to Connecticut, Lotano said the company is also expanding its operations into Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
He said that the company’s expansion has not been deterred by the passage of Republicans’ tax and spending plan, which eliminated federal tax credits for rooftop solar installations starting next year. The law kept in place similar credits for battery-storage systems. 
“We expect the solar industry will adapt over time and continue to thrive in a world without incentives through a combination of solar panel cost and technology improvements,” he said in an email. 
Connecticut lawmakers in 2021 set a goal of deploying 1,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2030. Of that amount, roughly half — 580 megawatts — is slated to come from the Energy Storage Solutions Program overseen by the Green Bank, with nearly three-quarters of that stored power expected to come from commercial and industrial users.
In total, the state anticipates having about 150 megawatts of electricity deployed through residential battery-storage systems by 2030.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CT-Green-Bank_Exterior1-768x512-1.jpg,,,2025-08-27 15:57:12.386784

According to a news release from ISU, President Wendy Wintersteen joined leaders from Kansas State and University College Dublin in signing “a memorandum of cooperation and understanding” for each institutions’ college of veterinary medicine in order to form an academic exchange program and encourage working together for research.
“Today’s agreement signing is the culmination of highly valued collaborative efforts from all institutions involved to further enhance the educational experience for our students,” said University College Dublin President Orla Feely in the release.

The U.S. universities visited Dublin, Ireland in late August for a summit on agriculture technology and the Aer Lingus Football Classic, won by the Iowa State football team against Kansas State with a score of 24-21. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds also attended the summit alongside industry partners, according to a news release from University College Dublin.
Discussions during the summit focused on precision farming, ways for universities and industry partners to foster economic development and the One Health initiative, according to the release, which is described by the ISU College of Veterinary Medicine as an “integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment.”
The American Veterinary Medical Association states online that One Health works off of the idea that humans, animals and the environment are all linked, and all must be addressed to ensure healthy and resilient communities. The ISU news release stated the university “has a long history of engagement with One Health.”
Dan Grooms, dean of the ISU College of Veterinary Medicine, said in the release the new agreement will build on foundations of collaboration already made by researchers and the agriculture student exchange program established between ISU and University College Dublin.
Having the chance to work across the globe with experts is “vital for addressing issues such as antimicrobial resistance,” Grooms said in the release.
“Antimicrobial resistance impacts animals, humans, the environment and plants. There are valuable perspectives that come from conversations with people around the world to understand how we combat antimicrobial resistance,” Grooms said in the release. “The practicalities of what can and cannot be done are different in other countries, which is why we must think of this at a global level.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A plan to remove  Oklahoma Highway Patrol troopers from metro and urban areas is illegal, according to a legally binding opinion released Wednesday by the state’s top attorney.
The agency cannot make “the arbitrary decision to foist its responsibility” onto the municipal and county law enforcement in Oklahoma and Tulsa counties, said Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond during a press conference announcing his opinion.
He said state law vests the Oklahoma Highway Patrol with the primary authority to patrol interstates.
The decision by Oklahoma Department of Public Safety Commissioner Tim Tipton to stop providing law enforcement coverage in the most populous areas of the state is unlawful, Drummond said.
Tipton, who was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, announced in July that the Oklahoma Highway Patrol would no longer provide law enforcement coverage  in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Edmond, Moore, Norman, Midwest City and Del City beginning Nov. 1. 
Highway Patrol leaders said responsibility for interstates and highways within those jurisdictions would shift to local law enforcement.
Tipton had said the agency needed to focus its resources on areas covered by smaller law enforcement footprints and because of higher call volumes and changing traffic patterns throughout the state. 
“The Stitt administration’s decision to abdicate this responsibility is not only unlawful, but it is bewildering,” Drummond said. “Even aside from its unlawfulness, such a move would have a profound and adverse effect on public safety.”
Drummond said he had no doubt that rural Oklahoma needs more resources along the highways, but the Highway Patrol cannot refuse to respond to serve certain urban and suburban communities. 
Over 1.4 million people — or more than a third of Oklahomans — live in those seven cities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Drummond said the opinion does not dictate how the OHP shall deploy its resources, but draws a “bright line” that the agency can’t abandon Tulsa and Oklahoma City.
If the agency responds by only deploying one trooper to the areas, then “we’ll probably have other issues,” Drummond said.
Tipton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not immediately clear if he would reverse course based on the opinion.
Stitt said he was glad Drummond agreed with him that the Department of Public Safety has the authority to allocate the OHP resources as it sees fit.
“Commissioner Tipton is taking a thoughtful, statewide approach to public safety that will make Oklahoma safer, especially in areas that have gone without consistent coverage,” Stitt said.
Drummond’s remarks were made during a press conference at his office. He was flanked by members of law enforcement and Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt.
Holt said the Oklahomans that live, vote and pay taxes in Oklahoma City and Tulsa “deserve to receive at least some version of the public safety service that has been offered in Oklahoma since the Oklahoma Highway Patrol was created in 1937.”
Holt is also dean of the Oklahoma City University School of Law.
He said he agreed with Drummond’s interpretation of the law and called the opinion “binding.”
Holt said his police department always needs additional officers, but even if they’re short staffed, they cannot refuse to provide law enforcement services to certain areas within Oklahoma City limits. 
Oklahoma City residents support more resources for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Holt said.
Tulsa Fraternal Order of Police President Jeff Downs said the underlying issue is a lack of resources. Oklahoma and the nation are facing a staffing crisis, he said.
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, who asked for the opinion on the legality of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol’s plan, praised Drummond’s decision.
“This opinion clarifies that OHP resources should continue to be available for our metropolitan areas,” Mann said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)In the hours after a shooter opened fire on a south Minneapolis church, killing two children and injuring 17 others before apparently dying by suicide, elected officials offered thoughts and prayers — and in some cases, calls for policy change. 
“Don’t just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a Wednesday morning press conference. “These kids were literally praying.”
Gov. Tim Walz said the state is “heartbroken” in a post to social media: “From the officers responding, to the clergy and teachers providing comfort, to the hospital staff saving lives, we will get through this together.” 
State Sen. Zaynab Mohamed, DFL-Minneapolis, whose district includes Annunciation Church, told MPR News that the church is a “pillar in the community.”
“I just keep thinking about how this is supposed to be the best week for these kids. It’s the first week of school for them, for their teachers, for their families … for that to have been taken away, and for this event to shape the rest of their lives, I think that’s devastating,” Mohamed said. 
Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said on MSNBC that one of her longtime staff members is the parent of three children who were attending Mass when bullets exploded through the stained glass windows. 
Klobuchar said the details of how the shooter acquired the guns are still unknown.
But, “(It) makes me think about guns and all the work we’ve done to ban these automatic rifles and to do something when it comes to the background checks and everything,” Klobuchar said. “And we keep getting thwarted. We were able to pass a limited measure on a bipartisan basis but not enough to stop something like this.”
Minnesota passed significant gun control legislation in 2023, creating a “red flag law” and expanding background checks. 
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, said Minnesotans stand together against “these violent acts and the wicked individuals who perpetrate them.”
“My heart is breaking at the news this morning, and my prayers are with everyone who is affected. There is no place for this kind of violence, and attacks on a sacred place and children are especially egregious,” Johnson said in a statement. 
State senators from Minneapolis thanked first responders, offered condolences to the affected families and said they will “recommit ourselves to solutions to address the epidemic of gun violence and keep our children and communities safe.”
The state House delegation from Minneapolis said “we cannot accept a world where people face the threat of gun violence as they go about their daily lives.”
President Donald Trump and Walz both ordered flags at half-staff to honor the victims of the shooting.
The Democratic National Committee, which has been meeting in Minneapolis this week, called off its final general session due to the shooting — but not before Bishop Leah Daughtry led the assembly in prayer: 
“We bring our tears, our confusion, our pain, our anger and our grief — for lives snatched away too soon, for families and friends left devastated for the forces of hatred in earth — such painful actions. And we ask: How long, oh Lord, how long will our nation allow such hatred to reign unchecked?”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MG_8535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 15:57:12.386784

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Two children, ages 8 and 10, are dead Wednesday following a shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis, where students at the Catholic school there gathered for a mass to celebrate the beginning of the school year.
The shooter, a man in his early 20s without an extensive criminal history, appears to have killed himself at the scene, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who gave a news conference near the site.
Another 17 people were injured — 14 of them children. Two of the injured are in critical condition, O’Hara said.
The shooter approached the church from the outside, barricaded the front door with plywood and shot dozens of rounds through the windows, O’Hara said.
Outside the school after the shooting, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.

Susan Ruff, a neighbor whose children attended the school at Annunciation and has a grandson currently enrolled, said she saw the shooting from her window. She witnessed a man dressed in black, wearing a helmet, with a long gun, shooting at the church from the outside. She heard 25 or 30 gun shots. “It sounded like someone was dropping a dumpster. That loud bang. But I kept hearing it, so I thought, that’s not a dumpster.” Her grandson was unhurt in the shooting.
Jeremy Graff, 50, lives two blocks from the school and said he’s lived in the south Minneapolis neighborhood his whole life. He said his neighbors messaged him around 8:45 a.m. to say they heard a round of gunshots near the campus. He said he has about a dozen friends with kids who go to the school.
“I would like to say it’s surprising, but it’s really not nowadays,” Graff said.
Officers were sweeping the neighborhood and backyards with dogs and interviewing neighbors.
Jack Freedman, 25, went to the school and lives in the area. He said, “You never think that it’s going to happen at the school you went to, but then you start thinking how naive to believe that. Because it happens everywhere.”
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who also spokee at the press conference, grew emotional at times: “And don’t just say, this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” he said, referring to what has become a rote response to school shootings, often unaccompanied by any action. “These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and State Patrol are on the scene.
“I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,” Walz said in a social media post.
Giffords, the national gun control group, released a statement by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and severely injured in a mass shooting in 2011: “When will enough be enough? I am devastated by the news of a mass shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. No one should have to fear for their lives when attending religious services.”

“It’s all about the Hartford youth,” said Johnson to the nearly 20 volunteers of different professional backgrounds, ages and from different parts of the city and state.
Once the school doors opened, the ‘brothers’ as they called each other, formed a tunnel for high fives, to start a party for the kids. Some students ran through the tunnel with an ear to ear grin, others were a bit confused and instead walked through and observed with an amazed gaze the suited men shaking tambourines for them.
The Back 2 School greeting tours started after Johnson in 2015 saw a social media post of men in Atlanta lined up to greet the kids there on their first day of school. He, with help from Correction Ombudsman DeVaughn Ward and other friends, figured Hartford should have a yearly event like that. So they recruited on social media and by word of mouth, and got over 50 men to greet Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School students that year.

The tour began at the middle school on Monday and will continue at a different school each day this week.
The celebration of students became the grassroots movement Calling All Brothers, which provides mentorship, positive role models and educational support. The movement serves as a way to change the narrative, and redefine masculinity of male models for Hartford, in a country where Black men are underrepresented in positive social roles in the media, according to research.
Within the Hartford school district, the majority of the enrolled students are people of color, with 57% identifying as Hispanic or Latino, 29% Black or African American, 6% as white and 5% as Asian.
“There’s often a lot of misconceptions about the men in urban communities, that either they’re absent or not involved,” said Ward.
Ten years later, the community effort is constant and the brotherhood built through the years persists. Whether it’s someone’s first time attending these events, or their 10th year, the commitment to motivate children’s educational journey sets a common ground for all.
“I think it’s a beautiful thing, it’s like motivational for the kids and encouragement,” said Shay Hughes, mother of a Fisher middle schooler, who was meeting the Calling All Brothers volunteers for the second time.

While some parents do show excitement or support towards the line of high fives to the kids, other parents do not. In one of the greeting tours, a conflict arose because the drums and tambourine noise disturbed a parent and his child, but was resolved after the brothers learned the middle schooler had sensory issues, according to Johnson.
“When we think of Hartford all we think is crime and violence, and all we need is a conversation,” Johnson said in his starting speech of the greeting tour before the kids arrived.
The men who participate in the greeting tour come from different backgrounds, neighborhoods and states. Some met in high school, others are alumni from the middle schools they do the greeting tours at and a few even drive from nearby towns to join the community.
One of those is Leonard Scott Kemp, a volunteer activist, who drives from Ridgefield to join the brothers early in the morning for the first week of school greeting tours in Hartford schools.
“For folks to see people that look like themselves in those lines, welcoming them, I think is just so important,” Kemp said.

For Kemp as well as Johnson and Ward, the greetings are an opportunity to showcase Black men’s success and transmit joy to the students.
“A lot of the kids that have come out weren’t even born when we started this initiative,” said Fred Phillips, founder of Men Standing Up Against Violence, who has been at the greetings since 2015. “We will continue to do whatever we can to enhance our community.”
Besides lining up at the entrance of middle schools on their first days of school the organization is fundraising money to provide uniforms for Hartford Public School students.
The Back 2 School greeting tours are the kickstart of a series of Calling All Brothers’s events in Hartford with a trunk or treat lined up for October.

The new shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed their use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity. That presents new barriers to access for millions of Americans who would have to prove their risk — and millions more who may want to get vaccinated and suddenly no longer qualify.
Additionally, Pfizer’s vaccine will no longer be available for any child under 5, because the FDA said it was revoking the shot’s emergency authorization for that age group.
Parents will still be able to seek out shots from rival drugmaker Moderna, the other maker of mRNA vaccines, which has full FDA approval for children as young as 6 months. But the company’s Spikevax vaccine is only approved for children with at least one serious health problem.
The revamped vaccines target a newer version of the continuously evolving virus and are set to begin shipping immediately. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they’ll be able to get one, with access dependent on decisions by federal health advisers, private health insurers, pharmacies and state authorities.
The new restrictions — previewed by FDA officials in May — are a break from the previous U.S. policy, which recommended an annual COVID-19 shot for all Americans 6 months and up.
The approach reflects heightened skepticism about the ongoing risks of COVID-19 and the need for yearly booster shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, both outspoken critics of wide-scale vaccinations.
“The American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,” Kennedy wrote on social media.
Novavax’s shot is only open to people 12 or older, not younger children, and under the same risk-based restrictions as are now in place for the Moderna and Pfizer options. It’s the nation’s only traditional, protein-based COVID-19 vaccine.
Coverage questions and access issues are unresolved
The limits “can’t help but create barriers to vaccinations” and cause confusion for patients, doctors and pharmacists, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.
Some medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have objected to the new limits, saying they may block vaccine access for families who want to protect their children. Last week, the group offered its own recommendations for kids, saying annual shots are strongly recommended for children ages 6 months to 2 years and advised for older children.
In his post Wednesday, Kennedy said the shots will be “available for all patients who choose them after consulting with their doctors.”
But Americans are likely to confront a number of logistical hurdles.
Insurers typically base their vaccine coverage decisions on the recommendations of a panel of advisers to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some say they will also look to medical professional groups, including the American Medical Association.
Earlier this year, Kennedy replaced the entire CDC panel, naming several doctors and researchers who have repeatedly questioned the safety of commonly used vaccines and ingredients. The panel is expected to meet in September, but no agenda has been released.
Depending on the panel’s advice, Americans under age 65 could be expected to provide documentation of a serious medical condition before they can get a shot. Complicating the rollout is the fact that pharmacists — who administer most COVID-19 shots — typically aren’t expected to collect that kind of information. And laws governing their ability to administer routine vaccinations vary by state, where pharmacists are licensed.
Many states limit vaccinations by pharmacists to those recommended by the CDC panel.
Access could also be complicated for healthy adults and children who are interested in getting a shot for extra protection.
If the latest vaccines aren’t covered by their insurance, those patients could be required to pay $150 or more out of pocket if they want one. If they aren’t considered considered high-risk, they also might also have to find a doctor or other health professional willing to give the shot “off label.”
“This makes things much more complicated and when we things get complicated we see vaccine uptake go down,” said Andy Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University.
Shots target a recently dominant coronavirus version
The updated shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax target coronavirus subtypes that are closely related to some newly emerging cousins. Pfizer and Moderna said they expect their shots to be available within days. Novavax’s vaccine is expected in the early fall, a spokesman said.
All three shots were initially made available under the FDA’s emergency use authorization, an expedited process to quickly review vaccines and other countermeasures during the pandemic. Pfizer had not yet sought full approval for its doses designed for children under 5, which is the reason that Moderna will be the only provider of shots for the youngest children this year.
In addition to revoking emergency use of Pfizer’s vaccine in young children, Kennedy said Wednesday the government also pulled remaining authorizations for all other COVID-19 vaccines and another therapy from the pandemic years, convalescent plasma, which was used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients before the first antiviral drugs became available.
COVID-19 vaccines do a good job preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, which remain a bigger risk for seniors and people with underlying health factors, including heart disease, lung disease and cancer.
Preliminary data from the CDC estimates 47,500 Americans died from COVID-related causes last year. In at least two-thirds of those cases, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death.

(Photo by Christopher Massa/Johnson & Wales University)Tuition and professional development for a dozen biology majors at Johnson & Wales University (JWU) will be covered through a U.S. National Science Foundation grant worth nearly $1 million, the school announced Wednesday. 
The federal foundation’s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics program is the source of the five-year, $999,960 grant, designed to subsidize education for academically talented low-income students in STEM fields, and help increase student retention, outcomes and career readiness offerings.
JWU’s new grant award will provide scholarships of up to $15,000 annually for up to four consecutive years of study. The money will be administered through the new JWU STEM Supplement Grant and will help eligible students meet 100% of their financial need.   
“This program will be life changing for scholars,” said Nicole Urban, a professor in JWU’s Department of Biological and Physical Sciences, in a statement Wednesday. “It will allow them to focus on their studies and extra-curricular opportunities that are critical for their careers rather than working quite so much to finance their educations.”
Urban and fellow science faculty professor Kristin Rosler will serve as principal investigators for the project and administer the awards.  
“We are excited that this program will equip our Scholars to take seats at the lab bench,” Rosler said in a statement, noting her hope that the program could help grow Rhode Island’s emergent biotechnology industry. 
In addition to covering tuition and attendance costs, the program will provide mentorship, professional development, and training for students to better communicate the science in which they’re involved. The program’s career preparation aspects are designed to keep students ready to enter biotech careers in the Ocean State.
Glenn Robertelli, the executive director of trade group RI Bio, called the grant award “outstanding” in a statement, and added that it “advances Rhode Island’s efforts to develop a future-ready life sciences talent pipeline and prepares students for well-paying careers in the sector.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Two children, ages 8 and 10, are dead Wednesday following a shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis, where students at the Catholic school there gathered for a mass to celebrate the beginning of the school year.
The shooter, a man in his early 20s without an extensive criminal history, appears to have killed himself at the scene, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who gave a news conference near the site.
Another 17 people were injured — 14 of them children. Two of the injured are in critical condition, O’Hara said.
The shooter approached the church from the outside, barricaded the front door with plywood and shot dozens of rounds through the windows, O’Hara said.
Outside the school after the shooting, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.

Susan Ruff, a neighbor whose children attended the school at Annunciation and has a grandson currently enrolled, said she saw the shooting from her window. She witnessed a man dressed in black, wearing a helmet, with a long gun, shooting at the church from the outside. She heard 25 or 30 gun shots. “It sounded like someone was dropping a dumpster. That loud bang. But I kept hearing it, so I thought, that’s not a dumpster.” Her grandson was unhurt in the shooting.
Jeremy Graff, 50, lives two blocks from the school and said he’s lived in the south Minneapolis neighborhood his whole life. He said his neighbors messaged him around 8:45 a.m. to say they heard a round of gunshots near the campus. He said he has about a dozen friends with kids who go to the school.
“I would like to say it’s surprising, but it’s really not nowadays,” Graff said.
Officers were sweeping the neighborhood and backyards with dogs and interviewing neighbors.
Jack Freedman, 25, went to the school and lives in the area. He said, “You never think that it’s going to happen at the school you went to, but then you start thinking how naive to believe that. Because it happens everywhere.”
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who also spokee at the press conference, grew emotional at times: “And don’t just say, this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” he said, referring to what has become a rote response to school shootings, often unaccompanied by any action. “These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and State Patrol are on the scene.
“I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,” Walz said in a social media post.
Giffords, the national gun control group, released a statement by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and severely injured in a mass shooting in 2011: “When will enough be enough? I am devastated by the news of a mass shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. No one should have to fear for their lives when attending religious services.”

Connecticut law does not require health care workers in hospitals to receive COVID-19 vaccines, although it is now part of the facilities’ internal infection control and health frameworks, according to the Connecticut Hospital Association.
In 2021, the CHA adopted a statewide policy that endorsed mandatory vaccination for hospital health care workers. This was a hospital policy, not a state mandate.
But Gov. Ned Lamont also issued an executive order during the pandemic that required hospital employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and receive a booster if “eligible” under federal guidance. However, that mandate expired in February 2022. 
That said, individual hospitals and health systems can still set their own rules. Some facilities recommend or require certain vaccines for staff, particularly in high-risk settings, but these are employer-level decisions rather than state mandates.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
Permitting
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, Colorado Energy Office executive director


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
Interconnection
Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

The St. Albans City hospital suspended all surgeries last week due to the presence of particles on surgical tools, a problem that worsened over several months. Some operations have resumed with improved water filtration.

Northwestern Medical Center resumed some operations Monday after suspending all surgical procedures last week due to the persistent presence of small particulates in sterilized surgical trays, the hospital’s leader said. The St. Albans City hospital continued Tuesday to increase the number and type of surgeries it performs.  
During the temporary pause, first reported by WCAX-TV, which began August 18, the hospital installed a temporary reverse osmosis water filtering device to remove the particulates, hospital CEO Peter Wright said. The custom-made permanent reverse osmosis machine planned as a long-term solution will cost the hospital about $500,000, he said. 
Though the hospital uses municipal water, its staff is not aware of any issues with the city’s supply that could have caused this. They also are unsure why the issue became more prevalent this summer. 
The water standards needed for decontaminating surgical tools are stricter than what is required for clean drinking water, Wright said. The hospital’s particulate issue does not mean there is any danger in drinking or using city water for other purposes. 
“I fill up my water bottle; I drink city water every day,” he said.
Operating room staff started noticing tiny particles in the sterilized, plastic-wrapped trays of surgical tools in the spring. When found, those tools had to be replaced or re-sterilized, sometimes requiring surgeons to delay operations. The problem persisted and surgical delays became more frequent, which brought the issue to Wright’s attention in June, he said.
At that point, the hospital began efforts to remediate the problem, changing water pipes and filters more frequently, and reviewing HVAC systems and workstations, among other preventative checks, hospital spokesperson Kate Laddison said. Medical device company Steris has also worked with the hospital to remediate the issue, she added. 
Still, by late July, contamination in the trays became an even more frequent obstacle. 
“It got to the point where the team said, ‘Hey, we don’t know that we can reliably do surgery with the right equipment.’ The moment we thought it was a safety issue, we said, ‘stop,’” Wright said. 
Hospital leadership decided Friday, Aug. 15, to suspend surgeries the following Monday. 
The additional step of filtering water used to clean surgical equipment through the temporary reverse osmosis machine appears to be addressing the problem, according to Wright. Last week, early testing showed the trays and kits cleaned with water that passes through the reverse osmosis machine were free of particulates, he said. 
The hospital moved forward Monday with an incremental restart of surgeries and held four operations, all of which had trays free of particulates, Wright confirmed. They scaled up the number and type of surgeries Tuesday without any contamination. 
Still, Northwestern Medical Center’s administration plans to continue evaluating its decontamination and sterilization process to isolate other potential sources of contamination, according to Wright. The surgical tools and trays generally undergo a multi-part cleaning process. The tools are inspected and hand washed before going into a large dishwasher-like decontaminator. Then they are assembled into trays, wrapped in plastic, and sent through sterilization. The review will include examining the quality of the wrap the trays are covered with and interrogating how the sterilization room itself is cleaned, he said. 
“We do not think that [the water] is the only problem. We just think it’s the biggest bulk of the problem,” he said.
Some staff have expressed frustration with the ongoing nature of the problem.
Wright confirmed the administration received a letter from staff that expressed concerns about how long the contamination issues were allowed to go on and called for the removal of the person overseeing surgical processes. He declined to address the specific complaint, however.
“It would be inappropriate for me to comment about anything regarding any single member of our team,” he said of the letter, “but of course we will address it, absolutely.”
Christine Juaire, an operating room nurse and a member of the bargaining team for the newly-formed nurse’s union said in an emailed statement that “nurses don’t really know what is going on right now.” She did not address the letter or whether she signed it.
“Unfortunately, that is a trend with our current administration,” Juaire said in the statement. “There is often little transparency and little interest in involving staff who have years of experience in the processes and decisions.”

(Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A man charged with threatening to kill multiple presidents is too delusional to stand trial until he receives mental health treatment, a psychologist said during a federal court hearing Wednesday.
Travis Lang was arrested in March on charges of threatening to kill President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, as well as their vice presidents and several South Carolina elected officials. The threats came through various direct messages and social media posts. The 47-year-old Irmo resident has delusions that make him unable to understand his case or help his attorneys, psychologist Lauren Schumacher said.

Lang pleaded not guilty soon after his arrest. He remains in the Lexington County Detention Center.
Schumacher, who works for the federal Bureau of Prisons in Miami, diagnosed Lang with a delusional disorder after seven formal meetings. Each lasted between 20 minutes and two hours, she said.
Lang told Schumacher that government officials are trying to silence his knowledge of various conspiracies and keep him from running for president, she told District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie.
Lang filed as a Republican candidate for president in the 2024 election, but he didn’t pay to appear on the ballot in South Carolina. His campaign funds consisted of $6,000 of his own money, of which he spent about $2,500, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
Lang had a good grasp on the way the legal system works in theory, but he couldn’t apply those facts to his own case, Schumacher said.
For instance, when Schumacher asked about a hypothetical situation, Lang said defense attorneys are meant to represent their clients’ best interests and that judges are impartial decision-makers. But when Schumacher asked about his own case, Lang said his defense attorneys and the judge are part of the conspiracy he believes is working against him, she said.
Lang believes the government is targeting him because he knows secret information about the V.C. Summer nuclear power plant, where he worked until its utility owners abandoned their expansion project in 2017, Schumacher said. He claims to know about a racketeering conspiracy and secret information about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. He says he has communicated with Biden and that various public officials are covering up crimes such as treason and murder, she said.
None of Lang’s claims, many of which he said were secret, had any evidence to back them up, Schumacher said. He refused to back down from his beliefs, even when presented with evidence to the contrary, she said.
Those beliefs seem to echo some of the social media posts investigators said Lang wrote about elected officials.
Lang posted on X asking if Biden’s administration ran “counter to the mission at hand,” without clarifying what that mission was, before threatening to kill Biden, investigators said. Also on X, Lang wrote that he would execute Biden and Trump, as well as former vice presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence, for “abuse and misuse of office,” when he won the presidential election, investigators said.
All of the threatening posts investigators claim Lang made have since been deleted. An account on X that appears to belong to Lang told Trump to withdraw from office and put Lang in his place and made unfounded accusations that various state and federal politicians have committed treason and murder.
Ahead of the hearing, Lang, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, could be clearly heard muttering to his attorneys about someone trying to hide crimes, including murder and extortion. In his minutes-long rant before the judge walked in, Lang also called the president’s actions an embarrassment to the world, though it’s unclear which president he was talking about.
During psychological testing, Lang seemed to minimize any symptoms he was having, despite being obviously distraught about the conspiracy he believed existed, Schumacher said.
“He denied minor faults or shortcomings most people would acknowledge,” such as minor anxiety or stress, Schumacher said.
Under federal law, a person must understand the nature or consequences of their case and be able to effectively communicate with their attorneys in order to be found competent. Lang didn’t meet either requirement, since his belief that he was caught up in a conspiracy hindered his understanding of his case, and his mistrust of his attorneys made it likely he wouldn’t give them all the information they needed for his case, she said.
SC man charged with threatening to kill Trump must undergo mental evaluation

Most people with similar mental conditions can become competent after taking medication, Schumacher said. Whether the same would be true for Lang is unclear, she said.
Lang took a mental health drug prescribed during an involuntary hospitalization in 2021, but he felt the medication slowed him down, Schumacher said. She offered Lang multiple chances to speak with a psychiatrist about other medication, potentially including those for more minor issues such as the anxiety he felt over his perceived persecution, but he declined each time.
Lang believes himself to be competent, said his public defender, Jeremy Thompson.
Lang has been adamant that he will not take any medication for his mental health, Thompson said. If Currie finds Lang incompetent to stand trial, attorneys would almost certainly have to return to court to ask Currie for permission to force Lang to take medication, Thompson said.
Thompson asked for a second opinion from another, independent psychologist, citing Lang’s distrust of anyone working for the federal government. Currie declined, saying Schumacher’s analysis seemed fair and honest.
Currie might recommend a second evaluation by a psychologist and psychiatrist before sending Lang to a psychiatric hospital for treatment, she said.

Vermont’s joint NPR and Public Broadcasting Service station, Vermont Public, has laid off 15 people, the network announced in a news story posted to its website Wednesday afternoon.
The decision comes about a month after Congress voted to rescind more than $1 billion in federal funding for public media stations across the country, including $2 million that was included in Vermont Public’s current budget.
Wednesday’s cuts include a reporter and staff for several of the Colchester-based station’s programs, CEO Vijay Singh told the station, though he did not elaborate. Two full-time positions at the station have also been changed to part-time. The cuts mark a 14% overall reduction in Vermont Public’s current workforce, according to the announcement.

Alicia St. Germaine (R-Harrison Township), House Bill 4664 would alter the state’s current penalty for blocking, obstructing, impeding, or otherwise interfering with traffic from a civil fine to a misdemeanor. Where the current penalty is a fine of up to $100, St. Germaine’s proposal carries a punishment of up to 93 days in prison and/or a fine of up to $5,000. 
While the bill netted support from Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido and Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard, both Republicans, the American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about the bill’s implications for the right to free speech and peaceful assembly.

The bill passed through committee with full support from Republicans and opposition from Rep. Kara Hope (D-Holt), the sole Democratic member present for the vote. 
While Hope later made a motion to reconsider the vote on the bill, the effort was unsuccessful with Hope and Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) marking the only votes in support.

,DC,2025-08-27 18:35:48+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Tribal radio stations wait on $9M pledged in congressional handshake deal,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tribal-radio-stations-wait-9m-pledged-congressional-handshake-deal,,"WASHINGTON — Tribal radio stations that are supposed to receive millions in funding to fill the hole created when Congress eliminated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting haven’t heard anything from the Trump administration about when it will send the money or how much in grants they’ll receive.Unlike most government spending deals, the handshake agreement South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds negotiated with the White House budget director in exchange for Rounds’ vote on the rescissions bill wasn’t placed in the legislation, so it never became law. Instead, Rounds is trusting the Trump administration to move $9.4 million in funding from an undisclosed account to more than two dozen tribal radio stations in rural areas of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Wisconsin that receive community service grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. But neither Rounds' office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Interior Department, nor the Bureau of Indian Affairs responded to emails from States Newsroom asking when the grants would be sent to those radio stations and whether the funding levels would be equal to what they currently receive. Loris Taylor, president and CEO of Native Public Media, a network of more than 60 broadcast stations that’s headquartered in Arizona, said she’s written to Rounds and the Bureau of Indian Affairs about the handshake deal reached in July but hasn’t heard back. “I can't place my expectations on something that hasn't been concretely shared with the stations,” Taylor said. “And so all I can say is that our expectations are to raise money for the stations to make sure that they have operational dollars for FY 2026, and that's exactly where we're placing our focus.”Taylor pointed out that Rounds’ informal deal with White House budget director Russ Vought doesn’t cover all of the tribal stations in the network and will only last for one year, leaving questions about long-term budgeting.‘The little stations like us’  Dave Patty, general manager at KIYU-FM in Galena, Alaska, said he isn’t planning to receive any federal funding during the upcoming fiscal year, in part because he hasn’t heard anything from the administration. The 2026 federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1.“Well, I certainly can't budget anything that I don't know is coming, so I'm definitely not planning for it now,” he said. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers' decision to eliminate all funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting because of their belief of left-leaning bias at National Public Radio wasn’t the right way to address those frustrations, Patty said. “The narrative was definitely centered around NPR and that was definitely wrong because NPR aren’t the ones in trouble,” he said. “NPR is well funded from philanthropists all over the country, and as a mothership, NPR is not going anywhere. It's the little stations like us that are going to go away because, for instance, about 60% of our budget came from the CPB grant.”The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced in early August it will shutter most of its operations by the end of September, with some staff working through January. NPR and the Public Broadcasting Service have made no such announcements, but local stations throughout the country have announced budget cuts since Congress approved the bill rescinding $1.1 billion in funding it previously approved for CPB. That money was supposed to cover costs during fiscal 2026 and 2027. Lawsuit feared Karl Habeck, general manager at WOJB in Hayward, Wisconsin, said he’s only heard “gossip” and “rumors” about how exactly the handshake agreement will work in practice but is concerned that someone may challenge the Trump administration's authority to move money around since it wasn’t in the bill and never became law. “What gives them the right to take these funds that were allocated for environmental projects and send them towards Native American radio stations?” Habeck said. Typically, the administration would need sign-off from appropriators in Congress before moving large sums of money from one account to another. Officials haven’t said publicly where exactly they plan on taking the money from and it’s unclear if the Trump administration is trying to create a new account for grants to rural tribal radio stations out of thin air, without an actual appropriation from Congress. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, and Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, ranking member on the panel, didn’t immediately respond to a request for details.  Habeck said he expects WOJB will be okay financially for the next year, but that he and many others don’t know what the future will hold after that. “It's going to be hard,” Habeck said. “I guess people don't understand. You know, they try to compare us to commercial radio and it's two different things.”Local broadcasting stations, he said, have fewer employees and are often a nexus for their communities, providing information about everything from lost dogs to emergency alerts to high school sports updates. “That doesn't happen everywhere. It'd be a shame to lose that,” Habeck said. “I think we're an integral part of the community and people have come to rely on us and appreciate that. And I'm talking everybody. I don't care what their political stance is. “A different mission for tribal radio stationsSue Matter, station manager at KWSO in Warm Springs, Oregon, said she reached out to one of her home-state senators, Ron Wyden, who contacted Rounds' office to ask how the funding would be allocated and when. But Wyden was unable to share any concrete information.Matter also spoke with someone she knows at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, who was similarly unable to provide information about how the agreement will actually work.“I'm just assuming there's not anything,” Matter said, adding she’s now focusing on securing a grant from the bridge fund that’s supposed to help the more at-risk public broadcasting stations.Tribal stations, she said, often have substantially different missions than commercial stations, focusing on language and cultural programs as well as preserving their traditional life.“That's endangered,” Matter said. “We won't let anything stop us. But it's sad that for whatever reason this funding has been taken away.”",,,,2025-08-27 14:57:45.349513

The ballots won’t be available until early October, but Maine law allows for people to request them three months before the election. Absentee ballots can be requested online or by contacting the local municipal clerk. 
Once an absentee ballot has been requested, voters can track the process of their request online. If a replacement ballot is needed, voters should contact their municipal clerk. 
Absentee ballots must be requested by 5 p.m. on Oct. 30. They must be returned to the voter’s municipality by 8 p.m. on Election Day.
In-person absentee voting will also be available at town and city halls at least 30 days before the election. The deadline to vote absentee in person is also 5 p.m. on Oct. 30.
Maine residents can also register to vote or change their party status on the Department of the Secretary of State’s website. The portal can also be used to update information for an existing voter registration.
In addition to any local referendums or races, the November election includes two statewide referendum questions. One will ask voters about a multitude of election law changes including the requirement to show photo identification at the polls. The second question will ask voters if they would like to implement a red flag law, officially called an Extreme Risk Protection Order, which would make it easier to temporarily confiscate one’s guns if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members.
For additional questions and information about absentee voting, the Secretary of State’s office has put together an online guide.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Two children, ages 8 and 10, are dead Wednesday following a shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis, where students at the Catholic school there gathered for a mass to celebrate the beginning of the school year.
The shooter, a man in his early 20s without an extensive criminal history, appears to have killed himself at the scene, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who gave a news conference near the site.
Another 17 people were injured — 14 of them children. Two of the injured are in critical condition, O’Hara said.
The shooter approached the church from the outside, barricaded the front door with plywood and shot dozens of rounds through the windows, O’Hara said.
Sen. John Hoffman calls on Democrats to build trust in first speech since attempted assassination

Outside the school after the shooting, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.
Susan Ruff, a neighbor whose children attended the school at Annunciation and has a grandson currently enrolled, said she saw the shooting from her window. She witnessed a man dressed in black, wearing a helmet, with a long gun, shooting at the church from the outside. She heard 25 or 30 gun shots. “It sounded like someone was dropping a dumpster. That loud bang. But I kept hearing it, so I thought, that’s not a dumpster.” Her grandson was unhurt in the shooting.
Jeremy Graff, 50, lives two blocks from the school and said he’s lived in the south Minneapolis neighborhood his whole life. He said his neighbors messaged him around 8:45 a.m. to say they heard a round of gunshots near the campus. He said he has about a dozen friends with kids who go to the school.
“I would like to say it’s surprising, but it’s really not nowadays,” Graff said.
Officers were sweeping the neighborhood and backyards with dogs and interviewing neighbors.
Jack Freedman, 25, went to the school and lives in the area. He said, “You never think that it’s going to happen at the school you went to, but then you start thinking how naive to believe that. Because it happens everywhere.”
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who also spokee at the press conference, grew emotional at times: “And don’t just say, this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” he said, referring to what has become a rote response to school shootings, often unaccompanied by any action. “These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and State Patrol are on the scene.
“I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,” Walz said in a social media post.
Giffords, the national gun control group, released a statement by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and severely injured in a mass shooting in 2011: “When will enough be enough? I am devastated by the news of a mass shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. No one should have to fear for their lives when attending religious services.”

Our levees are stronger, poverty has declined, we have seen significant gains in educational attainment.
But beneath that recovery lies a quieter, more persistent crisis — one we cannot afford to ignore if we want to build true resilience for the future.
Women and children in Louisiana continue to bear the brunt of economic hardship and violence — both within the home and embedded in our broader systems. And new research from the Newcomb Institute at Tulane University shows that these vulnerabilities not only persist—they often worsen during times of crisis.
To mark the 20-year anniversary of Katrina, we released a trio of policy briefs using data from our 2023 Louisiana Violence Experiences Survey (LaVEX) and other statewide sources. Together, they tell a sobering story.
We found that children under 5 — and by extension, families with young children — are disproportionately likely to live in poverty. Many parents face crippling child care costs, with some going into debt just to secure care.
When families are hit with economic shocks — like eviction, homelessness, or not having enough money for food or basic needs — the burden intensifies. These kinds of shocks, especially during and after hurricanes, are linked to increased risk of domestic violence, a threat that falls most heavily on women, particularly those raising young children.
The impact of violence doesn’t start in adulthood. More than 1 in 5 Louisianans report witnessing violence against their mother during childhood. Nearly 1 in 8 girls and 1 in 5 boys in our state report having been physically abused before the age of 13.
These early experiences leave lasting scars and unless we intervene, they are often passed down across generations.
This cycle of poverty and violence is made worse by the climate threats we face. Louisiana is particularly vulnerable to hurricanes and severe weather events. When the storm hits, it doesn’t just tear down buildings — it tears into the stability of the families who can least afford to recover.
If we want to be truly resilient — not just surviving disaster, but growing stronger in its aftermath — we must confront poverty and violence as root causes of vulnerability.
That begins with investing in the systems that protect and empower families every day.
We need accessible, affordable and reliable child care so parents can work and children can thrive. We need stronger safety nets — emergency financial assistance, tenant protections, and food support — especially during times of climate disruption.
And we need to treat violence prevention as essential infrastructure: early screening, wraparound services and survivor support must be built into the very systems that serve our communities including disaster relief.
Louisiana’s long history with natural disasters is well known. But as we look to the future, the more enduring threat may not be the storms themselves, but our tolerance for the persistent social and economic vulnerabilities they expose — and often deepen.
This is our moment to act — not just to survive the next storm but to ensure that all Louisianans, especially our youngest and most vulnerable, can thrive.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Child-welfare-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 14:57:45.349513

(Photo by Shelby Kleinhans for Source NM)New Mexico’s U.S. senators joined the Senate Democratic caucus Wednesday reintroducing federal legislation to guarantee abortion access across the country.
The legislation is a direct response to the 2022 Dobbs decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade.
In the recent Congressional spending bill signed by President Donald Trump, Republicans included language blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving payments through Medicaid — which provides health insurance to low-income people. While a federal judge in July temporarily blocked that component of the law in a case still pending appeal, another federal judge earlier this week allowed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to halt Medicaid payments to reproductive health care providers in Maine.
The bill backed by New Mexico’s delegation would prevent states from imposing restrictions on access to abortion early in pregnancy; require that states not limit access to abortions later in the pregnancy, if the life or health of the mother is at stake; and protect the right to travel for abortion care.
New Mexico, prior to the SCOTUS’ decision overturning Roe v. Wade, had repealed an antiquated law criminalizing abortion, and enacted additional protections after the decision.
Governor signs bill protecting abortion and gender-affirming care providers

Subsequently, the number of abortions performed in New Mexico tripled after the Dobbs decision, rising from about 3,000 per year to more than 12,000 procedures. Nearly 70% of the procedures are for people who traveled out of state, according to data collected by Guttmacher.
The proposed federal law aims to address strain on New Mexico and other abortion providers, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said in a statement.
“A woman has the right to make her own healthcare decisions without politicians inserting themselves between her and her doctors,” Heinrich said. “That right should not depend on the state she lives in, and the majority of Americans agree. Yet Congressional Republicans are doubling down on a national abortion ban, blocking women from making choices about their own bodies and seeking to criminalize doctors and nurses.”
In the interim since the 2022 Dobbs decision, Republican lawmakers across the country have passed further restrictions on accessing abortion, and introduced potential jail sentences for health providers. According to the Guttmacher Institute, just nine states — including New Mexico — do not restrict abortion based on the length of time of the pregnancy. Furthermore, 28 states limit abortion based on how long someone is pregnant and 12 states have a total abortion ban, according to Guttmacher.
Voters in at least seven states restore reproductive rights 

These legal changes at the state level have resulted in unprecedented criminal charges for a New York doctor for providing abortion medication; criminal investigations and arrests for women miscarrying; and more pregnant women dying of infections in Texas. 
Fellow New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján noted in a statement that U.S. Senate Republicans voted to block previous, similar legislation adding the GOP’s “position could not be clearer,” on the issue.
“Senate Democrats stand with the majority of Americans who support Roe, and we will keep fighting to restore and protect reproductive rights,” Luján said in a statement. “These relentless attacks from the Trump administration, Congressional Republicans, and the Supreme Court put the most vulnerable at risk and turn back the clock on progress. We will not back down.”
In the last state legislative session, New Mexico lawmakers passed Senate Bill 57, which creates an exemption in the state’s public records laws for any records that contain “personal identifying information or sensitive information,” of public sector abortion providers.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also has vowed to expand the state’s reproductive health care  capacity with a $10 million center in southern New Mexico under construction; and approval from lawmakers to spend $10 million in capital outlay for a center in northern New Mexico this past session.

On Aug. 28, 2005, six friends came to stay at the Bay Town Inn in Bay St. Louis as Hurricane Katrina was approaching.
At the time, the Bay Town Inn consisted of eight bedrooms and baths, a large kitchen and a wonderful dining room with a table for 12. It was across the street from the beach and had a beautiful view of the sunrise. But that sunrise was not so beautiful one day later.
The house that was the Bay Town Inn was built in 1899 and had withstood many storms. We all felt the house would be able to handle this one. And, we felt the storm was going toward New Orleans, more than the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Even so, the house was boarded up.
The next morning near 5:30, I drove around with my friends Doug and Kevan. We saw that we were almost the only ones who had not evacuated.
The storm picked up just a few hours later. Looking out the kitchen window, I saw my Jeep starting to float. About that time water started seeping in the front door.

We all went upstairs (we seven and my Scottie, and a friend’s Shepherd) to Room 5 at the back of the house thinking it was the safest. It was for a while.
Then one last surge broke through the front of the house and took the first floor and all of the second floor except Room 5.  
The older couple went off on a piece of flooring side by side. I thought they were gone, but luckily they were rescued by the sheriff’s department that afternoon. Doug first swam to an oak at the back of the house, then I swam with my pup, then Kevan.
We tried to get our other friend up but the water and debris was too strong. Her husband made it to another tree. She went under. Thank goodness she was rescued that afternoon as well.  
We were in that oak for three or four  hours with my Scottie under my stomach, Kevan facing the water and Doug behind me.  Every once in a while Kevan would say “duck!” as a wave would come over us.
Around 1 p.m. or so the eye passed, and Doug bravely jumped down, followed by  Kevan and me and my pup.
We saw nothing but destruction – mud, pieces of furniture, bathrooms, stuff.
We went to a house across the way that had lost its first floor but thankfully had its second. We took some dry clothes and then started walking around to see if anyone else was in town. Not many were.
Finally we made it to the second floor of a friend’s home and collapsed for the night.
We were tired, dirty and very much in shock.  Our town was virtually gone.

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Before she was targeted by President Donald Trump, Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook published research centering on race and inequality and advocated for other Black women in economics.
Trump on Monday said he intended to fire Cook, who in 2022 was confirmed as the first Black woman to serve on the independent Federal Reserve Board, which sets U.S. monetary policy and regulates financial markets. Over 100 people have served as governors on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board since it was founded in 1913. Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said Tuesday that she would file a lawsuit challenging Trump’s attempt to dismiss her.
Trump’s move is the latest and most drastic escalation yet in his attempts to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Trump has also aggressively targeted Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell, who last week indicated that the board could cut interest rates at its upcoming September 16 meeting.
In his letter dismissing Cook, Trump cited allegations that Cook engaged in “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct” of mortgage fraud by listing two residencies as her primary residence on loan applications. Cook has not been charged or convicted with any wrongdoing in connection to the allegations, which relate to applications she submitted before her service on the Federal Reserve. Trump’s allies have levied similar accusations against other perceived political opponents, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff of California.
A president can only fire a member of the Board of Governors for “cause,” which has been interpreted to refer to gross misconduct in office. In a Monday statement issued through Lowell, Cook said she would not step down and there was “no cause” for Trump to try to fire her.
“I will not resign,” she said. “I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.”
Much of Cook’s economic research has centered on international economics, particularly the post-Soviet Russian and Nigerian economies, and on race in America, including the impacts of lynchings and segregation and the history of Black innovation.
One of her best-known papers found that violent lynchings of Black Americans between 1870 and 1940 reduced the number of patents awarded to Black inventors. Cook has written and co-authored other research papers and articles on the links between segregation and lynchings, the mortality consequences of distinctively Black names, and causes and ramifications of current gender and racial disparities in innovation and patent filings.
Before then-President Joe Biden appointed her to the Federal Reserve, Cook was a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University. She served on the Council of Economic Advisors in the Obama administration and in the Treasury Department’s Office of International Affairs from 2000 to 2001. She attended Spelman College, a historically Black women’s college, and Oxford University as a Marshall scholar, later earning her Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley.
“I spent my childhood in Milledgeville, Georgia, in the midst of the rural, desegregating South,” she said in her 2023 congressional nomination hearing for a full term on the Board of Governors. “My dedication to public service was invigorated by observing the courage and resolve of my late parents and other members of my family. We stood alongside friends and neighbors whose names were never recorded, and others, like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, whose memories are engraved in our nation’s history.”
Cook has also advocated for women and people of color in economics, including in her role directing the American Economic Association’s Summer Training Program from 2018 to 2021. Black women are heavily underrepresented in the White and man-dominated profession of economics, which in turn has led to underrepresentation on decision-making bodies like the Federal Reserve.
In 2019, Cook and Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman, then a pre-doctoral student, published a New York Times op-ed highlighting the barriers facing Black women in economics, which include discrimination, harassment and inequality in publication citations. Opoku-Agyeman, a doctoral student at Harvard Kennedy School, later co-founded the Sadie Collective, an organization focused on growing the pipeline for Black women in economics and related fields. It’s named for Dr. Sadie T.M. Alexander, who in 1921 became the first Black woman to earn a Ph.D. in economics.
Alexander, they wrote in the op-ed, “switched to law because of the racism and sexism she encountered. A century later the experience of black female economists is disturbingly similar.”
Congressional Democrats and advocates were swift to condemn Trump’s move to fire Cook, the latest in a series of prominent Black women singled out by the administration.
“Dr. Lisa Cook is the first Black woman ever to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement. “Donald Trump is trying to remove her without a shred of credible evidence that she has done anything wrong.”
Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said Trump’s attempt to fire Cook was “further evidence of his strategy to illegally dismantle a politically independent body he cannot control.”
“Time and time again, the president has targeted Black women leaders and has tried to push them out of positions of power,” she said. “As prices continue to rise and his public approval falls, Trump is trying to distract the nation from his failures by removing the experts and replacing them with political loyalists who will blindly carry out his destructive agenda, whatever the cost to our nation and to working families.”

(Photo by Streeter Lecka / Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The University of South Carolina received the final approval it needs to begin long-planned upgrades to Williams-Brice Stadium.
The state’s five-member financial oversight board, chaired by the governor, gave the Gamecocks the nod Tuesday to finance upgrades to the student section, locker rooms, concession stands and bathrooms, as well as expanding the number of suites for big-spending fans.
The flagship university’s athletics department will issue $350 million worth of bonds to pay for improvements to the 91-year-old stadium. University officials emphasized to the oversight board that student fees and tuition will not increase as a result.
Instead, the school plans to pay off those bonds over three decades with additional revenue it expects to earn from new premium seats and suites, plus $16 million from one-time bonuses in its contracts for food sales and media rights.
Athletics anticipates earning $26 million more in annual ticket revenue by year two. By year 30, the school projects that additional ticket revenue to reach more than $70 million, compared to present day numbers, according to documents filed with the State Fiscal Accountability Authority. It also expects to use the new suites to fundraise $210 million, most of that in the first 10 years, according to the documents.

Students should expect changes to the north end zone, including an air-conditioned club space and more restrooms and more concessions for students. Student athletes will see improvements to their locker rooms and training rooms. And the school is considering two new video boards at the south end of the stadium.
But at the heart of the renovations is the expansion of premium seating, taking the stadium from just 18 suites to 43. That includes 33 traditional suites and 10 luxury “founder” suites.
In addition to suites, USC athletics has plans for nine different club areas, including one at field level.
“Increased suites and clubs will address demand from fans and generate new revenue to service athletic revenue bonds,” the school wrote in its proposal.
Construction is expected to begin in December 2025 and finish in August 2028. The renovated stadium will hold about 73,000 fans. That’s a capacity of 4,500 fewer people, resulting in $9 million lost from those seats.
Student fees
Separately, the athletics department sets aside a portion of ticket sales — $15 on each football ticket sold, $4 for each men’s basketball ticket sold and $1 for any women’s basketball ticket — to pay for facility improvements.
Plus, since 2007, full-time students have paid a $52-per-semester special fee that goes to athletics. That fee allowed students to attend every Gamecock sporting event except football games. Students have to enter a lottery for the chance for a spot in the student section. That fee brings in about $2.1 million annually, according to the school’s documents.

While athletics has access to that money, it is already obligated to pay off the $153 million still owed for past projects.
New this year is a $300 annual “auxiliary” athletics fee. That’s on top of the regular, per semester athletics fee. That money’s meant to enhance students’ experiences at games but won’t pay for stadium construction, according to the college.
That $300 fee for full-time students will pay for increased event operating costs, as well as “student centered in-game activity and promotions, facility upgrades and additional support for health/safety staffing at athletics events,” the school said in a statement in July, when the Board of Trustees approved the new fee.
Based on the school’s total enrollment of more than 38,000, that new fee could generate more than $11 million annually.
Clemson University also announced a mandatory $300 athletics fee despite never having such a fee in the past.

Melissa Hortman, her husband and dog has cast a pall over state legislatures, as officials wonder if public service is worth risking their lives.","Minnesota Democratic Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, left, and Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth speak at a tribute to state Rep. Lisa Hortman, who was killed in a politically motivated shooting in June, at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston this month. The shooting has caused many state lawmakers to reconsider the costs and value of public service. (Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”

He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

‘Hold people accountable’
Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.













 I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact. 


–  – Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat





During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
‘What is your why?’
Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A monthly meeting of the Oklahoma State Board of Education has been abruptly canceled after weeks of significant tension between board members and the head of the panel, state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
The board was meant to meet Thursday morning for the first time since conflict erupted during their meeting last month, when two board members reported seeing explicit images on Walters’ office TV. The Oklahoma State Department of Education posted a cancellation notice Wednesday morning, a day before the board’s scheduled August meeting.
Board members Chris Van Denhende, Mike Tinney and Ryan Deatherage said they were given no reason for the cancellation. The Education Department’s interim general counsel sent the board a brief cancellation notice, Van Denhende said, the same one the agency posted publicly on its website.

Van Denhende and Tinney said they have asked for further explanation but so far have received none. The cancellation is “very frustrating because there are important matters that need to be addressed,” Tinney said.
Agency spokesperson Quinton Hitchcock told Oklahoma Voice the meeting was canceled because of the “transitioning staff and legal team.” 
The board’s attorney, Chad Kutmas, has departed in recent weeks after three board members called for his replacement.
“There are several big items facing Oklahoma education and we want to make sure that the board meetings are conducted properly and efficiently,” Hitchcock said.
Walters has announced major changes to state policy in recent months, including an overhaul of Oklahoma’s state testing methods, without seeking approval from the board.
The Oklahoma County District Attorney’s Office is still reviewing evidence from a law enforcement investigation into the incident with Walters’ office TV. Both the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation looked into the matter.
Walters’ administration initially sought a $100,000 contract with an Oklahoma City defense attorney for “pre-charge criminal defense” and for legal advice “to minimize the likelihood of criminal charges being filed, as well as preparing for the possibility of charges,” according to records Oklahoma Voice obtained from the Attorney General’s Office.
The Education Department’s interim general counsel, Jacki Phelps, later contacted the Attorney General’s Office on Aug. 14 to withdraw the contract, records show.
The state Board of Education was in the middle of a private portion of its July 24 meeting when two members saw images of naked women on the TV in Walters’ office, they later told news reporters.

Walters called a news conference days later to deny the allegations. He suggested they were a set-up orchestrated by Gov. Kevin Stitt, who appointed every board member except the state superintendent. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said a “bizarre accident” likely caused the incident. 
An investigation by Hilbert and other state officials found that the Samsung TV in Walters’ office automatically plays a Samsung movie channel. That channel happened to be showing the 1985 Jackie Chan film “The Protector” at the time of the meeting, Hilbert said after requesting information from Samsung. 
Images from “The Protector” seem to match descriptions the board members gave of what they saw on the office screen. The movie includes multiple scenes involving nude women.
Walters, who had said the board members’ allegations were false, has yet to comment on Hilbert’s findings.
Under Oklahoma law, the state Board of Education is meant to meet once a month, but occasionally meetings are canceled or postponed. The Education Department did not answer a question from Oklahoma Voice of whether the August meeting will be rescheduled.
A major vote on annual school accreditation is still awaiting board action. These votes typically take place in July, but yearly accreditation still has yet to appear on a state board agenda.
Van Denhende also called for a special meeting to discuss the board’s authority versus the state superintendent’s powers. He made the request during the July 24 meeting while pointing out that the Education Department removed the board’s secretary, Amy London, without discussing it with the board.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Kutmas, the board’s attorney, shut down Van Denhende’s request for a special meeting. 
Since then, Van Denhende, Deatherage and board member Becky Carson emailed the Attorney General’s Office to ask for Kutmas’ removal, according to records Oklahoma Voice obtained. The Attorney General’s Office has control over state agency contracts with attorneys.
“Mr. Kutmas appears to believe he is Superintendent Ryan Walters personal board attorney and in that regard is obstructionist in his behavior and legal guidance,” Van Denhende wrote in an email. “I request that you review, remove and or cancel his contract so that the State Board of Education can engage with legal counsel that will provide appropriate guidance in matters of the whole board.”
The Tulsa World reported Kutmas’ law firm, Norman Wohlgemuth Attorneys at Law, voluntarily withdrew from representing the board on Aug. 12.
This week’s meeting could have been the board’s first opportunity to vote on hiring its next lawyer.

Free.,"New FAFSA form to be ready by Oct. 1, Education secretary says",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-fafsa-form-be-ready-oct-1-education-secretary-says,,"WASHINGTON — The updated form to apply for federal student aid will launch for all students by Oct. 1, U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon told congressional leaders in a letter this week. The department began testing in early August for the 2026-27 Free Application for Federal Student Aid — better known as FAFSA — to address any bugs or technical issues before opening it up to everyone in the fall. The agency signaled earlier this year that the form would open up to the general public by Oct. 1, the typical opening date for the annual form that’s now congressionally mandated. The department noted that for the 2026-27 FAFSA, 2,435 forms were started, 1,372 were submitted and 1,347 had been processed, as of Monday. McMahon’s letter to lawmakers on Tuesday followed the botched rollout of the 2024-25 FAFSA, which faced several highly publicized hiccups during then-President Joe Biden’s administration’s attempts to implement a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act in 2020.The rollout of the following 2025-26 form, still under the Biden administration, took a staggered approach that included several rounds of testing and gradually increased the number of people able to complete the form. Though that form debuted earlier than the 2024-25 application, the full rollout still came nearly two months later than the usual Oct. 1 date. “Under President Trump’s leadership, our team has prioritized technical competence and expertise, which has led to the earliest testing launch of the FAFSA form in history,” McMahon said in a statement Wednesday. “The Biden Administration failed the FAFSA rollout two years ago, leaving millions of American students and families without clear answers or a path forward in their educational journey,” she said. “Congress gave us a mandate to improve the form and deliver it on time for students, families, and institutions of higher education — and I am proud to certify that the form will launch on time this fall.” McMahon’s letter to the chairs and ranking members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and the House Committee on Education and Workforce follows a law signed by Biden last December that ensures the FAFSA rolls out by Oct. 1 each year. The law also requires the Education secretary to notify Congress by Sept. 1 annually on whether the department will meet that Oct. 1 deadline.",,,,2025-08-27 13:58:32.995055

Mike Braun talks about government efficiency and savings at a news conference on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Department of Administration has saved Hoosier taxpayers about $37.6 million over its first six months under Gov. Braun’s leadership, his office announced.
The agency, which manages state assets, has also identified about $72.2 million in previously anticipated expenses that it will now “avoid.”
Braun said a pair of efficiency executive orders “are paying off.”
“We’re finding a lot of things in many of the nooks and crannies of our own state government,” he told reporters at a news conference Wednesday.
Indiana House OKs bill to increase scrutiny around state agency contracts

Contract renegotiations, for example, saved $1.4 million and prevented $37 million in projected spending, Braun continued.
Reforming the state’s approach to procurement — using national price benchmarks and “smarter processes” — saved $2.3 million and cut $31.8 million from future expenditures, according to a news release issued last week.
The state also launched an in-house procurement management dashboard “at no cost” and plans to establish “advanced category and vendor management systems.”
Such moves align with a recent state law that increases upper-level scrutiny of state contracting.
Reassigning vehicles across agencies saved another $2.1 million and “avoid(ed) unnecessary purchases,” the release continued.
The state still pursued additional fleet vehicles, but at a discount.
Braun’s office said it “leverag(ed) utilization data and bulk purchasing” in its pre-tariff bargaining to save $1.4 million and steer clear of future costs. The release asserted that this move “eliminated $37 million in Motor Pool expenses” over the two-year budget cycle and “reclaimed” 50 administrative staff hours.
The administration has also negotiated $240,000 in lease rebates, with a deal “underway” to eliminate $1.2 million in utility costs.

Nearly 400 surplus items were also redistributed, while 705 computers were earmarked for school corporations. Combined with “improved surplus sales processes,” this generated $1.6 million in revenue and an additional $615,000 in cost avoidance for local units of government, according to the release.
Braun touted the state’s improving fiscal outlook — an expected $337 million surplus — but said the push for efficiency was still necessary.
Asked about layoffs and service cuts, he said, “Our agencies, they had grown over time in a way that wasn’t sustainable. … That still needs to occur, because if we are not running state government efficiently and in a sustainable way, we can’t make the investments, whether it’s in public health, whether it’s in education.”
Agency Commissioner Brandon Clifton told reporters that the direct savings would likely be reverted to the General Fund.
“This is just the beginning,” he said of the push to save.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Florida legislators from both sides of the aisle commented on Wednesday about the latest school shooting in the United States., with some calling for legislation to prevent gun violence.
Two children, aged eight and 10 years old, were killed during a Catholic school mass to mark the first day in school in Minneapolis, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara. An additional 17 were injured, 14 of whom are children.
“This is absolutely unconscionable and unacceptable. Children can’t be safe praying in a church in America?” said Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Darren Soto on X. “As a Catholic, I am deeply grief-stricken by this terrible tragedy. Now is the time for meaningful action to prevent gun violence.”
“Kids deserve to be safe in school!” said Tampa Bay area Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor. “America must act to keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them. Thoughts and prayers are not enough!”
Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, who as governor signed comprehensive gun-safety legislation in the immediate aftermath of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018, also weighed in, although he refrained from calling for any legislative action.
“Ann and I are heartbroken for the families at Annunciation Catholic School and all the victims of this tragedy,” Scott said on X. “Please join us in praying for them.”
“Don’t just say ‘thoughts and prayers,’” said an emotional Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey during a press conference. “These kids were literally praying. … They should be able to go to school or church in peace without the fear or risk of violence, and their parents should have the same kind of assurance.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Two children, ages 8 and 10, are dead Wednesday following a shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis, where students at the Catholic school there gathered for a mass to celebrate the beginning of the school year.
The shooter, a man in his early 20s without an extensive criminal history, appears to have killed himself at the scene, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who gave a news conference near the site.
Another 17 people were injured — 14 of them children. Two of the injured are in critical condition, O’Hara said.
The shooter approached the church from the outside, barricaded the front door with plywood and shot dozens of rounds through the windows, O’Hara said.
Outside the school after the shooting, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.
Susan Ruff, a neighbor whose children attended the school at Annunciation and has a grandson currently enrolled, said she saw the shooting from her window. She witnessed a man dressed in black, wearing a helmet, with a long gun, shooting at the church from the outside. She heard 25 or 30 gun shots. “It sounded like someone was dropping a dumpster. That loud bang. But I kept hearing it, so I thought, that’s not a dumpster.” Her grandson was unhurt in the shooting.
Jeremy Graff, 50, lives two blocks from the school and said he’s lived in the south Minneapolis neighborhood his whole life. He said his neighbors messaged him around 8:45 a.m. to say they heard a round of gunshots near the campus. He said he has about a dozen friends with kids who go to the school.
“I would like to say it’s surprising, but it’s really not nowadays,” Graff said.
Officers were sweeping the neighborhood and backyards with dogs and interviewing neighbors.
Jack Freedman, 25, went to the school and lives in the area. He said, “You never think that it’s going to happen at the school you went to, but then you start thinking how naive to believe that. Because it happens everywhere.”
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and State Patrol are on the scene.
“I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,” Walz said in a social media post.
Giffords, the national gun control group, released a statement by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and severely injured in a mass shooting in 2011: “When will enough be enough? I am devastated by the news of a mass shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. No one should have to fear for their lives when attending religious services.”

,DC,2025-08-27 17:09:23+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judge keeps Abrego Garcia in US at least through October hearing,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-keeps-abrego-garcia-us-least-through-october-hearing,,"WASHINGTON — Maryland federal Judge Paula Xinis barred the Trump administration Wednesday from re-deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully removed earlier this year, until she makes a decision in an evidentiary hearing set for October.Separately, Abrego Garcia filed a claim for asylum, a longshot bid to gain legal status as the Trump administration aims to expel him to Uganda after unlawfully deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador in March. Xinis has no jurisdiction over the asylum case, which will be handled by an immigration judge.    Xinis said at a Wednesday hearing that she would issue a temporary restraining order blocking immigration authorities from removing Abrego Garcia until she issues a decision following a hearing scheduled for Oct. 6 in the U.S. District Court of Maryland. That hearing is on Abrego Garcia’s habeas corpus claim challenging his detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials this week. Xinis said she would rule on the claim within 30 days of the early October hearing. Detained in VirginiaImmigration officials took Abrego Garcia into custody Monday when he appeared for an in-person interview at Baltimore’s ICE field office. He is currently detained at an ICE facility in Virginia, his attorneys said. Xinis said she would include in her temporary restraining order that Abrego Garcia must be detained within 200 miles of the district courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia are also challenging the administration’s efforts to expel Abrego Garcia to the East African nation of Uganda and are pushing for a credible fear interview, in an effort to stop his removal to a country where he could face harm. Immigrants who are deported to a country that is not their home, known as a third country, are allowed to challenge their removal if they believe they will experience harm in that country.Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign said during Wednesday’s hearing that he expects the credible fear process to take two weeks. Ensign said that while the Department of Justice objects to Xinis’ temporary restraining order, the federal government is ""committed"" to keeping Abrego Garcia in the United States until she makes her decision on the habeas corpus claim. Uganda or Costa RicaAbrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador despite deportation protections granted in 2019, was brought back to the U.S. in June to face criminal charges lodged against him by the Department of Justice in May amid several court orders, including from the Supreme Court, that required the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. His case has brought a spotlight to President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia has detailed the physical and psychological torture he experienced at the El Salvador megaprison.Last week, attorneys for Abrego Garcia in his criminal case in Nashville, Tennessee, said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to force Abrego Garcia to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses. Costa Rica’s government has stated it will grant Abrego Garcia refugee status. Abrego Garcia’s attorney in his Maryland case, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, said Abrego Garcia is willing to be removed to Costa Rica but will not plead guilty to the charges in Tennessee. Those charges stem from a traffic stop in 2022 in which Abrego Garcia was in a car with several people. No charges were filed at the time. The Department of Justice has alleged that Abrego Garcia took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. Trump and other top officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have accused Abrego Garcia of being a MS-13 gang leader, but no allegations have been proven in court. Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. without legal authorization from his home country of El Salvador in 2011 at the age of 16. He applied for asylum in 2019, but authorities denied the claim because he did not apply for asylum within his first year in the U.S., which is the legal deadline for such claims.Instead, an immigration judge gave him deportation protections, known as a withholding in place, because it was likely he would face gang violence if returned to his home country of El Salvador. Federal immigration officials at the time didn’t object to the deportation protections and declined to find a third country of removal that would accept him and where he would not experience harm.",,,,2025-08-27 13:58:32.995055

A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.

Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-27 16:57:26+00:00,CT Mirror,A US tariff exemption for small orders ends Friday. It’s a big deal for CT small businesses,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/27/us-tariff-exemption-ct-small-businesses/,Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs will be subject to their origin country’s applicable tariff rate.,"NEW YORK (AP) — Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the United States this week as part of President Donald Trump’s agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods and resetting global trade with tariffs.
An executive order signed last month eliminates a widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 or less starting Friday, nearly two years earlier than the deadline set in the tax cuts and spending bill approved by Congress.
Although the president previously ended the “de minimis” rule for inexpensive items sent from China and Hong Kong, having to pay import taxes on small parcels from everywhere else likely will be a big change for some small businesses and online shoppers.
Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs will require vetting and be subject to their origin country’s applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%. For the next six months, carriers handling orders sent through the global mail network also can choose a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package instead of the value-based rate.
In response, the national postal services of more than a dozen countries said they would temporarily suspend sending some or most U.S.-bound packages due to confusion over processing and payment requirements. Japan and Switzerland on Monday joined Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Thailand, the U.K. and New Zealand in saying they would pause shipments.
Exemption created in 1938 for $1 imports
The Trump administration says the exemption has become a loophole that foreign businesses exploit to evade tariffs and criminals use to get drugs, counterfeit products and other contraband into the U.S. Former President Joe Biden and members of Congress also discussed the issue.
Other countries have similar exemptions, but the threshold is usually lower. For example, 150 euros ($175) is the value limit in the 20 European Union countries that use the euro as their official currency. The U.K. allows foreign businesses to send parcels worth up to 135 pounds ($182) without incurring tariff charges.
In the U.S., the “de minimis” — Latin for lacking significance or importance — exemption started in 1938 as a way to save the federal government the time and expense of collecting duties on imported goods with a retail value of $1 or less. U.S. lawmakers eventually increased the eligibility cutoff to $5 in 1990, to $200 in 1993 and to $800 in 2015, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Since then, the number of shipments claiming de minimis treatment has exploded. A total of 1.36 billion packages with a combined value of $64.6 billion reached the U.S. last year, compared to 134 million packages sent under the exemption in 2015, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency reported.
About 60% of the 2024 shipments came from China and Hong Kong, according to an analysis logistics firm Flexport prepared based on U.S. government data. Multiple countries and regions accounted for the remainder, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, India and Vietnam.
Boutique owner anticipates higher costs for European apparel
Proponents of limiting the exemption argue that it has served as a way for China-founded retail platforms like Temu and Shein to flood the U.S. with low-priced goods. The National Council of Textile Organizations said the move would help close a “backdoor pipeline for cheap, subsidized, and often illegal, toxic and unethical imports.” But some smaller American companies that rely on imported products and materials benefited from the exemption too.
Kristin Trainor is worried the end of de minimis will also mean the end of Diesel and Lulu’s, her 3-year-old boutique in Avon, Connecticut. Over 70% of the women’s clothes and accessories she stocks comes from small fashion houses in France, Italy and Spain. Trainor places small batch orders each week that fall under the $800 threshold.
“Our business model is to provide casual chic and unique clothes at affordable prices,” she said. “The added customs and duty charges that will go into effect on Aug. 29 will eliminate that affordability.”
Trainor said she was looking to replace her European vendors with ones based in the U.S. But her bestselling product categories, such as apparel made of Italian linen, come from other countries. She estimates a simple linen sundress that cost $30 wholesale at the beginning of the year will rise to $43 next month.
After a corporate career, Trainor opened the store to have more time with her 9-year-old son and her 91-year old father. Raising the boutique’s prices to absorb part of the import charges would help offset higher shipping and logistics costs, but Trainor worries her customers will balk at higher prices.
“I have not made any official announcements to my customers just yet, although they have started to ask if I will stay open as they understand the economic impacts that are occurring,” she said. “At this point, I am leaning more and more towards closing the boutique, sadly.”
Trade agreement doesn’t shield products from Mexico and Canada
Ken Huening started CoverSeal, his business making and selling protective covers for cars, motorcycles, grills and patio furniture, in 2020. The company is based in Los Gatos, California, and the covers are manufactured in Mexico and China. When a customer places an order, it ships from Mexico.
Although a trade agreement that took effect in 2020 has made most goods from Mexico and Canada exempt from country-specific U.S. tariffs, the withdrawal of the de minimis rule applies to all countries.
Huening said he’ll either have to raise prices or end free shipping now that his products will be taxed when they are sent from Mexico to U.S. customers. He’s looked at setting up a U.S. production and logistics network but says domestic sewing facilities and textile manufacturers do not exist for the engineered fabric used in CoverSeal’s products.
“We are often asked why we don’t just establish a U.S. supply chain,” he said. “It is not possible in the short term. By the time the infrastructure is established, many companies and small businesses will be out of business.”
Shannen Knight imports hard-to-find sports goggles and glasses as the owner of A Sight For Sport Eyes, her online store and shop in West Linn, Oregon. She routinely received shipments from the U.K., the Netherlands and Italy that fell under the de minimis dollar cutoff.
Knight estimated that she would need to raise the retail price of the rugby goggles she gets from Italy by 50%. It took the International Rugby Board two years of testing to approve the Italian-made goggles, a specialty item without strong prospects for stateside production, she said.
“There are products that it just makes sense to be made internationally, where there is the stronger demand for them, but there still is some demand for in the U.S.,” Knight said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7209-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-27 13:02:58.586223

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The Franklin County courts are moving operations back into the downtown Frankfort courthouse following damage from widespread April floods. 
The courts will return to the courthouse on St. Clair Street starting Tuesday, Sept. 2, the Administrative Office of the Courts said. Flooding inundated communities across Kentucky in April, including the capital city of Frankfort.  
It was the “second worst flood in Franklin County history,” said Franklin Circuit Chief Judge Thomas Wingate in his order granting the reopening of the courthouse.
Franklin County courts have been operating at the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) building on Chamberlin Avenue, which has also served as a temporary home to the Kentucky Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, while some damage was being repaired over the past few months. Some proceedings also took place at the Franklin County Regional Jail and over Zoom. The circuit clerk had a temporary office on Vandalay Drive, another AOC site. 
Because it’s the capital, most court cases involving state officials or government are filed in the local circuit court. A hearing in the Kentucky Student Voice Team’s case against the state over the quality of public education was held at the building on Chamberlin Avenue in May. 
The Franklin circuit clerk’s temporary office will be closed for in-person business Friday as courthouse workers prepare for the move next week. It will reopen Tuesday. 
In a press release, the Administrative Office of the Courts said flood remediation will be ongoing, “but the building is ready for business.” 
Jamie Neal, a spokesperson for AOC, told the Lantern in an email that repairs at the Franklin County courthouse so far have been focused on operating systems, like HVAC and electrical systems, to allow court operations on floors that weren’t directly impacted by the flood. 
“We will have a timeline for full restoration of the first floor after we have a full architectural assessment and reconstruction plans for that floor,” Neal said. “This includes a study of ways to protect against future flood damage.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1388-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-27 13:02:58.586223

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
Energy officials outline Maine-specific problems and solutions to costly clean energy projects

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
Permitting
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
Interconnection
Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
Despite loss of federal EV tax credit, Efficiency Maine still hopeful about transition to clean cars

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Two children, ages 8 and 10, are dead Wednesday following a shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis, where students at the Catholic school there gathered for a mass to celebrate the beginning of the school year.
The shooter, a man in his early 20s without an extensive criminal history, appears to have killed himself at the scene, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who gave a news conference near the site.
Another 17 people were injured — 14 of them children. Two of the injured are in citical condition, O’Hara said.
The shooter approached the church from the outside, barricaded the front door with plywood and shot dozens of rounds through the windows, O’Hara said.
Outside the school after the shooting, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.
Susan Ruff, a neighbor whose children attended the school at Annunciation and has a grandson currently enrolled, said she saw the shooting from her window. She witnessed a man dressed in black, wearing a helmet, with a long gun, shooting at the church from the outside. She heard 25 or 30 gun shots.
Jeremy Graff, 50, lives two blocks from the school and said he’s lived in the south Minneapolis neighborhood his whole life. He said his neighbors messaged him around 8:45 a.m. to say they heard a round of gunshots near the campus. He said he has about a dozen friends with kids who go to the school.
“I would like to say it’s surprising, but it’s really not nowadays,” Graff said.
Officers were sweeping the neighborhood and backyard with dogs and interviewing neighbors.
Jack Freedman, 25, went to the school and lives in the area. He said, “You never think that it’s going to happen at the school you went to, but then you start thinking how naive to believe that. Because it happens everywhere.”
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and State Patrol are on the scene.
“I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,” Walz said in a social media post.
Giffords, the national gun control group, released a statement by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and severely injured in a mass shooting in 2011: “When will enough be enough? I am devastated by the news of a mass shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. No one should have to fear for their lives when attending religious services.”

(Photo illustration via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing) A physician assistant facing multiple criminal charges alleging he sexually assaulted female patients is seeking a court review of his license suspension.
Late last year, the Iowa Board of Physician Assistants issued an emergency order suspending the license of James Haag, who was practicing occupational medicine at MercyOne’s Bluebell Road Family Medicine in Cedar Falls.
In its order, the board cited Haag’s “predatory actions towards his patients (that) constitute a threat to public health.” The board alleged Haag “sexually assaulted multiple patients in his care” and that he posed “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.” In April, the board concluded Haag’s conduct warranted a three-year suspension of his license.

Haag was also criminally charged in connection with the alleged assaults, and is currently facing two counts of sexual abuse, two counts of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, and three counts of simple assault. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a trial is scheduled for Sept. 30, 2025.
With the criminal case still pending, Haag is now seeking judicial review of the licensing board’s decision to suspend his license. Haag alleges that after the board suspended his license, he filed a request for a rehearing. The board, he says, unfairly denied that request in June.
In his petition for judicial review, Haag alleges the board “ignored the facts” that were presented at his disciplinary hearing, “rendering the mandated due process illusory.” The petition cites “inconsistencies and falsehoods/fabrications” within the board’s final decision that he claims are not supported by the evidence.
The petition seeks a court order overruling and board’s decision. Attorneys for the board have denied any wrongdoing and are currently seeking a dismissal of the petition.
Board: Haag touched ‘ vulnerable female patients’
Board records show that as part of his work at Bluebell Road Family Medicine, Haag performed job-related physicals for individuals who worked at a local business. The licensing board alleged that in July 2024, Haag examined four patients for purposes of their employment. In each case, the patients were allegedly instructed to disrobe and Haag conducted the initial portion of the exams without the presence of a nurse or other observer.
During the course of each examination, the board alleges, Haag removed each patient’s robe and “made physical contact” with the patients’ genitals. In some instances, the board alleges, he used his hands, while in others he “pressed his fully clothed pelvic area into the patient’s genitals or backside.”
The board alleges Haag also made “inappropriate contact with multiple patients’ breasts” during the course of their examinations. “In multiple instances, where the patients attempted to cover themselves, (Haag) swatted their hands away,” the board alleges.
When a board investigator asked Haag about the allegations, the board says, Haag replied with one word: “Lies.” He denied all of the allegations, including touching the women’s breasts, pushing their hands away when they tried to hold their gowns closed or retie their gowns and touching the women’s vaginal area.
At the February 2025 hearing on the licensing board charges, Haag testified that he always requests a chaperone be in the room during a female hernia exam for his own “protection” since the procedure involves touching a woman’s lower pelvic area.
Hearing testimony indicated that while a chaperone entered the room during the four women’s physicals, it was typically after Haag had already performed the portion of the exam that was most concerning to the women. The board concluded that the four women were credible and consistent in their allegations.
As for Haag, the board said that “by his own admission, Haag spent several minutes alone in an exam room with female patients” prior to requesting a chaperone’s presence.
“Haag used his position of power as a medical professional to inappropriately touch vulnerable female patients, patients that were required to undergo a physical in order to maintain employment,” the board stated in its ruling.

To provide the services we need, want, and expect from our public transit system, the T needs to do more things and hire more people and pay them competitively. There’s nothing controversial or troubling about this.
The post Yes, the MBTA operating budget has increased significantly – and that’s a good thing   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE FOLKS AT the Pioneer Institute are focusing their attention once again on the MBTA, and their complaint (well, it is actually their recurring complaint) is that the T’s operating budget is spiraling out of control. As evidence of this, Charles Chieppo and Andrew Mikula wrote recently in CommonWealth Beacon: 

“Since fiscal 2021, system operating costs have risen more steeply every year, including by nearly 15 percent between fiscal 2023 and 2024.  The biggest culprit is the bus system. In 2019, the MBTA spent $153 per hour in operating costs to run a bus, compared to $220 at New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority. By 2023, costs had risen slightly to $263 in New York, but the hourly cost of operating an MBTA bus nearly doubled to $297, exceeding New York’s costs.” 

This analysis of the T’s operating budget is very misleading, as it fails to take into account the variety of reasons why the T’s operating budget has increased, and fails also to acknowledge how critical those increases are to the proper functioning of the system. 
Why has the MBTA’s operating budget increased significantly since fiscal year 2021 (which includes a portion of 2020)? Let’s look at the facts.  
The major global pandemic disruption of 2020-2021 saw T ridership (and fare revenue) plummet to unprecedented levels. Beyond the massive hit this had on T revenues, the pandemic also caused an unprecedented workforce shortage. Many people quit or took retirement, and the impact of the pandemic on the bus driver workforce was especially severe.  
Driving a bus is probably the most challenging job at the MBTA. You have to drive a huge and unwieldy vehicle in Greater Boston traffic conditions, and do so safely every day while carrying a large number of passengers who themselves can often have challenging needs.  
A bus driver needs to navigate Boston’s narrow streets and congestion, in all types of weather. A bus driver is in close proximity to passengers. A bus driver needs to manage fare collection on the bus, and needs to ensure accommodation for riders with baby carriages or accessibility devices. Attracting people to do this type of work is not easy, particularly in a low-unemployment marketplace. 
What made it near-impossible to restore the workforce after the pandemic? In 2015, after a succession of paralyzing snowstorms shut down the T and exposed longstanding problems in its operations, the Baker administration, in its zeal to reduce costs, secured a temporary exemption from the state’s privatization statute, the so-called Pacheco Law, which puts limits on the ability to contract out state services.  
Using this as leverage, they entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the T’s Carmen’s Union that saved money at the expense of younger or new workers. The most notorious provision of that contract was the provision restricting all new bus driver hires to work only part-time hours, capped at 30 hours a week, with fewer benefits than more senior drivers.   
This worked well until the pandemic gutted the bus driver workforce, and the T needed to hire bus drivers to fill the huge gaps. The collective bargaining agreement was wisely renegotiated by the Healey administration, and the restrictions on full-time work were removed, signing bonuses were offered, and wages were improved to be competitive with other US transit agencies and with the Metro Boston marketplace.  
Once those provisions were put into place, applications for bus drivers rose dramatically – by over 300 percent — and bus service was able to be restored to acceptable levels.   These necessary changes worked to bring bus driver staffing to its needed level, but they cost a great deal of money. For Chieppo and Mikula to cite the bus system as the biggest “culprit” driving operating costs while ignoring this recent history is an omission that undermines the credibility of their argument.  
In addition to bus drivers, as I have previously written, the T also needed to recruit new dispatchers into its Operations Control Center, in order to run more subway service. It should surprise — or trouble — no one that hiring more people into essential jobs in this low-unemployment, post-pandemic period costs more money. 
Beyond the saga of retaining and recruiting bus drivers, Pioneer seems to forget that the T is growing, not retrenching. Operating new services like South Coast Rail and the Green Line Extension – both initiatives embraced by the prior administration – requires more funding. To run late night service, the T needs more operating funding. To reduce traffic congestion and offer more sustainable mobility services through the Greater Boston region, the T needs to improve commuter rail frequencies. To prevent fare evasion on the trolley and bus systems, the T needs to hire fare engagement representatives.  
In short, to provide the services we need, want, and expect from our public transit system, the T needs to do more things and hire more people and pay them competitively. There’s nothing controversial or troubling about this.   
Indeed, there are many advocates, myself among them, who believe that the current operating budget is insufficient to meet the full needs of our regional economy.  
The T should be performing more routine and programmed maintenance activities as operating expenses, rather than deferring work so it can be paid out of the capital budget. The T should be running more service across the system, and this requires hiring more operators for all modes. The T should beef up its planning and procurement and project management capabilities in order to get more work out more quickly. All of this will cost more money. This is not a call for profligate spending; it is a candid appraisal of the role of the transit system of a major US metropolitan area. 
I have written several times about ways to tame the growth of the operating budget and ensure that its resources are spent on helping T riders. For example, the T still pays 100 percent of the cost of paratransit service for disabled riders, an annual amount in excess of $140 million. This is a human services issue as much as it is a transportation issue, and this cost should be borne by the Commonwealth, not the MBTA.  
Since 2015, the T has been in a very dynamic period. I acknowledge many of the positive aspects of the tenure of the Fiscal Management and Control Board created in the wake of the system meltdown that winter. The FMCB adopted several useful reforms, but they also embarked on a strong reinvestment program for the system. Reinvestment and reinvigoration of public transportation, by definition, means more services to more places and improved performance. This is not achievable on an austerity budget.  
The MBTA certainly has an obligation to spend its rider and taxpayer funds wisely, and it also has an obligation to be fully transparent with data and analysis so that everyone can rest assured their hard-earned T fares and taxes are having their intended impact. 
But accusing the T of spending too much when, in fact, it is probably not spending enough, is simply unwarranted. Reporting budget numbers without proper context is not sufficient or credible analysis. Pioneer does a disservice to the T, to T riders, and to all residents of the Commonwealth when it presents facts out of context and misleads people to think the T is spending more than it needs to or more than it should.

George Orwell’s dystopian novels “Animal Farm” and “1984” have remained popular in the U.S. ever since their initial publication in the 1940s.
What’s less well known is that in the years before the publication of “Animal Farm” and “1984,” Orwell’s writing often focused primarily on other themes including work, poverty, anti-imperialism and democratic socialism.
In fact, Orwell remained a committed democratic socialist until his death in 1950.
“Animal Farm” tells the tale of a group of farm animals who take ownership of their farm from their human master by means of rebellion, but who eventually end up re-enslaved by the farm’s pigs. “1984” tells the story of one man’s failed attempt to resist totalitarian rule in a hypothetical future dictatorship set in Orwell’s home country of England.
Part of these books’ initial appeal came from their critiques of Soviet communism as the U.S. was entering the Cold War. Part of why the books seem to have remained popular are their anti-totalitarian and pro-freedom messages, which have been praised by people across the U.S. political spectrum.
Orwell, who died of tuberculosis at age 46, is a writer famous for the ideas that preoccupied him in the final years of his life. His journey to those ideas via his thinking about work, poverty and democratic socialism, among other themes, may surprise those familiar with only his dystopian fiction.
 Communism and socialism not synonymous

Orwell’s democratic socialism may surprise some Americans for at least two reasons.
First, when many Americans talk about politics, they often treat communism and socialism as interchangeable terms. How could Orwell, the great satirist of Soviet communism, have been a socialist?
The answer is that communism and socialism are not synonymous.
Orwell denied that Soviet communism was a form of socialism. Instead, he saw Soviet communism as totalitarianism merely masquerading as socialism.
Orwell claimed in his 1937 book, “The Road to Wigan Pier,” that “Socialism means justice and common decency” and a commitment to “the overthrow of tyranny.” Elsewhere in the same book, he maligned communism’s anti-democratic behavior as like “sawing off the branch you are sitting on.”
A second reason that Orwell’s commitment to democratic socialism may surprise some is because in the U.S., democratic socialism is often associated with the nation’s most left-leaning political figures, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. And Orwell is often not viewed in popular imagination as a political progressive.
Yet, by American standards, Orwell was very politically progressive. He argued in “The Lion and the Unicorn” that his home country of England ought to nationalize mines, railways, banks and major industries. He also argued for limits on income inequality. Some of these policies run to the left of even most U.S. democratic socialists.
For Orwell, such left-leaning economic policies were not only compatible with, but required, a strong commitment to the central pillars of democracy, such as intellectual freedom, free speech, a free press and genuine rule by the people.
I think the best way to understand how these aspects of Orwell’s political views came together is to look at the evolution of his writing.
 Work and poverty

Two of the most important themes in Orwell’s first decade as a professional writer, the 1930s, are work and poverty.
These are what he focused on most in his first book, the autobiographical “Down and Out in Paris and London,” published in 1933. There he recounts his experiences living among the poor and unemployed in France and England in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
The book is full of pithy insights, such as “poverty frees people from ordinary standards of behavior, just as money frees people from work,” and “the average millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit.”
The latter quote highlights one of the key ethical and political messages of “Down and Out”: It is primarily social and political circumstances, and not moral character, that separates the rich from the poor.
Another key theme in “Down and Out” is that without a certain amount of leisure, people are incapable of doing certain kinds of thinking.
For example, Orwell argued that the reason the kitchen staff in French restaurants had not gone on strike or formed a union was because “they do not think, because they have no leisure for it; their life has made slaves of them.”
Orwell blamed the owners of such establishments for exploiting their workers. As he saw it, at most upscale restaurants “the staff work more and the customers pay more” and “no one benefits except the proprietor.”
In multiple novels and works of nonfiction in the 1930s, Orwell continued to explore the idea that social and political circumstances robbed people of the time they needed to engage in tasks like serious thinking and writing.
 Imperialism and democratic socialism

One of Orwell’s earliest and most enduring political commitments was anti-imperialism – opposition to extending national power by means of colonialization or military force.
Orwell was of English and French descent. He was raised in England, but born in India in 1903. His father worked for the British Civil Service, which at the time exercised administrative control over India as a British colony.
Following his father’s footsteps, he spent five years working for the Imperial Police in Burma, now Myanmar. He came away from that experience with a deep hatred of imperialism. He drew upon this in his novel “Burmese Days” and his essays “A Hanging” and “Shooting an Elephant.”
In “The Road to Wigan Pier,” he wrote, “I hated the imperialism I was serving with a bitterness which I probably cannot make clear.”
“Wigan Pier” also displays Orwell’s commitment to democratic socialism. In the book’s first half, he reports on the dismal working and living conditions of the poor and unemployed in northern England. In the second half, he uses that material to make a case for democratic socialism.
In Orwell’s view, in deciding whether to embrace democratic socialism one had “to decide whether things at present are tolerable or not tolerable.” He concluded that present conditions were not tolerable and that democratic socialism was the way to make things better.
 Propaganda and totalitarianism

Orwell developed into a sharp critic of Soviet Russia after witnessing how they used propaganda to mislead much of Europe about the Spanish Civil War. He discussed this in his book “Homage to Catalonia,” which recounts his time during the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer soldier fighting with the Spanish left against Gen. Francisco Franco, who would go on to become the country’s longtime dictator.
From Orwell’s perspective, communism highlighted the risks of how socialist revolution could go wrong. He thought that, without care, attempts at socialist revolution could create opportunities for a new form of oppression through totalitarianism.
He saw that totalitarianism was not limited to either the political left or right. Soviet communism represented left-wing totalitarianism, while Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy represented right-wing totalitarianism.
Thus, a major preoccupation in his final years was trying to warn people about the risks of falling into totalitarianism during times of political upheaval. Orwell wanted radical political change, but the change he wanted was in the service of increasing freedom and democracy, not decreasing it.
“Animal Farm” is a story about falling into autocracy. “1984” is a story about just how much autocracy can take from us.
But the things Orwell wanted to preserve, such as freedom of the mind, were also things that he thought were at risk from circumstances like poverty, oppressive working conditions and imperialism.

It brings the state’s fatality count attributed to the pathogen this year to six.
The two most recent deaths involved people who ate oysters harvested in Louisiana at two separate restaurants — one in Louisiana and another in Florida – according to Jennifer Armentor, molluscan shellfish program administrator from the Louisiana Department of Health.
Armentor shared information about the vibrio-related deaths Tuesday during a regular meeting of the Louisiana Oyster Task Force, held at New Orleans Lakefront Airport.
“It’s just prolific right now,” Armentor told task force members.
She did not provide any additional information about the individuals who died or where they ate. Armentor reiterated in a call Wednesday morning that the fatalities involved people who ate oysters, but did not confirm whether they were the source of the vibrio infection.
State officials have yet to specify whether the four earlier vibrio deaths involved exposure to the bacteria through open wounds or from eating raw seafood. The Louisiana Department of Health did not respond immediately to questions Tuesday afternoon.
As of July 31, the state reported four deaths and 17 hospitalizations attributed to vibrio infections. There have been 14 more illnesses since then, but it’s not yet known how many resulted in hospitalization.
Vibrio infections and deaths are generally rare, but cases linked to Louisiana are spiking this year above the average annual rate of seven infections and one death since 2015. Scientists say it’s hard to pinpoint exactly why this is happening.
“Numbers are typically so low, any change looks disproportionate,” said Dr. Salvador Almagro-Moreno, an associate faculty member at St. Jude Children’s Hospital with expertise in vibrio infections. “Nonetheless, the trend over the past few decades is quite clear: The number of cases has been steadily and consistently increasing, and from these recent outbreaks, they do not seem to be on decline.”
Flesh-eating bacteria in coastal waters are more common during the summer months when warmer waters provide better living conditions for vibrio. Direct wound exposure to brackish waters or eating oysters harvested from such areas increases the likelihood of coming into contact with these naturally occurring bacteria.
“You can almost watch it spread,” Paul Gulig, professor emeritus and microbiologist at the University of Florida, said in an interview.
Symptoms
The infection is known as “flesh-eating” for good reason, he said. Nausea, vomiting, and chills are all symptoms from consuming the bacteria, while wound exposure can cause severe redness and swelling, with infected patients sometimes needing limb amputation to save their lives.
“If you put a mark with a pen around the edge of the redness, and you came back an hour or two later, it would have moved significantly,” Gulig said.
Different health factors can worsen vibrio infections, including stomach and liver conditions, a weakened immune system, and pregnancy, according to the state health department.
Open wounds have created the biggest risk in this year’s vibrio infections, according to state health data. Three-quarters of the illnesses reported in Louisiana last month involved people with direct wound exposure to brackish waters where vibrio lives.
Gulig confirmed this trend, saying research shows wound infections have overtaken eating raw oysters as the top way of getting infected over the past 20 years.
Mitch Jurisich, chairman of the Louisiana Oyster Task Force and a Plaquemines Parish oyster farmer, said it’s critical for consumers to know all the risks involved.
“We want the public to know about safety with oysters, but there’s other ways of getting [vibrio infections],” Jurisich said, adding that people with certain health conditions should avoid raw seafood.
Different factors – such as warmer Gulf temperatures, saltwater intrusion, or even more people swimming and eating oysters – could be behind the spike in cases, Jurisich added
It could also just be chance, according to Gulig.
“Just like rolling dice, sometimes you get snake eyes three times in a row and there’s nothing that really explains that, other than just kind of random chance,” the microbiologist said. “This could be kind of a random thing.”

Donzell Lee, the current president, will remain in his role until June 2026. 
In an email, Blondean Y. Davis, chair of the presidential search committee, told constituents last week that WittKieffer, a Chicago-based consulting and executive firm, will lead the process. The committee has also created a leadership profile outlining the qualities for a successful candidate. 
Earlier this summer, the committee led community listening sessions for faculty, alumni, board of trustees and students. The college’s next leader will be expected to expand enrollment, help with financial sustainability and elevate the national profile, according to the job profile. Applications for the role will be accepted through Oct. 10. 
Faculty and alumni have been dissatisfied with the school’s leadership for years. In March, the college’s faculty senate issued a series of no confidence votes for Lee, the office of the provost and registrar. 
In a memo, faculty cited lack of communication from Lee as well as failing to  acknowledge lingering concerns about provost Josiah Sampson III and registrar Pam England. The faculty senate voted no confidence in Sampson and England in May 2024. Lee was interim president of the university at the time. 
In April, Lee told the Clarion Ledger, the administration reviewed the concerns and worked toward “an appropriate path forward.” It is unclear if issues were resolved. 
In 2022, students voted no-confidence in the leadership of Carmen Walters, the college’s 14th president. That same year, a group called the Tougaloo College Alumni Coalition for Change created an online petition calling for Walters’ removal that garnered more than 1,500 signatures. 
The petition claimed the college had been without a full-time registrar for years. Faculty were leaving in a “mass exodus” and enrollment had fallen to its lowest point in 40 years. Enrollment under Walter’s tenure dropped to 713 students in Fall 2021, down by 8% from the previous year, Higher Ed Drive cites. In Fall 2023, there were 725 students enrolled at the college according to federal data. 
Founded in 1869, the college is recognized as an important institution in the Civil Rights Movement, serving as a refuge for activists and gathering space for organizers in Mississippi to plan sit-ins, protests and voter registration drives. The college currently serves roughly 600 students and offers more than 30 programs of study.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100039/3X0A3913-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-27 11:56:45.569562

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)

Writing the date on a mail-in ballot envelope is a minor burden for voters, a federal appeals court said Tuesday. But the impact of making a mistake or forgetting to do so is too great to justify the requirement.
The Philadelphia-based U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has now twice considered the date requirement in Pennsylvania’s vote-by-mail law after earlier rejecting claims it ran afoul of federal law.
This week’s ruling stems from a lawsuit by Erie County voter Bette Eakin, originally filed after her mail-in ballot for the 2022 general election was rejected because she failed to write a date on the return envelope. The Third Circuit found the government interests in requiring a date do not outweigh the harm to voters’ rights.
“Because of the commonwealth’s date requirement, an inadvertent typographical error or a flipped number or even a stray pen mark in the date field will remove the ballot contained within the return envelope from consideration. And the voter may never be the wiser,” Circuit Judge D. Brooks Smith wrote for the unanimous three-judge panel.
Democratic backers of Eakin’s case called the decision “a victory for free and fair elections,” and the right of Pennsylvanians to participate in democracy.
“It’s also a reminder that the Republicans’ playbook for the midterms is to disenfranchise voters across the country because they know they can’t win on their failed governing record,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Executive Director Julie Merz and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Executive Director Devan Barber said in a statement. “Democrats are united in the fight to ensure every legal vote is counted, in Pennsylvania and across the nation, and will not let these Republican attacks go unanswered.”
Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Greg Rothman and lawyers for the GOP did not return calls Tuesday.
Pennsylvania voters first had the option to cast ballots by mail without an excuse for not going to the polls in 2020. The convenience appealed to voters, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many sought to avoid crowds. County election offices received more than 3 million requests for mail-in ballots.
In every election since, voters’ failure to correctly date their ballot envelopes has caused significant numbers of ballots to be rejected. Voting rights advocates estimated more than 10,000 voters were disenfranchised because of such errors in 2022. Even after the Department of State redesigned ballot envelopes to reduce errors and omissions, about 4,500 mail-in ballots were rejected in 2024, according to the opinion.
In an earlier challenge to the law, Eakin argued the date requirement violated voting rights protections under the Civil Rights Act – specifically, its Materiality Clause, which bars requirements (e.g., literacy tests) that aren’t material to whether someone is qualified to vote and could disenfranchise them.
U.S. District Judge Susan Paradise Baxter in western Pennsylvania agreed with Eakin. But the Third Circuit overturned her decision, with Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro writing that the provision only applies when the state is determining who may vote and not how they must cast a ballot.
In the current case, Eakin claimed the date requirement violated her First Amendment right to vote and 14th Amendment right to equal treatment under the law. Baxter again sided with Eakin. This time, the Third Circuit panel agreed that Baxter had correctly employed a longstanding test balancing the interests of the states in administering elections against the burden on voters that could keep them from casting ballots.
The Third Circuit panel rejected arguments that the date requirement was crucial to election administration on appeal by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, its national counterpart and the Republican National Congressional Committee.
“The date requirement seems to hamper rather than facilitate election efficiency. By its nature, it fails to add solemnity to the process of voting,” wrote Smith, who was nominated for the court by President George W. Bush.
He also rejected the Republicans’ argument that the date requirement assisted in detecting and prosecuting ballot fraud.
In the six years since Act 77 introduced no-excuse mail-in voting to Pennsylvanians, such a scenario has played out “only in the extremely rare instance involving a hapless fraudster who obtains a recently deceased voter’s mail-in ballot, completes the ballot, and adds a date on the return envelope postdating the deceased voter’s death,” Smith noted.
“One bizarre instance of the date requirement helping the commonwealth prosecute a criminal case of voter fraud — fraud that had been detected by other means — cannot justify the burden the date requirement imposes that affects thousands of Pennsylvania voters every election,” Smith said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)DAKOTA DUNES, South Dakota — Business leaders in the Sioux City area are asking the governors of South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska to help secure hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for infrastructure improvements.
The projects include replacing a deteriorating runway and parking ramp at the 185th Air Refueling Wing in Sioux City, an Army Corps of Engineers study on Big Sioux River flooding, and upgrades to a Sioux City wastewater plant. The funding needs for the projects amount to about $653 million.
Presenters at Tuesday’s Tri-State Governors’ Conference also shared some concerns about federal funding under the Trump administration. South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen told reporters after the conference that the way to address those concerns is leveraging personal connections with the administration and congressional delegates to address tri-state needs.

“It’s working really, really hard and developing relationships within the federal government,” Pillen said, referencing a meeting this week he has planned with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. “It’s making sure that we have a tremendous sales pitch so they understand the best investment of tax dollars comes to the Great Plains.”
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds did not stay to answer media questions after the event. The three Republican governors met in Dakota Dunes, a South Dakota community just outside of Sioux City, where the three states’ borders meet.
Runway replacement
The National Defense Authorization Act, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee in July, would allocate $148 million to the runway project for the 185th Air Refueling Wing, a unit of the Iowa Air National Guard. The Federal Aviation Administration designated an additional $20 million.
But that funding falls short of the total project cost of $180 million. All three governors said they would support the effort to secure additional funding.
“Even though the runway is located in Iowa, it’s a regional asset that supports all of us in this three-state area and beyond to our entire nation,” Rhoden said.
Without full funding, the city could ultimately lose its airport fire department, airport control tower, the KC-135 air refueling tanker mission and all Air National Guard flying activities, according to the presentation by local officials. The military unit employs over 900 servicemen and women living in the tri-state area.
Wastewater upgrades
The Sioux City Wastewater Treatment Plant is “overloaded” and deteriorating, said Ryan Callahan with RP Constructors. The facility deals with heavy industrial wastewater demands due to food processing companies in the city.
It’ll cost $470 million to make improvements to the facility and meet regulatory requirements by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Iowa Department of Natural Resources. That’s too costly for local governments to handle on their own, Callahan said, asking the governors to “aggressively” pursue federal funding.
“This is a tri-state area issue,” Callahan said. “It’s also a water quality issue. Everybody that is contiguous to that river wants to have good water quality.”

Barbara Sloniker, executive vice president at the Siouxland Chamber of Commerce, said the city expected to receive funding from the Biden administration’s infrastructure programs, but is “a little uncertain” where the funding will come from under the Trump administration. The administration has made wide-ranging cuts to government programs since President Trump returned to office in January.
While Rhoden encouraged the attendees to explore working with the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources for possible state funding, Pillen said businesses driving the increased demand and need should help foot the bill before asking the government to step in.
“I think we should have the expectation that if we have an industry that is growing and making a lot of money in our communities, they should be part of solving that problem,” Pillen said. “I just don’t believe the state should pay for all of that.”
Pillen’s take is “somewhat true,” Sloniker said after the conference.
“If funding can be combined with state funds, that could help ease the burden on our taxpayers, which includes individuals and businesses,” Sloniker said.
Flood study
North Sioux City Administrator Jeff Dooley requested the governors use their positions to encourage the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fund a study of flooding on the Big Sioux River. The study is needed to reevaluate the nearly 50-year-old flood mitigation plan for the area.
The plan came under scrutiny last summer after major flooding on the Big Sioux River damaged or destroyed dozens of homes around McCook Lake, north of Sioux City. The goal of the flood mitigation plan was to protect North Sioux City, Dakota Dunes and parts of Sioux City by diverting floodwaters into McCook Lake, but the plan was overwhelmed by a historic volume of water.

“It’s going to be a huge lift, so the region will have to come together with the states and federal government,” Dooley said.
The study will cost $3 million and take four years to complete, said Rhoden, who added that his office and local leaders have been in contact with congressional delegates.
“We’re looking for ways to support that study and the local match,” Rhoden said.
Potential changes to the Federal Emergency Management Agency discussed by the Trump administration could put a greater burden on states to fund disaster preparedness and responses.
Pillen said he still expects FEMA to play a role.
“To say FEMA is over, I think that’d be a little dramatic,” he told South Dakota Searchlight after the conference.
Rhoden added that his “comfort level” is greater after meeting with Trump Cabinet members and administration leaders, adding that he’s “gotten results immediately” when he’s asked for help from the administration.

Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
 ‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.
D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
 Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “(The tax credits) are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of (state regulators’) financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

Tim Walz said Wednesday that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and State Patrol are on the scene of what he called a “horrific act of violence” at a Catholic church in south Minneapolis.
“I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,” Walz said in a social media post.
The shooting was reported at Annunciation Church, which is also the site of a Catholic school.
Th Star Tribune reported that two children were killed, and the gunmen also dead.
A news conference was scheduled for Wednesday morning.
Outside the school, parents were picking up their children, who wore the green polos that are the school uniform.
Jeremy Graff, 50, lives two blocks from the school and said he’s lived in the south Minneapolis neighborhood his whole life. He said his neighbors messaged him around 8:45 a.m. to say they heard a round of gunshots near the campus. He said he has about a dozen friends with kids who go to the school.
“I would like to say it’s surprising, but it’s really not nowadays,” Graff said.
Officers were sweeping the neighborhood and backyard with dogs.
Another neighborhood resident, who declined to give his name, said he lives four blocks away and woke up to about 30 gunshots around 8:20 and came to Annunciation.
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, the former chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, opened up the final general session of the DNC summer meetings in Minneapolis by denouncing the shooting and offering prayers to the affected families.

(Photo provided by LifeWise Academy)At least one Kentucky school district has rejected a proposal from Ohio-based LifeWise Academy which has plans in the works across Kentucky to offer Bible lessons to public school students.
The board of Warren County Public Schools voted 3-2 against the nonprofit organization’s proposal, the Bowling Green Daily News reports. If the board had approved, students with their parents’ permission would have been able to leave an elementary school with LifeWise volunteers and travel to a nearby church for instruction.
LifeWise has started planning teams in 45 school districts across Kentucky to ask boards for approval to offer weekly Bible-based education classes.
The push comes after the Republican-controlled General Assembly enacted Senate Bill 19 over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto earlier this year. The legislation initially required moments of silence at the start of school days. Toward the final days of the session, the House added a section to allow boards of education to permit “moral instruction” programs for students off campus and during school hours with parents’ permission. 
A local program director told the Daily News that LifeWise plans to again propose Bible-based education to Warren County Public Schools despite the school board’s Aug. 21 rejection of the first proposal.
According to its Statement of Faith available online, LifeWise “maintains a high view of the authority of Scripture and we align ourselves with historic, orthodox Christian beliefs as expressed in the Nicene Creed,” 
The Oldham County Schools Board of Education is weighing a similar proposal. On Monday, Oldham board members heard from dozens of community members for and against LifeWise’s plan but did not take a vote during the board meeting. The Oldham County board has asked the Kentucky attorney general’s office for more clarification on the legality of moral instruction proposals. 
WPSD Local 6 reported last week that LifeWise is working on a proposal in McCracken County that will be submitted to the local board of education for consideration. 
One Kentucky school district, Marshall County, has had an active Lifewise program since 2023. Six schools in that district will have the program this fall. State law previously allowed school- based decision making (SBDM) councils to decide if off-campus moral instruction programs could be offered to students.
The Heritage Foundation awarded LifeWise one of its Innovation Prizes earlier this year, which included a financial award. LifeWise reported in its most recent IRS filing that its revenue exceeded expenses by $17 million. The organization reported its revenue grew from $13.8 million to $35.3 million from 2023 to 2024.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCF5458-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 11:56:45.569562

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources will hold two public hearings in September for a review of water quality standards, as required every three years by federal regulations. 
Per the hearing agenda, DNR plans to discuss water quality standards as they relate to antidegradation, human health criteria, per and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, lake nutrients and rights reserved for tribal nations. 
The agenda also notes a “cleanup” of the Surface Water Classification document. Per the state water quality standards, this section outlines how certain water segments are classified either as general use, or designated use waters which encompass everything from segments used for recreation, those that serve as drinking water, are home to cold-water aquatic life or are regularly fished for human consumption.

DNR has not noted areas intended to be changed in the standards. More on the topics listed on the agenda can be found online or in the state water quality standards. 
Antidegradation refers to the federal laws that are in place to protect and maintain water quality from unnecessary pollution. These are regulated through things like permits and the designation of outstanding waters in the state. 
PFAS, which are sometimes called “forever chemicals” are man-made chemicals used in non-stick coatings, firefighting foam, clothing, carpets, waterproofing materials and more. The chemicals are so prevalent that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports “many PFAS are found in the blood of people and animals all over the world” as well as in water bodies, fish, air and soil. 
DNR said the existing research on PFAS “suggests” exposure to the chemicals may be linked to developmental defects in infants and to certain types of cancer. The department has a PFAS action plan and has tested public water supplies across the state for the chemicals. 
According to reporting from Iowa Public Radio, Des Moines Water Works and several other utilities in Iowa will receive millions of dollars from the settlement of a case against 3M for PFAS pollution. Similar cases and settlements across the state have popped up in the last several years as water utilities face mounting costs at removing PFAS from drinking water. 
At the public hearings, which will be held virtually, DNR staff will take questions and public comments. 
The meetings will be held: 
— Thursday, Sept. 18, at 9:30 a.m.
— Tuesday, Sept. 23, at 2:30 p.m.
Links for both meetings can be found online.
Those who cannot attend either session can view the recordings of the sessions and submit written comments to the department, on the proposed topics, after the first session and through Oct. 20. Public comments can be submitted via email to wqs@dnr.iowa.gov.

It doesn’t have pottery, vases or fine china. Instead, it holds onesies, pacifiers and hospital bracelets. 
“Isn’t that the smallest urn you’ve ever seen?” Shows asked, looking toward the second shelf.

Makayla and Carson Shows’ daughter Mazeigh died in 2023 in a hospital after she was found unresponsive at First Baptist Children’s Center in Brandon. She was 3 months and 3 days old. 
That year, deaths of  40 children were reported in day care centers across the U.S. But 16 states, including Mississippi, had incomplete numbers or no recorded data.
Day care deaths in the U.S. are rare, but complaints about injuries, neglect, abuse and unsafe conditions are more common. Together, they paint a picture of an industry without enough resources to guarantee safety for young children at a price that parents can afford to pay. 
Advocates and industry experts say the problems are driven by staffing shortages, low pay and a lack of oversight, and are indicative of a deeper problem: an undervaluation of caregiving and early education in the U.S.

The medical examiner’s report on Mazeigh’s death says she was put in an unsafe sleep position, on her side in a crib, at day care and that a worker a short time later found Mazeigh “unresponsive.” 
Makayla Shows said several details from that day still haunt her. 
“I just remember them wheeling her out to the ICU, and she was already purple,” she recalled. “She didn’t look real. She didn’t smell like my baby.”
First Baptist Children’s Center did not respond to multiple requests for comment in recent weeks from Mississippi Today. 
Across the country, the industry is responsible for 11 million children under the age of 5 – the most critical years for learning and development, research shows. 
Many have long argued that the work of early child care deserves more respect and investment, and that the education that occurs – or doesn’t – in those early years is just as important as K-12 education. 
Like most systemic problems, the solution isn’t simple, especially in a country that values capitalism and limiting the government’s role in families’ private lives. Still, experts say it’s long past time to make child care consistently safe, functional and affordable, and the solution will require more than just the argument that it allows parents to go back to work. 
“Ultimately, if you want to move to a system where all families have the child care that they need and their children need to flourish and live the family life that they want to live, we’re going to need more than just attaching parents to the labor force,” said Elliot Haspel, a nationally recognized child and family policy expert based in Colorado. “We need to see child care as an essential part of our social infrastructure just like parks and roads and libraries and schools and all these other things that let our communities thrive.”
Unaffordable costs and unlivable wages
On a hot day in June, Shows scrolled through photos on her phone of her older daughter Luna Scott sitting on the floor with Mazeigh the morning before Mazeigh died. 
“Those were the last ones,” Shows said. “Sometimes I can go through them, and sometimes I can’t.” 
Luna, now 10, spent most of the morning running in circles around the kitchen table asking her mom if she can make cookie dough and whether they can all go swimming later. But when her mom struggles to find words to talk about Mazeigh, Luna quiets and walks over to put her arms around her mom, who tells Luna, “I’m fine.” 
“Those tears in your eyes says otherwise,” Luna remarked in a comedic drawl, and her mom laughed. 
They have each other, and Makayla and Carson Shows welcomed another daughter, Juniper, in 2024. But Makayla Shows struggles with the guilt of staying home with her children, something that is only possible because of the settlement they reached in the wake of Mazeigh’s death.

“We don’t have money problems, we don’t have many bills, we have a beautiful child, we have all these blessings – and I feel guilty,” she said. “Because it wasn’t because we worked for it. It was because something terrible happened.”
On average, it takes 10% of a married couple’s median income to afford the nation’s average cost of child care, according to Child Care Aware, a national advocacy group. That number rises to 35% for a single parent. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services concluded child care is unaffordable if it exceeds 7% of a family’s income. 
The U.S. has the highest child care costs in the world, according to the World Economic Forum – something that hasn’t translated into higher quality standards. 
Out of 41 high-income countries, the U.S. ranked second to last on child care policies, according to a United Nations Children’s Fund report. The report evaluated the accessibility of child care for young children whether countries had nationwide paid parental leave policies. It also assessed quality measures such as child-to-teacher ratios, minimum qualifications for teachers and affordability. 
Makayla and Carson Shows aren’t sure what they could have done differently. Back in the summer of 2022, they splurged on a small house in Brandon near Luna’s school and Mazeigh’s day care. Makayla took two weeks of unpaid parental leave after giving birth to Mazeigh before returning to work. It was as much time as the family could go without pay.
They made sure to include in their daughter’s day care notes that Mazeigh was only to be laid to sleep on her back – a long held public health recommendation that was especially important because she had torticollis, a condition that causes a baby’s neck muscles to tilt and can make a baby more susceptible to suffocating.  
At the time they thought the instruction was overly cautious, since the day care’s internal guidelines mandated employees only put infants to sleep on their backs, and national guidelines recommend the same.

Between 2017 and 2023, Mississippi child care facilities were cited at least 20 times for unsafe sleep practices, according to Mississippi State Department of Health records. It’s not a large number, but the fact that it happens at all is significant, said Grace Reef, president of the Early Learning Policy Group in Washington. 
“When there is a tragedy involving an infant in safe sleep, it points to training,” Reef said. “Does the provider understand safe sleep – not just the requirement but the reason for it?”
The center in Brandon did not respond to Mississippi Today’s specific questions about why Mazeigh was placed on her side that morning. 
The facility was fined $500 for failing to prevent Mazeigh’s death, an additional $200 for leaving children unattended that day and $50 for unsafe sleep practices. The facility agreed to stop caring for infants under the age of 1, according to a 2023 statement by the Mississippi State Department of Health.
“Infant care was suspended, pending our investigation,” the statement said. “The facility subsequently entered into a consent agreement voluntarily surrendering infant care of the program until further notice.”
Mississippi Today reviewed investigations into First Baptist Children’s Center by the Mississippi State Department of Health in the year leading up to Mazeigh’s death. The records showed no other deficiencies related to unsafe sleep practices and no other deaths. They also showed no other serious injuries that resulted in penalties.
Sometimes, low staffing and lack of oversight at U.S. day care centers result in tragedy. But more often, they result in less egregious but potentially lasting harm, such as bad teaching practices. 
A common example is the way many facilities encourage silence, even though research recommends engaging young children with back-and-forth exchanges, said Cathy Grace, who founded the Early Childhood Institute at Mississippi State University.
“I can’t tell you the number of child care facilities I’ve been in where it was ‘shh-shh-shh,’ thinking that what the school wants them to do is not talk, which may be, but that’s not good practice,” Grace said. 
According to Grace, problems arent’ unique to Mississippi, though the state has the lowest median hourly wage for child care workers at $9.44 and the second-largest percentage of early childhood educators living in poverty. 
“If  you talk to people across the country, the answer’s the same,” Grace said. “We have very low salaries. That doesn’t promote longevity within the staff in many of the centers. Right now, we have fast food places and service places that actually pay almost twice as much.”
Public investment and other solutions
Many countries have struggled with child care, but the acuteness of the problem in the U.S. is unparalleled, said Haspel, the Colorado-based expert in family policy. 
“Where the U.S. really stands alone is that we haven’t done much to fix the problem,” Haspel said.
Much of it comes down to longstanding economic practices. 
“The way that free market economics works is: One person is making six cars every day, and eventually that person is involved in making 60 cars and then 600 cars a day,” Haspel said. 
“Their productivity goes up and so their wages go up and the profit goes up and that’s the whole system of how capitalism works,” he said. “It doesn’t work in care. The market can’t reward care because care will never meet the capitalist definitions of productivity in the same way.”
That means that parents are sometimes forced to put their children in subpar child care centers so they can return to work themselves. 
“With Luna, my whole life was completely different,” Shows said of her first daughter. “I was young, had no job, lived with my mom. But as an adult, when I was doing the right things, being a responsible adult, my child died. How do you reconcile that?”

Child care can’t become more safe and functional without public investment. That may seem counter to U.S. values, but examples of successful public investment in child care are starting to sprout up in red and blue states. 
In New Mexico, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham established an Early Childhood Trust Fund in 2020, investing $300 million largely from oil and gas revenue. By the end of 2024, the fund had risen to over $9 billion, a portion of which goes toward making child care free for most families. 
Vermont, which has a Republican governor and Democratic-controlled legislature, passed a small payroll tax in 2023 – three-quarters of which is paid by employers – that will generate about $120 million to increase salaries for child care workers and make the system more affordable for families. 
Republican-led Texas passed several child care bills this year, including one that turned $100 million in previously unallocated federal funds into child care scholarships to benefit nearly 95,000 children. 
This year, the Mississippi Legislature appropriated $15 million for child care vouchers for low-income families, which will help reduce the number of children on the waitlist after pandemic-era funds ran out. However, it won’t do anything to add resources or staff to facilities. 
Data around incidents like Mazeigh’s death are critical to forming state policies. That information is scarce, according to the only comprehensive national study about deaths in child care that was conducted in 2005 by researchers at the City University of New York Graduate Center. 
“Key to any effort aimed at reducing risks is gathering consistent, reliable data on fatalities, serious injuries, and near misses in child care,” the researchers wrote.
“Unlike fatalities or serious injuries in public schools, harms to children in child care have been largely invisible, with only a few gaining widespread media attention. This has hampered efforts to understand patterns and devise prevention strategies.”

While public discourse on the issue remains quiet, for parents like Makayla and Carson Shows, every day is a reminder of a future that won’t come to be. 
“Me and grief won’t be sharing cookies and a cup of tea,” Makayla wrote in her journal. “I will have to fight it off with blood, sweat and tears. People talk of acceptance, this is not one of those times. Losing your baby, your infant child, feels like the loss of the future. You don’t know who you are or what you are or what your goals were before. You only know after.”

Kristen McDonald Rivet left her seat in the state Senate to serve in Congress, residents of the Bay City Democrat’s former district have grown increasingly discontent with their lack of representation in Lansing.
Amid that frustration, members of the three youth arms of the Michigan Democratic Party have joined the chorus calling for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to set a special election to fill the vacant 35th Senate District, which encompasses parts of Bay, Midland and Saginaw counties. 
“Legislation impacting Michigan’s students and families is being decided right now without input from an entire State Senate district,” Austin Marsman, chair of the Young Democrats of Michigan, said in a statement. “It’s long past time for Governor Whitmer to call a special election and ensure every Michigander has a voice in our state government.”

Since January, more than 270,000 Michiganders have been left without representation in the Democratic-led Michigan Senate. However, calling a special election in the swing district could jeopardize Democrats’ slim majority in the chamber. 
If a Republican senator is elected, the chamber would be left with a 19-19 split. While Lt. Garlin Gilchrist is able to cast the tie-breaking vote, all members of the Senate must be present and voting. On a vote of 19-18, Gilchrist cannot vote, and any legislation up for consideration will fail without the 20 votes needed to pass through the chamber. 
With Republicans holding the majority in the House, a split Senate would further complicate the Democratic governor’s ability to advance policies on her agenda.
While the seat will be up for election in 2026, alongside all other seats in the Michigan House and Senate, the Young Democrats of Michigan, Michigan College Democrats, and Michigan High School Democrats called on Whitmer to fill the seat before the November general election. 
“The first lesson of a high school civics class covers an American’s right to representation in our government,” Abby Huffman, chair of the Michigan High School Democrats said in a statement. “Without guaranteeing that right to the residents of the 35th State Senate District, we’re not only failing those residents, we’re failing every student that is taught the promise of representative democracy.”
Whitmer’s office did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.

Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
[RELATED: Trump administration halts CT offshore wind project]
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”

Permitting
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.
State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
Interconnection
Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana Secretary of State Nancy Landry’s office hosted a public demonstration Tuesday of a Texas company’s voting systems technology as part of the state’s long-troubled efforts to replace its decades-old machines that have fallen into disrepair.
Parish clerks, registrars of voters and members of the public gathered at the Old Governor’s Mansion to inspect and try out a version of the technology Louisiana voters could start using as soon as next year’s congressional midterm elections. Landry’s office used the mansion’s spacious ballroom to host the first of six public demonstrations from companies hoping to qualify to compete for Louisiana voting machine business. 
The demonstrations are required as part of the state’s process to certify prospective voting systems. 
Vendors must have their voting machines certified by the secretary of state before they can compete for a long-overdue state contract to replace Louisiana’s 35-year-old machines, many of which have broken down and cannot be repaired because replacement parts are no longer made.
Companies that will hold their public demonstrations over the next few weeks are: Clear Ballot on Sept. 9; Election Systems & Software, Sept. 11; Democracy Live, Sept. 15, Dominion Voting Systems, Sept. 16; and VotingWorks, Sept. 18. All demonstrations will take place from 9 a.m. to noon at the Old Governor’s Mansion. 
Hart InterCivic’s new Verity Vanguard 2.0 system received federal certification last month. Its system uses a total of three small suitcase-sized machines and a collapsible plastic lockbox to store paper ballots. 
The first machine is used by election officials to check in a voter and print a small paper ticket, roughly the size of a credit card, known as a “voter pass.” It bears a QR code indicating the voter has checked in at the polling location. The voter takes the pass and a blank paper ballot and inserts both into a second machine, an electronic ballot-marking device with a digital touch screen. The voter uses the screen to mark the ballot, and the machine ejects the marked paper ballot. The voter pass is also ejected, with a large black rectangle printed over the QR code to prevent it from being reused. 
Finally, the voter takes the paper ballot to a third machine, a high-speed optical scanner that reads the words and markings on the ballot. Its digital screen allows the voter to confirm the scanned information is accurate. The voter can then press a button to cast the ballot, both in digital and paper form. 
The scanning machine records and tabulates the ballot, storing digital copies on a removable hard drive and a second internal memory drive while dropping the paper ballot into a locked bin attached to the bottom of the machine. The scanners can also read hand-marked paper ballots.  
Hart InterCivic’s machines do not connect to the internet and have redundant tamper-prevention features that include security seals, locking doors, audible alarms and triggers that disable the machines if any of its ports are accessed.
The multi-paper, multi-screen, multi-station system is more complex than Louisiana’s current voting machines, which feature just one piece of equipment. 
Ascension Parish Clerk of Court Bridget Hanna, who attended Tuesday’s demonstration, said she’s concerned that a three-machine system might be a challenge for older election commissioners to handle. 
They might not have the energy to lug around and set up the machines for each voting line, she said in an interview. Her office has been actively trying to recruit younger commissioners, but the current pay rate of $200 per 13- to 14-hour election day is not enough for many, especially when factoring in the 16 hours of unpaid training required to work at polls, Hanna said. 
A multi-station system could also use up a lot of precious space at certain voting locations, she added. 
“For a clerk on Election Day, you’re always thinking about space,” Hanna said. “Two or three pieces of equipment is something we’d have to work out.”
Louisiana struggles to buy new voting machines after placating election deniers

Whichever new voting system Louisiana adopts, it is likely to be more complicated thanks to new state voting laws that require hybrid digital-paper ballot systems. 
In 2018, Secretary of State Nancy Landry’s predecessor, Kyle Ardoin, was finalizing a contract with Dominion Voting Systems, one of the nation’s largest vendors, when competing vendors tanked the deal with accusations of an unfair bidding process. When Ardoin tried to reopen bidding in 2021, the process was halted again when supporters of President Donald Trump mounted a pressure campaign against election officials across the nation. 
The small but vocal group bogged down several committee hearings at the State Capitol that year with far-fetched conspiracy theories and false claims of election fraud against Dominion and SmartMatic, another voting machine company. The group offered no actual evidence to support their allegations but called for a return to the hand-marked, hand-counted paper ballot systems of the previous century. Some Republican state lawmakers embraced the disinformation and adopted changes to the state’s process for buying voting machines.
Landry’s spokesman, Joel Watson, said the secretary of state hopes to have a contract in place by the end of the year for at least a pilot system that can be tested in a few parishes during the 2026 congressional midterms.
However, Louisiana’s current efforts to replace its voting machines could encounter the same political pressure that foiled its earlier attempts.
Last week, Trump announced he plans to sign an executive order to eliminate voting machines and mail-in voting. Adopting false claims his supporters made five years ago, the president said the country should instead use “Watermark Paper” for the 2026 congressional midterms. 
Election law experts have said such changes in the federal voting process would have to originate from Congress.  
Trump’s announcement came at around the same time as news that Dominion agreed to a $67 million settlement with the conservative television network Newsmax, stemming from a defamation lawsuit that accused the outlet of knowingly airing false fraud claims about the company in the 2020 election. 
In 2023, Dominion received a $787 million defamation settlement from Fox News, which also spread some of the same conspiracy theories.

Brandei Schaefbauer, R-Aberdeen, speaks on the South Dakota House floor on Jan. 17, 2024. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)In recent years it felt like the rest of the world was going crazy. There were conspiracy theories about the weirdest things: Barack Obama’s birth certificate, the existence of a deep state that secretly controls the federal government, Donald Trump’s supposed fight against a Satanic group of child molesters. 
Surely, these theories sprang from the cities where the friction of daily life in such confined quarters led people to believe the oddest things. Out here on the prairie, where there’s plenty of room to roam, we seemed immune to those ideas. We seemed safe from conspiracy theories.
Those days are over, if they ever existed. 
For me, the first hint that South Dakotans could be just as addled as the rest of the nation came in 2022. In one of the first commentaries ever published by South Dakota Searchlight, the writer described how he tried and tried to get secretary of state candidate Monae Johnson to admit that she believed the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. He likened her artful dodging of his questions to trying to nail Jell-O to a tree. 
The trouble with Monae Johnson and Jell-O

As a story, an election denier running for an office that oversees elections had a certain man bites dog quality to it. As an indication of what was to come, having a Republican candidate for statewide office embrace a conspiracy theory was just the tip of the iceberg. 
In 2023 the Legislature considered House Concurrent Resolution 6006 that called for the fair treatment of the Jan. 6, 2021, defendants who besieged the United States Capitol. Sponsored by Rep. Phil Jensen, a Rapid City Republican, the resolution was based on the conspiracy theory that those prisoners endured inhumane conditions; were subjected to cruel and unusual punishment; and were deprived of adequate food, medical care and access to religious services and attorneys. 
Concurrent resolutions don’t have the weight of law, but are a reflection of the mood of the Legislature. The House State Affairs Committee wasn’t in the mood, defeating the resolution 12-0. That doesn’t change the fact that an elected representative sought to give a conspiracy theory legislative legitimacy. Since President Trump pardoned the insurrectionists, don’t be surprised if a new resolution comes along, asking for reparations for the Jan. 6 “patriots.”
Meanwhile, the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was somehow stolen from President Trump caused a flurry of activity in South Dakota as “election integrity” backers made life miserable for county commissions across the state and pressured lawmakers to do more to make sure that the state’s already squeaky clean elections were beyond reproach. In effect, a conspiracy theory has led to an unneeded movement that still has momentum.
The level to which conspiracy theories have been accepted among elected leaders in this state can be found in an episode of the Ken Matthews podcast, which was called out for criticism on the South Dakota War College website. In that episode, Matthews interviewed Aberdeen Rep. Brandei Schaefbauer, a Republican majority whip in the House. In the last legislative session, Schaefbauer sponsored House Concurrent Resolution 6009, which sought to have the attorney general file a lawsuit against China to seek damages related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

China, however, isn’t the only pandemic culprit, as Schaefbauer told Matthews. Referencing the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, Schaefbauer said, “He should be on death row for killing millions and millions of people.”
She also had something to say about the way the Trump administration is handling the Jeffrey Epstein files, which have been the topic of conspiracy theories about underage girls provided to high-ranking officials. Schaefbauer said “if something doesn’t happen” to satisfy people calling for the Epstein files, “there is going to be, I believe, a revolt of the American people. Because they have, I mean, we have all been promised that something is going to happen, and we get this little, you know, give us this little nugget, and then it’s a pacifier for us. Well, no, I think the way things are going — people are so upset and they have nothing else to lose — so why not let’s just start, you know, a civil war again.”
There you have it, a call to civil war by a leader in South Dakota’s Republican Party. That almost makes Johnson’s refusal to answer questions about who won the 2020 election seem quaint and harmless.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/591A1516e-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-27 10:56:23.757973

(Screenshot/Legislative Budget Committee)TOPEKA — Agriculture is a potential winner of new federal dollars when Kansas officials considered the state’s gains and losses from the “one big, beautiful bill“ act, the legislative budget committee learned Tuesday. 
Multiple funding opportunities through expanded agriculture grants were included in the law, covering everything from the agriculture conservation easement program to the conservation stewardship program, said Dylan Dear, assistant director for fiscal affairs at the Kansas Legislative Research Department. 
In a presentation backed by a 25-page report on Kansas federal funding, Dear broke down changes outlined in the Trump spending and tax cut law. 
The information showed effects on various programs, such as food and nutrition and health care, as well as possible effects of funds that were pulled back, called rescissions, from a variety of agencies and how specific Department of Government Efficiency actions hit the budget.  
Committee members questioned total dollar amounts flowing in and out of the Kansas budget as a result of OBBBA, but Dear said there weren’t definitive answers. 
“Those DOGE items, in particular, are very difficult to track because they’re not enacted into law in most cases,” Dear said. “So we just tried to identify those ones that we have been able to confirm.”
The memo will be updated constantly, Dear said, calling it a “work in progress” for months. Arriving at an exact dollar amount will be difficult, he said.  
“A lot of these are grant opportunities,” Dear said. “We’re looking at either additional federal funding streams being made available, but we’re not going to know how much Kansas is going to receive, or we’re looking at rescinding of unobligated balances. But we are still working with the agencies to determine what specifically has and has not been obligated.”
 
Budget demands identified
A few known dollar amounts could stretch the state’s budget. 
Kansas’ Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was part of Tuesday discussions because the OBBBA requires the state to cost-share based on its error rate.
That rate is near 10%, which would mean the state would pay 10% of benefit costs. 
If the error rate stays at that level in FFY 2026, Dear said the state share would be $40.8 million. The cost share doesn’t go into effect until FFY 2029 but is based on the error rate in either FFY 2025 or 2026. 
The OBBBA also increases the state’s share of SNAP administrative costs from 50% to 75%, beginning in fiscal year 2027. The budget would see a nearly $20 million in additional costs annually, Dear said. 
Some parts of the federal legislation, such as changed tracking of SNAP recipients subject to work requirements, involve creating new administrative procedures and don’t have a dollar amount attached, Dear said. 
 
Health care programs
Multiple health care programs that receive federal funding, such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, will require administrative costs from the state, Dear said. For instance, to prevent duplicate enrollment, states must create a system by Oct. 1, 2029, to prevent individuals from being enrolled in multiple states, Dear’s testimony said. 
About 10 OBBBA changes did not apply to Kansas because the state never expanded Medicaid, Dear said. 
“I was kind of wondering in 2028 what the impact would have been for the state of Kansas if we would have passed Medicaid expansion,” said committee chairman Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker HIll.
Dear said the legislative research department had not collected that information but would answer Waymaster’s request. Kansas City Sen. Pat Pettey, a Democrat, asked that the report include what the state would have saved by expanding Medicaid.
One health section may save the state money, as it decreases retroactive coverage of medical bills for Medicaid enrollees from 90 days to 60 days, beginning Jan. 1, 2027, Dear said. 
Kansas nursing home advocate Rachel Monger said in July such a change will affect retirement homes and possibly patients because they will have to pay hospital charges from day 61 through 90. 
 
Grant opportunities
The OBBBA offers numerous grant opportunities, Dear said, which leaves the amount Kansas could receive unknown. 
In the agriculture arena, the OBBBA expands the agriculture conservation easement program, increasing funding from its current $450 million to $625 million in federal fiscal year 2026, $650 million in fiscal year 2027 and $700 million annually for federal fiscal years 2029 through 2031, Dear said. 
The provision may expand federal grant opportunities for Kansas land trusts and local governments to apply for grants, he said. 
Increased annual spending in the conservation stewardship program may offer the same opportunity for Kansas producers, he said. 
 
Funding rescissions, eliminations
Several programs saw unobligated funds pulled back to the federal government, while other agencies saw funds disappear, according to Dear’s list. 
Dear told committee members he was working with agencies to determine what funds hadn’t been obligated because it’s unclear how much money was returned or needs to be returned. 
Those included elimination of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants operated through the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The loss of $37.9 million in grants resulted in the elimination of 56 positions at KDHE, Dear’s report said. 
Other eliminated or reduced funding included:

$15 million (estimated) for immunization and vaccines for children
$6.1 million (estimated) for a health disparities initiative
$7.9 million (estimated) for epidemiology and lab capacity for prevention and control for emerging infectious diseases
$6.5 million (estimated) for mental health block grants

The report also noted a $8.23 million cut to the Digital Equity Act Grant, which resulted in the loss of resources for planned digital inclusion initiatives, and termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which could affect 14 Kansas projects, depending on where they were in development, Dear said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Dylan-Dear-1024x661.png,,,2025-08-27 10:56:23.757973

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Ten members of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Natural Resources are making an unusual visit to Alaska this week during a break from business on Capitol Hill.
The 45-person committee deals with a variety of issues pertaining to public lands in the United States, and the visit is giving eight Republicans and two Democrats a chance to put their literal hands on the topics they cover.
On Monday, the lawmakers visited Hecla Greens Creek Mine, which produces silver, gold, zinc and lead from a site west of Juneau. They overflew parts of the Tongass National Forest, the nation’s largest, and observed Suicide Basin in the Mendenhall Glacier, the origin point for glacial floods that have inundated parts of Alaska’s capital city in recent summers.
Outside the hangars of Ward Air in Juneau, several House representatives talked with reporters.
“Obviously, Alaska is a big natural resources state, so we’re here seeing things on the ground, so that when we’re talking about (them) in Washington, DC, it’s not just an academic exercise for us,” said Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah and a member of the committee.
Among the group was the committee’s chairman, Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, as well as the home-state Republican Rep. Nick Begich.

Begich called the visit “historic for Alaska,” citing the number of visiting Representatives. 
Also attending were Reps. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming; Tom Tiffany, R-Wisconsin; Pete Stauber, R-Minnesota; Rob Wittman, R-Virginia; Val Hoyle, D-Oregon; Paul Gosar, R-Arizona; and Sarah Elfreth, D-Maryland.
“It is imperative that we visit these places, so that we have a better understanding when they come before us and ask for relief, whether it is in permitting reform or in ways to better manage the resources that we have,” Hageman said. 
The legislators are expected to spend several days in southcentral Alaska, where they will address the annual meeting of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association in Anchorage on Wednesday.
Members are planning to meet with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and expecting to hold a news conference with reporters in Anchorage as well.

For many of the national lawmakers, fresh from a mine tour, minerals were on their minds. President Donald Trump and his administration have been talking at length about the need to increase American production of so-called “critical minerals” used in electronics and high-tech equipment. 
Stauber, of Minnesota, said he saw Alaska’s potential to contribute to that effort.
“Alaska can drive that. They can lead the nation into both oil and gas and mineral exploration, if we’d allow them to do that. What we saw at that mine was spectacular,” he said, referring to the Greens Creek mine. 
Westerman said he believes additional mining and refining are needed in the United States and Alaska.
“With the big demand on critical minerals and rare earth (minerals) that we have in the country right now, the dependence we have on China for that, I think it’s imperative that Congress work with everyone who’s in the business to help figure out how to get more mining done here in the US — and not just mining, but also the refining of the metals, which is a huge issue,” he said. 
Neither of the two Democrats on the trip spoke publicly during their stop in Juneau.
Several of the Republican lawmakers said they believe there is room to increase logging in the Tongass in order to meet the demand for lumber to build housing, particularly locally.
“You ought to at least be able to cut enough timber to sustain your needs here at home, and that will make the forest healthier,” Westerman said.
Speaking nationally, Gosar of Arizona said he believes that selectively thinning national forests could reduce wildfire danger as well.
“You can’t let a lightning fire start where the undergrowth hasn’t been taken care of,” he said. “That’s how we lost the 19 firefighters in Yarnell. … I think there needs to be common sense in that aspect.

Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows turnover among election workers reached a new high in 2024. (Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
Wanted: Poll workers. Must love democracy.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

Court allows suit over home equity investments to move forward,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/courts/flexible-financing-or-illegal-reverse-mortgage-court-allows-suit-over-home-equity-investments-to-move-forward/,"
Though states including Massachusetts are considering possible rules for this novel product, which exchanges a lump sum for a share in home equity, HEI companies operate largely without regulation. 
The post Flexible financing or illegal reverse mortgage? Court allows suit over home equity investments to move forward appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A LAWSUIT LEVELED by the state attorney general against a Boston-based financial technology company for allegedly predatory loan practices is allowed to move forward, after a Suffolk County Superior Court judge denied the company’s motion to dismiss the complaint.  
Hometap, founded in 2017, is part of a growing wave of home equity investment (HEI) products, which work by giving homeowners cash in exchange for a share of their home’s value. When the owner sells the house, refinances, or hits the end of the investment term, they owe the company the original investment plus a portion of the appreciation in home value.  
In Hometap’s view, their product exists “to make homeownership more accessible and less stressful” and is offered by a company comprised of “good owners and good neighbors.” 
To Attorney General Andrew Campbell, the company targets financially vulnerable homeowners with illegal reverse mortgages, marketed deceptively in violation of the state’s consumer protection laws.  
“In reality, this product is vastly more expensive than any common mortgage product on the market — and when consumers cannot pay, Hometap will sell their homes,” the attorney general’s office claimed in its first-in-the-nation suit against Hometap filed in February. 
Hometap moved to dismiss the complaint in May. HEIs cannot be illegal mortgage loans, Hometap argued, because they are not loans at all – rather they are option contracts that are not bound by the same regulations. Option contracts give investors, like Hometap, the option but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset.  
But Suffolk Superior Court Justice Debra Squires-Lee in an August 21 decision determined that the products could be considered loans and these arguments should be tested in the courts. Also needing further exploration, the judge wrote, are questions of whether the company was being deceptive, if its products are unfair or oppressive to homeowners, and if there are possible penalties under the state’s consumer protection statute. 
In reverse mortgages, the owner’s debt increases over time, and the lender is paid back when a property is sold voluntarily or through foreclosure. They are usually aimed at people who have home equity but not enough assets to cover expenses, so Massachusetts limits these mortgages to people over 60 who receive counseling and are permitted a seven-day period to back out. 
The HEI structure, according to the attorney general’s complaint, includes four separate features: an upfront cash payment to the homeowner regardless of the owner’s assets or income, a percentage interest in the home equity twice the value of that cash payment, a return to Hometap that can exceed a 20 percent annual interest rate, and a 10-year balloon payment.  
Hometap can also take possession of the property and force a foreclosure sale if the owner defaults, according to court documents. These provisions, all together, form the shape of a reverse mortgage structure, according to the attorney general. 
Because Hometap does not assess a homeowner’s financial status, the owner can “get money quickly, and without documentation, and may lead them to choose an HEI over loans that cost less and have safeguards,” Squires-Lee wrote. “Hometap can only provide cash quickly if the HEI product is not governed by the regulations put in place with respect to reverse and subprime mortgages. Thus, in marketing the HEl, Hometap neither ensures that it provides money only to homeowners with the ability to repay, as with traditional mortgages, nor complies with the strict regulatory limits on reverse mortgages.” 
Campbell’s office claims the company does not adequately disclose the mechanics of the agreement, with sales representatives suggesting the company would share in the loss if property values depreciate. Instead, the attorney general argues, Hometap’s investment is insulated, and homeowners will pay back more than they receive from the company. 
Hometap attorneys argue that their home equity products are just option contracts, rather than loans. The attorney general’s interpretation of terms of the contract as creating a reverse mortgage, Hometap wrote, is “nonsensical.” 
There is no required repayment in the HEI contract, Hometap notes. This contract gives Hometap a right to purchase a percentage stake in the property under certain conditions, the company’s attorneys wrote in the motion to dismiss. If the company exercises that option, according to the motion, it becomes partial owner of the property and is then entitled to proportionate proceeds from the home’s sale.  
The attorney general’s claims depend on the Hometap agreements counting as loans, because Campbell’s office is arguing that they violate regulations to make sure that loans are fair and marketed honestly. But because Hometap argues that the product is merely an option, its attorneys say holding them to standards meant for loans would be inappropriate.  
“Hometap firmly stands by the integrity of our products, which provide Massachusetts homeowners with alternative and flexible financial products and further our mission of making homeownership more accessible,” a spokesperson for the company said in an emailed statement. “We look forward to the discovery process, which we are confident will introduce facts that further reinforce the strength of our position.” 
Campbell’s office cheered the opportunity to press forward with the case. 
“My team and I are pleased by the court’s decision and look forward to continuing this critical litigation to protect Massachusetts homeowners from Hometap’s harmful practices,” Campbell said in an emailed statement.  
Though some states like Massachusetts – and HEI companies themselves – are exploring what regulations might look like for these products, HEIs are essentially unregulated, Squires-Lee noted in her decision, regardless of any pending legislation. Without a HEI-specific regulatory framework, she wrote, the state can use what it has as a metric. “It is not inappropriate to measure the HEI against statutes and regulations protecting homeowner mortgagees or other consumer borrowers,” she wrote. 
Washington state has commissioned a formal study on the products, while Connecticut, Illinois, and Maryland have recently passed laws that regulate HEIs like typical mortgages.  
In Massaachsetts, state Rep. Daniel Cahill of Lynn and state Sen. John Cronin of Fitchburg have filed bills this session requiring a licensing system for shared equity investors of residential property. 
The bills define a “shared equity investment” as a transaction in which a sum of money is granted to a homeowner in exchange for an equity stake in the homeowner’s residential property or a future obligation to pay back the sum plus interest. Broadly, private companies could not act as a shared equity investor in more than 12 residential properties in one year without a license from the Massachusetts commissioner of banks.  
The commissioner would be tasked with assessing each license applicant, to make sure that the business operate “honestly, fairly, soundly and efficiently in the public interest.”  
Both the House and Senate bills were referred to the financial services committee in February, with no hearings scheduled or held. And both seek to settle one core question in the burgeoning industry: that HEIs are “not a mortgage loan or other form of loan.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The wealthy owner of the Dort Financial Center made a large political contribution to a Michigan Republican lawmaker a month after that official requested a $2.5 million earmark to renovate areas of the facility located in Flint.
And while the earmark ultimately was not included in the GOP-led Michigan House budget proposal delivered on Tuesday, the request appeared to skirt newly instituted House ethics rules that ban legislatively appropriated grants to for-profit entities.
Public records reviewed by Michigan Advance show that state Rep. David Martin (R-Davison) in April requested millions of taxpayer dollars for the non-profit Flint Firebirds Foundation to pay for various upgrades at the arena and events center. The request sent to the Michigan House clerk specifically addresses parking upgrades, new accessible ramps and curbs at the sports and concert venue.
The request is available on the Michigan House of Representatives website per new House ethics rules aimed at increasing transparency for the earmark process. A project pitch and a letter of support attached to the request touts that the project would add to the curb appeal of the complex. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
New House ethics rules passed in January make it so all requests are now public and open to scrutiny before they make the final budget in a given fiscal year. The rules also prohibit legislators funneling taxpayer dollars to for-profit companies.
Although the Flint Firebirds Foundation is listed as a non-profit organization within the Ontario Hockey League, the Dort facility and the Flint Firebirds hockey team that plays there are both owned by a for-profit manufacturing company based in Florida. The foundation exists to raise and distribute charitable funds and to operate non-profit youth programming, but the money requested by Martin would see a for-profit entity benefit from taxpayer resources if the grant is approved.
Martin was a champion of the new reforms and voted for House Resolution 14 when the chamber approved them earlier this year. The vote came right as Republicans took over the chamber and espoused a new focus on transparency and accountability.
The earmark request raises  questions about loopholes in those new rules because the money would have ultimately flowed from state coffers to a non-profit organization making upgrades that would support two for-profit subsidiaries of a larger corporation.
Multiple attempts to seek comment from or interview Martin for this story were not successful. Messages left with Martin via telephone, though his campaign committee and his office via email were not returned.

Messages seeking comment and clarification of the new rules from the House communications office were not returned, either.
Deepening the controversy are campaign finance reports that show Martin received a hefty political contribution to his House reelection campaign by the center and team’s owner, Rolf Nilsen.
In all, the Dort Financial Center and the Firebirds are all owned and controlled by Nilsen through a web of subsidiary for-profit corporations owned by Nilsen’s IMS Group, according to business and tax records reviewed by the Advance.
Genesee County tax assessment records indicate that the arena is owned by IMS Ice Arena Corp., based in Cape Coral, Florida.
Records from the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs also indicate that the Flint Firebirds hockey team is registered under the IMS Hockey Corp. trade name – another for-profit corporation.
IMS Hockey Corp. and IMS Ice Arena Corp. are subsidiaries of IMS USA, a registered Florida corporation. IMS USA is a subsidiary of IMS Group, owned by Nilsen.
In May, a month after Martin made the request, Nilsen gave $1,000 to the active Committee to Elect David Martin for State Representative.
In his application for the earmark sent to the House clerk, Martin was asked if he had a direct or indirect pecuniary interest – or involving money or the opportunity to gain or lose money – in the earmark.
Martin wrote in his April application that he did not have a direct or indirect interest in the project.
Rep. David Martin-2025-04-23T19_39_39.0395300Z
The request and the donation also raise eyebrows because the Dort Financial Center isn’t even in Martin’s district, which he noted in his application. 
Martin represents the 68th House District. The arena is situated in the 70th House District, represented by Democratic state Rep. Cynthia Neeley. 
Neeley’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
A letter of support for the project was attached to Martin’s request from the tourism arm of the Flint & Genesee Group. The letter, signed by Explore Flint & Genesee Executive Director Amari Steward, touted Dort hockey stadium and events center as a cornerstone of the community.
Steward also wrote that fans of the Firebirds hockey team flock to the stadium from around the state, filling hotels and restaurants, all while enhancing Flint’s reputation as a sports destination.

The Advance asked Steward if he was aware of the new House ethics rules against taxpayer dollars going to for-profit entities, and pork projects without a clear public benefit, before he drafted the letter in support of the project.
Steward was also asked if he knew that Nilsen donated to Martin a month after he requested the earmark.
The executive director, in a statement provided to the Advance, answered neither question.
“Explore Flint & Genesee supported Dort Financial Center’s request on behalf of the Firebirds Foundation, as it aligned with our primary objectives to increase leisure travel to Flint & Genesee, boost meeting and group travel, and work towards becoming a more inclusive and accessible community,” Steward said. “With this appropriations request, the Flint Firebirds Foundation, in conjunction with Dort Financial Center, seeks to continue providing a welcoming, accessible, and functional space for children and families.”
Steward went on to say that the improvements to the Dort Financial Center help his team better promote the region and attract visitors, which he believed ultimately benefits the public through increased economic impact and better accessibility, because the project was aimed at broadening the center’s accessibility.
However noble, those upgrades would have ultimately served to upgrade a for-profit facility.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2172679916a-1024x508.jpg,,,2025-08-27 09:56:20.893713

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A Democratic National Committee panel did not advance any resolution on Israel’s war in Gaza during its meeting in Minneapolis on Tuesday, reflecting the party’s deep divisions over how forcefully to confront one of the U.S.’s closest allies.
The panel rejected a resolution, brought by a 26-year-old new DNC member, calling for an arms embargo on Israel and a recognition of Palestinian statehood.
The panel unanimously passed a resolution brought by DNC Chair Ken Martin reaffirming the party’s current position that calls for for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages held by Hamas since Oct. 7, 2023, and the unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.
Martin withdrew his resolution, however, and promised to form a task force “to continue to have the conversation, to work through this and bring solutions back to our party.”
The move buys Martin and the party more time to deal with one of the most contentious and emotional issues roiling the party. Advancing a status quo resolution risked further alienating young progressive members of the party incensed at the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza, yet calling for an arms embargo would surely upset older Democrats who’ve long supported Israel.
“This is a moment that calls for shared dialog. It calls for shared advocacy, and that’s why I’ve decided today, at this moment, listening to the testimony and listening to people in our party, to withdraw my … resolution,” Martin said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)
Resolutions passed by the DNC resolutions committee are meant to elevate principles consistent with the party’s platform and are largely symbolic.
Florida DNC member Allison Minnerly told reporters after the meeting she was disappointed Democrats didn’t pass her resolution.
“Overwhelmingly, Democrats want the end of U.S. involvement in this war, particularly they want their elected officials to not be complacent in this crisis. So while it’s important that the conversation started today, the chair has placed a comma on that conversation,” Minnerly said.
Last month, 27 Democratic U.S. Senators — including Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith — voted for a resolution to block the sale of American bombs and firearms to Israel. The resolution didn’t pass, but a growing number of Democrats voted in favor of it as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grows more dire amid widespread hunger and suffering. 
Martin, who was the longest serving chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer Labor Party, has struggled to keep the various Democratic factions together in his six months at the helm of the DNC. He pushed out 25-year-old DNC Vice Chair David Hogg, who aimed to bring a new generation of Democrats into office even if it meant contentious primary challenges. Martin is also confronting slowing donations and a dissatisfied voter base eager for a stronger resistance to President Donald Trump.

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
As California cities increasingly crack down on homeless encampments, most still lack enough shelter beds. So, in order to give people a place to go that isn’t a city street, some places are creating sanctioned camps, where people sleep on a designated lot in tents purchased by the city.
But a federal lawsuit filed in San Diego this week claims the city’s two camps (which have nearly 800 tents) force people to live in uninhabitable and inhumane conditions. 
Residents have complained of extreme heat in the summer and cold and flooding in the winter, overcrowding, inadequate meals and rat infestations that lead to rats crawling over them at night, according to the complaint.

Ann Menasche, the lawyer who filed the suit: “This is an unsafe, unsanitary environment that is actually hurting people’s health and lives. It needs to stop.”

Menasche brought the lawsuit on behalf of eight unhoused plaintiffs with disabilities who say the poor conditions at the camps have exacerbated their health conditions. One 49-year-old man said he can’t plug in his CPAP machine at night, and complained the food isn’t suitable for managing his diabetes. A 59-year-old woman who uses a walker said she couldn’t bathe for two months because the one handicap shower at the site was out of order.

Matt Hoffman, city spokesperson, in an emailed statement: “The City takes any claim of potential violations or unsafe conditions seriously. The safety and wellbeing of individuals served through the Safe Sleeping Program has, and always will be, the top priority.”

He said pest control visits the sites several times a month, and on the last visit, in July, confirmed there is no infestation. 
San Diego’s safe sleeping sites provide meals and give residents access to bathrooms, showers, security and case workers who can help them find permanent housing. They opened immediately before the city imposed new restrictions on camping on public property.
Other California cities are adopting this approach. San Jose, which was inspired by San Diego’s model, is building its first sanctioned camp for up to 56 people.

Assembly considers climate credit change

As Sacramento contemplates extending California’s carbon trading program, a new provision in the Assembly-based bill — one of two now making the rounds — would change the California Climate Credit, a line-item rebate that investor-owned utilities pay to homeowners, renters and small businesses. 
Funded by carbon auctions, the credit shows up twice a year and is pegged between about $50 and $80. Lawmakers now are proposing tweaks to the credit that would prioritize residential customers, pay out cash during high-bill months and base the dollar amount on energy use.
Rather than handing out “relatively moderate” cash payments, said climate law expert Ethan Elkind, “the Legislature could instead use the same dollars to create a far bigger impact on rates and the environment.” Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, wrote that the state could redirect climate cash toward financing energy efficiency instead.



Report: Spike in unemployment after LA fires

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
Unemployment claims surged after the L.A. County wildfires in January, with about 11,000 people in the county and surrounding counties filing new claims in the weeks after the deadly blazes, a new report shows.
New unemployment insurance claims rose from about 5,000 the week before the fires to about 12,000 in the first week after the fires, and stayed higher for several weeks, according to an analysis by the University of California’s California Policy Lab. 
More than 5,200 workers who normally wouldn’t be eligible for regular unemployment benefits — such as gig workers, contractors and self-employed workers — filed claims for disaster unemployment assistance. 
The biggest initial spike in claims came from workers in the accommodation and food services industries. Researchers also noted increases in claims by workers in health care, social assistance and real estate. The surge in claims came mostly from ZIP codes directly affected by the fires, but also from surrounding areas such as Central and South L.A., from where workers likely commuted to the fire-affected areas.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: California’s gubernatorial race remains wide open and the latest speculated candidate — U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla — would almost certainly become the frontrunner if he ran.
California lawmakers could reduce utility bills by restructuring the climate credit program, participating in a regionalized grid and more, writes Victoria Rome, director of California governmental affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

A new study found that many telemedicine patients have a hard time filling their buprenorphine prescriptions at pharmacies. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Nearly a third of telemedicine patients with opioid use disorder had to go without buprenorphine because they had trouble filling their prescription at a pharmacy, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open this month, surveyed 600 telemedicine patients across five states: Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder. The drug reduces a patient’s cravings for opioids and reduces the likelihood of a fatal overdose.
The most common reason that patients had trouble was that buprenorphine was unavailable at the pharmacy, followed by coverage-related issues and the pharmacy’s hesitancy in filling a telemedicine prescription.
Previous research has shown that some pharmacists, fearing scrutiny, hesitate to dispense buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say people with opioid use disorder “who need buprenorphine [should be] able to access it without undue delay,” the authors note.
Roughly half of the patients who participated in the survey were covered by Medicaid. A majority of patients had been in treatment for at least six months, and half lived in rural areas.
The analysis didn’t find statistically significant differences between patients in rural and non-rural areas. But the authors noted that the study only surveyed participants from those five states, and results might be different in other ones.
In general, they noted, patients living in rural areas might have a harder time finding buprenorphine and other opioid use disorder drugs at a pharmacy because there are fewer pharmacies in rural areas.
The study underscores recent data suggesting a lack of access to opioid use disorder medication. An analysis released last year by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2022, only a quarter of people with opioid use disorder received recommended medications. About 4% of U.S. adults have opioid use disorder.
Other research has shown many pharmacies lack buprenorphine. Two studies found that between 42% and 51% of U.S. pharmacies did not have buprenorphine in stock, and availability varied widely across states.
The JAMA Network Open study was led by Workit Health, a telemedicine addiction treatment app that operates in four of the states included in the survey.

Victoria Rome
Victoria Rome is the director of California governmental affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council.


Customers of California’s investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison, get a reprieve from soaring utility bills twice a year thanks to a credit from the state’s cap and trade program, which requires large polluters to pay for their emissions. But lawmakers could do much more with this program.  
This legislative session offers a crucial opportunity to update the climate credit program and use these funds to lower electric rates, delivering meaningful relief where families need it most: on their electricity bills. That change, combined with other rate reforms taking effect next year, could reduce costs for most households by 20%, UC Santa Barbara researchers found.
That’s real savings that can improve lives across California. And it starts with thoughtfully reauthorizing the cap and trade program so funding can reach utility customers.
Addressing the affordability crisis requires action on multiple fronts. In addition to reforming the climate credit, state lawmakers should also advance structural changes by regionalizing California’s electric grid and protecting electric vehicle programs, which lower costs for everyone.
The urgency is clear. PG&E rates have climbed 40% above inflation since 2018. Rates for other investor-owned utilities are increasing at a similarly dire pace. For families struggling to make ends meet, these increases are crushing. 
California’s leaders can take decisive action in the coming weeks.
It begins with restructuring the climate credit program to deliver monthly relief, instead of twice a year, by using polluter fees to directly reduce electricity prices. This creates predictable savings and importantly can help inland families afford air conditioning during the brutal summer heat.
Lower electricity prices also could accelerate California’s clean energy transition by making electric cars more affordable, helping the state meet its climate goals.
Legislators also could shift funds currently applied to gas bills toward electricity relief, where families need help the most. Electricity represents the largest utility expense for most California households. This shift would be more equitable since nearly all households pay electric bills, but many don’t use gas.
State leaders should pair these climate credit reforms with structural electric system changes, including participating in a regionalized grid that enables clean energy sharing across the West. It will help California develop more renewable energy to use or sell to other states, while reducing fossil fuel dependence and improving air quality. 
Finally, state policymakers should prioritize state funding for California’s electric vehicle programs, which deliver direct savings to all electricity customers.
Every electric car and truck on the road helps lower everyone’s bills because EV owners pay more in electricity costs than they actually cost the grid to serve, essentially subsidizing cheaper prices for all Californians. As more families make the switch to electric vehicles, these savings compound, creating a virtuous cycle of falling electricity prices that benefits every household, regardless of what they drive.
California lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom began this session focusing on affordability. By updating the state’s climate credit program, reauthorizing cap and trade and leading a clean energy partnership for the West, not only can they stem the tide of relentless rate increases, they can also deliver meaningful savings to utility customers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/072922_EV-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-CHARGING_MHN_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-27 08:56:29.722741

As the Norco prison prepares for a closing date in 2026, city leaders hope to overcome a number of hurdles to bring back its luxurious past. 


Before it became a prison, the California Correctional Facility in Norco was a luxury hotel, sanitorium and Navy hospital.
When it closes next year, Norco city leaders hope to restore it as an upscale resort again. But that plan faces complications that range from renovating the Art Deco architecture and remediating asbestos, to concerns about layoffs of correctional staff.
The prison is on track to close in 2026, after the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced this month that it’s no longer needed because of the state’s falling prison population.  It will be the fifth to shut down during Newsom’s administration, and its closure could save the state $150 million.
Norco Councilmember Kevin Bash is the city’s unofficial historian, and wrote about the facility’s colorful past in his book “The Norconian Resort.” 
“People don’t even know how magnificent this is,” Bash said. “It literally could be the Mission Inn on a hill, looking over a lake, on hundreds of acres.”
Rex Clark, who founded the city of Norco, built the Norconian after discovering hot water sulfur springs, which are believed to have therapeutic benefits. The resort debuted on Feb. 2, 1929 with a “star-studded grand opening” showcasing amenities including boating, an airfield, horseback riding, mineral baths, tennis, golf and swimming, according to the Lake Norconian Club Foundation.
“He decided to build the greatest resort on the West Coast,” Bash said. “Thousands of people showed up. It was a huge success. Unfortunately 1929 was not the best year to open a resort, because the Great Depression hit.”
The resort closed, but during World War II the property gained a new purpose.  On December 8, 1941, the day after the Pearl Harbor attack, the Norconian reopened as a Naval hospital.
“It then became the Pacific Theater hub for polio, tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, and a paraplegic center,” Bash said.
Doctors from the Mayo Clinic joined Sister Elizabeth Kenny, an Australian nurse who pioneered polio treatments, to treat sick and wounded service members, Bash said. In 1947, a group of injured veterans established the sport of wheelchair basketball as a team called “The Rolling Devils.”
In the 1950s, part of the facility was converted for use as a missile laboratory, Bash said. A decade later it became a drug rehabilitation center, and in the 1980s it began housing inmates as a medium security prison.
After the prison closes there are various options to renovate the property, Bash said: “It could be a resort, hotel. It could be office buildings or townhouses.”
Of course, that would take some work. Some of the World War II barracks were made from an asbestos compound called cemesto, which would require remediation.
Meanwhile, parts of the original facility have fallen into disrepair. Photos show water damaged halls, crumbled tiles and collapsing painted ceilings. The original Norconian Hotel is considered abandoned, Bash said, “which means you allow this magnificent building to deteriorate from the inside out. It’s demolition by neglect.”
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation did not respond to a request from CalMatters for details of its closure plans. Their website states that there are now 1,191 staff and about 2,766 people incarcerated at the institution, and it will shut down in fall, 2026.
Bash said he and other local officials want to get an inventory of the facility and its contents to preserve historic artifacts and fixtures. He’s wary of a worst case scenario if the prison closes without plans for the next steps.
“What happens if the state just walks away and doesn’t protect it?” Bash said. “It could become the largest graffiti haven, crime-infested, squatter-filled location in Riverside County.”
For more than a decade the Norco City Council has called for closing the prison, Bash said. But they’ve moderated that recently out of concern for the effects on its workers. Labor groups representing state employees who work there have denounced the closure, saying it would damage careers and the community, the Sacramento Bee reported. 
“The people that work there are our friends,” he said. “They are part of the community, we get along with them. Our position is tempered with the fact that we know so many of these people.
That is why we’re stepping back.”
If it does shut down as planned, he said, Norco is ready to step in to help restore the property and seek investors to spruce it up. 
“Overwhelmingly people want to reclaim the Norconian and bring it back to its glory days,” he said. “They really want to have a resort.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/080912-CRC-Norco-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-27 08:56:29.722741

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires.
But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects.
They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid.
Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure titled the Big Beautiful law, which ended those credits years ahead of schedule. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
Sen. Graham on SC’s proposed nuclear reboot: ‘We’re going to finish these reactors’

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage.
By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered.
The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

Details of services
A memorial service will be held at the Middlebury United Methodist Church on Saturday, September 13, at 10:30 with a reception to follow at the church. Donations in memory of Margaret to the Middlebury United Methodist Church or the charity of the donor’s choice will be much appreciated.

MARGARET KLOHCK, 79, formerly of Middlebury VT
Margaret Klohck passed away peacefully on August 17 at Elderwood at Uihlein, a nursing home in Lake Placid NY where she received care for several months.
Margaret Mitchell Klohck was born on November 17, 1945 in Albany, NY, the child of Norman and Jessie Mitchell. Margaret grew up in Schenectady, NY, until 1958 when her family moved to Lee, Mass, where she graduated from Lee High School in 1963. She attended Berkshire County Community College for nurses training and received her LPN pin. She moved back to the Schenectady area where she worked at various jobs. She found her real vocation while living in Middlebury VT where she worked with learning disabled students as a teaching assistant at the Hannaford Career Center. After moving back to NYS she continued this work for twelve years at the Wildwood School in Albany before retiring in 2001.
On February 6, 1981 Margaret and the Reverend George Klohck were married. George was serving as a United Methodist pastor in the Schenectady, NY. Margaret and George would both say that their real lives began when they found each other. Together they delighted in the relationships they developed with their three children and with the friends they made wherever they lived. They served churches in Schenectady, Middlebury VT, and Voorheesville, NY. While serving in Middlebury they both fell in love with Vermont, and especially Middlebury. They decided that this was where they would live when they retired. And so, in 2001 they returned to Vermont, first to New Haven, then Bridport, and finally in 2012 to Middlebury. In 2024 to live near family they moved to Lake Placid NY.
Margaret, always active in church, served in many leadership positions in the United Methodist Church. She always served with her husband in the churches that he served. She served on committees and boards in the United Methodist Troy Conference. Margaret and George served together as Volunteers-in Mission in Mozambique and Northern Ireland and in Louisiana and New Mexico. For about twenty years Margaret was a member of the Addison County Democratic Committee, first representing Bridport and then Middlebury. She was elected three times as a Justice of the Peace in Middlebury. She was an activist advocating for peace and justice and marriage equality.
Margaret is survived by three children: her daughter Leslie Shannon (Gary Bishop) of Lake Placid, her two stepchildren, Beth Zuckerman (Eric) of Berkeley, CA, and Tim Klohck (Angelina), and their two children, Maya and Leonardo (Léo) Klohck of Redondo Beach, CA. She is survived by three adult grandchildren, Dr. Hope Shannon (David Tooley) of Hyattsville, MD, Kerry Shannon Blinn (Chad) and a great grandson, Declan Charles Blinn of Lake Placid, NY, and Mitchell Shannon of Lake Placid, NY. She is also survived by her loving sister, Theresa Morrello of Las Vegas, NV.
Margaret leaves several cousins, two of whom live in Halifax, Nova Scotia and two others in Scotland. Exchanging visits with these cousins always brought great joy.
When care at a nursing home became necessary, great sadness was felt by Margaret’s family. George, continuing to live nearby in an apartment, spent time with her every day to show her his love and to assist in her care. Leslie cared for her mother and gave valuable assistance many times when her help was needed. For the care that Margaret received in the nursing home for several months Margaret’s family is very grateful.

(Photo courtesy of SEIU Local 1107)Workers at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center in Las Vegas say their units are dealing with severe understaffing, turnover and burnout while corporate owner HCA Healthcare rakes in billions in profits.
At an informational picket Monday, the workers called on the hospital to negotiate a fair first contract with them, something they have been waiting on for approximately a year and a half since they voted to unionize. With the workers was a 20-foot inflatable rocket emblazoned with the words “skyrocketing CEO compensation at HCA.”
HCA is one of the largest hospital corporations in the United States and reported $5.7 billion in profits last year, up around 10% from the previous year. HCA operates three hospitals in Southern Nevada: Sunrise Hospital, MountainView Hospital, and Southern Hills Hospital & Medical Center.
According to SEC filings, HCA CEO Samuel Hagan made nearly $23.8 million in 2024.
At the same time, HCA employed approximately 313,000 people with a median wage of $60,820, meaning half of workers made more than that amount and half made less.
That equates to Hagan receiving $391 for every $1 earned by an average employee.
Or, as SEIU Local 1107 put it, “the CEO made more in a single day than most workers made in the entire year.” Union leaders argue the disparity is indicative of a larger crisis of corporatization and consolidation.
Genie Patrick, a medical social worker at the hospital, said the community supports health care professionals at Sunrise Hospital.
“We have Google reviews of the community stating, ‘I love the way you treated me. You helped me so much,’” she said. “We just want to be appreciated, like everybody else, because we’re doing the job. We’re working hard. We want HCA to appreciate us like everybody else does.”
Casey Donaldson, a physical therapist who’s worked at Sunrise’s inpatient rehab unit for eight years, echoed that sentiment and said it’s difficult to see good employees leave.
“We need to make sure that we’re retaining these incredibly experienced people,” he said.
Donaldson implored HCA to “invest in us. Invest in frontline professionals.”
Kalani Kauwe, a physical therapist at Sunrise’s trauma intensive care unit, said it’s not uncommon to be assigned 15 or more patients per shift. At other hospitals, workloads are closer to 10 patients per shift.
Both Donaldson and Kauwe emphasized their unit sees patients at their lowest — after car accidents, traumatic brain injuries, strokes.
“They went from being completely independent, now they need two people to help them move in the bed,” said Donaldson. “We need to go in there when they’re incredibly vulnerable and improve their independence within about 10 to 14 days, to get them home.”
Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom, who attended the event Monday, expressed his firsthand gratitude for physical therapists specifically.
“I wouldn’t be walking without a physical therapist,” he said.
Sunrise Hospital employs nearly 300 health care professionals. In addition to physical therapists and medical social workers, there are laboratory medical technologists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, and speech-language pathologists. They voted to unionize under SEIU 1107 early last year but no initial contract has been reached.
That professional workers bargaining group is separate from Sunrise Hospital nurses, who were already unionized under SEIU. SEIU represents about 20,000 health care and public service workers across Nevada.
Sunrise health care professionals held a similar rally in May to highlight the stalled negotiations and need for better working conditions.
In addition to their picket, the workers launched a website to encourage supporters to put pressure on the hospital and its corporate owners: RespectSunriseProfessionals.org. According to SEIU, hundreds of emails have already been sent.
Representatives from Sunrise Hospital and HCA Healthcare could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
HCA made headlines last month after Attorney General Aaron Ford announced the State of Nevada would receive $768,500 as part of a $2.9 million multistate settlement with the health care giant for requiring nurses to repay the cost of a mandatory training program if they left the company before two years.
Ford, attorneys general from California and Colorado and the Biden administration argued it was an unlawful form of employer-driven debt and a violation of state consumer protection laws.
In addition to penalty fees paid to the state, HCA agreed to pay $75,776 in restitution to Nevada nurses impacted by the repayment policy.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/JAK07345-e1756296804867-1024x628.jpg,,,2025-08-27 08:56:29.722741

Albritton said the state will struggle to meet the funding requests of state agencies for fiscal year 2027. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The chair of the Senate’s General Fund committee said Tuesday “the numbers are not adding up” on budget requests from state agencies for fiscal year 2027. 
“The needs far exceed what the resources are going to be,” said Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, in an interview after budget hearings on Tuesday. “We’ll be fine this upcoming year, the budget that’s coming up. After that, it gets much more dicey, but we’ve got a long ways to go.”
The state faces challenges from federal funding changes and cuts from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which will increase the state’s responsibility in funding programs within the Alabama Department of Human Resources (ADHR), especially in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
The Legislature will take up the 2027 Education Trust Fund and General Fund budgets in the 2026 regular session, which starts in January.
Nancy Buckner, commissioner of ADHR, told legislators Tuesday that the OBBBA cuts will increase her budget request for FY27 by $35 million due to the ratio change for administration funding. Prior to OBBBA, Buckner said administration costs were equally paid by the state and the federal government. Now, the share is 75% from the state and 25% from the federal government. 
In FY28, the state will be responsible for 10% of benefits for SNAP, which it has never had to pay for. That increases the state’s appropriations by an estimated $173 million, based on FY24 costs and an 8.32% error rate, bringing the total increase to $208.7 million.
Those errors, Buckner said, are mostly from clients overpaying or underpaying for their benefits by not reporting a need within their household. Buckner said there were 752,000 Alabamians enrolled in the food assistance program in 2024, 331,0000 of whom were children. 
“We also deny 20,000 people every month in this state for SNAP,” Buckner said. 
Alabama’s penalty for an 8.32% error rate is about $36,000. For states whose error rates are greater than 20% when multiplied by 1.5, penalties are delayed four years. Albritton said that is not fair.
“Our error rates are the lowest in the Southeast and lower than most of the country, and yet we’re going to be stuck with the $200 million thing and all the others that don’t,” Albritton said. “That doesn’t make sense, so we got to sort some things out like that.” 
Kirk Fulford, the legislative fiscal officer, told the legislators that while the General Fund and Education Trust Fund have grown 3.22% and 3.26%, respectively, from July 2024 to July 2025, the state will have more funding responsibility with the OBBBA cuts. 
“You’re the controller of the appropriation process,” Fulford told the joint committee. “It is absolutely critical that you understand and pay attention to the issues going on in Washington with regards to federal programs, federal funding, federal grants, because it will eventually impact your budget in a big way.”
Fulford said while the funds have grown, it is a slower growth and will get slower as federal interest rates change. He said the general fund will lose about 15% of its revenue because of decreased interest rates on state deposits. 
“Everything else in the General Fund doesn’t grow by enough to offset a big decline in one revenue source,” Fulford said. 
The budget hearings, which continue Wednesday, are for the legislature to get an understanding of what challenges state agencies are facing, Allbritton said. For DHR, those challenges remain to be employee turnover rates in its child welfare programs and not being able to control how many children are brought under state care. 
“Relinquishments, that’s what’s hurting us greatly. We can’t say no,” Buckner said. “The judge gives us an order. We can’t say ‘we don’t have a place to put them today, can we pick them up next week.’”
Bo Offord, the newly appointed commissioner of the Alabama Medicaid Agency, said Alabama will not be substantially impacted by cuts through the OBBBA, as the state never expanded Medicaid. He said the agency is waiting on guidance from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on eligibility changes made by the OBBBA. The agency is watching drug prices and health care inflation, he said.
“It’s impossible to predict when an FDA approved medication may enter the market, how CMS will treat that in the Medicaid space, or what the associated expense will be for the Medicaid program to bring that to our Medicaid beneficiaries,” Offord said.
The Alabama Department of Mental Health has a similar story to the state’s Medicaid agency. The changes in the OBBBA will impact who qualifies for mental health service through Medicaid, but the ADMH is not expecting federal funding cuts, Commissioner Kim Boswell said. 
Boswell said ADMH’s biggest challenge is that the state does not have enough beds per 100,000 people for in-patient treatment. She said there are supposed to be 30 beds per 100,000 people, but the state only has 13.7 beds. 
“We have two objectives: Protect the facilities that are there now and get them at a reasonable rate … and we also need to expand the number of beds we have,” Boswell said. 
Albritton said that the only thing the Legislature can control with the budgets is how much they spend.
“We can’t control the asks. The asks are going to be there. All those asks are going to be valid and good,” he said. “We’ve got to control what goes out of the coffers of the state.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0368-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 08:56:29.722741

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah is the fifth-highest in the nation in the ranking of “focus on future generations,” a number largely driven by its high birth rates, which remain the highest in the nation. Also, by its strong effort to fund parks and recreation, according to a report from the Utah Foundation.
Nationally, birth rates are shrinking. So are investments in schools, parks and youth organizations. However, the issue is deeper in Mountain states, where the effort to establish a strong foundation for future generations is declining faster than the nation at large.
Even with a 60% decline since 2013, Utah is still a bit of an outlier in the region, the foundation says.

“Utah is still fifth in the nation, and well above the national average in its focus on future generations,” Christopher Collard, research director of the Utah Foundation said in a statement. “However, the gap between Utah and the U.S. is closing.” That’s because of the state’s public school funding efforts. 
Utah is typically last of all states in the widely used per-pupil spending numbers. But, for this study the Utah Foundation used a different education spending metric based on the state’s level of personal income. “This means that for every $1,000 earned by a Utahn, $37.91 was collected by a state or local government and spent on the K-12 education system in 2023,” researchers wrote. 
With those metrics, Utah ranked thirds among the low-funding-effort Mountain states, the report says, spending $38 per $1,000 of personal income in 2023. That’s down from $58.52 in 2008.
All Mountain states have seen declines in their numbers since then. Idaho has the lowest spending effort, with $28 per $1,000 of personal income — down from about $40 in 2008. And, New Mexico, which at $51 was the highest ranked in the region, experienced a decline from about $60, according to the report.  
The study also analyzed birth rates and funding efforts for parks and recreation, public schools and youth organizations since 2013, most of which have shrunk among Mountain states. These are trends that raise concerns, researchers said, because a gap in access to activities like team sports, means that many children may miss out on opportunities to build soft skills like grit and teamwork — and have reduced chances to build social connections.



Let us know what you think...


 


“While Utah is spending a lot on parks and rec, we continue to slide in public school funding effort,” Shawn Teigen, president of the Utah Foundation said in a statement. “We are blessed with a comparatively high, though declining, birth rate, but we are slipping further and further down on the other side of that coin – paying to educate those kids.”
What keeps Utah on top of the overall “focus on future generations” ranking is its “exceptionally large” families, something emblematic of the state’s culture, the report says. 
“Family itself is a key source of social capital, with larger families often forming the threads for larger social networks. The built-in network of siblings, cousins, and other family members often allows for lifelong relationships that can help weave a large network of connections,” researchers wrote.
But, those exceptional numbers have been changing, and downward trends are most likely to continue.
In Utah, about 13 children are born per 1,000 residents, still the highest birth rate in Mountain West states, which have a median birth rate of 10 births per 1,000 residents. But, while all states in the region have seen declines in their birth rates, Utah’s numbers have decreased the most rapidly.
“Utah’s birth rate dropped rapidly from 2008 to 2023, from 21 births per 1,000 residents to a little over 13,” the study said. “This represents a major reconfiguring of Utah’s population that will manifest in countless ways during the coming years, in areas ranging from education to public health to employment.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Recently, Gov. Henry McMaster announced he will seek restrictions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), our country’s largest food and nutrition assistance program for low-income households.
On the surface, these changes are framed as a push toward healthier eating. In reality, they take away the flexibility families need to feed themselves and make ends meet.
For many South Carolinians, grocery choices are an economic decision, not a nutritional one. SNAP isn’t just a safety net, it’s a lifeline.
Nationally, it served an average of nearly 42 million Americans monthly last fiscal year.
Here in South Carolina, it supported about 580,000 people — over 275,000 households — many in rural communities where grocery options are scarce and food costs are significantly higher.
Beyond limiting junk food purchases, these restrictions create enormous administrative hurdles for grocery stores and state agencies. Retailers would be forced to reprogram checkout systems to flag restricted items, increasing costs and confusion.
Families would bear the brunt, finding out only at the register that a food item they’ve planned, budgeted, and counted on is suddenly not allowed.
Imagine a parent with two children at the store, carefully balancing a cart of groceries for the week. When the cashier scans an item and the system rejects it as “junk food,” that parent has to decide whether to put it back in front of their kids or pay out-of-pocket with money that was already earmarked for rent. These moments don’t just create inconvenience; they strip away dignity.
I recently spoke with child nutrition advocates about the potential junk food restrictions, and they agree the idea is problematic. One advocate thought about her autistic daughter, who would eat only one item for a week straight and nothing else.
And then there’s the question of what counts as “junk food.” Drawing these lines is far more complicated than it sounds.
For example, are sports drinks off-limits but fruit juice, with its high sugar content, acceptable?
Will cereal be judged by the sugar on its label, or by whether it’s marketed as breakfast or a snack?
For families, the end result is the same: frustration, wasted time, and fewer options. In practice, these restrictions could easily backfire, and the timing could not be worse.
With food costs soaring and Congress proposing additional cuts to SNAP, families are already stretching every dollar.
Last month, the average benefit was less than $6.70 per person per day. That cannot realistically cover the cost of a balanced diet.
Since 2020, grocery prices have risen by 25%, meaning those benefits buy less each month.
Restricting food choices under the banner of “healthy eating” sends a damaging message: that low-income families cannot be trusted to make their own decisions.
The truth is that families know how to feed themselves. If Gov. McMaster truly wants to encourage healthy food selection, there are proven strategies that work without taking choice away.
Expanding access to farmers’ markets, investing in grocery stores in rural food deserts, and subsidizing refrigeration costs for low-income households would do far more to improve health outcomes than policing shopping carts.
The real crisis is not that SNAP recipients occasionally buy chips or soda. It’s that so many working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and children in South Carolina are one missed paycheck or unexpected bill away from hunger.
The program already has built-in safeguards to prevent misuse, and fraud rates remain extremely low.
Punishing struggling families by narrowing their choices will only deepen hardship and push more people toward the brink.
Gov. McMaster’s proposed restrictions on “junk food” are especially concerning when coupled with federal changes to the SNAP program that will cut benefits. More cuts could be on the way as Congress debates the farm bill and other government funding proposals.
South Carolina has a choice to make. We can invest in solutions that respect the dignity of our neighbors and address the root causes of food insecurity, or we can pass policies that make it harder for people to survive.
Restricting SNAP purchases under the guise of promoting health does nothing to address the real issues: stagnant wages, rising prices, and the lack of affordable, accessible healthy food.
The families who rely on SNAP are our coworkers, our neighbors, and in many cases, our friends and relatives. They are doing their best in an economy that too often works against them.
They deserve support, not judgment. We cannot push more kids into hunger. Instead of cutting benefits, expand them. Make it easier, not harder, for every family to put food on the table.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/snapphoto_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-27 08:56:29.722741

“The State was targeted in a cyber attack, and the incident is under active state and federal investigation. To protect internal systems during an active criminal investigation, the State is unable to provide technical details at this point,” reads a memo sent by the governor’s office late Tuesday.
A spokesperson with the governor’s office won’t say if the the state’s systems were hacked or if the state is being held ransom by cyber attackers, according to KLAS.
Some state offices are expected to resume offering in-person services “later this week,” according to the state’s late Tuesday update.
“Medicaid coverage and provider payments remain fully operational,” the memo said.
Payroll services weren’t affected and employees will get paid on time, the memo added.
State websites and IT services, hence many state services, were made unavailable beginning Sunday morning. As of early Wednesday morning, many state of Nevada websites were still down (the state’s homepage, the governor’s office) but others (the currently out of session Nevada Legislature, the Nevada Department of Employment) were up.
As in earlier updates, the state’s memo Tuesday said there is “no evidence” anyone’s personal information “was compromised.”

As the 2024 presidential election approached, tensions were high, and activists were, once again, hunting for fraud.
Cliff Maloney, a Republican activist working to get GOP voters to return their mail ballots, said on the social network X that one of his door-to-door canvassers had discovered an address in Erie, Pennsylvania, that had no residents but 53 voters registered to it.
“Turns out it’s the Benedictine Sisters of Erie and NO ONE lives there,” he wrote in a post that went viral, adding that he would not let “Dems count illegal votes.”
But that wasn’t true. And Maloney found himself being called out by the nuns, who didn’t appreciate being accused of fraud.
“We do live at Mount Saint Benedict Monastery and a simple web search would alert him to our active presence in a number of ministries in Erie,” Sister Stephanie Schmidt, of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie, said in a statement, calling Maloney’s post “blatantly false.”
Now, the sisters are being honored with an award from the National Association of Secretaries of State for their efforts to push back against misinformation. The 2025 Margaret Chase Smith American Democracy Award honors recipients for “individual acts of political courage, uncommon character and selfless action in the realm of public service.”
Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt, who is not related to Sister Stephanie Schmidt, nominated the sisters.
“The Sisters thoughtfully confronted the baseless claims and used their time in the spotlight to warn the public that ‘a free republic depends … on a discerning and conscientious citizenry who do not unquestioningly accept the word of anyone who has a social media platform,’” Secretary Schmidt said in a statement.
The award will be presented at the 2026 NASS winter conference in Washington, D.C.
Votebeat and Spotlight PA recently spoke with Sister Linda Romey, director of communications for the monastery, about its response to the accusations and the lessons of the experience.
Romey told Votebeat and Spotlight PA that in addition to the statement it put out, the monastery invited Maloney to visit — an invitation that still stands — but he has yet to come.
This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:
How did you first become aware of Maloney’s post? What was your reaction?
I came into work, and we have a very large email list and have friends across the country. So people who know who we are and what we stand for saw this post, and they were emailing me and Stephanie Schmidt, who was our prioress, our elected leader at the time. … So Stephanie called and she said, ‘How should we respond?’ And I said I think we should put out a press release and address this.
Pennsylvania was a battleground state, a very key battleground state in the election, and Erie County was key to Pennsylvania. So we knew that everything here would be scrutinized, and in addition to just wanting to counter what was blatantly false, we wanted to contest that. But we also knew that if Kamala (Harris) were to win the election and then her victory be contested, we didn’t want to become any part of that saying, you know, here’s 50 some false votes that the Democrats came up with and because nobody lives here. We wanted on record that we contested the falsehood immediately.
What kind of response did you get?
Overwhelming support, overwhelming. We don’t have an X account, so friends were telling us how the numbers were climbing on the views and the shares, or whatever they call them at X, but even on our social media pages, the support just continued to grow, and then we started getting phone calls. We had more than 25 media outlets contact us over the course of a couple of weeks.
Secretary Schmidt called and spoke with our prioress, Stephanie Schmidt, and offered his support, as did our local election officials. We were in touch with them, and they did support us. Our local mayor knows us and supports us. And other local political figures were behind us also. They all know us, and they know what we do in the city of Erie, and they spoke on our behalf. So yes, we were very, very well supported.
What lessons do you hope others will take away from your experience?
To stand up for truth. Not to back down … if you fall victim to this. But the other thing is, read with conscious discernment. Everybody needs to look at something and read something and then do the necessary background work to know whether or not something should be believed. Because it seems to me that as soon as something is out on social media, it’s taken for fact or for truth, and things are very rarely just that black and white. There’s always room for question, for more information.

However, running for governor is not for the faint of heart. It requires early commitment, stamina, a thick skin and the ability to raise the huge amounts of cash. 
That’s why, in most cases, serious candidates come from the ranks of lesser officeholders, spend years laying the groundwork their campaigns and declare themselves at least two years in advance of the election they hope to win.
Of the 10 men who have won the governorship since World War II — including Jerry Brown twice — only two didn’t use other offices as springboards: actors Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
However, the historic pattern is not holding for 2026 as Gavin Newsom’s governorship ends. Two of the most prominent potential Democratic candidates, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, have checked out, and those who remain in the field are — in political terms — middleweights at best.
The muddled situation is obvious in the latest poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies. 
The strongest candidate at the moment is former Rep. Katie Porter, who lost her bid for the U.S. Senate last year, with just 17% in the Berkeley poll. She’s followed by Chad Bianco, the Republican sheriff of Riverside County, and Democrat Xavier Becerra, a former attorney general and Biden cabinet member, at 10% each. Meanwhile, nine other declared candidates are trailing at no more than 6% each, while 38% of voters are undecided.
When second choices of voters are included in the standings, Porter receives 22% of the preferences, followed by Becerra at 18%, Bianco at 15% and Republican Steve Hilton, a former Fox News contributor, at 12%.
In the absence of a standout, there’s much speculation in political circles about who could command instant status. Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso, a very wealthy Republican turned Democrat, often mentioned. This week, Politico focused on Sen. Alex Padilla.
“A prominent political entity in Sacramento is currently in the field polling the 2026 governor’s race with Padilla’s name included as a potential candidate,” Politico reported. “Padilla is not ruling out a run, according to a person familiar with his thinking who was granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 
“Edgar Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the senator, pivoted to … Newsom’s redistricting measure, Proposition 50 — but notably, did not close the door on a gubernatorial bid.”
Pivoting from the U.S. Senate to a bid for governor is not unprecedented. That’s exactly what Republican Pete Wilson did in 1990 after eight years in the Senate.
Wilson, then the mayor of San Diego, wanted to run for governor in 1982, but a coterie of influential Republicans preferred Lt. Gov. Mike Curb and promised to help Wilson win a Senate seat if he would not challenge Curb. Wilson easily bested Democrat Jerry Brown in their 1982 Senate duel but the Curb gambit failed. Attorney General George Deukmejian defeated Curb in the Republican primary and won a very narrow victory over Tom Bradley, the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, for the governorship.
Were he to run, Padilla would almost certainly become the frontrunner, and there’s a certain logic to a shift from the Senate to the governorship.
The Senate is controlled by Republicans and that’s likely to continue after next year’s elections, Politico and other oddsmakers believe. Padilla, like Wilson, may be tempted to going from being 1% of the Senate to being No. 1 in the nation’s most populous state.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/051225_Governors-Event_FG_CM_30.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-27 08:56:29.722741

Rural residents will be hardest hit by looming health insurance premium increases, according to a new report. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”
Millions will see rise in health insurance premiums if federal subsidies expire

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-27 11:37:37+00:00,CT Mirror,CT shouldn’t lose its opportunity for parking reform,Thomas Broderick and Casey Moran,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/27/ct-shouldnt-lose-its-opportunity-for-parking-reform/,Arguments against parking mandates are so compelling and common sense that municipalities across the country are doing away with them.,"Part I of this two part series focused on how parking reform is helping Hartford build new homes and gain new infill investment. This part talks about how these trends are sweeping across the country in a bipartisan fashion.
When Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed Connecticut’s housing bill in June, he said the parking reform provision raised some eyebrows. It’s time to lower those eyebrows: 2025 has been the year of parking reform across the United States, and Connecticut would be placing itself firmly in the bipartisan mainstream by reforming its onerous, government-required parking mandates. 
Part I of this series addressed how parking mandates make little sense and drive up the spatial and financial cost of infill housing and businesses to the point that they often become impossible to build. As we pointed out in Part I of this series, Connecticut municipalities as distinct as Hartford and Thompson are benefitting from parking reform. 
Indeed, the arguments against parking mandates are so compelling and common sense that municipalities across the country are doing away with them. In 2023, Austin, Texas (which has the same population as Fairfield County) became the largest city in the country to eliminate its mandates, and Burlington, Vermont joined them that same year. And in 2025 Dallas and Denver have joined the movement and eliminated their parking mandates, joined by small towns like Shoreline (population: 63,740) and Bothell (population 51,770) in Washington state. 
The Shoreline and Bothell stories are instructive: it’s not just large cities that benefit from parking reform: twice as many small towns have eliminated parking mandates as large cities. Evidence shows that reforming parking in small jurisdictions is even more transformative in strengthening small business heavy main street districts, allowing missing middle housing to be built, and protecting forests and farms from sprawl development.
Parking reform case studies are so powerful —and the benefits so overwhelming— that it has now swept through statehouses across the country. States as diverse as Washington, New Hampshire, Texas, and Montana each passed laws to reform their onerous local parking mandates this year, and North Carolina is on the cusp after their House of Representatives voted 107-0 to fully eliminate all mandates statewide. While the details differ, the story is the same: Democratic and Republican, rural and suburban states are reforming their outdated parking regulations. 
These legislatures and governors understood that parking mandates are bad for business, bad for infill housing, and bad for runoff pollution, and they refused to give into fear-mongering. Eliminating parking mandates does not eliminate parking, as entrepreneurs and towns can still —and almost always will— build parking for their needs, just in more reasonable quantities. These states also understood that no one has to give up their car in a world without parking mandates, it just builds in a touch more flexibility. 
Not only will most developers continue to build parking in Connecticut after we modernize our parking policies, but we have a significant amount of parking already. Our research at Connecticut Parking Reform showed that parking lots make up an average of 29% of Connecticut’s downtowns and transit hubs, equating to 4,327 acres of parking —or over 630,000 parking spaces— on only 1.5% of our land! Want to see how much parking your local town center already has? Check out our work at ctparkingreform.org and scroll down to the “Paved Paradise: Mapped.”
New ideas can take a moment to digest, and some legislators and governors can be nervous to enact changes like parking reform. But they shouldn’t be: this is a common-sense, evidence-based, bipartisan policy passing in small towns, cities and states across the country.

The wildfire danger facing Vermont and much of the U.S. today is far different — and growing far greater — than it was for most of our nation’s history. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  James Campbell: How the ‘Fix Our Forests Act’ protects Vermont’s future.","This commentary is by James Campbell, of Brooklyn, New York. He is the director of federal affairs at Megafire Action, a nonprofit organization committed to ending the megafire crisis through a holistic approach to land management, wildfire response and community resilience.


When people think about wildfires, Vermont is hardly at the top of the list. But wildfire risk for the Green Mountain State is growing amid more frequent hot and dry conditions.
The wildfire danger facing Vermont and much of the U.S. today is far different — and growing far greater — than it was for most of our nation’s history. While some amount of fire is a natural part of ecosystems across the country, especially out West, decades of mismanagement and accelerating climate change have driven an alarming rise in catastrophic and severe wildfires that devastate communities, landscapes and lives. 
All of these factors have boiled over to turn wildfire seasons into wildfire years. Wildfires also fuel a vicious cycle of cascading disasters contributing significantly to drought, diminished water quality and making land more prone to flooding. Additionally, wildfires are a major contributor of carbon emissions further fueling the climate crisis.
Fortunately, this crisis is solvable, and a big part of the solution is making its way through Congress right now. At its core, S.1462, known as the “Fix Our Forests Act,” tackles two key challenges — permitting reform and technology adoption for improved decision making — that are essential to scaling up effective wildfire mitigation. 
The bill would achieve this by establishing a new community wildfire risk reduction program to help communities become more fire resistant, creating a wildfire intelligence center to embed cutting-edge science and technology into fire prediction and response, and by making it easier to reduce buildups of dead wood and brush that significantly increase wildfire risk. 
In particular, a wildfire intelligence center would provide tools to help small fire departments — like many in Vermont — predict fire or smoke behavior.
In an era of sharp political divisions, particularly around environmental policy, S.1462 stands out as a notable instance of bipartisan agreement. First introduced during the Biden administration, it was reintroduced earlier this year and swiftly passed in the U.S. House with the support of every Republican and 64 Democrats. A bipartisan group of senators recently negotiated and released a companion bill that is even stronger.
Opponents have argued that S.1462 would stifle public input, roll back environmental protections and remove science from land management. These arguments are simply false. 
The bill appropriately balances the importance of community engagement and environmental review with the need to dramatically increase the pace and scale at which we implement wildfire resilience projects, including selective thinning and prescribed fire to reduce fire risk on public lands. 
Scientific evidence shows that active forest management as envisioned under S.1462 would not only build wildfire resilience, but it also would directly mitigate future droughts, leading to less fire-prone conditions and less ecological and community damage overall.
The legislation would also substantially strengthen how we incorporate science into land and fire management by providing real-time analytical services, comprehensively modeling wildfire, consolidating air quality data, and establishing information systems accessible to federal, state, local and tribal governments.
No single policy will eliminate the risk of catastrophic wildfires, but S.1462 would advance the policies and practices needed to reduce the threat of megafires, protect communities, and restore the health of fire-adapted landscapes. 
It is essential that Congress continue building upon its bipartisan efforts to change policy with additional investments in wildfire-fighting workforce, fuels management, home hardening and grid resilience, and emerging technologies.
Progress means not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, and S.1462 would certainly be progress. It represents months of negotiations and input from stakeholders across the ideological spectrum. Currently, the bill is awaiting a markup in the Senate Committee on Agriculture. 
Vermont not only has a direct stake in this bill as the state’s wildfire risk grows, but also because Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., is a member of the committee. That means he is set to cast a vote on whether to move the bill forward to the full Senate. 
If passed, S.1462 would be an important step to ensuring that fire is less of a threat for Vermonters — and all Americans.

(Courtesy Duke Energy)Hoosier utility regulators “impermissibly applied” Indiana law retroactively when they let Duke Energy raise customer rates to recover coal ash compliance costs, the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday.
Judge Paul Mathias — writing for the three-member panel — reversed the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s decision and instructed it to reconsider or dismiss Duke’s rate increase application.
Judges Cale Bradford and Dana Kenworthy concurred.
The lawsuit has roots in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules, promulgated in 2015, for treating and disposing of toxic coal ash. Duke, which operates several coal-powered electricity generation plants in Indiana, began spending to comply.
Four years later, the company asked regulators to increase rates on Hoosier customers to recover those costs, plus anticipated expenditures. Both requests were granted.
But Indiana’s Supreme Court reversed in 2022. Hikes for the costs incurred between 2015 and 2018 were considered illegal retroactive ratemaking.
Settlement: Duke to consider selling Indiana coal units amid switch to natural gas

The Court of Appeals in 2023 also blocked Duke’s separate attempt to recover costs from 2018 and 2019. A month later, however, the Indiana General Assembly amended the laws dealing with federal mandates — removing a pre-approval requirement. The changes were effective upon passage.
In response, Duke filed to recover about $88 million in costs incurred from 2019 through 2023, along with $238 million in projected spending between 2024 and 2030.
Citizens Action Coalition, a ratepayer advocacy group, intervened. But regulators found that the amended laws applied because the application was filed after the effective date.
The Court of Appeals disagreed in its Tuesday opinion.
The panel argued that a federal mandate triggers the laws, not a utility company’s regulatory filing.
“As our Supreme Court has made clear: ‘a statute operates prospectively when it is applied to the operative event of the statute, and that event occurs after the statute took effect,'” Mathias wrote.
He compared Duke and the IURC’s procedural theory to using the date the state files charging information — instead of when an alleged crime occurred — as the trigger for a criminal statute.
The opinion also noted that laws typically aren’t applied retroactively unless the text explicitly says to, and “there is nothing in this language reflecting a clear intent” to do so.
Remedial statutes are an exception.
Duke has argued that the changes were remedial because they were enacted in response to the court’s earlier opinion, but Mathias called that “an incorrect statement of law … all but expressly rejected by the Indiana Supreme Court.”
Even remedial laws generally apply only prospectively unless there is a “strong and compelling” reason to apply them retroactively. Duke didn’t provide any, Mathias wrote.
The court also affirmed that Citizens Action Coalition has the standing to sue.

All state laws passed in a regular session take effect Aug. 28 unless another date is specified. The capital gains tax cut will apply to all gains since Jan. 1 and will be reflected in the income tax returns due in April.
With the bill, MIssouri became the first state to exempt profits from the sale of assets such as stocks, real estate, and cryptocurrency from income tax.
“The (Department of Revenue) is already preparing for next year’s tax season and we are making the adjustments required to accommodate this and other new laws that affect taxpayers,” Trish Vincent, the state revenue agency’s director, said in a news release.
The exemption is officially estimated to reduce revenue by approximately $157 million in the current fiscal year and about $111 million annually on an ongoing basis. But the fiscal note, updated June 23 after the bill was passed but before Gov. Mike Kehoe signed it, included a warning that the impact could be much larger.
Missouri taxpayers claimed $13.3 billion in capital gains income for 2022 on their federal income tax forms.
“Therefore, taking the 4.7% top rate would yield ($625.6 million) for FY 2026,” the new fiscal note states. 
That is the same estimate The Independent reported in April based on estimates from the Institute for Tax and Economic Policy. The oversight division stated it “does not currently have the resources and/or access to state tax data to produce a thorough independent revenue estimate and is unable to verify the revenue estimates provided by (the Department of Revenue).”
Federal tax changes will further reduce state revenue, and the state is anticipating new costs for programs such as Medicaid funded jointly with the federal government.
Through Monday, general revenue has grown faster than expectations but the trend for the year is not clear. But when he signed the budget in June, Kehoe vetoed about $300 million in earmarked items and warned of a looming shortfall.
“The Office of Administration’s Division of Budget and Planning estimates a nearly $1 billion shortfall in general revenue starting in (fiscal year 2027),” the release stated. “Contributing to this shortfall, ongoing general revenue spending authorized in the (fiscal year 2026) budget is projected to outpace ongoing revenues by nearly over $1 billion and grow larger in future years.”

(Photo by John McGauley)Northeast Indiana’s economy is expanding, our communities are growing, and companies — both those rooted here and those exploring new investments — are deploying more advanced, energy-intensive technologies. We are at a pivotal moment. And as a result, the demand for reliable, affordable electricity is rising fast, and we must be prepared to meet it.
The energy landscape is evolving rapidly across the country, and Indiana is no exception. According to the 2023 Indiana Resource Plan developed by the State Utility Forecasting Group, traditional power generation sources are retiring at an accelerating pace, while the gap between supply and demand is widening. Although federal investments in transmission and infrastructure are in motion, those improvements are years away from full realization. Our region cannot afford to wait on the sidelines.
That’s why northeast Indiana must adopt a pragmatic, forward-looking “All of the Above” energy strategy — one that responsibly leverages a mix of energy sources, including solar where appropriate and feasible.
Solar energy is not a standalone solution, but it plays an important role in a diversified energy portfolio. When developed responsibly by experienced partners, solar projects can provide near-term benefits: they enhance grid reliability, offer cost stability, and generate long-term tax revenue to support local schools, infrastructure, and essential public services. Additionally, many of the industries we aim to attract now prioritize access to renewable energy as part of their sustainability and operational goals.
At the Northeast Indiana Regional Partnership, we manage more than 120 active business attraction and expansion projects. Increasingly, our conversations with site selectors and corporate leaders revolve around two critical questions: “Can you meet our long-term energy needs?” and “Do you offer renewable energy options?” If we can’t confidently answer “yes” to both, those opportunities risk landing in other states or regions.
This is not about choosing one type of energy over another. It’s about building resilience, protecting ratepayers, and remaining competitive in a global economy. A balanced mix — including next-generation baseload power, modern grid infrastructure, and local renewable projects — positions northeast Indiana for long-term economic success.
The bottom line is this: securing our energy future is essential to sustaining the momentum we’ve worked hard to build. A thoughtful, inclusive energy strategy that draws from all available resources will ensure we continue to grow, innovate, and lead.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Downtown-DeNoiseAI-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-08-27 07:56:46.685165

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin ushered through a slate of amendments to the party rules Tuesday meant to make the Democrats’ governing body more inclusive. 
Martin presented eight amendments to the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting in downtown Minneapolis on Tuesday, and all were approved with strong support. 
“This package of reforms is historic. It is transformative. It’s inclusive. It helps us rebuild trust with voters, and it gives people…a sense that we listen, and we learn — that we will do better, and that we are open and inclusive,” Martin said.
Earlier in the day, tensions among DNC members were on display as they debated whether to approve a resolution outlining the party’s stance on Israel’s war in Gaza, ultimately deciding to postpone the issue for now. Martin is also confronting early dissatisfaction with his leadership, flagging donations and a voter base anxious to fight back against President Donald Trump.
Tuesday evening, however, Martin found strong support in favor of rule changes that would place limits on his own power.
The rule changes reduce the number of members selected by the party chair and instead gives those slots to the party’s Asian American and Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ and Native American caucuses; increase the scope and oversight powers of the budget committee; limit the number of chair-appointed members who serve on the party’s major committees; and require DNC staff and officers to stay neutral in Democratic primary races. 
The rule requiring Democratic officers to remain neutral comes on the heels of a bitter dispute between party leaders and former DNC Vice Chair David Hogg. The 25-year-old gun safety activist was pushed out of his official party role over his plans to fund younger politicians’ primary challenges to older Democrats in safe districts.
And, in 2016, supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign accused the DNC of backing his opponent Hillary Clinton in the primary race. 
The neutrality policy means “you can’t help your friends who are running,” Martin told the committee members.
Shasti Conrad, chair of the Washington State Democratic Party and one of Martin’s vice chair appointees, said the neutrality policy is “incredibly important.”
“For far too long, I think many people — progressives, people of color, young people — have felt that at times, institutions like these have put thumbs on the scales and have made it harder for people to be able to feel like they have a fair chance,” Conrad said.
Martin, the former chair of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, founded and led the Association of State Democratic Chairs. Martin leaned on his state party connections to win his campaign to lead the DNC, and he delivered for those state parties on Tuesday by putting forth an amendment that would give state party chairs and vice chairs a minimum of 25% of the seats on all major DNC committees. 
Behind the scenes and sometimes in public view, DNC members are lobbying for their states to be one of the early primary states. For decades, Iowa was the first state in the nation to begin the process of selecting presidential nominees; under former President Joe Biden, that honor was conferred instead on South Carolina as a nod to the Black voters who helped Biden to victory in 2020.

Bob Ferguson is tapping the brakes on a controversial solar farm proposed in south-central Washington to allow more time to appraise concerns of Yakama Nation leaders.
Ferguson on Friday turned down a recommendation for the Carriger Solar project from the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council and directed the state panel to reconsider tribal officials’ desire for tougher conditions to protect cultural resources.
But the first-term Democratic governor signalled his eagerness to sign off on an updated development agreement that is due from the council by Oct. 21.
“Washington State needs clean energy. Based on the record developed in this matter, I find that the Carriger Solar Project is consistent with state policies regarding the mandated shift to renewable and zero-emitting sources for energy production,” he wrote in an  Aug. 22 letter.
Washington is striving to end its reliance on electricity from fossil fuels such as coal by mid-century. To do that, it is counting on a rapid buildout of new clean energy generation and transmission projects.
Ferguson wants Carriger Solar to proceed rapidly enough for its developers to secure federal clean energy tax credits before they are ended by the Trump administration. Solar and wind projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026 to fully qualify for the credits, he wrote.
“These tax credits are critical to ensure not only that the project remains financially viable, but that the energy it generates will remain affordable for Washingtonians,” he wrote.
The big picture
This is Ferguson’s maiden foray into the procedural and political turbulence of siting a large-scale clean energy installation. 
Cypress Creek Renewables of Santa Monica, California, wants to build the solar farm north of State Route 142 along Knight Road, about two miles west of Goldendale in unincorporated Klickitat County. 
As envisioned, it will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company website. The project, which also includes a 63 megawatt battery energy storage system, will tie into the Bonneville Power Administration transmission system.
It would occupy 1,326 acres within a 2,108-acre development site that is mostly agricultural and rural residential lands. That footprint includes all solar arrays, battery storage facilities, operations and maintenance building, employee parking, and access roads.
The council, after more than two years of public meetings and review, cast a 6-1 vote on June 26 recommending Ferguson approve the project, and sent a report to the governor two days later.
Matt Chiles, who represented Klickitat County on the panel, dissented, writing separately to Ferguson that from the outset, his community didn’t want it.
“There has been consistent loud and vocal opposition to this project from what appears to be an overwhelming percentage of the local Klickitat County population,” he wrote. All three county commissioners opposed it, he noted.
He cited three main reasons underlying the community’s distaste: it is a bad location because it is too close to homes; there is an increased fire danger from the proposed battery storage system;  and agricultural land would be taken out of production.
“Solar systems are a needed component of our energy grid for the foreseeable future,” he wrote. “However, this system is a poor example of how a solar installation should be designed. It is sited here only because of its proximity to existing energy infrastructure, with no regard for other factors.”
Are cultural resources protected?
Meanwhile, Gerald Lewis, chairman of the Yakama Nation Tribal Council, wrote in a June 18 letter to the siting council that there had not been “true government-to-government consultation” and conditions imposed on the development fail to “avoid or mitigate” impacts to their traditional cultural properties. As a result, the council should not advance the project, he wrote.
The council-passed agreement requires fencing and solar panels be pushed farther from the state route, Knight Road and parcels managed by the state Department of Natural Resources adjacent to the project. There also must be additional natural screening, such as earthen berms, rock piles, or native vegetation, on the north side of those state-owned parcels.
It also requires that tribal access to traditional and cultural properties is maintained during construction.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ferguson found little fault with much of the siting council’s handiwork.
He called the environmental review thorough and said many of the imposed mitigations exceeded the required minimums. He said the agreement “adequately addressed fire-safety concerns associated with battery energy storage systems.”
He said the siting council “had substantial engagement” with the Yakama Nation over a two-year period regarding impacts on traditional cultural properties. But he wants more.
He directed the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council to give the Yakama Nation an opportunity to provide further input on those mitigation measures. 
The council “should give due consideration to any input received” and should “account for this input as appropriate,” Ferguson wrote. He did not direct any specific changes be made.
Going forward, he said he wants to review the siting council’s policies and practices for tribal consultation and decide if changes are needed.
This is the second clean energy project in the past year to not pass initial muster with a Washington governor.
In May 2024, former Gov. Jay Inslee rejected the initial recommendation from the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council for the Horse Heaven wind and solar project along Interstate 82 south of the Tri-Cities.
He disagreed with conditions that effectively reduced the number of turbines in the Benton County project in half to curb threats to tribal cultural resources and endangered hawks. Inslee told the panel it had downsized the project too much and wanted revisions to get more turbines back into the project.
The council did. Inslee signed off on the revamped site certification application in October and Scout Clean Energy of Boulder, Colorado, the developer, did so in November. The project is under litigation.
Inslee spotlighted tensions incited by clean energy projects proposed in the state’s rural areas and on or near traditional tribal lands.
“We must come to grips with the fact that we will need to adapt and accept relatively moderate changes to our physical landscape, in order to ensure continued, reliable electricity service,” Inslee wrote.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/solar-panels-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-27 07:56:46.685165

After Christopher ingested concentrated green tea extract labelled as a “fat burning supplement”, his liver was compromised so severely that he nearly needed a liver transplant.
Although doctors managed to save his liver, Christopher now lives with the lasting repercussions of this incident. He can no longer exercise or engage in athletics , and even daily exertion must be limited to avoid liver strain.
While Christopher’s story is tragic, it’s far from unique. 
Over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplements, such as green tea extract, cause over 23,000 emergency room visits per year in the United States. These adverse medical events are attributed to the toxic ingredients contained in OTCs, as the FDA determined that nearly 1/5 of OTC supplements contained more than one undeclared or harmful ingredient. 
These compounds include fluoxetine, bumetanide, rimonabant, cetilistat and other chemicals linked to detrimental medical consequences. Ingredients such as bumetanide are associated with serious fluid and electrolyte loss, while compounds like cetilistat, an experimental obesity drug, have been linked to reduced serum concentrations of vitamin E,  gallstones and kidney stones. 
Thus, when individuals purchase OTC supplements, they’re purchasing these toxic ingredients too, often without even knowing it. Considering that ingredients in OTC supplements are evidently linked to organ failure and nutrient imbalance, it’s difficult to scientifically support the claim that OTC supplements have true health value. 
The existence of such OTCs on the market in Missouri is an urgent concern, as there are currently no regulations preventing children from purchasing these products. This means that in Missouri, children are legally able to purchase OTC supplements laced with toxic chemicals. 
The ease of access to these dangerous products stems from the FDA’s limited regulatory authority under the DSHEA of 1994, which classifies supplements as foods rather than drugs, meaning most can be sold without prior FDA testing. So, supplement companies can include any ingredients in OTCs and market the supplement as “fat-burning” or “muscle-building.” 
Because of these deceptive claims, more and more youth end up purchasing these products. Now, almost 1 in 10 American youth report using ineffective and harmful OTC weight-loss products.
In Missouri, this problem is quickly accelerating. 
Missouri Poison Control recorded dietary and homeopathic products as a top-10 exposure, indicating that innocent residents are using these products and facing harmful health consequences. Furthermore, OTC supplement use is contributing to a rise of eating disorders within our state, as youth who use such products are up to six times more likely to be diagnosed with an eating disorder than nonusers of OTCs. 
Already, nearly 137,922 Missourian youth will experience an eating disorder in their lifetime. That’s 9% of the Missourian youth population. Without legislative action, the number of kids purchasing dangerous OTCs will continue to increase – along with the number of eating disorder cases as well.
Leading the Missouri team with the Harvard T.H. Chan’s Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders (STRIPED), we have dedicated the past few years to raising awareness on this issue by advocating for legislation to protect Missourian children from predatory OTC supplement companies.
As teenagers, we’ve witnessed firsthand the effects of these products on our peers and friends. Adolescents across Missouri are turning to diet pills and muscle-building supplements, hoping to achieve a societal standard of beauty. Yet just like vapes, OTC products are marketed with flashy designs and false promises, causing youth to fall prey to the supplement industry. 
Not knowing the risks of OTC supplements, teens’ pursuit of “beauty”  ultimately comes at the expense of their own health.
So in the upcoming legislative session, STRIPED is working to introduce a bill in Missouri that would regulate the sale of OTC supplements to individuals under 18, the same way that vapes are regulated for sale to minors. We’ve already discussed the implications of this legislation with numerous policymakers and physicians across Missouri and acquired the formal support of the Missouri Eating Disorders Council to advance this bill. 
Our model legislation outlines our concept in practice, where employees of retail establishments that sell OTC supplements would ask consumers for age identification to ensure they are 18+ in age to directly buy OTCs. Similar protections will be implemented in online purchasing avenues. 
It’s important to recognize that our legislation would not target prescribed supplements, vitamins, or safe protein powders – only products specifically labeled for the purpose of achieving weight loss or building muscle.
In the past, opposition groups — supplement companies, generally — have argued that our bill amounts to government overreach. However, Missouri already restricts minors from buying high-risk products like tobacco and alcohol for the same reason: the dangers of these products are well-documented. Indeed, the dangers of OTC dietary and muscle building supplements are comparably well-documented too. 
Thus, STRIPED legislation is a targeted, precise safeguard that protects a group especially vulnerable to deceptive advertising and serious health consequences.
Passing this bill would also help bring Missouri up to speed with a national movement to curb the sale of misleading products to children. STRIPED’s legislation has already been passed in New York and filed in California, Texas and Washington, demonstrating widespread support for our organization’s cause. 
Furthermore, our research has bolstered the necessity of our bill, as we quantified that in Massachusetts, our legislation would prevent nearly 57,034 eating disorder cases and 46,000 additional adverse medical events over 30 years. Imagine how many cases of such conditions could be prevented in Missouri if STRIPED legislation were in effect.
We have the opportunity to lead on this issue. We need to show legislators that youth health is a top bipartisan priority in Missouri. We’ve met with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and found common ground in the need to protect our youth, but we need young people to speak up and share their stories. 
This legislation isn’t about politics. It’s about safety, accountability, and ensuring Missouri teens don’t become the next victims of an inadequately regulated industry.

Aug. 26, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz Veliz/Michigan AdvanceAmid applause and cheers from a filled room and surrounded by signs bearing his name, William Lawrence began his speech at his first campaign event in the Allen Neighborhood Center Hall in Lansing Tuesday.
The Lansing-born activist, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, and coordinator of the MI Rent Is Too Damn High coalition, Lawrence held a campaign kick-off for Michigan’s 7th Congressional District, which drew dozens of residents and supporters of all ages. Lawrence is the latest candidate to enter the race for this congressional seat in one of Michigan’s most competitive districts.
“You’re going to hear me talk throughout this speech and throughout the campaign about the basic stuff that every human being deserves: that’s good housing, good health care, good education.” Lawrence said. “And I know that we can provide that for every single person, no exceptions.”
Lawrence outlined the main focus of his campaign: housing, healthcare, education, and security, adding that people’s power and his experience and knowledge as a social activist will help him achieve those goals that are being considered in his campaign.
“People are struggling with the cost of living right now,” he continued.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Social security was a central issue raised by Lawrence and a concern shared by attendees. The progressive candidate emphasized the need for true security, clarifying that it must include food, jobs, wages, and education. The audience agreed and engaged with Lawrence when he asked how many of them had experienced this kind of insecurity.
“Real security is knowing that you can afford your groceries next month. And real security is housing security, not just having a roof over your head right now, but having the confidence that you and your family will have a good house where you can enjoy your time together next year.” Lawrence said.
Jasper Baldwin, 25, a Lansing resident, echoed Lawrence´s words and emphasized the impact of financial insecurity as his biggest concern. 
“I’ve spent my entire life unable to have that security. I’ve watched my grandparents come and go without owning property, and they would work to the day that they died to be able to afford that,” Baldwin said.
In a conversation with Michigan Advance, Lawrence discussed his plans to address the housing crisis in Lansing, saying that more affordable houses should be built and the playing field between tenants and landlords needs to be leveled. 
“Tenants don’t know what the rent will be next month or next year. That makes it impossible to build a home,” Lawrence said.

A swinging seat amid cuts
Lawrence joins other Democratic candidates on their way to the primary elections in August 2026, including Josh Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, Muhammad Salman Rais, former Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam and Michigan Army National Guard veteran Samuel Smeltzer, who goes by the name Elyon Badger. 
The winner will face off against incumbent U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in November 2026.
Lawrence took the opportunity to mention Barrett’s work in Congress, notably his support for the One Big Beautiful Bill, President Trump’s signature tax and spending measure. 
“Tom Barrett voted to throw 700,000 Michiganders off their Medicaid health insurance, 200,000 off food assistance. This is cruelty. Make no mistake, people will die because of these cuts,” Laarwence said.
“I know that we have to do more to stand up to the bullies and the billionaires who have taken over our government and stopped this assault on the working class and the poor.” Lawrence continued.
Less war, more care
Lawrence also shared with attendees his concerns regarding the tense political climate globally, mentioning China and Iran, but also Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
“I believe that we must stop arming Israel. We must stop spending our money on wars and providing billionaire tax cuts, and instead invest in the basics that actually keep us safe,” Lawrence said. 
That point of view resonated with Anuja Sudarshan, 23, a Lansing resident, who cited what she calls the genocide in Gaza as her biggest concern. 
“As a congressional district and as a country, funding the genocide in Gaza. That is probably my biggest, biggest worry right now in today’s political climate,” Sudarshan said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/164A4196-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 06:56:28.485085

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
 Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
 Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

(Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)Most of the state’s federal judges have adjourned matters before them because of a court battle over the legality of acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba’s appointment, and the delays could go on for the next few months, according to the Trump administration.
In a six-page motion filed with the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday, U.S. Department of Justice officials say New Jersey’s federal courts could grind to a halt because of a federal judge’s Aug. 21 ruling that Habba no longer has any legal authority to act as New Jersey’s chief federal prosecutor.
Even before that decision, at least 12 federal judges in the District of New Jersey postponed trials, guilty plea hearings, sentencing hearings, and more because Habba’s authority had been questioned, the letter says.
“The longer it takes to resolve these appeals, the greater the risk that still more matters will be adjourned indefinitely, contrary to the interests of the Government, defendants, and the public in the disposition of criminal cases,” the government’s letter reads.
The Trump administration and the other parties in the case concerning Habba’s appointment have asked the appeals court to hear the case in late October or early November.
President Donald Trump named Habba, his former personal attorney, as acting U.S. attorney back in March. Federal law allows for acting U.S. attorneys to serve for 120 days without U.S. Senate confirmation, but when Habba’s term was up and the Senate had yet to hear her nomination, the administration implemented a series of personnel moves in an attempt to keep her on the job for an additional 210 days.
U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, the Pennsylvania judge who heard the case because of a venue change, found in his Aug. 21 ruling that Habba’s legal appointment ended on July 1, and that she is no longer legally performing the duties of U.S. attorney. The Trump administration is appealing that ruling.

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Following a recent state Supreme Court decision that upheld legal abortion in Wisconsin, medical students and health care professionals say Wisconsin laws and the Trump administration attacks on reproductive health still make care inaccessible for many patients and that physicians still face significant challenges in providing care.
In July, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled invalid an 1849 criminal law that had halted abortion care in the state for over a year following the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that revived previously unenforceable abortion bans on the books in many states. In its 4-3 decision, the Court found the law had effectively been repealed by other laws passed after it. 
During a Tuesday panel discussion hosted by the advocacy organization Free & Just, Dr. Abigail Cutler, a practicing OB/GYN at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine & Public Health, said the decision provided a “reason to celebrate” but ultimately it brought the state “back to a pretty low bar.” 
“We have just a slew of abortion restrictions on the books that pre-dated Dobbs that make it really, really difficult to access care if you’re a patient and to provide care if you’re a provider,” Cutler said, adding that the decision also doesn’t prohibit the state Legislature from potentially passing an abortion ban in the future. “Our right to access abortion in our state and to provide it freely is not protected.” 
Some Wisconsin laws restricting abortion include a 22-week ban, a requirement that patients have two, in-person visits with a physician, a mandatory ultrasound, a prohibition on telehealth abortion care and a parental consent requirement for minors seeking an abortion. Wisconsin, in line with federal law, prohibits its state Medicaid program from covering abortions except in limited circumstances. 
Amy Williamson, associate director of the Collaborative for Reproductive Equity, a research initiative at UW-Madison, said the state law prohibiting telehealth related to abortion isn’t based in science. 
“There’s plenty of studies that indicate that abortions can be provided safely and effectively through telehealth, whether it’s the consultation you could do by telehealth, or you can provide a medication abortion by telehealth,” Williamson said. “If we were able to change that, we know that we could expand access to care in the state, like with other health care services.”
Cutler said the “most insidious restriction” to her is the restrictions on insurance coverage for abortion care.
“If you cannot pay for the care that you need, then you’re not going to get the care. You’re going to choose to provide food for your kids, you’re going to choose to keep going to your job and not taking time off from work,” Cutler said. 
In addition to state restrictions, the Trump administration has been targeting abortion care on a federal level.
Trump’s recent megabill approved this summer included a provision to prohibit Planned Parenthood from accessing Medicaid payments. 
The Hyde Amendment has long banned the use of federal dollars to pay for abortion care, but the new provision went further by banning federal support for nonprofit facilities that provide abortions using separate funds. The provision has been challenged in court, though a federal judge recently ruled in favor of the administration.
Williamson called Planned Parenthood a “really critical part of the economic safety net,” noting that about one in five women of reproductive age who are on Medicaid get their care at Planned Parenthood. 
Williamson said that given the array of services, cuts would also mean further consequences.
“This leads to a decrease in contraceptive use, an increase of undesired pregnancies, undetected and untreated STIs and less opportunities to identify cancer early,” Williamson said. “We can be doing better. It’s not rocket science.” 
“When Planned Parenthood is targeted, it is because they provide abortions,” Cutler added. “In the state of Wisconsin, they are also one of the largest providers of non-abortion care, preventative and reproductive health services to so many people in our state … so that’s really concerning, and it’s why a lot of people are referring to that bill as a backdoor abortion ban.”
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), who moderated the panel, said abortion bans “do not stop abortion… but what they do do is they kill women, and they make all of us vulnerable to not receiving the medical care that we need.” She said it’s important to continue conversations about changes that need to be made, though state-level bills to protect access may be in limbo under split government.
Roys and her Democratic colleagues introduced a bill earlier this year that would repeal many of the abortion restrictions on Wisconsin’s books. 
“I think these bills are unlikely to advance until we have elections and new leadership in the Capitol,” Roys said during the panel. 
Republicans currently hold majorities in the Assembly and Senate in Wisconsin, though control will be up for grabs in the 2026 elections. The governor’s office is also an open race with the retirement of Gov. Tony Evers.
Roys told the Examiner after the panel that she is “very likely” to enter the 2026 race for governor and she thinks reproductive health could be one motivating issue for voters come next year.
“In a time when reproductive freedom is threatened, people want someone who is a champion and not mealymouthed. This is a popular issue, and it’s a really important economic issue,” Roys said. 
Roys said Democrats are also planning to introduce several other reproductive health bills this fall. Those include one to help with infertility coverage, one to ensure young people have access to “medically accurate, age-appropriate, comprehensive information to help them make healthy choices throughout their lives, especially with respect to sexuality and reproduction” and one to help protect people from being prosecuted for certain outcomes in pregnancy.
“We have seen pregnancy criminalization around the country — people being arrested, jailed, prosecuted for having miscarriages,” Roys said, adding that it is personal to her as someone who has had a miscarriage. “This is a known and intended outcome of abortion bans is for our pregnancies, our periods to be policed.” 
The panel also discussed how restrictions in Wisconsin are affecting the state’s health care workforce. 
Cutler spoke about research she worked on that focused on 21 OB-GYNs working under the 1849 law, which had an exception for the life of the mother, before there was a final decision invalidating that felony abortion ban. 
“It was really alarming because participant after participant described how difficult it was to interpret this vague, ambiguous law into their medical practice,” Cutler said. “As a result, there were wide, wide variations in the kind of care being provided to patients presenting with the exact same problem.”
According to a CORE brief, some OB-GYNs had contemplated leaving the state due to restrictions, though most expressed a commitment to staying in Wisconsin in part because they felt responsible for their community. 
Cutler said the data is mixed when it comes to the specific effects of restrictions on the workforce, but pointed to recent research from University of Illinois-Champaign that found that targeted regulations of abortion providers are associated with significant decreases in the density of OB-GYNs. 
“This study suggests that these providers are just retiring. They’re stopping practice all together, not even leaving the states where they’re restricted,” Cutler said. “That’s also a problem because you’re diminishing the workforce.”
Cutler said the restrictions in Wisconsin are also at the top of mind for medical students
“What are the restrictions in Wisconsin? Am I going to be able to get abortion training in Wisconsin?” Cutler said she’s asked. “It’s difficult to reassure people of the stability of the landscape when so much feels uncertain and again tied to political whims and election outcomes that are not completely within our control.
Cutler noted that there has been a decrease in residency applications at the UW OB/GYN residency program since the Dobbs decision in 2022. According to a CORE brief on the OB-GYN workforce, Wisconsin witnessed an 8% drop in applications for OB/GYN residency training programs in 2023 and a 10% drop in 2024.
Morgan Homme, a member of Medical Students for Choice UW-Madison, said she constantly thinks about whether she wants to do her residency and practice in Wisconsin. 
“It’s a hard choice and a hard thing, you have to grapple with,” Homme said. “I grew up here, and all my family is here, and I do like it. I do love the state, but if they’re not going to allow me to practice the way that I want, the full scope of care, then why would I limit myself to that and limit my training?”

A series of events, beginning Thursday in Salt Lake City and ending Tuesday in Rock Springs, revisit the past to honor the memories of the workers killed in 1885.
The post A Wyoming town massacred its Chinese workers 140 years ago. Descendants returned to dig for the Chinatown ‘burn layer’ appeared first on WyoFile .","ROCK SPRINGS—A short drive from Main Street in Rock Springs, two rectangular holes, about 4 feet deep, form a checkerboard pattern in a grassy lawn. The green space, which connects a Slovenian Catholic church with a playground, has attracted a trickle of visitors from all over the country this summer to this small city in southwestern Wyoming.
Inside the holes, six Grinnell College researchers are digging, scraping and screening the soil. Most have never been to Wyoming before. 
They’re looking for artifacts from 140 years ago, when a mob burned down what was once Chinatown in Rock Springs. In the violence, the mob killed 28 Chinese migrant workers and injured another 14, making it one of the most violent bouts of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history.
In 1885, labor tensions had boiled over in the Union Pacific Railroad’s coal mines, stemming from an argument over who had the best work opportunities. The mob, many of them also migrants, blamed the Chinese. The mob burned several blocks that once made up homes and shops full of imported goods, later razed to the ground and redeveloped. 
“[Because of this], there’s going to be a layer that is very distinctive in the archaeological record,” said Laura Ng, the Iowa-based archaeology professor leading the dig. 
That layer is what’s known as the “burn layer” and it’s where Ng’s team is concentrating its efforts. Here they have found artifacts, ranging from pottery shards, animal bones, an ornamental door handle and a wooden beam from an old building foundation.
Grinnell College student Jorge Salinas holds one of his favorite finds from the dig: an escutcheon, or an elaborate and ornamental design for a late 19th or early 20th-century door handle. Pottery shards, often for vases that held imported food from China, are one of the more commonly found artifacts. (Jenna McMurtry/KHOL)
These artifacts tell the researchers what life was like in the 19th-century Chinatown for migrant workers, each of whom had a foot in two vastly different worlds. For many of the Chinese, work was in Wyoming and family in China. Not necessarily a personal choice, this was more of a reflection of federal immigration laws at the time restricting Chinese immigration.  
“Railroads and Chinese-American communities go sort of hand-in-hand, but also discrimination, segregation,” Ng said. 
Existing anti-Chinese sentiment built on the federal Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, she added, and likely stirred the mob.   
Descendants join the dig 
Despite spending most of their youth in Rock Springs, Grace and Ricky Leo only learned later in life about the massacre — and that they have ties to it. 
“We didn’t know that we were related to the people that died in the massacre,” Grace said, during the Leos’ recent return to Rock Springs to join the dig. 
Although the couple now calls Thousand Oaks, California, home, they’ve learned more about their family’s multigenerational ties to their hometown in recent years. The massacre was not something the Leos learned about in school.
At a 2019 event commemorating the 150th anniversary of the transcontinental railroad, the Leos met Rock Springs archaeologist and Western Wyoming Community College professor emeritus Dudley Gardner. 
“I didn’t realize there were so many members of my family that were here.” Ricky Leo
Gardner helped the Leos learn that Ricky’s father, a World War II veteran and owner of a Rock Springs Chinese-American restaurant, wasn’t the only Leo immigrant to make a life in Wyoming. Rather, it was a trend that spanned generations in the Leo family and dated back to the 1870s. 
“That was very surprising,” Ricky said. “I didn’t realize there were so many members of my family that were here.” 
That large number resulted from Ricky’s ancestors recruiting relatives to come work in Rock Springs. 
Of the 28 killed in the massacre, 13 of them are from the Leo clan in China. His great-uncle was one of the survivors. 
Two Rock Springs history museums mention the massacre in exhibits, though the Leos said some of it is incomplete. One suggests that there are no Chinese descendants from the massacre left in Rock Springs.
“We have to let them know that there are still descendants here,” Ricky said. 
Whenever the Leos are in Rock Springs, they spend time keeping up Ricky’s late father’s home, which is still in the family. The Leos will return to Rock Springs this weekend to participate in a 140th commemoration to remember the massacre. 
The commemoration begins Thursday in Salt Lake City with a visit to the Chinese railroad workers monument at the Utah State Capitol and then tours through Evanston and Rock Springs to visit historic sites and bless ancestors at the Chinese cemetery in Rock Springs. The event will culminate Tuesday morning with an 8:30 a.m. public dedication of a statue, designed by David Alan Clark, to honor the lives and memories of the miners killed in the 1885 massacre. 
“The designer asked if I would be the model for the statue,” Ricky Leo said. “It’s an honor to represent the Leo family.”   
In 2019, Ricky Leo was 61, and his wife Grace was 56, when they first learned about a massacre that roiled their town over a century ago. Now the two are organizing an event to highlight this past. (Jenna McMurtry/KHOL)
Rock Springs’ immigration past and present
The Chinese weren’t the only migrant workers drawn to Rock Springs. The Union Pacific Railroad turned Rock Springs into a company town, pushing recruitment efforts all over the globe and earning the town the motto “Home of 56 nationalities.”
Every year since 1924, the town has held “International Day,” one of Wyoming’s only multicultural festivals, honoring the town’s long heritage of attracting migrants. These days, Rock Springs’ penchant for industry still attracts immigrants, though today the draw has changed and the migrants are less diverse. The railroad tracks still stand, but most travel by car on Interstate 80. Coal mining has also given way to trona. 
The 2020 census shows that of the nearly 25,000 inhabitants of Rock Springs today, 60% identify as white and 18.7% Hispanic. Only a couple hundred Asian-Americans live there today. 
Rock Springs isn’t isolated from the growing national crackdown on immigrants, and in some regards, is driving it. The sheriff’s department in Sweetwater County, home to Rock Springs, became one of the earliest in the country to adopt a contract to work on behalf of ICE in 2020. Under the second Trump administration, it upped its commitment to adopt all three possible types of contracts. 
Four other Wyoming counties have followed suit, along with the Highway Patrol. Gov. Mark Gordon recently confirmed that the Wyoming National Guard will soon join immigration enforcement.
With the recent intensification in immigration policy, Ng described what she sees as a parallel from the past to the present: a system that lures migrants to drive the local economy without making it easy to stay. Instead, she sees migrants “villainized” and “criminalized.” A recent analysis of Wyoming data shows most immigrants arrested by ICE this year have no criminal backgrounds.
Even today, the Leos said some, including other descendants, would rather avoid talking about the massacre. Ng has heard similarly.
“Some people want to say ‘Get over it, it happened in the past,’” she said. “Why revisit something that makes America look bad?”
For Ng, the answer is simple. 
“It seems like we don’t learn from history,” Ng said.

Columnist Rod Miller spins a cautionary cowboy tale about the dangers of government censorship.
The post Smut around the ol’ campfire appeared first on WyoFile .","Night dropped its curtain around the cow camp as dusty cowboys wandered back from a tough day on the trail. Cookie had the fire going and beans simmering, and the tuckered crew took a load off in the firelight.

Opinion

“Say, where’s Panhandle?” Sweetwater Slim asked, looking around for his absent pard.
Cookie stirred the frijoles and answered, “Some o’ them Freedom Caucus ICE mercenaries come into camp this mornin’ after you left, an’ they clapped him in irons an’ hauled him off to the hoosegow.”
Puzzled looks regarded Cookie from the circle of dusty faces. Hoolihan spoke up, “You mean them Freedom Caucus gomers an’ border guard goons? Hell, Panhandle was born an’ raised here in this country, jest on t’other side o’ the Freezeout Mountains. He ain’t never set foot outta the county ‘cept that one time he went to the Stock Show in Denver an’ come back with a dose o’ clap. What the hell?”
“It was quite a fracas this mornin’,” Cookie said as he stroked his greasy beard and told the tale. “They come bustin’ in here while I was doin’ dishes. Wearin’ them camo Meal Team Six uniforms with ICE on the back. Armed to the goddam teeth. Said they was lookin’ fer dirty books.”
This information made a couple of the grizzled old trail hands a bit nervous.
“They caught Little Joe back behind a greasewood bush, givin’ a tattered ol’ copy o’ Hustler a purty good look-see. Them fellers beat the hell outa poor Joe, bear-sprayed him an’ whatnot, ‘til he told ‘em he stole it outta Panhandle’s bedroll.”
This got the attention of the cowhands. Little Joe was a favorite saddle pal, and the whole crew doted on him. They taught him cowboy tricks, like how to get bucked off into cactus.
Cookie proceeded with his yarn. “Then they started pullin’ out his fingernails, tryin’ to get Joe to tell ‘em how old he was. When he told ‘em he was 16, they quit beatin’ on ‘im an’ commenced to whuppin’ up on Panhandle. Then they drug him off to El Salvador or Uganda or god-knows-where. They said they’s gonna ransack the library while they was in town, an’ have a book burnin’.”

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
“How’s Joe?” a voice from the smoke asked.
“He’s gonna live,” Cookie replied. “He’s over yonder under the chuckwagon tryin’ to stop the bleedin’ but he’s gonna be OK.” He gave the cauldron another stir. “But I’m a tad worried ‘bout Panhandle. Them goons said he was in a passel o’ trouble for corruptin’ a minor, distributin’ pornography to kids, bein’ a librul an’ a bunch o’ other crimes. I think they said treason, too. It’s all written down on this here paper.”
Cookie waved an official-looking document in the firelight. “Says here the Freedom Caucus is gonna burn every dirty book in Wyoming, an’ if anyone gets in their way, there’ll be hell to pay.”
Goshen Gus nodded his noggin, and said with more than a smidgen of sarcasm, “They got a point. We cain’t have them town kids gettin’ all horny by readin’ ‘bout kissin’ an’ huggin’ an’ whatnot. Who knows what they’ll end up doin’. Maybe wear lipstick, steal hubcaps, or molest the sheep or some damn thing.”
“Hold yer horses there, Gus.” Deacon from Dayton exhorted. “We gotta get this country back to a Bible-believin’ outfit. Iff’n kids can read all that racy stuff in libraries an’ school, they’ll stop comin’ to church to read the true Word.”
Deacon paused his sermon long enough to reach into his saddlebag and haul out a well-thumbed copy of the King James Bible. “Here’s the kinda stuff we should be teachin’ our young ‘uns. He took a deep breath, then read all eight chapters of the Song of Solomon to the congregated cowboys.
As Deacon read his turgid Old Testament lesson, smoke swirled around the campfire, making the crew’s eyes burn. Grizzled old broncpeelers squirmed on the ground, and a few fanned their flushed faces with stiff Stetsons.
The Trail Boss sauntered into the campfire light just as Deacon closed his Bible and the trail crew got to their feet to hightail it out into the gathering darkness.
“Where y’all goin’?” Trail Boss queried.
Panhandle hollered over his shoulder as he dashed into the darkening gloom, “We’re gonna hide out down to the gully, an’ make ourselves scarce. Them Freedom Caucus ICE goons is comin’ for Deacon next fer what he just read, and we don’t want ‘em arrestin’ us too. It ain’t gonna be purty.”

The mayors of Carlentini and Omaha had already signed an official “twinning” agreement last year when Mayor Giuseppe Stefio was in Omaha. But Saturday’s ceremony marked Carlentini’s turn to celebrate on its turf, among its 17,000 residents.
The event coincided with Carlentini’s 404th Santa Lucia festival and another Omaha-related highlight: the dedication of a Carlentini amphitheater named in honor of the late Omaha City Councilman Sebastian “Subby” Anzaldo. 
 ‘Breathtaking’ setting 

Anzaldo was born in Omaha in 1933 to Carlentini immigrants Antonio and Lucia (Vacirca) Anzaldo, who were among the earliest waves of Italians to settle in the city where Subby eventually rose to be an interim mayor. 
“The City Council chose to name the modern amphitheater after Subby Anzaldo, son of Carlentini,” Stefio said, noting the project site’s “breathtaking” scenic setting near Mount Etna and Lake Lentini. “The location of this structure offers the same view that the ancient Greeks, the city’s founders, saw from the Greek theater that once stood in the ancient city.”
A mayoral spokesman told the Nebraska Examiner that Carlentini in recent years has funded a series of urban redevelopment projects, including the revival of old buildings and parks. He said that many of those monuments have been named after Carlentini citizens “deserving of public recognition.”

Stefio wanted to name the new 500-seat amphitheater, which is under construction outside a newly renovated cultural center, after a “successful performer and entrepreneur” whose roots are in Carlentini. The mayoral spokesman said Anzaldo, who died in 2019 at age 86, “fits the bill.” 
Anzaldo was a musician and entertainment agent who brought star power to Omaha that included Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. Stefio said he has been impressed as well by Anzaldo’s lengthy public service and builder of housing for inner-city Omaha populations.
Among those participating in the amphitheater dedication — as well as a related concert featuring Subby Anzaldo Jr. and other Omaha performers — was an official Omaha Sister Cities Association delegation of about 30 people. Members of the Anzaldo family also were present, as were about 20 other guests from Nebraska.

OSCA president Steve Gerdes and City Council President Pete Festersen, who represented the City of Omaha, were part of the contingent that toured landmarks and were recognized at various events.
“It’s a great cultural exchange and friendship we have between these communities — the history is amazing,” said Festersen. Guests paid their own travel expenses, he said.
 Salerno brothers

Gerdes during one presentation offered a brief history of the relationship between the two cities, which dates back to around 1900, when Carlentini’s Salerno brothers, Joseph and Sebastiano, started recruiting workers to make the trek across the Atlantic Ocean to America.
Many of the Italian immigrants took railroad and packing plant jobs, and many settled in a neighborhood around Sixth and Pierce Streets near today’s downtown Omaha. 











They moved into the area that Omaha knows as Little Italy — but perhaps really should be known as Little Sicily or Little Carlentini.


– Steve Gerdes, president of Omaha Sister Cities Association



“They moved into the area that Omaha knows as Little Italy — but perhaps really should be known as Little Sicily or Little Carlentini,” Gerdes said, drawing applause from the group.
Today about two-thirds of Italian Americans living in the Omaha area have ancestral ties to Carlentini, he said. 
Rosetta Nastasi of Carlentini Omaha Association USA emigrated herself in the 1960s to Omaha and stayed about 14 years before returning to Carlentini, where she now lives. She said her experience helped her professionally and culturally, and she gave a shoutout to immigrants past and present.
“With the spirit of sacrifice, (they) left their homeland and began a new life in the USA, a land that still gives great opportunities,” Nastasi said.

Gerdes described the Carlentini signing ceremony as a reaffirmation of the sister city pact signed in Omaha in summer of 2024. A “friendship agreement” was formed a few years earlier, in 2021, as a step toward what he calls the sister city “twinning.”
Carlentini was Omaha’s eighth sister city, following similar pairings with places such as Shizuoka, Japan (the first, in 1965), Naas, Ireland and Xalapa, Mexico. A ninth bond was formed this summer with Jamestown, Ghana, in Africa.
Such partnerships lead to business, education, civic and social exchanges. 
 Small world 

In Carlentini, the town has named a park after Omaha: Parco Omaha. The City of Omaha, in turn, installed a “Carlentini Plaza” at one of its parks near downtown in the Little Italy neighborhood.
Educational, real estate and other projects between the two cities are growing. More family relationships are being discovered; friendships between residents are deepening.
Common to both Carlentini and Omaha is the Santa Lucia Festival. Omaha just held its 101st annual festival honoring Saint Lucy, a tradition started by immigrant Grazia Bonafede Caniglia, who came to Omaha from Carlentini in 1900. She wanted to recreate her hometown’s Santa Lucia Festival as a way for her ethnic enclave to maintain ties with their heritage.

Omahans increasingly are making the pilgrimage to Sicily for the summer festival and to reconnect with distant relatives they’ve grown to know better through social media and other groups formed over the past few years.
“I say thank you to all the people and the new generations for keeping alive the Sicilian culture,” said Nastasi.
Omahans Sarita “Sarah” Ruma and Todd Procopio, pausing their trip to talk to a reporter, spoke fondly about small world connections they feel when visiting the towns of Carlentini and neighboring Lentini.
They had just stopped in a coffee shop and a young man asked where they were from. Their response lit up his face, Ruma said, as they all realized he had relatives in Omaha. 
“I mean we’re 5,200 miles away, having coffee and taking a picture with somebody we know’s nephew,” said Ruma. “It gave us all goosebumps.”
Ruma is a co-president of the Sons and Daughters of Italy and Procopio represents the Santa Lucia Festival Committee and the Sicula Italia Foundation. The three organizations are active in the Omaha area’s Italian American community and the sister city partnership.

They said the amphitheater tribute to Anzaldo is another link.
“It’s one more really cool thing to connect us with Carlentini,” said Ruma. “It’s  another family. Another reason. It’s just another connection to our traditions and heritage.”
 Anzaldo arrival, 1913

The Anzaldo tie goes back to 1913, when Subby’s father, Antonio, migrated to Omaha and opened a shoe shop in South Omaha. Antonio at the time was married to Carlentini native Giavannina DeFilippo and the pair had two children.
Mother and daughter passed away, and Antonio, according to family history, returned to Carlentini and married Lucia Vacirca.
The family returned to Omaha and had three more children, including Subby, who attended St. Peter’s Catholic grade school and church. He’d take the streetcar after school to his dad’s shoe store, absorbing the entrepreneurial spirit.

Subby learned to play the clarinet and saxophone and became a member of several bands before joining the Eddy Haddad Orchestra. He also played in Omaha’s Santa Lucia marching band.
Marriage to Janice Kipp led to five children. Most now live in Omaha, a few having returned to be near their mom after launching entertainment-related careers on the West Coast. An extended family network also is in Omaha. 
Over the years, Subby returned a few times to Carlentini and donated to local churches. He went there once for his sister’s wedding, and another time for Christmas after meeting son Terry, who was in Rome related to his job with Madonna and the premier of her movie Evita.

As a theatrical booking agent, Subby Anzaldo signed artists to perform at county fairs and concerts. While serving as president of the Omaha Musicians Union, he hired the orchestra to play locally for acts including Elvis Presley, Diana Ross and Barry Manilow.
Anzaldo later served on city boards including Planning and Parks & Recreation and was a three-term councilman in the late 1980s and 1990s, stepping up for about four months of that time to be interim mayor when another mayor resigned. He also served as a liaison between the City Council and Mayor Hal Daub.
Three months before he passed, the City of Omaha renamed South Omaha’s Columbus Park Community Center in honor of him. 
Son Terry Anzaldo, who spoke at the Carlentini dedication, said his dad never missed an opportunity to talk about his roots and remained involved with numerous cultural groups including the Italian-American Heritage Society. He said his dad was a proud family man who loved public service. 
Of the dedication, he said, “This is, in fact, the honor of his life.”

(Photo: Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation)Environmental groups say they plan to sue Wilson County’s wastewater authority over a Mount Juliet facility that state records show has repeatedly violated state rules and discharged polluted wastewater into a tributary of the Cumberland River.
The wastewater treatment system serves about 89 homes in the Ridgewater Estates and Camelot Cove subdivisions. It funnels sewage into a sand and UV filter before piping remaining wastewater into a “drip field,” where it is meant to be dispersed over a large area to allow soil to act as a natural filter.
But the Ridgewater facility has repeatedly oversaturated its drip field in the last five years, using only a third of the land its permit stipulates, according to a Notice of Intent to Sue letter sent on Aug. 6 by the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of the Tennessee Scenic Rivers Association and the Sierra Club. This led wastewater to form pools covered in “mats of algae and slimes,” one state inspection recorded in March 2021. 
In April of this year, inspection reports noted wastewater flowing through an unpermitted, freshly dug trench discharging into a tributary of the Cumberland River — something the environmental groups say violates the federal Clean Water Act. Samples taken from the tributary downstream from the wastewater discharge showed levels of E. coli and other pollutants that exceed Tennessee and Environmental Protection Agency recreational standards, according to the letter.
The notice letter informs the Water and Wastewater Authority of Wilson County (the wastewater system’s owner), Adenus Operations, LLC (the system’s operator), the EPA and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation of a pending federal lawsuit, which can be filed 60 days after the letter was sent.
The wastewater authority contends that the trench is a recently cleaned existing storm water drainage ditch, and that high E. coli levels are coming from another source in the area. Adenus did not respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit will seek an injunction to halt any continued violations and seek civil penalties of up to $68,445 per day for each violation, according to the letter. The Tennessee Scenic Rivers Association and Sierra Club allege that the site has violated the Clean Water Act every day since August 2020 by discharging wastewater into the tributary — considered waters of Tennessee and the United States — without a permit to do so.
State regulator’s records chronicle ongoing issues
TDEC began issuing permits for “decentralized drip dispersal systems” — the type of wastewater system used at the Ridgewater site — in the 1990s. Its lack of reliance on existing sewer infrastructure makes this type of system favorable for developments in rural areas, the letter states.
There are about 374 permitted drip dispersal systems in Tennessee today, and TDEC found in a 2024 survey that more than half of the 360 sites in active use did not comply with their permits. Overloading soil with wastewater — leading to polluted runoff onto other land or bodies of water — was one of the most noted problems.
The Ridgewater site first obtained a permit for the wastewater system in March 2018. The permit prohibits ponding and wastewater discharge to any surface waters. It also requires maintenance, sampling and reporting throughout the life of the site. 
The Ridgewater site’s permit shows plans to spread the wastewater onto a 6-acre drip field, but state inspections show the site uses only about two acres. 
TDEC conducted multiple site visits from March 2021 through May 2025, noting “significant ponding,” issues with the sand filter, “large areas of algae growth,” a lack of fencing around the area (something that was promised in the site’s permit applications), and foul odors, all in close proximity to homes. 
  A state inspector photographed marshy land near homes at the Ridgewater wastewater treatment site in Mount Juliet, Tenn. on Jan. 8, 2024. (Photo: Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation)
The regulator issued two notices of violation to the Wilson County wastewater authority and Adenus in 2021 and 2024. The wastewater authority responded with its plans to fix the sand filter and drip field system to stop ponding and keep water on the site. They also stated that the drip field should be 3.5 acres, though the original paperwork showed more than 6 acres.
A TDEC inspector’s most recent visit on May 2 revealed the fresh trench, which contained water, foam and a “moderate sulfuric odor,” though the inspector noted it was “unclear if the water flowing in the channel was draining from an adjacent lowland or being discharged from the sand filter.”
Chris Leauber, executive director of the Wilson County wastewater authority, told Tennessee Lookout that the trench is a storm water drainage ditch that was cleaned to prevent storm water from the subdivision from flowing onto the property. Leauber sent a photograph of the apparently dry ditch dated Aug. 12. 
He also stated that E. coli levels taken on April 23 as part of the site’s quarterly report were within state requirements, one day before the samples from the tributary showed higher levels of E. coli.
The wastewater authority takes its mandatory samples from the discharge before it is distributed to the drip field.
“Therefore, the high E. coli levels of concern may be coming from other sources,” Leauber wrote.
Similar reports of putrid smells, slime and algae in river tributaries near wastewater treatment sites have likewise spurred legal action from environmental groups seeking stronger oversight.
The Water Authority of Dickson County settled a lawsuit with the Harpeth Conservancy in September 2023, requiring the public utility to clean up Trace Creek and change its operating procedures to stop future pollution.
In November 2024, Tennessee Riverkeepers sued the Town of Celina, alleging that officials allowed sewage overflows to be discharged into Cordell Hull Lake and the Cumberland and Obey Rivers, violating the Clean Water Act and Tennessee law.

(Photo courtesy of Dennis Neumann, United Tribes Technical College)United Tribes Technical College on Sept. 5 will hold a dedication ceremony for a new monument honoring the memory of Japanese Americans who were imprisoned there during World War II.
During the war, the U.S. government incarcerated more than 100,000 people of Japanese descent. Some were held in military posts like Fort Lincoln, which would later be converted into United Tribes Technical College in the late 1960s.
Almost 2,000 Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Fort Lincoln beginning during the 1940s.
Through the Snow Country Prison Japanese American Internment Memorial, United Tribes and Japanese American historians hope to call attention to what incarcerated families suffered and how they resisted persecution by the U.S. government, the college’s website for the memorial notes.
It’s also meant to recognize the common experience shared by Japanese Americans and Indigenous communities who faced forced removal and oppression by the United States.
“The Snow Country Prison Memorial is our story as well as the Native American story,” Satsuki Ina, who helped plan the site, said in a promotional video for the monument. Ina’s father, Itaru, was incarcerated at Fort Lincoln in 1945 and 1946.
The monument gets its name from a haiku poem Itaru wrote while he was there.
“The war is over but I’m still in a snow country prison,” the haiku reads.
The memorial was designed by MASS Design Group, a nonprofit architecture firm, and funded through private donations and a grant from the National Park Service.
The firm worked with a committee that included Japanese American historians and activists to plan the space.
“They put definition to the design,” said Joseph Kunkel, a designer for MASS who helped lead the project.

The monument incorporates both Japanese and Native American design elements.
The inside walls of the memorial will display the names of the 1,850 Japanese Americans imprisoned at the military post. In the middle, it features a drum circle shaped like an Indigenous medicine wheel. The site is meant to be a place for community building and collective healing, Kunkel said.
The design of the monument was also inspired by kintsugi, the Japanese art of using gold to repair broken pottery. The walls incorporate old slate tiles that once lined the roofs of the buildings where Japanese Americans were incarcerated, for example.
The dedication is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. Sept. 5 in the courtyard behind the college’s Education Building.
Ina will speak during the ceremony. Afterwards, she will also host a signing for her new book about her family during the World War II era titled “The Poet and the Silk Girl.”
The Rev. Duncan Ryūken Williams, a Sōtō Zen Buddhist priest and member of the memorial committee, will offer a blessing.
Williams led a project to create a book memorializing the names of 125,284 people of Japanese ancestry incarcerated in the United States during the war. The book, called the Ireichō, will be on display at the United Tribes Technical College library on Sept. 5 and 6.
Additionally, the ceremony will feature a Native drumming group, as well as a drumming and dance performance by Ensō Daiko, a group from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, according to a news release from the college.
Dancers from Ai Dance Theater of New York City will also perform.
Afterwards, at 3:30 p.m., United Tribes will host a screening of “Defiant to the Last,” a documentary about Japanese Americans who pushed back against their persecution by the U.S. government during the war.
The dedication coincides with the United Tribes Technical College’s 55th annual International Powwow.

Lisa Hortman, who was killed in a politically motivated shooting in June, at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston this month. The shooting has caused many state lawmakers to reconsider the costs and value of public service. (Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.
Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

‘Hold people accountable’
Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.











I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat



During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
‘What is your why?’
Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

Bill Lee said at a Tuesday press conference that he does not plan to deploy National Guard troops to Tennessee cities. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee isn’t considering deploying National Guard personnel to Tennessee cities for law enforcement or accepting federal troops to patrol Memphis, despite a presidential order.
“We have no plans to put the National Guard there now,” Lee said Tuesday.
Lee told reporters he believes President Donald Trump “made a smart decision” to combat crime in Washington, D.C., and major cities nationwide with National Guard troops, including 160 personnel from Tennessee.
But the governor said the state made “significant investments” to stem crime in Memphis, including spending $150 million in grant funds and increasing Tennessee Highway Patrol enforcement with help from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Marshals Service and local agencies. He added that a report he received Tuesday morning showed crime is down 15% in Memphis, though he didn’t specify a time frame.
In light of those efforts, he said he has no plans to send the military into Memphis or other cities, even though Trump reportedly said troops should be sent to Memphis and signed an executive order creating a quick strike force to go into the nation’s largest cities to combat crime.
Tennessee National Guard to join D.C. police order

“We’ve had no conversations with the president or his team about National Guard in Memphis. We have targeted our efforts and our communications with those federal agencies. I even spoke this morning with an FBI official about our efforts in Memphis and Shelby County and how they’re working. So that’s where we are today,” Lee said.
Lee recently activated Guard personnel to handle logistical and clerical work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enable more federal agents to concentrate on immigrant deportation. In addition, he sent state troops to Washington, D.C., last week in response to Trump’s request for increased patrols in the nation’s capital.
The president’s Monday order allows Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to set up a “quick reaction force” for national deployment and directs National Guard units to be ready to help local, state and federal law enforcement in stopping civil disturbances and “ensuring public safety.” Asked Tuesday if he would consider deploying Guard personnel for law enforcement in Tennessee cities such as Memphis and Nashville, Lee said, “There are no circumstances that currently exist that we believe warrant that, so we’re not talking about that right now. It’s not a consideration for us right now.”
Democratic leaders nationwide have criticized moves by the president and Republican governors to use the military for civilian law enforcement. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed suit against the president for deploying National Guard troops and the Marines to Los Angeles.

Aimed at preventing sexual harassment and exploitation, the laws allow an individual depicted in a sexual or intimate context within a deepfake image or video to take civil action for its creation and distribution. They can file the case confidentially.

Courts can also issue a restraining order or permanent injunction to prevent further harm to the person filing the suit. The court can also impose a maximum civil fine of $1,000 daily for violating the order.
Additionally, the laws set penalties for the creation and distribution of a harmful intimate deepfake, with first time offenders facing a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison and/or a maximum fine of $3,000. Repeat offenders will face a felony, punishable by three years in prison and/or a fine of  $5,000.

Internet service providers, telecommunications networks and educational or library systems that provide access to content created by another person are not held liable under the law, nor are the providers and developers of the technology used to create an intimate deepfake.
“As a county prosecutor, I went after people who used their power to prey on others,” Whitmer said. “Now, as governor, I’m proud to sign these bipartisan bills into law, so we can protect Michiganders from this rising form of sexual exploitation. I’ll keep working with anyone to protect Michiganders from blackmail or retribution, because no one should have to live in fear.”
Bierlein said the laws will protect the dignity and privacy of Michigan citizens and provide victims with the tools needed to seek justice.

“Technology should be used to improve lives, not to exploit them – and today we’ve taken an important step to ensure that,” Bierlein said in a statement. 
Tsernoglou said the bills mark the beginning of a long bumpy road the state faces in regulating artificial intelligence.

Lisa Cutter and Jeff Bridges on the Senate floor in the Colorado Capitol on Aug. 24, 2025. (Photo by Sara Wilson)Colorado lawmakers will take up the task — once again — to tweak the state’s artificial intelligence regulations during the regular lawmaking term next year, after negotiations on the policy broke down during the special session and they decided to extend the existing AI law’s start date.
They will have until June 30 to change the law or allow it to go into effect, which many at the Capitol are not keen to do.
“We care about our constituents being treated fairly, having access to opportunities and we care about our constituents’ privacy, their data and their knowledge of where that goes,” said Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat. “I just want to remind us of that so when we continue to have these conversations, we orient on that.”

“I’m asking that with this delay, we come together to solve this problem because we have committed to lead and respect our constituents,” she added.
The state’s AI law, passed in 2024, included guardrails to mitigate the risk of discrimination when companies use AI systems to make big decisions related to housing, finances and education. It requires risk assessments and disclosures of when AI is being used for those decisions and allows the attorney general’s office to enforce the law and levy fines.
As soon as the ink was dry, however, business groups and the tech industry raised concerns about a chilling effect on innovation and the costs of implementation once the law went into effect, originally set for February 2026.
An issue task force met for about a year to find compromise and bring a policy tweak during the regular session earlier this year, but negotiations fell through and lawmakers adjourned in May without changing anything. Gov. Jared Polis then included AI in his call for this special session, which was primarily to solve a billion-dollar revenue shortfall caused by federal tax code changes.
Two competing AI bills were introduced during the special session to change how the law would operate. One was crafted by the 2024 law’s architects, including Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat, while the other was backed by a bipartisan, more moderate group of lawmakers. Both bills were eventually whittled down to simple delay the original law’s effective date.
Rodriguez said negotiations over his bill, Senate Bill 25B-4, had “reached a deal” as of Sunday night. The framework would have further simplified the disclosure bill, allowed consumers to correct information about themselves within a system and altered the liability component of the law between developers who create the AI systems and deployers who use them.
But not all sides, namely tech, could agree to that.
“The proposed deal that had been circulated during the Colorado legislature’s special session fell short,” Meghan Pensyl, Business Software Alliance’s Director of Policy, said in a statement. “Colorado now has an opportunity to craft clearer, more practical rules for high-risk AI that build public trust in technology and support AI adoption across the economy.”
The deal fell apart by Monday morning, and Rodriguez amended the bill to delay the implementation date.
“Overnight, the tech industry decided that they were so unhappy with the compromise that had been achieved by consumer protection organizations, educators, labor, and business that they would rather return to (the 2024 law),” he said on the Senate floor. “It became impossible to iron out a path forward that works for everyone. That is why I am delaying implementation.”
Negotiations over changes to the law will now take place during the regular lawmaking term that starts in January and ends in May, giving interest groups more time than a handful of days during the special session to iron out the details of what could be a nation-leading policy.
“I think a delay is extremely prudent. I’m up here happy that we landed at a delay,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat who ran the moderate AI bill, said. “We need the entire session to get this right.”
A group of Democrats in the House and Senate voted against the delay. Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat, was originally on the bill but pulled her name from it after it got amended to just be a delay.
“The big tech companies did not want to come to the table. They did not want to compromise and they did not want any liability,” she said. “Even though it didn’t end up the way I expected it to be, I commend everyone’s efforts. We got to the closest point, I believe, that we have ever gotten (to a deal).”
The bill cleared the House on a 48-14 vote and the Senate on a 29-3 vote.
“We appreciate the work of the legislature on this important issue, including Majority Leader Rodriguez and sponsors of the legislation,” Polis spokesperson Shelby Weiman wrote in an email. “There were very productive conversations that we believe will help shape future policy discussions, and the additional time agreed to by the General Assembly will help to ensure we get this right.”

The state's department of tourism is looking for ways to save money on the publication. (West Virginia Culture Center photo)The West Virginia Department of Tourism says it’s looking for ways to reduce costs and increase readership for Goldenseal, the state’s traditional life magazine that’s been published for 50 years. 
Goldenseal was first published in April 1975 by the West Virginia Department of Commerce and the Arts and Humanities Council, according to a history of the magazine posted on the Department of Tourism’s website. 
The Department of Tourism, which was combined with the state Department of Culture and History earlier this year, prints the magazine four times a year. Topics range from “labor history, folklore, music, farming, religion, traditional crafts, food and politics.” 
In an email to West Virginia Watch, Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said at its height, the magazine had more than 30,000 subscribers. In recent years, “with the growing preference for digital media,” subscriptions have dropped to fewer than 4,500, she said. 
Ruby said the decline in subscribers, along with rising costs of printing and postage, have led to a net loss of $640,000 in taxpayer dollars over the past five years.
Ruby said the department does not plan to completely eliminate the magazine. She did not directly answer a question about whether the state plans to stop printing the magazine. She said the department is working “hand-in-hand with the Goldenseal editorial team to explore more effective ways to share the state’s beloved heritage with a broader audience.”
“We are exploring options to modernize [Goldenseal] with the goals of both reducing costs and increasing readership,” Ruby wrote. “While we are still in the planning stages of Goldenseal’s next chapter and don’t have all the details ironed out, I can assure you, we are committed to keeping the tradition of Goldenseal alive.”
Rumors about the possible end of the magazine’s print edition are the basis of a Facebook group called “Friends of Goldenseal magazine,” which had 210 members as of Tuesday. 
“Goldenseal Magazine’s future hangs in the balance,” Alan Byer wrote in his description for the Facebook group. “Goldenseal may become all-digital, with the Summer 2025 issue the final print edition, or it may go away altogether.  Our new administration in Charleston hasn’t made any announcements, and have shared nothing definite with the staff.”
He urged people who love the magazine and are concerned about its future to contact Ruby and to buy copies of the magazine. 
In a statement, Byer, an Elkins resident who has contributed writing to the magazine, called Goldenseal “unique among state-sponsored publications.”
“It has never been a slick advertisement for West Virginia’s physical beauty and typical tourist attractions,” he wrote. “Instead, for the past 50 years, it has delved into our fair state’s very soul, telling the stories of regular people who have practiced, or still practice, age-old traditions.  Articles about mountain musicians, dancers, square-dance callers, artists, sculptors, writers, poets and plain-old interesting people throughout West Virginia’s rich history fill its pages.  
“Many of us, including a growing number of visitors in search of authentic Appalachian culture and history, rely upon Goldenseal for information we can’t find anywhere else,” Byer said. “Its contributions to West Virginia and West Virginians can’t always be directly measured in dollars and cents, but it remains a valuable asset for us all.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Hurricane Katrina prompted the wholesale move of New Orleans’ public school system to an all-charter system, though seeds for the dramatic overhaul were sown at least two years before the 2005 catastrophe. 
Before the storm, 60% of New Orleans schools earned a “F” grade on their state school performance scores. Today, there are no failing schools in the city. System and school leaders also point to improvements in standardized test results and graduation rates as validation for their autonomy from a traditional, centralized school district.
All but one of the 70 schools in New Orleans today are operated under charters independent of the local school board. They include 17 single-school charters and 28 organizations with multiple campuses. Though charter operators run their individual schools, there is still an umbrella New Orleans Public Schools district office and a school board that reviews charter applications and renewals.
As what’s been called the nation’s biggest experiment in public education prepares to enter its third decade, local school leaders are bracing for still more changes. For example, declining enrollment numbers, which is not unique to New Orleans, will likely lead to campus closures. 
For many, it brings to mind the difficult post-Katrina decisions to shutter certain schools, mostly in neighborhoods where the population was slow to recover. Critics have said the charter movement exacerbated racial and economic gaps that existed before the storm, and new research lends credence to their claims. They fear the next round of school closures will be more of the same.
Another potential loss: more Black educators, who made up 71% of the system workforce in a city that was two-thirds Black before Katrina. Their numbers have rebounded to 52%, from a low of 42% since the storm, but gaps remain in the institutional culture. It’s that missing element that provided schools with strong neighborhood ties, even as they struggled with performance, said Adrinda Kelly, founder and leader of the advocacy group Black Education for New Orleans. 
A graduate of McDonogh 35 High School, she’s among stakeholders who say the cultural factor is more difficult, and more important, to replace than buildings or employees.
“When we talk about trying to get closer to some of the things that we had going that were right pre-Katrina, we’re not just talking about Black bodies in front of Black children. That’s a part of it,” Kelly said. “What we’re talking about more is an ethos of education, where community and cultural responsiveness are sort of pillars of how we do education.”   
How we got here
The Orleans Parish School Board served more than 65,000 students at 124 campuses for the school year that started weeks before Hurricane Katrina’s impact. At the time, a change in school governance was in its nascent stages. 
Five campuses were already part of the Recovery School District, which the Louisiana Legislature had created two years earlier to take over schools that consistently failed state progress assessments. 
Charter schools in New Orleans also predated Katrina, with two operating under the state school board, one under the local school board and more in the works.  
Leslie Jacobs, then a member of the state Board of Secondary and Elementary Education, was the chief proponent of the Recovery School District. She had previously served on the Orleans Parish School Board, when system leaders were ensnared by corruption, crumbling infrastructure and declining performance.
“People had written off New Orleans public schools. No one believed New Orleans public schools could do anything,” Jacobs said Saturday at an Education Research Alliance of New Orleans symposium to mark the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. 
After Katrina, the entire system was placed under the Recovery School District as officials tried to determine which locations should reopen. Nearly 50 schools were deemed significantly or completely destroyed, and it would be several months before displaced families could begin their return and recovery. Did schools need to wait on neighborhoods – or vice versa?

The first schools to reopen welcomed students back in January 2006, and the system ended the year with an enrollment of 12,000. The count increased to roughly 25,000 for the 2006-07 school year, and total enrollment peaked above 51,000 in October 2019.
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a decline that’s stretched over the past four years. As of October 2024, there were 47,667 students enrolled in 70 schools.
The declining birth rate is one factor that’s produced falling enrollments nationally. Since the pandemic, more families have also opted for homeschooling and other nontraditional teaching options.
The drop is more pronounced in New Orleans’ high schools. As of February, nine of the city’s 23 stand-alone high schools (no K-8 grades) had student bodies below 500 last school year. By comparison, three high schools – Warren Easton, Edna Karr and Ben Franklin – had more than 1,000 students. 
The Cowen Institute, created in 2007 to track educational changes after Hurricane Katrina, has followed the trend. In the 2025 edition of its report on “The State of Public Education in New Orleans,” it notes the amount of money the state provides per public school student has remained largely unchanged over the past 15 years. 
State figures show the Minimum Foundation Program formula came to $3,855 per student for the 2010-11 school year. For 2024-25, the amount was $4,105 – a 3.3% increase that falls well short of the 2.65% average annual increase in inflation over the same period.      
Each open seat in a New Orleans public school represents a loss of roughly $10,000, according to the Cowen Institute.
“The financial implications of already under-enrolled high schools experiencing additional enrollment declines in the future pose challenges for school leaders and the district, necessitating difficult decisions regarding resource allocation and potential school closures,” its report reads.

Gaps persist
The state’s measuring stick for public school performance is the Louisiana Educational Assessment Program, better known as the LEAP test, which is administered to all third- through 12th-grade students. Scores from fourth- and eight-graders are used to assess schoolwide performance.
Last year, 54% of New Orleans Public School fourth-graders and 65% of eighth-graders achieved Basic or Above on the English portion of the LEAP test, up from pre-Katrina rates 44% and 26%, respectively. Math scores were also higher, with 49% of fourth-graders and 42% of eighth-graders reaching Basic or Above in 2024, an increase from 41% and 30% in 2004, respectively.
However, long-term disparities in student performance based on race, household income and special education status persist. White and Asian scored far higher than Black, Hispanic, economically disadvantaged, special education and English language learner students. These disparities have increased over the past three years, according to the Cowen Institute’s analysis.
Tiffany Delcour, chief operating officer for New Schools for New Orleans, noted at last weekend’s symposium that lagging performance from English language learners is common throughout the state. The nonprofit she works for was created after Katrina to shepherd resources directed to improving public education in the city.
“As that is the [fastest] growing population we have in New Orleans – our multilanguage learners – we really have to figure out how to innovate for those students,” Delcour said.   
The Cowen Institute also noted racially “stratified” student bodies at the eight New Orleans selective admissions public schools that require students to pass qualifying tests to enroll.
White students made up 42% of those accepted to these schools, although they make up just 10% of total enrollment systemwide. Black students, who accounted for 35% enrollment at selective schools, comprise 71% of the citywide student body. 
Pros and cons of autonomy
Lake Forest Charter School is one of those selective admissions schools and was the first to open in New Orleans East after Hurricane Katrina. Mardele Early, its founding CEO, said she had started having conversations with parents about seeking a charter for her Montessori-curriculum elementary before the August 2005 hurricane.
“Our reason was we wanted to have more of an autonomy to build – and continue to build – what we knew would be a great school for students,” Early said. “We wanted to have more faith in the selection of our materials and how we were going to spend our funding.”

With school closures and consolidation on the near horizon, New Orleans school leaders have started to explore whether their autonomy is an expense they can continue to afford. 
Each individual charter operation requires a transportation contract for school buses, a food service program for student meals and a health care provider for its employees – all expenses a central office covers in a traditional school district. Charter holders with multiple campuses enjoy some economies of scale, but single-school operators have to shoulder the cost on their own.  
For some schools, though, these spending decisions are about more than just keeping their books balanced.
Kate Mehock, founder and CEO of Crescent City School, said at Saturday’s symposium that she chose to stop contracting with a transportation provider and took its bus service in-house last year. Her charter operation includes five schools and an alternative education program. When her independent school board asked whether its transportation team was having an impact, she said she began tracking attendance and four that tardiness rates fell by half.
“What does that mean? It means kids aren’t late to first period. It means they eat breakfast,” Mehock said. “They come to school, they’re ready to go, right? So a small thing like that really matters.”
Future funding fears
Although New Orleans’ charter schools are independently run, the local tax revenue that supports them comes through the Orleans Parish School Board. An ongoing dispute between the board and Mayor LaToya Cantrell involves tens of millions of dollars in school tax revenue the city has retained. The mayor insists those proceeds are meant to cover the city’s cost for collecting school taxes. 
The school board has sued the Cantrell administration, and a judge issued a temporary restraining order Tuesday that suspends the city’s tax collection fee. 
The money in question would help the school system overcome a $50 million deficit from last year that was the result of an error in tax revenue projections. The mistake led to the quick exit of Superintendent Avis Williams and forced the school board to dip into its savings to cover part of the shortfall. 
These financial difficulties make it difficult to attract and retain teachers, current Superintendent Fateama Fulmore said. A 2023 study from The New Teacher Project found that 25% of New Orleans teachers left their jobs in each of the previous three years, with the pandemic forcing many to exit the field entirely.
There’s also the competition factor. 
New Orleans school leaders watched nervously last December as Jefferson Parish voters were asked to increase their property taxes to support teacher pay raises. The proposition failed by a margin of 319 votes. 
The average annual compensation for a certified teacher in New Orleans is just under $44,000, according to multiple third-party online salary databases. An official figure is difficult to obtain, given the number and independent nature of charter operations, but anecdotal evidence places New Orleans teacher pay behind salaries in Jefferson.
Had the property tax been approved, each Jefferson Parish teacher would have seen their annual salary increased $8,300, dramatically increasing the district’s edge over New Orleans.
As the years have passed since Hurricane Katrina, the appeal of working in an experimental school system has lost its luster for some educators, especially as neighboring systems have increased teacher pay. Fulmore said compensation, declining enrollment and underfunding are the three main obstacles the New Orleans school faces in the near term. 
“I don’t believe these are insurmountable challenges we’re facing, but there are Heculean efforts that we’re going to have to make to overcome them,” the superintendent said.

(Getty Images)Back-to-school season is here and parents across the Treasure Valley are juggling transportation schedules, sports practices, and after-school activities. However, for families experiencing homelessness, simply ensuring their children can continue their education is a concern. In Idaho, more than 9,000 K-12 students experienced homelessness during the 2023–24 school year. 
At Jesse Tree, we work to keep families housed during a temporary financial crisis through our emergency rental assistance program, which includes connecting families facing risk of eviction and homelessness with resources for long-term stability. Given that over half of our clients are families with children, we partner closely with local school district McKinney-Vento Liaisons, whose job is to help students facing homelessness continue their education, ideally avoiding transferring youth from their original school. 
Natalie Sandoval, Jesse Tree board member and homeless liaison for the Nampa School District, emphasizes the impact of a school transfer, especially on an unhoused youth.

“Most people think of homelessness as moving from shelter to shelter,” she says. “But for most families, it’s one move, just one loss of housing, that can cause enormous disruption.” That single move can uproot a child from their friends, teachers, extracurricular activities, and programs they rely on. “It’s already traumatic to lose your home. Then to be separated from your school on top of that is devastating for kids.” 
Nampa’s McKinney-Vento Liaisons have found transportation to be a primary hurdle in preventing school transfers of unhoused youth. If a family loses housing but stays within district boundaries, buses or carpools can sometimes work. If homelessness causes the family to be placed outside of the district, challenges multiply. Though McKinnney-Ventos offer assistance coordinating with other school districts, loss of program funding has reduced multiple resources that once made alternative transportation options more feasible. 
Natalie recalled a student whose commitment to sports kept her engaged in school, despite the trauma of housing loss. Her school was in Nampa, but she moved to a neighboring community to live with a distant family member when she lost her home. Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds once covered a McKinney-Vento transportation van, but without ongoing funding, there is currently no driver to operate it. Even so, Natalie’s team found a way to ensure she could keep attending Nampa schools and stay on her team. 
“For her, that stability and sense of belonging was everything,” Natalie says. 
Affordable housing is the only option for many income-constrained families, but it is scarce and often not readily available within a family’s original zip code. 
“We have to throw a wide net to try to get people rehoused,” Tony Torres, Jesse Tree’s housing navigator, explained.
This often conflicts with the McKinney-Vento goal to keep homeless youth enrolled in their original school, making close coordination with Natalie’s team and other local school districts critical in avoiding compounding challenges for homeless youth and their families. 
Disruption to a youth’s education is one of many secondary effects of homelessness. When housing stability is lost, preserving the stability offered by school can allow children to continue to thrive academically and emotionally, even through a housing crisis.

U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock, who was appointed to the federal bench by George W. Bush, last week ruled that Mississippi’s Supreme Court districts violate the federal Voting Rights Act and that the state cannot use the same maps in future elections. 
Mississippi law establishes three Supreme Court districts, commonly referred to as the northern, central and southern districts. Voters elect three judges from each to the nine-member court. These districts have not been redrawn since 1987.

The main district at issue in the case is the central district, which comprises many parts of the majority-Black Delta and the majority-Black Jackson Metro Area. 
Several civil rights legal organizations filed a lawsuit on behalf of Black citizens, candidates, and elected officials, arguing that the central district does not provide Black voters with a realistic chance to elect a candidate of their choice. 
The state defended the districts arguing the map allows a fair chance for Black candidates. Aycock sided with the plaintiffs and is allowing the Legislature to redraw the districts.
The attorney general’s office could appeal the ruling to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. A spokesperson for the office stated that the office is reviewing Aycock’s decision, but did not confirm whether the office plans to appeal.
In her ruling, Aycock cited the testimony of William Cooper, the plaintiff’s demographic and redistricting expert, who estimated that 56,000 felons were unable to vote statewide based on a review of court records from 1994 to 2017. He estimated 60% of those were determined to be Black Mississippians. 
Cooper testified that the high number of people who were disenfranchised contributed to the Black voting age population falling below 50% in the central district. 
Attorneys from Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office defended the state. They disputed Cooper’s calculations, but Aycock rejected their arguments. 
The AG’s office also said Aycock should not put much weight on the number of disenfranchised people because the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previously ruled that Mississippi’s disenfranchisement system doesn’t violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. 
Aycock, however, distinguished between the appellate court’s ruling that the system did not have racial discriminatory intent and the current issue of the practice having a racially discriminatory impact. 
“Notably, though, that decision addressed only whether there was discriminatory intent as required to prove an Equal Protection claim,” Aycock wrote. “The Fifth Circuit did not conclude that Mississippi’s felon disenfranchisement laws have no racially disparate impact.” 
Mississippi has one of the harshest disenfranchisement systems in the nation and a convoluted method for restoring voting rights to people. 
Other than receiving a pardon from the governor, the only way for someone to regain their voting rights is if two-thirds of legislators from both chambers at the Capitol, the highest threshold in the Legislature, agree to restore their suffrage. 
Lawmakers only consider about a dozen or so suffrage restoration bills during the session, and they’re typically among the last items lawmakers take up before they adjourn for the year. 
Under the Mississippi Constitution, people convicted of a list of 10 types of felonies lose their voting rights for life. Opinions from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office have since expanded the list of specific disenfranchising felonies to 23. 
The practice of stripping voting rights away from people for life is a holdover from the Jim Crow era. The framers of the 1890 Mississippi Constitution believed Black people were most likely to commit certain crimes. 
Leaders in the state House have attempted to overhaul the system, but none have gained any significant traction in both chambers at the Capitol. 
Last year, House Constitution Chairman Price Wallace, a Republican from Mendenhall, advocated a constitutional amendment that would have removed nonviolent offenses from the list of disenfranchising felonies, but he never brought it up for a vote in the House. 
Wallace and House Elections Chairman Noah Sanford, a Republican from Collins, are leading a study committee on Sept. 11 to explore reforms to the felony suffrage system and other voting legislation.  
Wallace previously said on an episode of Mississippi Today’s “The Other Side” podcast that he believes the state should tackle the issue because one of his core values, part of his upbringing, is giving people a second chance, especially once they’ve made up for a mistake. 
“This issue is not a Republican or Democratic issue,” Wallace said. “It allows a woman or a man, whatever the case may be, the opportunity to have their voice heard in their local elections. Like I said, they’re out there working. They’re paying taxes just like you and me. And yet they can’t have a decision in who represents them in their local government.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01184654/Voting-14.jpg,,,2025-08-27 06:56:28.485085

Since its passage, Social Security has touched nearly every American life, offering a safety net that has kept millions of Americans out of poverty and enabled them to flourish well into old age.
Yet we forget just how monumental this legislative achievement was and the figures who helped make it possible. Here in North Carolina, few remember the vital advocacy of one of our own: Frank Porter Graham.
“Dr. Frank” stands among the greatest North Carolinians in history. Though he briefly served as a United States senator, his most enduring legacy lies in his tenure as president of the University of North Carolina and his tireless activism for a more just and humane South. Graham envisioned a “cleaner, nobler, and more beautiful America,” and spent his life advancing the causes of racial equality, labor rights, and economic justice. He was fearless in his pursuits, and along with his successor William Friday, Graham helped make Chapel Hill and the UNC System synonymous with the social, economic, and political progress of the 20th-century South.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt knew of Graham’s vision and commitment to justice. Through the auspices of Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, Roosevelt invited Graham to chair the Advisory Council on Economic Security, a group tasked with working in parallel to a committee of cabinet members in laying the groundwork for what would become the Social Security Act. The council met for just one month, from Nov. 15 to Dec. 15, but during that brief period, Graham poured himself into the effort.
As his biographer Warren Ashby observed, Graham’s work on the council reflected the culmination of his lifelong concerns: “sympathy for the underdog, the consequences of the industrial revolution, the plight of the worker, the feeling for the dispossessed and despised, the awareness of the downward pull of poverty.” For Graham, economic security for the elderly, unemployed, children, and mothers was not just a policy goal but a moral imperative. He believed that such security would help America live up to its ideals of liberty and opportunity at a time when the totalitarian regimes of Europe threatened those values.
Speaking at a White House conference on economic security in the fall of 1934, Graham captured the essence of Social Security’s mission in the face the negative consequences of the Industrial Revolution, which had manifested dramatically in the Great Depression:
“The human casualty of an industrial society is unable alone to provide for his own security. Labor unions, fraternal organizations, and cooperative societies are necessary. Social legislation is required for minimum wages and maximum hours. But social insurance is indispensable to security against unemployment, sickness, and old age. These millions of human beings provide the life and labor necessary to industrial civilization, but our modern civilization with its fragmentary view of human beings, and human society, makes but little provision for the security of their labor, sickness, and old age.”
As Ashby notes, Graham’s influence on the final legislation was modest. The Social Security Act was passed in a form weaker than his committee had envisioned or hoped. Yet, upon signing the bill into law, President Roosevelt declared it “the cornerstone in a structure which is being built, but which is by no means complete.”
Why recall Frank Porter Graham’s role today, 90 years after the passage of Social Security?
First, he should remind us of the importance of Social Security and that it emerged from a world of problems, especially in the American South, that most of us have never known or have forgotten, but to which none would want to return. In 1920, the only bulwark against old age poverty or the poor house in North Carolina was the generosity of relatives, good luck, or a Confederate pension, which amounted to no more than $72 ($1,205 in 2025) annually and, of course, was not available to the nearly one-third of North Carolinians who were Black. Recent reports indicate that Social Security will face a $25 trillion shortfall before the end of the century, and there has been little action from Congress to address the impending crisis that will affect us all, middle class and poor alike.
Graham’s work also reminds us of a tradition of humane, energetic progress unique to North Carolina, particularly among Southern states. This tradition, rooted in democratic liberalism, reflects a belief in our shared responsibility to alleviate suffering, improve human relations, and build a better future not solely for our own quality of life, but for the good of others.
Frank Porter Graham exemplified this noble tradition in North Carolina. Indeed, some might even say he inaugurated it. His life and service are a powerful reminder of what is possible when we combine sound learning with action, compassion with energy, a deep commitment to a particular place and people alongside unpretentious cosmopolitanism, and his legacy offers lessons that are as relevant today as they were in 1934. At a time when our nation faces deep divisions and pressing challenges — particularly from a new wave of human problems generated by the AI-dominated Fourth Industrial Revolution — we would do well to remember his example, and, despite the challenges, to renew our commitment to building a more just and equitable society for all North Carolinians.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fpg-unc-backdrop.jpg,,,2025-08-27 05:57:23.472085

(Murray State photo)On a routine day in West Kentucky, only a few random visitors and occasional school groups drop in to Murray State University’s Wrather Museum. However, when a traveling exhibition from the Smithsonian Institution comes to town, attendance steps up because rural communities value having local access to cultural experiences usually reserved for big city museums. 
In 2012, the Smithsonian’s Journey Stories exhibition came to the Wrather Museum. About 4,000 people viewed images and information that explored the ways travel and migration have impacted individuals and communities, past and present. Inspired by the exhibit, scores of school kids wrote and recorded journey poems that were broadcast on WKMS-FM, the NPR affiliate.
One image in Journey Stories, an engraving of a line-up of male slaves being transported on foot, sparked comment from a middle schooler. The artwork, a primary document from the antebellum era, showed barely clothed African men yoked together with leg irons and neck braces. 
Pointing to the picture, the young man declared, “They didn’t wear those things around their necks, they just wore ones on their ankles,” as if leg irons were good, but neck irons not so much. 
The boy’s observation sparked my memory of the word “coffle.” I would have taken the opportunity to introduce a new word into the kids’ vocabularies, but the school buses were waiting outside: No time for the teachable moment. 
 “Coffle,” according to “The American Slave Coast” by Ned Sublette and Constance Sublette, means, “the common way slaves were transported from slave breeding states on the Atlantic coast to the slave markets and plantations of the deeper South. Southern children grew up seeing coffles approach in a cloud of dust.”
  In a coffle, both men and women of all ages were chained or roped together marching under guard in the process known as “Sold South.” (National Park Service)
During the time of slavery in America, enslaved people were marched in coffles at a pace of 20 or 25 miles a day, sometimes for weeks and in all weather, to a point of sale. The origin of coffle leads to an Arabic word meaning caravan, harkening back to overland slave trade that trekked across the desert from sub-Saharan Africa to the Middle East.
“About a quarter of those trafficked southward were children between eight and fifteen, purchased away from their families,” “The American Slave Coast” description goes on.
An account by Charles Ball, who was forcibly taken from Maryland to South Carolina in 1805 stated, “The women were tied together with a rope … which was tied like a halter round the neck of each.” Men were collared in chains and “fitted by means of a padlock round each of our necks.”
“Women with babies in hand were in a particularly cruel situation,” Charles Ball recalled. “Babies weren’t worth much money and they slowed down the coffles,” he said. “William Wells Brown hired out a slave trader named Walker, who recalled seeing a baby given away on the road.” 
In 1841, when Abraham Lincoln witnessed a coffle of slaves in chains, he said, “The sight was a continued torment to me and I see something like it every time I touch the Ohio or any other slave border.”
Although coffle has faded from usage, the word retains precise historic accuracy and relevance. For example, the deportees who were dispatched to a notorious Salvadoran prison without due process were tethered in a coffle, even forced to bend from the waist as they shuffled to an uncertain fate.

Nevertheless, just the other day, the president chastised the Smithsonian Institution for focusing too much on “how bad slavery was” and not enough on the “brightness” of America.
In a social media tirade, Mr. Trump said, “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.”
“This Country cannot be WOKE,” he bombasted, “because WOKE IS BROKE. We have the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.”
When the president wants people to talk about America, however, he specifies the words that can (or cannot) be used. For instance, take the now verboten term D.E.I. Through a recent series of executive orders, Donald Trump flushed the words diversity, equity, and inclusion into the golden toilet of obscurity, sending educators, professors and college administrators into frenzied efforts to expunge the “three little words” from policies, procedures and even syllabi.
Of course, words and ideas shift in meaning and sometimes fade out of use. That’s a fact, not fake news. Were comedian George Carlin alive today, he would have to expand his list of seven dirty words to accommodate the new American lexicon that strives only to speak of the country’s positive achievements, as if admitting anything less is inherently bad. 
Mr. Carlin has a few words he might have used to describe such repression of the truth. I call it poppycock.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wrather_West_Kentucky_Museum.jpeg,,,2025-08-27 05:57:23.472085

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
North Dakota Democratic lawmaker proposes bills to protect IVF, birth control

After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
IVF pushback grows louder
This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
Abortion, reproductive rights bills rejected in North Dakota House

The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
Out of obscurity
RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.
Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.
Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
First in the nation
Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

(File photo by Annmarie Timmins/New Hampshire Bulletin)With young children particularly vulnerable to the serious health risks of lead exposure, the state is accepting applications to reimburse eligible child care programs for remediation projects.
“Very small amounts of lead can have serious effects on a child’s growth and development,” said Colleen Smith, bureau chief of the state Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Public Health Protection. “It could lead to delays in speech, hyperactivity, and behavior change challenges, even lower IQ or lower achievement in school.”
High levels of exposure could lead to hearing loss or even death, she said.
While about 70% of lead exposure in U.S. children comes from lead paint and dust, especially in older homes built before 1978, Smith said, contaminated drinking water accounts for about 15% of exposure. The state established a law in 2018 requiring drinking water in schools and licensed child care facilities be tested for lead — and that it be remediated if found at concentrations at or above 5 parts per billion. (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that “there is no known safe level of lead in a child’s blood.”)


Where to apply
If you run a licensed child care center whose facility had concentrations of lead at or above 5 parts per billion that had remediation completed after May 17, 2016, and have not previously requested reimbursement, you can apply for funds here. Applications are due Oct. 15.


Now, $400,000 is available through the New Hampshire Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund to reimburse eligible licensed child care programs for up to the full cost of their lead remediation projects if their facilities require it. Applications are due Oct. 15.
To be eligible for funds, the projects must not have already been submitted for reimbursement, and must have been completed after May 17, 2016. 
Since applications opened in December, $40,000 has been distributed to 11 programs, Smith said. Remediation can include replacing faucets, installing water filtration systems, putting up permanent signs that a water source is not for drinking, or other actions. 
The funds are being disbursed on a rolling basis as programs apply. It may take as little as a couple of weeks to a month for a program to receive funds, Smith said. 
A state report published last year found that 1,142 New Hampshire children had “elevated blood lead levels high enough to impair their ability to think, learn, and concentrate in 2023” — the highest number found in the past five years of data. 
And though the state requires 1 and 2 year olds to have their blood tested for lead, compliance is well short of 100%. Among children 12 to 23 months included in the 2023 data, 24% had not undergone the required testing, while 31% of children ages 24 to 35 months had not been tested, the report said.
The report also found an economic imbalance with exposure. One in 10 children on Medicaid had elevated blood levels, almost twice the rate of other children.
Licensed child care programs, as well as schools, are required to undergo three rounds of lead sampling. 
Of the 742 licensed programs in the state, 63% have completed all three rounds, 85% have completed two rounds, and 99% have completed at least one round, according to Ian Atwell, the schools and child care facilities program manager for the state Department of Environmental Services’ Drinking Water and Groundwater Bureau. The 10 facilities that have yet to begin testing all opened this year, Atwell said.
Among those that have done testing,194 facilities had at least one result that was at or above the 5 parts per billion lead concentration threshold. Of that group, 175 have completed remediation, and 19 are still in progress, Atwell said.
  Water filters that remove lead, like the one seen here, can be a remediation option. (New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services).
The vast majority — 93% — of licensed child care facilities are enrolled in the state’s Get the Lead Out of Drinking Water program, through which they can access free sampling. Others had an existing relationship with a laboratory that they preferred to use, Atwell said.
Child care programs testing through the state receive sample bottles that they can fill up themselves and pre-paid shipping labels to send the water off to Microbac Laboratories, the state’s contractor for this program, Atwell said. Within about two to four weeks, results are available in a public portal, and facilities are alerted of results at or above the state’s threshold for action.
From there, the first step is to block access to the contaminated drinking water source. Then, the programs have five days to let families know about the testing result, and six months to report back to the state with a solution, Atwell said.
Atwell said New Hampshire was in a “strong spot” by having mandatory testing, as opposed to other states with voluntary programs.
Some feel state law could go further to protect children from lead exposure. Two such bills aiming to do so were killed by lawmakers this past legislative session. 
One would have lowered the blood lead level in children that triggers an investigation from DHHS, required the agency to inspect other units when one in a multi-unit residential building has a lead hazard, and established a presumption that residences built before 1978 have lead substances present unless determined otherwise by an inspector. Another would have mandated families submit health forms showing at least one blood lead level test result for children entering public school or day care, with some exemptions.
Rep. Heath Howard, a Strafford Democrat who sponsored the measure related to public schools and child care programs, said he didn’t think current testing went far enough, and “that we need to be doing significantly more.”
For example, he pointed to recreation centers or other places outside of schools or licensed child care programs where children may be exposed to lead.
“It goes to the fact that these children are going to be exposed at more than just one location,” Howard said, “and it’s about trying to make sure that we have opportunities to kind of figure out where we may see higher levels of lead ahead of time.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger says one of her first acts if elected would be to undo Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s February directive requiring Virginia law enforcement to help carry out federal immigration crackdowns — a policy she argues wastes local resources and undermines community trust.
“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February. The order gave state police and corrections officers authority to perform certain immigration duties and also urged local jails to fully cooperate with federal deportation operations.
The governor said at the time the measure was meant to keep “dangerous criminal illegal immigrants” off Virginia’s streets. Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.
“Our immigration system is absolutely broken,” she said. “The idea that we would take local police officers or local sheriff’s deputies in amid all the things that they have to do, like community policing or staffing our jails or investigating real crimes, so that they can go and tear families apart … that is a misuse of those resources.”
Spanberger’s stance sets up a sharp contrast with her opponent — Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has embraced the order and tied it to her own story as a legal immigrant from Jamaica.

The divide between the two candidates underscores how immigration has become one of the most combustible issues in Virginia’s 2025 campaign for governor — and how Youngkin’s policies continue to shape the race even as he prepares to leave office in January.
That influence stretches beyond Youngkin’s executive order. In late February, Youngkin also launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a sweeping federal-state operation staffed with more than 200 personnel from agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI, state police and corrections, which has claimed hundreds to thousands of immigration and gang-related arrests in Virginia. 
 Keep enforcement federal, Spanberger says

Spanberger, who represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in Congress before launching her gubernatorial bid, argued that immigration enforcement should be handled by federal officials with judicial oversight, not by local police diverted from their own duties.
She said Democrats are often wrongly portrayed as opposing law enforcement when they object to policies like Youngkin’s that conscript local agencies into immigration sweeps. 
“If someone has a criminal violation at the state level or at the federal level … local resources are required to arrest that person or put them in a local jail before transferring them to federal custody. Absolutely the locality should participate in that,” she said.
But Spanberger insisted the standard should be the same for immigration cases as for any other criminal matter.
“They have to have a warrant to pick somebody up off the street, so they meet that same standard,” she said. “And they can easily go get that detention order signed by a judge or a magistrate, if they want that local support.”
Without those safeguards, Spanberger argued, local cooperation with ICE undermines community policing, creates constitutional concerns and strains already tight budgets. She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.
 Earle-Sears emphasizes rule of law

Earle-Sears, who initially agreed to a similar policy interview with The Mercury but canceled minutes before it was to take place, has publicly and repeatedly defended Youngkin’s executive order.
“I am a legal immigrant and now a naturalized citizen. Working together, the governor, attorney general, and I have made Virginia safer,” she said in February when announcing the policy. “Now, working with President Trump, we can take on the scourge of dangerous and violent illegal immigrants.”

In December, while unveiling a “No Sanctuary Cities” budget proposal, she described the bureaucratic hurdles her own family went through when immigrating to the U.S. and argued that others should follow the same path. 
“My father and I had to file documents and wait to be granted permission to enter the United States. Under Governor Youngkin’s leadership, Virginia stands firm: we are not a sanctuary state,” she said.
“The rule of law is not negotiable — it is the foundation of our safety, our freedom, and the promise of opportunity that defines America,” she added.
Earle-Sears’ broader ideas on immigration remain unclear, as she has not gone beyond a handful of public statements and her campaign website offers no issue page outlining her positions.
 Dispute over Youngkin’s deportation claims

The candidates also diverge sharply on Youngkin’s claim in July that all 2,500 immigrants arrested and deported by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force are “violent criminals.”
Spanberger said she has seen no evidence to support the governor’s sweeping assertion. 
“If they were violent criminals, presumably, they were arrested on those charges for the violent crime that they committed, in which case, there would be clear documentation,” she said. “Frankly, as somebody who believes in upholding the law, I want people to be arrested for the crimes that they are committing.”
Civil rights groups have also raised alarms, arguing that Youngkin’s mandate is “playing politics with people’s lives.” 
“For years, Virginia’s governor has been pushing the same dangerous, false narrative as the Trump administration that immigrants commit crime at higher rates than people who were born here, despite the fact that no data exists to support that conclusion,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia said in a statement.
Earle-Sears has not directly addressed the governor’s 2,500 figure but has frequently pointed to grim cases of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in arguing for tougher enforcement. 
“We’ve seen too many tragic stories after dangerous criminals in this country illegally were put back on the streets, and this executive order will make sure we send them back to where they came from,” she said earlier this year.
 The Laken Riley Act

The immigration debate has also touched on Spanberger’s record in Congress. 
Earle-Sears has faulted her for initially voting against the Laken Riley Act, named for a Georgia college student killed by a Venezuelan national who entered the country unlawfully. The law, which eventually passed after Spanberger left Congress, requires federal authorities to detain immigrants accused of theft and burglary while their cases proceed.
Spanberger said she opposed the bill in its first iteration because it “was essentially putting incredible burdens on localities removing any form of due process” and would not have prevented Riley’s murder. 
“As a mother of three daughters, I was deeply offended that they would utilize that young woman’s murder as a political talking point,” she said. “At the time of that vote, her father was in the press saying that he was deeply distressed by the fact that her murder was being utilized in the way that it was.”
David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said Spanberger has staked out a position that balances criticism of Trump-era immigration policies with support for reforms viewed as moderate.
“Spanberger has been fairly vocal in criticizing the Trump administration’s methods of dealing with undocumented immigration,” Richards said. 
“Her voting record on bills centered around immigration has been mixed, supporting some of the more moderate bills, but voting ‘no’ on some key GOP bills like the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act. … It falls in line with her presenting herself as a pragmatic candidate.”
By contrast, he said, Earle-Sears has been relatively quiet on immigration, surfacing the issue primarily when it intersects with her biography or when amplifying President Donald Trump’s agenda. 
“She did talk about the issue back in June, saying that she, as an immigrant, did things the ‘right way.’ But overall, she has skirted the issue,” Richards said. 
“She may feel that the issue is not one she can really win with in Virginia, although, as more immigration related arrests happen in the commonwealth, she may have to start talking about this.”
 The bigger picture

The fight over immigration in Virginia is inseparable from national politics. Youngkin has aligned himself closely with Trump on enforcement strategies, boasting of joint operations with ICE and staging press events around courthouse raids and “gang and immigration sweeps” that have drawn criticism from Democrats and civil liberties groups.
Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law. She cited bipartisan bills like the Farm Workforce Modernization Act and the Dignity Act as examples of incremental progress, even if they fell short.
“There are many places where the governors of states can bang on the table and tell Congress, ‘Stop making this such a political issue that you campaign on every two years and just fix it,’” she said. 
She added that immigration is not only a humanitarian concern but also a pressing economic issue for Virginia, from hospitals seeking visas for foreign-trained nurses to seafood producers dependent on seasonal guest workers.
Earle-Sears, meanwhile, has emphasized border security and public safety, drawing a bright line between legal immigrants like herself and those who arrive unlawfully.
“Any local elected official who instructs law enforcement to defy efforts to keep Virginians safe abandons their duty and breaks the trust of the people they swore to protect,” she said last year.
 Looking ahead

With polls showing immigration remains a top concern among Republican voters — and a complicated one among independents — the issue is likely to stay at the forefront of this year’s election cycle.

Spanberger is betting Virginians will see Youngkin’s executive order as overreach that diverts local resources and harms public safety by discouraging immigrant communities from reporting crimes. Earle-Sears is counting on voters to view strict enforcement as common sense, framed by her own story of navigating the legal immigration system.
“Maybe she is waiting for a Trump endorsement,” Richards said of Earle-Sears. “But if immigration remains in the headlines, she may not be able to avoid it.”
For now, voters face a stark choice between a Democrat who vows to unwind the governor’s crackdown and press Congress for broader reforms, and a Republican who pledges to double down on enforcement in the name of law and order.

(Photo courtesy of Evan Cantwell/George Mason University)After the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights announced Friday that George Mason University violated federal civil rights laws due to alleged unlawful hiring and promotion practices, an attorney representing the school’s President Gregory Washington on Monday said those actions didn’t occur and advised him not to apologize for them. 
The agency, which did not immediately respond for comment Tuesday, had recommended GMU take several measures to address its findings, including requiring Washington to apologize and issue a statement affirming that GMU will conduct all recruitment, hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions in compliance with Title VI, the federal anti-discrimination law. 
The agency gave Washington 10 days to resolve the violations. 
Despite federal investigations, GMU president will remain in role, receive pay boost

However, Douglas Gansler, the attorney representing GMU’s first Black president, said to the board in the Aug. 25 letter that apologizing for promoting unlawful practices “would be falsely admitting to conduct that did not occur and would open GMU to further legal risk” in other investigations.
“If the Board entertains OCR’s demand that Dr. Washington personally apologize for promoting unlawful discriminatory practices in hiring, promotion, and tenure processes, it will undermine GMU’s record of compliance,” wrote Gansler. “An apology will amount to an admission that the university did something unlawful, opening GMU and the Board up to legal liability for conduct that did not occur under the Board’s watch. In addition, OCR’s recommended resolution will not bind other agencies, like the Department of Justice, from enacting penalties based on this admission.”
Washington and GMU have been inundated with questions following the launch of four federal investigations by the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. Two of those involve alleged racial discrimination in employment, while another examines the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices.

Gansler argued that the OCR’s investigation was incomplete and based on mischaracterizations and omissions of facts, particularly regarding the university’s efforts to comply with evolving DEl laws. As an example, Gansler pointed out that the OCR claimed Washington’s assertion that the institution’s “North Star” is to “reflect the rich diversity of the student body” suggested support for unlawful race-based hiring. 
“This is not code for establishing a quota system,” Gansler wrote, quoting Washington’s North Star remarks. 
He further added that Washington’s “North Star” remarks cited former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s “ONE Virginia Plan,” which mandated state agencies, including universities, to create DEI strategic plans that promote diversity in hiring in alignment with federal and state equal employment opportunity laws.
The OCR “selectively excerpted” Washington’s remarks about hiring decisions, Gansler wrote, incorrectly suggesting staff was hired based on race. He added that the OCR failed to point to any policy enacted or discriminatory hiring decision made as a result. Washington is also not directly involved in the evaluation of faculty candidates, he said.
Gansler said OCR claimed the university’s Anti-Racism and Inclusive Excellence Task Force was intended for university staff to make hiring, promotion and tenure decisions based on factors like race and other protected characteristics based entirely on a website post.
But the post for the task force did not establish or alter any university policies, its suggestions were “hypothetical,” and many of them were not ultimately included in the final recommendations for the task force, Gansler noted.
“It is glaringly apparent that the OCR investigation process has been cut short, and ‘findings’ have been made in spite of a very incomplete fact-finding process, including only two interviews with university academic deans,” Gansler wrote to the school’s Board of Visitors. “As I am sure you agree, the facts are critically important here, and the OCR’s letter is evidence that they have not spent sufficient time finding critical and material facts.”
In a Friday statement, the Board of Visitors said it is reviewing the proposed resolution steps and takes the matter seriously. 
The next board meeting is scheduled for Sept. 25.

(Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)Republican support for in vitro fertilization, after surging in the wake of a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that threatened the procedure, may be splintering as President Donald Trump retreats from his IVF promises and more far-right voices gain ground.
Earlier this year, conservatives in the Tennessee House staged an eleventh-hour skirmish over an IVF protection bill introduced by two of their Republican colleagues. The bill eventually passed, becoming one of the first in the nation to explicitly protect access to IVF. But some lawmakers who voted for it have signaled their willingness to revisit the issue.
In Georgia, a Republican-sponsored bill to codify the right to IVF into law sailed through the legislature, even as fellow conservative lawmakers introduced their own anti-abortion bill that opponents warned would undermine the IVF protections in the new law.
In statehouses around the nation, IVF has emerged as a dividing line running through the Republican Party. Particularly in states where abortion is banned, lawmakers who unite under the “pro-life” banner disagree over whether the popular treatment gives life or destroys it.
People who believe embryos are children oppose IVF because it can involve the discarding of some embryos, which they say is akin to abortion.
“The popularity of IVF creates a dilemma for Republican politicians who have had anti-choice organizations as a key part of their constituency for their whole careers,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
After the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last year that embryos are people, fertility clinics around the state temporarily halted their services, sparking nationwide outrage.
Republicans and Democrats rushed to pledge their support for fertility treatments such as IVF and announce their plans to protect it.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to make insurers cover IVF so that it would be free for patients. After taking office, he signed an executive order giving White House officials 90 days to assemble a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing costs.
In March, he called himself “the fertilization president.”
But a week later, his administration eliminated the team of experts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for tracking IVF outcomes across the United States. The team had, among other things, operated a database allowing consumers to look up an individual fertility clinic’s success rates. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the White House doesn’t plan to require insurers to cover IVF services, though administration officials told the newspaper that IVF access remains a priority.
Meanwhile, conservative groups that oppose abortion have begun pushing an obscure alternative treatment for infertility called “restorative reproductive medicine,” or RRM. Advocates have urged the White House and federal and state legislators to back RRM, which is based on the idea that the underlying causes of infertility can be treated through lifestyle changes and improving a person’s overall health.
Arkansas recently became the first to pass a pro-RRM law. Others might follow suit in upcoming legislative sessions.
Cole Muzio, founder and president of the Georgia conservative Christian nonprofit Frontline Policy Council, said he doesn’t expect to see legislators try to ban IVF outright, despite preemptive efforts by legislators in his state and others to protect it.
“Republicans are intrinsically pro-family, and the idea of supporting those who want to have a family is a conservative, noble, positive thing,” he said.
“At the same time, IVF discards an overwhelming number of human lives. We’ve got a lot of work to do to educate people.”
IVF pushback grows louder
This spring, the Tennessee bill protecting IVF passed unanimously in the state Senate. But by the time it hit the House floor in April, many of its Republican supporters sat silently while a few of their GOP colleagues tried to derail it.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Iris Rudder, told the Tennessee Lookout that she hadn’t expected disagreement over the bill to “mushroom the way it did.”
It eventually passed. But 11 Tennessee House Republicans sent a letter to GOP Gov. Bill Lee urging him to veto it and calling it “a Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life.”
Lee signed it in April.
The following day, Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson — who voted for the bill and said he supports IVF and contraceptives — told constituents during a legislative forum that he’d had “lots of conversations” about it and expects the legislature to revisit the issue again in the next session.
“I think we’ll be back next year to take another stab at it,” he said.
Potential threats to IVF push political novices into election-year advocacy

In Georgia, the state’s most powerful Republicans made a bill to codify the right to IVF a major priority this year. It was signed into law in May.
“Thanks to a lot of bipartisan support and hard work, Georgians who want to grow their families will never have to worry about whether or not they can access this vital treatment,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Lehman Franklin, posted to X after it passed through the legislature. Franklin and his wife conceived through IVF, a story he has shared publicly as he promoted the measure.
“At the end of the day, being pro-family means being pro-IVF,” he wrote.
Muzio, of the Frontline Policy Council, believes the IVF debate represents not so much a split in the Republican Party as it does a lack of education about what the treatment really means to people who believe human life begins as soon as an egg is fertilized.
“Hopefully you’ll see [legislation] put in place that either backs different fertility treatments that are more pro-life or guardrails put in place to restrict the discarding of human life for the purposes of IVF,” he said.
For conservatives who see IVF as akin to abortion, restorative reproductive medicine has emerged politically as an option for addressing infertility without explicitly supporting IVF, which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans.
Out of obscurity
RRM was a relatively obscure idea until anti-abortion groups such as The Heritage Foundation began elevating it over the past year as an alternative to IVF. With RRM, a practitioner might help patients analyze their diet, chart their menstrual cycle to look for conditions that can impact fertility, or treat reproductive disorders like endometriosis or thyroid dysfunction.
Supporters argue that a more holistic approach is a better way to treat infertility, and that RRM methods are much less expensive than IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
But RRM has been criticized in mainstream medical circles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls RRM a “nonmedical approach” and an “unproven concept” that can delay time to pregnancy and expose patients to needless and painful surgical interventions, such as procedures to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome. It says the approach overwhelmingly puts the onus on women, ignoring that infertility causes are just as common in men.










They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’


– Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine


Some experts worry that patients spending months or years on RRM treatments will lose precious time when IVF could have helped them get pregnant.
And OB-GYNs warn RRM is closely tied to the anti-abortion “personhood” movement, which attempts to grant fertilized eggs the same legal status as people — potentially leading to a loss of rights for pregnant patients and more severe restrictions on birth control and other reproductive health care.
Tipton, of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, believes RRM is more “ideology” than medical practice.
“[RRM] got legs thanks to the work of really influential right-wing and anti-choice groups,” he said. “They put their considerable resources into asking, ‘How do we blunt the momentum IVF is getting without saying we’re opposed to IVF?’”
But as RRM gains mainstream attention, it’s also found supporters in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement promoted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some consumers remain skeptical of the fertility industry, where some clinics have ties to private equity firms and other large corporations.
In March, Arkansas Republican state Rep. Alyssa Brown told fellow legislators that RRM “prioritizes women’s health over the profits of Big Pharma and Big Fertility.”
First in the nation
Brown sponsored a first-of-its-kind bill in Arkansas — which passed in April and was signed into law — that requires state insurance companies to cover RRM treatments.
Brown promised during a hearing that it wouldn’t limit access to IVF. Arkansas was one of the earliest states, in 1991, to require insurance companies to cover IVF.
A similar bill with the same title, the RESTORE Act, was introduced in Congress again this year, after failing last year. It includes recommendations from The Heritage Foundation and the conservative, anti-abortion Ethics and Public Policy Center.
Arkansas’ new law also requires programs funded through Title X, which provides birth control and other reproductive care to low-income families, to use fertility awareness-based methods, mirroring a similar effort at the federal level. Under Kennedy, HHS has indicated plans to use Title X funding to open an “infertility training center.” Part of the center’s focus, according to its grant announcement, is to “educate on the root causes of infertility and the broad range of holistic infertility treatments” available to patients.
Meanwhile, state legislators around the country this year attempted to require health insurance to cover IVF, including in Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. Under New Hampshire law, insurers are required to cover medically necessary fertility treatments and fertility preservation when a person undergoes surgery, radiation or other medical treatment that may risk impairing of fertility.
Nevada’s Democratic-controlled legislature passed a bill in June establishing the right to fertility treatments, including IVF, but it was swiftly vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
In May, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law requiring a state insurance commission to consider coverage for procedures like IVF, a move that sets the stage for requiring health insurance companies to cover it. Before signing, Youngkin tried to insert a provision allowing private plans to opt out of coverage for religious or ethical beliefs, but the legislature rejected the change.
Although he signed the measure, Youngkin said his exemption idea needed to be taken up if the state eventually mandates coverage of fertility treatments.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As a Loudoun County neighborhood awaits the State Corporation Commission’s decision on which path a new high-powered transmission line to feed power-hungry data centers may take, lawmakers are weighing in. On Monday, three state legislators told regulators they want to protect the community from having the transmission lines being built there. 
Loudoun Valley Estates in Ashburn is within the proposed reliability loop of power that Dominion Energy has said is vital energizing Data Center Alley, just up the road. Two lines of the project have already been approved, with the Golden to Mars line being the final piece.
If approved, that line could cut through the backyards of multiple homes in Loudoun Valley Estates, with one homeowner concerned she will either lose her home or its value will tank if one of the proposed 165 foot poles is built in her yard.
State Sen. Kannan Srinivasan, Del. JJ Singh, and Del. Marty Martinez wrote to the SCC panel stating:
“It is unacceptable that the burden of meeting these large-scale power demands falls disproportionately on the shoulders of our residents. In particular, those along Loudoun County Parkway and neighboring communities are severely impacted. These hardworking families have made significant investments in their homes, neighborhoods, and communities, and actively contribute to the rich tapestry that is Loudoun County.”
There are multiple lines proposed in the plan that the SCC would have to choose from. The county school board voted against two of the proposed paths unless Dominion would be willing to bury the lines underground. However, the utility said it had run a feasibility study that showed it would be difficult to bury the lines given the acreage, water supply and other resources needed to do so.
If the school board does not change its stance, the routes that cut through the backyards on top of the hill from Rock Ridge High School and follow Loudoun County Parkway would become more likely to be selected. The county doesn’t favor the lines running along the Parkway and how it would look.
The lawmakers asked for the SCC to consider if the project is truly needed, to conduct an independent analysis of burying the lines, to prioritize pathways that minimize public impact by finding new routes other than what is in the proposal, and to look into all the reliable data on health risks related to high-powered transmission lines.
“We must take their concerns seriously as they face numerous harms, both temporary and long-term, including health risks, diminished views, declining property values, noise pollution, restricted access and land use limitations, and environmental damage. They deserve better,” the lawmakers wrote.
Dominion has stated that the final piece of the loop is critical to meet the power demand for the data centers. If the final portion of the loop is not built it could damage energy infrastructure and cause other issues for the entire coverage area, a spokesperson for Dominion said in a previous interview. The company could also face violations from the regional grid provider, PJM Interconnection, if they don’t supply the power to the area by 2028.
There are two public hearings about the transmission lines scheduled September 18 and September 29 at Rock Ridge High School near Loudoun Valley Estates. The official SCC hearing, where both sides will present their arguments for the project, will be on Dec. 15.

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)While the election for Maine’s next governor is still more than a year out, several candidates have already made day one pledges to support a cause that’s been stalled by the current governor: tribal sovereignty. 
Seven of the 16 candidates running for governor in 2026, when Gov. Janet Mills will term out, have vowed to back sweeping reform. Most are Democrats, but not all.
“It’s the right f***ing thing to do,” said Democrat Troy Jackson, former president of the Maine Senate, when he was the first to announce on May 19 that he’d submit a bill to restore tribal sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations on day one of his administration. 
Jackson told Maine Morning Star the support among gubernatorial candidates to restore full sovereignty to the Tribes shows that this issue is likely to be a priority of the next administration, regardless of whether he wins.
Further, he sees the support as reason for the Maine Legislature to act before then and pass legislation when lawmakers return in January. The Legislature carried over a sweeping tribal sovereignty proposal, so lawmakers already have a vehicle to do so. 
“But if they won’t,” Jackson said, “the next governor should lead on this.” 
The Houlton Band of Maliseet, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation — collectively known as the Wabanaki Nations — are treated differently than other federally recognized tribes. This is because of a 1980 land settlement agreement that left them with a relationship to the state more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations.  
Mills, a Democrat, has approached changing this dynamic on a case-by-case basis, pushing through piecemeal adjustments while rejecting attempts to overhaul the agreement, which has put her at odds with many members of her own party. 
But, increasingly, tribal sovereignty has garnered bipartisan support. 
Sponsored by House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), the latest attempt at another incremental change — a bill to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use — passed both chambers but was ultimately vetoed by Mills.  
Some of that bipartisan support extends to the gubernatorial hopefuls. 
Pledges of full sovereignty 
Two other Democratic candidates announced similar plans on the campaign trail to sign legislation that would recognize the full sovereignty of the Wabanaki Nations — Hannah Pingree when she announced her candidacy in June, and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows this week. 
Maine Morning Star’s outreach to all candidates about this issue shows support is even more widespread than that.
State Sen. Rick Bennett, a former Republican who left the party when launching his independent bid for governor, told Maine Morning Star that he plans to propose sweeping sovereignty legislation if elected, which is in line with his support of such proposals as a senator. 
“These four are uniquely discriminated against,” Bennett said of the Wabanaki Nations, “largely because the state refuses to take action.”
The last attempt to overhaul the Settlement Act, LD 1626 in 2022, would have allowed the Tribes to self-govern within their respective territories in accordance with the same federal laws that generally govern tribal lands elsewhere in the U.S. by enacting most of the recommendations of the task force convened in 2019 to review the Settlement Act. 
After initially passing the Legislature, the bill died on what’s known as the “appropriations table” allegedly because of its cost. But, really, Bennett said, “The reason that happened was the governor said that she didn’t want to see it on her desk.”

Mills had sent a letter asking legislative and tribal leaders to stand down on their effort, citing concerns it could lead to increased litigation and more division, and the bill then died without final action. 
Bennett said this was an example of “legislative dysfunction and of the unfortunate politics that prevail in Augusta,” a point he made at the time on the Senate floor when he attempted to move it off the table, to no avail. 
Looking back, Jackson criticized Mills’ concern about possible litigation, saying, “that type of reaction can be made to every piece of legislation… If you’re going to worry about the fact that somebody’s going to sue you in the United States, then you’re not going to do anything and governments should just shut down.”
Jackson added, “Every other state has made some way to have tribal sovereignty work, and it is working to some extent. Why Maine — that is supposed to be the state that leads — can’t lead on this issue is beyond me.”
That type of broad legislation is what Bennett, Jackson and others are generally referring to when they say they’d propose a bill to recognize full Wabanaki sovereignty. An earlier omnibus bill died when the Legislature adjourned early at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Insight on how gubernatorial candidates who have served in the Legislature will approach tribal issues can be gleaned from their past votes. 
Bennett did not have the opportunity to vote on LD 1626, but the scorecard released by the Wabanaki Alliance — a coalition formed to push for state recognition of tribal sovereignty — that year noted he was a vocal supporter of it. Bennett has otherwise supported much of the legislation the alliance has backed, including one bill that sought to restore access to beneficial federal laws, though it ultimately failed. 
Jackson voted for the omnibus bill and overall voted 100% in line with Wabanaki Alliance stances on other proposals in his final three sessions in the Legislature, since the group started ranking lawmakers in the 129th Legislature, 2019-2020.
Bellows, a former state senator, also voted 100% in line with Wabanaki Alliance stances during her last term.
Sen. James Libby, who is running as a Republican for governor, was not in the Legislature when the last omnibus bill was considered. He’s since voted in line with the Wabanaki Nations on some of their other priority bills — including the proposal to access federal laws — but against others — such as the recent bill to ban eminent domain of tribal land. Libby did not respond to Maine Morning Star’s requests for comment.
While not in the Legislature, Pingree served in the Mills administration as head of the Office of Policy Innovation and the Future until stepping down this spring to run for governor. She has tried to distance herself from Mills’ approach to tribal sovereignty in particular. 
“I support full tribal sovereignty and would sign legislation to advance that goal,” Pingree said in a statement to Maine Morning Star. “The Wabanaki Nations deserve the same rights as every other federally recognized tribe, not only as a matter of fairness and justice, but to build a stronger future. I have worked with tribal leaders on climate resilience and look forward to expanding partnerships on economic development, health care, infrastructure, natural resources, and environmental protection.”

Democrat Kenneth Pinet of South Portland vowed to grant full sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations but did not say whether he’d propose legislation himself.
“In essence, I will direct and support immediate and comprehensive action to confer full sovereignty upon the Indigenous tribes of Maine,” Pinet said in a statement to Maine Morning Star. 
Similarly, Republican Kenneth Capron, a Portland-based retired Certified Public Accountant and financial fraud investigator, did not share specific plans for legislation but said in a statement, “I can’t wait for a chance to stand up and fight for the rights of our Tribes and their sovereignty.” 
He said his support stems from seeing the respect shown when his father worked as a doctor and treated some Passamaquoddy citizens. 
“As a result, I have always had a warmth toward all Indigenous peoples — not from guilt for what settlers did to them but because they are good people,” Capron added. 
Independent John Glowa supports tribal sovereignty, according to his campaign website, though he did not respond to Maine Morning Star’s requests for comment. He wrote on his website that tribal sovereignty would be a win-win for the Tribes and state by allowing the Tribes to grow their economy and bring prosperity to their regions. 
“To say that the U.S. government and the State of Maine have abused, neglected and taken advantage of Maine’s indigenous people is an understatement,” his website reads. “The Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 and the continuing refusal of the State of Maine to recognize their sovereignty are prime examples.”
Contingent support
Other candidates who responded to Maine Morning Star are not promising full tribal sovereignty. 
Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. Sen. Angus King, said in a statement, “We’ve got to get the legislation right with new and trusted voices focused on honoring and respecting the rights of the Wabanaki Nations and the surrounding communities.”
King, who works in the renewable energy sector, said the state needs to do things differently than it has, but didn’t elaborate on how, aside from saying he’d “bring all voices to the table, listen and take real action.”
“The truth is that the trust between the state and the Wabanaki Nations has continued to erode since the settlement act was signed decades ago, and the world has changed as well,” he said. “As governor, I would look forward to rebuilding those relationships and working on changes that reflect the needs of every community.”
Expanded tribal authority over prosecuting crimes takes effect

Democrat Jason Cherry, who previously ran an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate as an independent, said he is in favor of the Wabanaki Nations’ return to self-determination, with some caveats. One is ensuring that Maine law enforcement has concurrent jurisdiction or a memorandum of understanding to investigate crimes. 
Last year, the state passed a law that expanded Wabanaki authority to prosecute more serious offenses committed on tribal territory by tribal members. Cherry did not respond to follow up questions regarding whether he’d be looking to change that new law.
The other caveat to full sovereignty Cherry has is with gambling, though he said, “I would not be against a casino per se, but would want some limitations due to the impact on impoverished communities.”
Among the many federal laws that do not apply to the Wabanaki Nations due to the Settlement Act is one that offers federally recognized tribes the right to exclusively regulate and take in revenue from gambling on tribal lands.
In 2022, the Maine Legislature amended the act to permit Tribes to handle sports betting. This year, lawmakers attempted to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine and afford the Tribes more revenue from gambling at private casinos. The latter was carried over into the next session, which begins in January, while the igaming bill is being held by the governor.  
“The reason I am in favor of self-determination for the Wabanaki Nation is that they deserve a right to repair the loss of the land and their identities,” Cherry said. “It is not ‘woke-ism’ to accept that our ancestors took these lands by force. The ability to at least rectify that moral wrong in some part is a sign of being mature, courageous, compassionate, and honest.”
Unclear at this time
Republican Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former President Ronald Reagan and both Bush administrations, said the issue had not been top of mind for him but that he will do “a deep dive and try to more fully understand the issue, all equities, and where my own thinking comes out.” 
Independent Alexander Murchison has no plans to introduce tribal sovereignty legislation at this time. “Being unfamiliar with the issue, he would require more information on the matter before making any clear stances for the time being,” his campaign office shared in a statement. 
The following candidates did not respond to requests for comment and have not otherwise publicly shared their stance on tribal sovereignty: Republican David Jones, Republican Owen McCarthy, Republican Ben Midgley and Republican Robert Wessels. Maria Aguilo and Steven Sheppard filed paperwork to run for governor as Republicans, but their candidate status is now listed as “terminated” on the state’s website.

(Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

 ‘Hold people accountable’

Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.










I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat


During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
 ‘What is your why?’

Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Retired military and active-duty Ohio families spoke out against Gov. Mike DeWine recently deploying Ohio National Guard troops to Washington D.C. at the request of President Donald Trump. 
Trump said earlier this month he would send National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to crackdown on crime and Ohio is one of six states that has so far sent troops to Washington D.C. 
Violent crime in Washington D.C. is at a thirty year low and Toledo, Dayton, and Cleveland all had a higher crime rate than Washington D.C. in 2024. 
“This is not a national emergency,” said VALOR Media Network President Kenneth Harbaugh. “The impact on the morale of these soldiers on the ground is palpable when they are pulled away from their families, when they have to miss birthdays and graduations and the beginning of school and things like that to go guard a Shake Shack.”
Trump has also talked about possibly sending troops to other cities including Chicago, New York, and Baltimore.  
“The current deployments … and the ones that are being contemplated in other places throughout the country in the near future are unnecessary and disruptive to the lives of all these citizen soldiers,” said Christopher Dziubek, retired U.S. Army Brigadier General. 
Secretary of the Army Daniel P. Driscoll asked DeWine on Aug. 15 to send 150 members from the Ohio National Guard to Washington D.C. and members of the Ohio National Guard are currently there on a 30-day deployment. 
Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Tennessee have also sent troops — all states with Republican governors. 
“These deployments to D.C. are not an emergency and are an overstep in the use of our military,” said Ohio Army National Guard veteran Jermaine Collins. “It’s downright disrespectful to our citizen soldiers to pull them away from their families and their communities to police the unhoused population in D.C. and assist ICE in mass deportations.” 
Part of Trump’s crackdown on crime comes from a recent executive order that forces those experiencing homelessness off the streets.
“Our loved ones are being deployed, not for defense, not for disaster relief, not for emergencies, but for missions that are vague, polarizing, and even cosmetic,” said Brandi Jones, an Ohio military spouse and co-executive director of Secure Families Initiative. “Beautification of cities is not the job of the military.”
The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has not asked for National Guard troops to be deployed, and Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has spoken out against the deployment.
“Folks did not sign up for the National Guard to become political pawns,” Collins said. “If our citizen soldiers wanted to become Metro P.D. or ICE agents, they would have signed up for that instead of the National Guard. … National Guard troops shouldn’t be used as political pawns.”
Trump does have the authority to request National Guard troops to Washington D.C.
“But the trigger for using those legal authorities is in an emergency situation … where normal local authorities are hamstrung by lack of resources, or they’re utterly overrun by violent rioters, protesters, insurrectionists, (or) rebels,” said Dan Maurer, U.S. Army veteran and Ohio Northern University College of Law associate professor.
Sixty cities have a higher violent crime rate than Washington D.C., he said. 
“The governor should have asked questions … like, ‘Well, what exactly is the emergency we’re facing? … What are the facts on the ground that justify the extraordinary use of another state’s National Guard on the streets of American cities to do law enforcement?” Maurer said. 
The Ohio National Guard is one of the largest in the country with around 17,000 soldiers and airmen, according to the 122nd Army National Guard Band. 
Advocates are calling on DeWine to bring the deployed National Guards troops home.

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.
Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.
And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.
Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.
Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.
“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.
But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.
“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”
Permitting
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.
State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.
For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.
But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.
“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.
Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.
Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.
“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”
Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.










We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.


– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office


State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.
Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.
“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.
Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.
O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.
Interconnection
Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.
Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.
Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.
In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.
O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”
New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.
Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.
“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.
Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

Luis Alonso Juárez, a Honduran, who is well-known across Duke’s campus for operating a “party bus,” made the announcement outside the Regulator Bookstore on Ninth Street surrounded by students, faculty and others who said he brought joy to their lives by playing lively music on his route.
A scheduled press conference on the Duke campus was cancelled and moved to the bookstore after Duke University officials threatened Juárez with disciplinary action if the press conference was held on campus, according to Siembra NC, a grassroots immigrant advocacy group.
Supporters were asked to ride Juárez’s bus this week in a show of solidarity. Juárez will travel to Raleigh on Sept. 4 to meet with Budd and the leaders of General Assembly.
Juárez was granted Temporary Protected Status in 1998, according to a press released shared by Siembra NC. That status will expire Sept. 8 due to a Trump administration order terminating TPS protection for Honduras.
Because Juárez entered the U.S. without inspection or authorization and is not married to a U.S. citizen, under current immigration law, he does not qualify for another form of protection like a work visa or green card.
Without protected status, Juárez, and as many as 51,000 other Hondurans across the country will be eligible for removal, according to Siembra NC.

“He’s [Juárez] been working at Duke for 19 years but because of these decisions made by the Trump administration, thousands of people are about to lose their protective status,” said Nikki Marin Baena, co-director at Siembra NC.
Speaking through an interpreter, Juárez said he wants to remain in the United States because he likes his “work as a bus driver.” The 54 year-old previously worked in the construction industry but said it is unrealistic at this point for someone his age to return to that kind of work.
“I’m all over the campus and they [students, faculty and colleagues], like my work and they want me to keep doing it,” Juárez said.
Immigration attorneys have advised Juárez that his only short-term path to retain a work permit would be for the Trump administration to grant an extension of protection from removal, much like his first term. In 2021, President Donald Trump issued a Deferred Enforced Departure designation for Venezuelans present in the U.S. on or before Jan. 20, 2021, which granted them 18 months of deferred removal and employment authorization.  He has twice extended such protections for Liberians.
Andrew Willis Garcés, a senior strategist for Siembra NC, said the organization is unaware to what extent Duke has reached out to help Juárez or others who might be in a similar predicament.
“Right now, they’re [immigrants] about to just lose their paycheck, which could mean they lose their mortgages, could mean they lose all kinds of things and it doesn’t look to me like they [Duke leaders] have yet taken the step of trying to figure out how they can help these workers, even if they can’t help them with their legal status or their work permits, what else could they do?” Garcés said.
Juárez has become a popular figure on the Duke campus. He was profiled in the Duke Chronicle in February. And last month, 477 students, faculty and staff submitted letters of support for Juárez to Duke Visa Services, asking the university to take action on his behalf.
Several students showed up Tuesday to support Juárez.
Duke senior Joyce Thomas has been riding Juárez’s bus since she was freshman. Thomas said Juárez has helped build community at the university, and that he and other staff members are not replaceable.
“Without people like Luis, I would not feel how I do at Duke,” Thomas said.
  Katya Weslowksi (Photo by Greg Childress/NC Newsline)
Professor Katya Weslowksi, an anthropologist and dancer, said she met Juárez last spring after she began riding his bus.  Weslowksi was taken by his cheerfulness and the “fabulous” music he plays, she said.
Weslowski worked on a plan to incorporate Juárez into her curriculum but the two couldn’t get together to pull it off, she said.
“This is an illustration about how the workers at Duke are not invisible,” Weslowski said. “They are not extracurricular. They are not doing work behind the scenes. They are integral to Duke education, to our students’ education.”
Members of the Union of Southern Service Workers also showed up to support Juárez.
“This is an attack on all workers,” said Mama Cookie, a community organizer and retired food service worker. “If we allow this to happen and not stand in unity with Luis [Juárez], we’re going to be in trouble.”

Nah’Shon Blount, a Duke housekeeper, noted that Juárez’s immigration issues come amid heavy layoffs at the university due to a Trump administration threat to reduce funding over race-related discrimination claims.

On most Friday afternoons, you can find Jeff Dorman hanging out in the kitchen at Modern Apizza in New Haven. He chats with the chefs while they prepare more than a dozen pies, which he then shuttles over to the pediatric cancer center at Yale New Haven Hospital. 
This very special weekly pizza delivery is part of Dorman’s work at the Feeding Families Foundation, a non-profit he started with his wife, Sam Dorman, that helps support parents of children undergoing cancer treatment who don’t have easy access to regular meals as they care for their children. 
The foundation pays for food from the hospital and, on some days, delivers from some of New Haven’s most beloved restaurants to the hospital rooms.
The couple launched the organization last year to address a pain point they experienced first-hand: It can be expensive and inconvenient to eat when you’re in the hospital caring for a kid with cancer.

In September 2022, the Dormans’ 2-year-old daughter, Harper, was diagnosed with leukemia. Sam stayed at home in North Haven, caring for their oldest daughter, Olivia, and their newborn, Madison, while Jeff spent his days in the hospital with Harper, sometimes for weeks at a time.
Her meals were provided. But when Dorman started ordering hospital food for himself, the cost — at $10 a plate, two or three times a day — started adding up quickly.
Cancer patients and their families often experience financial strain that goes beyond the most obvious expense of medical bills, Jeff Dorman said. A parent or caregiver may be forced to scale back or stop working altogether to manage a loved one’s care, resulting in lost income. Over time, smaller expenses — like hospital parking, gas to cover trips to the doctor, and meals for anyone other than the patient — all begin to add up, too.

“The longer you’re in it, all of these different things start to mount and get very, very expensive. Food being one of them,” Dorman said.
During one of Harper’s hospital stays, an employee with the facility’s food services vendor at the time noticed Dorman wasn’t finding the time to eat. She offered to deliver and comp his meals for the duration of their stay. That small act made all the difference, he said.
“Having an omelette and a cup of coffee changes the whole trajectory of the day,” Dorman said. “The added stress of being hungry on top of all the other stress — that went away.”

When the Dormans were brainstorming ways to help other families facing a devastating diagnosis, they thought back to the impact of those meals. 
When they started Feeding Families in January 2024, the service began by delivering one hospital meal a day, free of charge, to parents of children getting treated on the pediatric hematology oncology floor at Yale New Haven Hospital. Roughly five months later, they bumped it up to two meals per day.
When they began, small-dollar donations fueled the operation. Now, grants and bigger donors also help support the effort.
The Feeding Families Foundation plays an integral role in supporting patients beyond direct treatment, Kevin Billingsley, chief medical officer at Yale Cancer Center, said.

Physicians focus on the medical needs of the patient, but “there’s so much that goes into tending to the well-being of not just the patient but the family,” Billingsley said. “Jeff and Sam … recognized a need and brought people together to address that, and it’s so powerful.”
Today, the Feeding Families Foundation has delivered more than 2,000 meals. Later this year, they’re slated to expand their services to the pediatric intensive care unit at the hospital. In addition to the “Parent Plate Program,” which delivers meals, they have a “Snacks Program” that makes snacks available 24/7 for families who find themselves admitted to the hospital at odd hours of the night or early morning.
New Haven’s restaurant scene is getting involved, too. In addition to Modern, which donates pizza every Friday, Nolo provides pizza every Monday. Olmo Bagels, Haven Hot Chicken and the North Haven Olive Garden also regularly donate meals.

The foundation provides a way for the entire family to process the cancer experience, the Dormans said.
Harper finished treatment in June, three years after her initial diagnosis, and started kindergarten this week. Olivia, the Dormans’ oldest daughter, just started second grade, and Madison, who was born just weeks after her sister was diagnosed, turns three in October. Sometimes the girls accompany their parents on meal deliveries to the hospital.

(Photo courtesy of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.)More than a dozen faith leaders gathered at the Ohio Statehouse Monday to urge Gov. Mike DeWine to speak out on behalf of a Muslim cleric whom the Trump administration is trying to deport. 
Ayman Soliman, a former chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, is being held in the Butler County Jail as Immigration and Customs Enforcement tries to deport him to Egypt. 
After being granted asylum in 2018, Soliman was arrested on July 9 as federal officials have used a shifting set of reasons and misrepresentations to get him out of the country. 
“The case against Ayman Soliman is non-existent,” Tala Ali, who was with Soliman at the time of his arrest, said Monday.
Under pressure from President Donald Trump to make 3,000 immigration-related arrests a day, officials accused Soliman of providing “material support” to terrorists in Egypt more than a decade ago. 
Soliman was beaten and tortured by Egypt’s totalitarian government after he worked with western journalists during the Arab Spring uprising, his lawyers said last month.
Trump administration lawyers accused Soliman of supporting terrorism because his organization provided charitable services before the Egyptian uprising that sometimes overlapped with those provided by the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organization. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
However, the brotherhood is not listed as a terrorist organization by the United States. And its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, won an internationally recognized election in 2012. A military coup deposed that government in 2013 and later jailed Soliman for his work as a journalist.
Soliman came to the United States in 2014, seeking asylum. The Egyptian government that jailed him is still in power, and Soliman’s supporters said the consequences will be dire if he is forced to return.
Ali said “it would surely be a death sentence for him.” 
As a state official, DeWine has no power over Soliman’s case. But the cleric’s supporters are hoping the Republican governor will speak in support of Soliman as he did last year for Haitian refugees living in Springfield.
Trump and his then-running mate, then-Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance, spread the racist lie that Haitians were stealing neighbors’ pets and eating them. Now the Trump administration is attempting to end temporary protected status for 348,000 Haitians nationwide, forcing many back to a country that doesn’t have a functioning government.
The clerics gathered at the Ohio Statehouse Monday said Soliman’s continued imprisonment is a “significant loss to the spiritual and moral well‑being of many Ohioans.” 
That’s why they were asking DeWine to speak out.
“Throughout your decades of service — as Prosecutor, Attorney General, U.S. Senator, and now Governor  — you have acted with courage when injustice demanded it,” they said in a letter they delivered by hand. “In 2024, you defended Haitian immigrants in Springfield, affirming that compassionate immigration aligns with Ohio’s values. During the COVID‑19 pandemic, you prioritized human life even in difficult political contexts. Time and again, you have demonstrated a willingness to do what is right.” 
But it’s not clear that the governor will take up their cause.
“We have not issued any statements on this,” DeWine’s press secretary, Dan Tierney, said in an email when asked about Soliman.
For the coming months, anyway, it seems likely that the cleric will remain behind bars in Ohio. He was scheduled for a hearing Tuesday morning conducted by an immigration judge in Cleveland. It’s part of a proceeding that might determine his ultimate status. 
But Soliman and his lawyers are also challenging his detention in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. A judge there last week ruled that ICE can’t take him out of Ohio at least until Oct. 7, when the court will hear arguments about the lawfulness of his detention.
Adam Allen worked as a chaplain with Soliman at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital until being fired last month for speaking publicly in support of Soliman. The Mennonite said people were better off because Soliman sought refuge in Ohio.
“Ayman is truly the example of someone we want in this country,” Allen said. “His advocacy for others, his selflessness, and his deep conviction and godly compassion are things that have impacted thousands of families.”

Funding for local schools typically is the biggest share of a homeowner’s property tax bill. State dollars help level out funding among affluent and less affluent districts.
“So generally, districts with greater capacity locally to raise revenue are expected to do so, and they’re getting less money from the state of Ohio. Districts with lower capacity are getting more of their total revenue from state sources,” Ohio Department of Education and Workforce Deputy Chief of Staff Aaron Rausch explained.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Figuring out how much state money goes where depends on local income and property values. As appraisals around Ohio shoot up, homeowners’ taxes climb as state support recedes. Many communities are feeling a pinch.
“All of this is calculated on a per pupil basis,” Rausch said. “So, the perfect storm is a district that is losing student enrollment while at the same time their property values are going up.”
“That impacts them twice as much,” he added, “because they have greater local revenue, or potential to raise revenue, and they are serving a smaller student population.”
Rausch explained the problem is widespread because most districts are enrolling fewer students than they did five or 10 years ago. An exception are suburban districts like Dublin City Schools, Superintendent John Marschhausen said. But because they tend to be wealthier, their state share per pupil is much smaller.
“The state is not going to help, really, materially educate those kids when it comes to the state funding formula,” Marschhausen said.
In either circumstance, though, rising property values tend to put greater emphasis on local dollars and less on state funding.
Three options
Ohio’s governor, lawmakers, and grassroots organizers are all wrestling over property tax reform

Working group co-chair Pat Tiberi, a former Republican congressman who heads up the Ohio Business Roundtable, brought up what he called “the elephant in the room” — a citizen initiative to eliminate property taxes.
Although he insisted it would be “devastating” for the state, he empathizes with frustrated Ohioans.
Perhaps more important, Tiberi is concerned about the extent of the idea’s appeal.
“I had a local government official — a moderate local government official — who said to me after I got named to this, ‘I hope you come up with a solution, because I’m going to sign the petition if you don’t,’” Tiberi described.
Working group co-chair Bill Seitz, a longtime Republican state lawmaker from Cincinnati, argued there are three options on the table if lawmakers want to deliver immediate property tax relief — a deferral, refund, or exemption.
The first idea wouldn’t change what homeowners owe, but it would give them more time to pay. Seitz warned delaying payments comes with several attendant question like whether to charge interest or set a minimum amount of home equity.
A refund program, typically referred to as a circuit breaker, is a way of means testing property taxes.
One current proposal sets a ceiling at 5% of a homeowner’s household resources. If their property taxes clear that ceiling, they can claim a tax rebate of up to $1,000. The idea is to protect less affluent homeowners from getting taxed out of their home, while continuing to levy taxes on homeowners who can afford them.
Like most bright-line policies, the question of where to make the cut off will be hotly debated and create winners and losers.
The homestead exemption reduces taxes for certain homeowners by shielding a portion of the home’s value from tax. Seniors, disabled Ohioans and the families of fallen first responders get to exempt roughly $25,000 or $50,000 from tax.
Seitz argued the loudest complaints he’s hearing come from senior citizens living on a fixed income.
“There should be some targeted relief at those people first,” he said, “It’s like the women and children get on the lifeboat first, and the rest of us will go down with a Titanic.”
But Tiberi pushed back. Expanding the homestead exemption is perhaps the simplest policy change on the table, he said, and lawmakers have so far refused to do it.
Tiberi contends the idea of effectively cutting a check by expanding the exemption is “dead on arrival” and the working group should think outside the box.
Frustrated, Seitz acknowledged lawmakers can ignore recommendations to expand the homestead exemption, “but then don’t say we want to do something about the 97-year-old lady that’s getting taxed out of her house when you’re not willing to do anything to help the 97-year-old lady.”
Other ideas
One possibility that got positive reviews from most working group members would restrict property tax increases to the rate of inflation. Ohio House Bill 186 offers a version of that idea.
Under current law, property tax rates on voter-approved levies get reduced as home values increase.
The idea is voters shouldn’t pay more (without voting on it) just because their home became more valuable. But there’s a catch — those rate reductions have a hard stop at 20 mills (or 2%), known as the 20-mill floor. So, if property values rise high enough there’s nothing to keep taxes from rising with them.
For districts at the 20-mill floor, HB 186 would limit property tax increases (at least for voter approved levies) to the overall rate of inflation since the last reappraisal.
The measure also rejiggers the calculation for state funding make up for some of the money districts aren’t getting from local residents.
The working group is slated to meet again Thursday, and Gov. Mike DeWine has tasked them with delivering a set of recommendations for lawmakers by Sep. 30.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story)One of Ohio’s top union leaders is hopeful that the Trump administration’s new $9 billion investment in tech giant Intel will help push the state’s long-awaited semiconductor manufacturing plant forward.
“The Intel project, it’s been like a roller-coaster,“ said Mike Knisley with the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council.
Ohio’s long-awaited multi-billion-dollar facility has faced delay after delay after delay. We’ve been reporting for years on Intel’s massive Central Ohio semiconductor manufacturing facility — one that was supposed to be operational by now — and its financial hardships.
“I think the investment from the government or even outside sources would bring some stability to the company and to the project itself, especially here in Ohio,” Knisley said.
Thousands of workers have been waiting on the sidelines, Knisley says, but he adds that could change under President Donald Trump’s new deal.
“They’ve had some bad management over the years and they got lost,” Trump said Friday.
The president announced that the government will make a nearly $9 billion investment in Intel stock, a 10% stake in the company.
“This comes to the United States of America, and I said, ‘I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,’ (CEO Lip-Bu Tan) agreed, and they’ve agreed to do it, and I think it’s a great deal for them,” Trump said. “And I think it’s a great deal. He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States, so we picked up $10 billion, and we do a lot of deals like that. I’ll do more of them.”
Weeks ago, Trump and U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno asked for Tan to resign due to his reported ties to the Chinese government. After a meeting with Tan, Trump changed his mind.
But on Monday, Intel warned of “adverse impacts” due to the government being a “significant stockholder.”
“Sales outside the US accounted for 76% of the Company’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024,” Intel wrote in a business filing. “Having the US Government as a significant stockholder of the Company could subject the Company to additional regulations, obligations or restrictions, such as foreign subsidy laws or otherwise, in other countries.”
Although rare, Case Western Reserve University law professor Jonathan Entin said that after the 2008 crash, the federal government took temporary ownership interest in both GM and Chrysler.
“The goal was to keep those companies afloat at a time when they were facing the prospect of just failing, and the idea was not to maintain a long-term government ownership stake,” Entin said.
The Obama administration sold off its stake within a few years, he said, but that instance was also different because it had congressional approval.
“Up the burden of persuasion on the government to be able to say, ‘Well, just because it hasn’t been done doesn’t mean it couldn’t be done,'” Entin said.
Knisley shared concerns about the Trump administration’s say in the company’s future projects, but Intel said in its official press release that the government won’t have a seat on the board.
“I don’t believe that the government should have the majority stake in it or should have a say over a private company’s business dealings,” Knisley said.
We reached out to Intel to hear how this deal would impact Ohio and didn’t hear back. In their official press release, the company said that this would “accelerate” their effort to make chips.
“I’m cautiously optimistic,” Knisley said. “I would love to see it compress a little bit and get it done before 2030.”
Knisley is meeting with construction managers this week to talk about the announcement.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)A child dies a gruesome death. The child was “known to the system.” In fact, the case file had more “red flags” than a Soviet May Day parade. That leaves everyone asking: “How could it have happened?”
The answer is counterintuitive.
Tragedies like the death of Zoey Felix, who was killed after slipping through the cracks, happen in every state. But they are more likely to happen in Kansas. That’s because Kansas has embraced an approach to child welfare that can be boiled down to: Take the child and run. Kansas tears apart so many families needlessly that workers have less time to find those very few children — like Zoey — who really do need to be taken.
Kansas takes children from their parents and consigns them to foster care at a rate double the national average, even when rates of child poverty are factored in. Those are only the placements the Kansas Department for Children and Families admits to. Add what DCF calls “police protective custody” placements — foster care in all but name — and Kansas probably takes away children at triple the national average; the third highest rate in America.
Overwhelmingly, parents whose children are taken are nothing like the killer of Zoey Felix. In 76% of cases in which DCF took away a child in 2023, there was not even an allegation of sexual abuse or any form of physical abuse. In 78% of cases, there was not even an allegation of any form of drug abuse.
Far more common are allegations of neglect. Sometimes that can be extremely serious; more often it means a family is poor. Kansas was the scene of a massive natural experiment illustrating the confusion of poverty with neglect. When former Gov. Sam Brownback slashed public assistance, foster care numbers went up. Conversely, study after study finds that even small amounts of additional cash reduce what agencies like DCF call neglect.
The class bias is compounded by racial bias. Black children are in foster care in Kansas at more than quadruple their representation in the general population. More than half of all Black children will endure the trauma of a child abuse investigation before they are 18, and more than 14% will endure foster care — only nine other states are worse.
Still another indication that Kansas tears apart families needlessly can be seen in those police protective custody placements. Those that do not become official foster care placements last no more than six days. Potential child rapists and murderers don’t get rehabilitated in six days. But six days torn from everyone a child knows and loves is plenty of time to traumatize that child. If you can send the child home within six days, you almost certainly never needed to take the child at all.
Consider the harm:
The rotten outcomes for many foster children were vividly documented by the Kansas City Star. When the Star went looking for young people who’d been in foster care, they started in one of the places they are disproportionately likely to be found: Jails. So it’s no wonder multiple studies find that, in typical cases, children left in their own homes fare better even than comparably maltreated children placed in foster care.
Multiple studies also find abuse in one-quarter to one-third of family foster homes; the rate in group homes and institutions is even worse. This is, of course, far more abuse than DCF acknowledges. But, as we’ve recently seen, DCF has a system that virtually guarantees a lot of abuse in foster care will be overlooked.
Even that isn’t the worst of it. All the time, money and effort wasted on thousands of false reports, needless investigations and needless foster care placements is, in effect, stolen from finding children like Zoey Felix.
Two key steps can start Kansas down the road to making all children safer:

Become laser-focused on ameliorating the worst harms of poverty. Small amounts of additional help can go a long way. Kansas can afford it. Because foster care is so much more expensive than better alternatives, Kansas actually spends on child welfare at one of the highest rates in the nation.
Provide every family with high-quality defense from the moment DCF shows up at the door. That means a lawyer with a reasonable caseload, a social worker and sometimes a parent advocate who’s been through the system herself. No, it’s not to get “bad parents” off; it’s to craft alternatives to the cookie-cutter “service plans” doled out by DCF. This approach has been proven to safely reduce foster care with no compromise of safety. The federal government will pay half the cost in many cases, and the rest is likely to be covered by reduced foster care expenses.

Reducing needless placements does not guarantee fewer tragedies like the death of Zoey Felix, but it’s an essential prerequisite. Failing to reduce needless placements guarantees such tragedies will repeat over and over.

I’m an Information Systems professor with expertise in mobile technology applications, and my son is a tech enthusiast — so we teamed up to make an app that lets people quickly catalog and identify their boxes’ contents, making it much easier to unpack.
Fast-forward to 2025, and our app has been downloaded thousands of times; we’ve even partnered with a few local moving companies. It’s a labor of love, more than anything — we enjoy working together, trying out new ideas, and helping make moving less stressful for other families.
Unfortunately, a proposed Ohio bill — HB 226 — could make it harder for people to use our app, and more complicated and legally risky for us to run it. HB 226 aims to protect minors by strictly regulating how they access apps.
As a dad, I’m a strong supporter of online safety measures for kids. But the bill takes an overly broad approach that would saddle developers of completely benign apps — like mine — with costly and complex new compliance requirements.
HB 226 requires verified parental consent for every app downloaded by someone under 18, regardless of the app’s purpose — even if it’s as mundane as finding your own stuff in a cardboard box.
But forcing app stores to verify parental relationships introduces serious new obligations that small developers will struggle to fulfill.
Few minors have a government-issued ID, and there’s currently no reliable online method for confirming whether a consent-giver is actually a minor’s parent.
That means small developers like me could easily — and completely inadvertently — break the law.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
HB 226 presents small Ohio developers with additional legal and logistical worries. The bill requires us to receive, handle, and secure sensitive age-related data — even if we don’t want it.
My app isn’t intended for kids, and I’ve never asked for users’ ages. But if HB 226 became law, app stores would send me that information anyway. I’d then have to manage and secure it according to federal children’s privacy laws like COPPA.
That would cost thousands of dollars, which I — and most small app developers — can’t afford. Even worse, continually moving and storing kids’ data creates new risks that it will be leaked or hacked.
HB 226 would also make it harder for people to benefit from apps’ efficiencies. For instance, teachers use our app to help keep track of boxes of school supplies, especially at the start of the school year.
If the new law were in place, they couldn’t have kids help unpack the boxes with the aid of our app unless a parent — not even the teacher — approved it.
Similarly, teachers would have to get verified parental consent before using common digital learning tools like flashcard apps, educational games, or interactive reading platforms.
Strangely, HB 226 only applies to apps downloaded through app stores, not those downloaded directly from websites or pre-installed on devices.
That means the biggest companies and most common apps — including social media apps that many parents don’t want their kids using — can pay phone manufacturers to preinstall their apps, effectively buying exemption from the law!
That giant loophole leaves kids vulnerable to many of the apps that keep parents up at night, and punishes little guys like me who are trying to follow the rules and don’t have the money to buy our way out of compliance.
Ohio needs thoughtful, balanced policies that protect children online. Unfortunately, HB 226 misses the mark.
While introducing major regulatory burdens and legal risks for small developers who build safe tools, the bill’s loopholes offer easy exemption for makers of many of the most problematic apps.
Ohio lawmakers need to go back to the drawing board — because Ohio kids and families deserve better than HB 226.

(Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.
Minnesota assassination prompts many lawmakers to wonder: Is service worth the danger?

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

 ‘Hold people accountable’

Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.










I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat


During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
 ‘What is your why?’

Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
State leaders brace for ‘heavy lift’ from Medicaid, food stamp changes

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

Thomas Johnson High School in Frederick County on Aug. 20, as she and other local and state education officials visited on the first day of school of the 2025-26 school year for the county. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland public school students made modest gains in math and English language arts, but significant gaps remain between demographic groups, the latest test results show.
The Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP), which students took this spring, showed nearly 51% of students were proficient in language arts, an increase from about 48% in the 2023-24 school year.
The results mark the third straight year of language arts increases, gains that are being attributed in part to the “science of reading” curriculum that State Superintendent Carey Wright brought with her from Mississippi, where test scores rose significantly while she was superintendent there.
Fourth grade was the only level that saw their overall scores go down, form 49.3% in the 2023-24 school year to 48.4% in 20240-25, according to results reviewed Tuesday by the state Board of Education.
Math scores also rose, but they remained far behind language arts: About 26.5% of students were proficient in math, versus 24% in the previous school year.
The board approved a revision of math standards, and parts of a math policy will be implemented this year, which should help improve student outcomes, said Tenette Smith, chief academic officer with the state Department of Education.
“We are seeing progress, but there’s still important work” to be done, Smith said.
The data are from tests taken by students in the spring in grades three through eight in math and language arts. Language arts is also assessed in 10th grade. Student proficiency is also measured in specific math courses and in science for students in fifth and eighth grades.
At least two board members expressed concerns about the gaps between student groups, specifically Black and Latino students.
The biggest gap, according to the exam results, game in eighth grade science.

About 62% of Asian students were proficient in that subject last school year, compared to 53% in the 2023-24 school year. White student proficiency rose from 40% to nearly 49% in the same period. While other student groups also made progress, they still trailed:

Latino students went from 11.7% proficiency in 2023-24 to 17.1% last school year;
Black students rose from 12.3% in 2023-24 to 17% last school year.

Board member Alverne “Chet” Chesterfield asked why the same “set of folks still underperforming.” That was echoed by board member Nick Greer, who noted that the same concern was expressed last year and who asked what strategies will be looked at in the near future to help close those achievement gaps.
With the exception of language arts, the proficiency level for students with disabilities and multilingual students didn’t reach double digits.
“What we need to be doing as a state and as superintendents and principals … is identifying those specific children that were still struggling regardless what subgroup they’re in,” said Wright, the state superintendent, during a briefing with reporters Tuesday afternoon. “You’ve got to look at individual children, because each child’s needs are very individual, and that’s what we’re expecting schools to do.”
School systems vary
Worcester County, which recorded the second-highest proficiency level in math at 39.3% in 2023-24 school year, moved into first place last year with a rate of 47.7%. Despite a drop from 69.4% two years ago, Worcester County still had the highest English proficiency last year, at 68.5%.

One reason for that jurisdiction being the best in Maryland comes from consistent leadership, said state board President Joshua Michael. Worcester County school board member Jon Andes also was the school system’s superintendent from 1996 to 2012.
“This is a school district over decades that has had very few superintendents,” Michael said. “So there is a level of instructional coherence in that district. There’s a level of continuity in leadership.”
Just behind Worcester in math proficiency is Howard County, which recorded its students’ proficiency in math at 42%, pu from 41.1% two years ago.
Carroll County students had the second highest proficiency in English at 66.5%. Students in Dorchester County saw the biggest increase in English scores, rising from 33.7% to 41.3%.
Although Somerset County recorded the lowest student proficiency in math last school year at 10.1%, that was an improvement from the 9.8% recorded two years ago.
Despite the gains, lawmakers missed an opportunity to make scores even higher in the future, said Trish Brennan-Gac, executive director of Maryland READS, in an interview Tuesday.
The General Assembly approved a training program within the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act during this year’s 90-day legislative session. But no funding was attached to the program educators call a “coaching program.”
“We will not see as dramatic improvement in reading instruction in 2026 as we could have,” Brennan-Gac said. “Had the legislature funded that program, they would have been able to establish the coaching program this summer, train the coaches and begin to have them supporting teachers in the classroom this year, which means by the spring, when the MCAP scores were administered, students are more likely to have had better reading instruction and have reading proficiency rates increase.
“So next year, we will probably, hopefully see the same continued weak trend instead of a dramatic improvement,” she said. “So, if we want to see that dramatic improvement, then we have to get the coaching funded.”

Garmatz United States Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A federal judge Tuesday threw out what he called a “novel and potentially calamitous” attempt by the Trump administration to sue the entire federal court bench in Maryland over an order that put a two-day pause on deportations.
When a party disagrees with a court action, there is “a tried-and-true recourse,” wrote Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia — file an appeal. But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk and the court itself.
Given recent conflicts between the White House and the courts, “it’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely,” wrote Cullen, who was nominated by Trump in 2019. “Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”
But judges enjoy broad immunity for judicial acts, wrote Cullen in a 39-page ruling, adding that when co-equal branches of government are involved, “there is no right—express or implied—to litigate that grievance in this manner.”
“Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” wrote Cullen, who was assigned the case because of the conflict of Maryland judges hearing it.

The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Judge George L. Russell III, the chief judge of the Maryland district and the prime target of the administration’s lawsuit.
It was Russell’s order in May that sparked the lawsuit. Faced with a flood of habeas corpus petitions from immigrants facing deportation under the administration’s amped-up immigration enforcement, Russell ordered that deportations of those petitioning the court would be put on hold for at least two days, so that judges could schedule and review their cases.
On June 25, the Justice Department announced that it filed a complaint against the Maryland District Court judges, arguing that they had exceeded their authority with the 48-hour freeze on deportations because it interefered with the administration’s exclusive right to enforce immigration law.
“President Trump’s executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a written statement at the time.  “The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.”
But Cullen agreed with the Maryland judges that the Trump administration chose the wrong avenue to raise its issues with Russell’s order.
“If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” Cullen said. “And under normal circumstances, it would not be surprising if the Executive raised these  concerns through the channels Congress prescribed — that is, by challenging the orders as applied to a particular habeas proceeding through a direct appeal to the Fourth Circuit or, as expressly authorized by federal statute, by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules.”
“All of this isn’t to say that the Executive is without any recourse; far from it,” Cullen wrote. “If the Executive truly believes that Defendants’ standing orders violate the law, it should avail itself of the tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants: It should appeal.”
Mark Graber, regents professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, believes that the case was more of a stunt than an earnest legal challenge from the Trump administration.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Issuing an injunction against judges is a guaranteed loser,” he said. “What the Trump people were trying to accomplish may simply to have been noise and publicity …  Whether they really thought they could ever win this case is doubtful — and if somebody thought that they should ever win that case, that person should be fired for incompetence.”
Graber said that allowing the case to move forward would have “fundamentally changed the way our judicial system works.”
“The implications would be startling,” he said. “This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision. That’s not the way the separation of powers works. There’s a judicial system; it has a way of correcting errors – it’s called appeals.”
Graber compared the case to being charged for a crime in Maryland and then asking a judge in another state to issue an injunction against the judge who handed down the sentence.
“This is Law 101 — it is Law 101 to the point where virtually all non-lawyers know this,” he said.
Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.
“What the Trump administration is claiming – and this is not a horrible legal argument – is that the court could only issue orders with respect to the people before the court,” Graber said.
“There’s a legitimate debate on this, and if they appealed it, who knows what the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court would have done?” he said. “The problem is they didn’t appeal it in the normal way.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-08-27 02:57:21.888608

(Photo by SDI Productions via Getty Images)The Maryland State Board of Education approved a resolution Tuesday asking local school leaders to implement comprehensive cell phone policies “as soon as practicable” for the 2025-26 school year.
While there is no requirement to do so, the 24 school systems are encouraged to adopt policies that align with broad recommendations presented in April by a statewide Task Force on Cell Phone Use in Schools. Input in the recommendations came from various school and community leaders.
“This is not a mandate. This is just requesting local education agencies, your [school] district, have a policy that actually engages stakeholder input,” said O’Marie Barnes, a Prince George’s County high school student and the board’s student member.
Among the most important of those stakeholders are teachers, said Angela Duckworth, a University of Pennsylvania psychology professor who launched a survey this year, called “Phones in Focus” that aims to assess cell phone policies in schools nationwide.
The survey asks, “What is your school’s official policy for how students can use their phones?” and “How is student access to phones physically restricted?” among other questions. Duckworth, who participated in Tuesday’s board meeting via Zoom, said most schools have “no show” cell phone policies, meaning phones can’t be visible in school, by being placed in lockers, backpacks or even a student’s pocket.
New teachers, new policies as students, staff start to head back to school in Maryland

She said Maryland had the second-highest response rate, accounting for 7,863 responses of the more than 20,000 educators nationwide who took part. Based on responses in Maryland and throughout the country, Duckworth said, “The stricter the policy, the happier the educator. The stricter the policy, the less students are distracted in class.”
The resolution approved Tuesday does not make specific requirements, but it does ask that school districts “regularly revisit and assess the impact of cell phone use policies on student outcomes as well as to address any emerging or updated technology trends.”
In addition, it said, systems should “clearly define expectations for their policies, address emergency preparedness and engage public input.”
The Maryland State Education Association supports the resolution.
“We support this policy overall, as we want to make sure that cell phones are not distractions to students’ academic success or mental health,” said Paul Lemle, president of the state teacher’s union. “Importantly, this policy includes the … opportunity for local input to make sure local policies work well for local schools, educators, students, and parents.”
‘Keep an eye on’
Current rules are varied across the state, but the majority of school systems include provisions to provide exceptions for students with special needs such as an Individualized Education Program, or a 504 plan, which requires reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities.
Queen Anne’s County, like several systems, updated its policy this summer to allow students to receive telehealth appointments during the school day. This was a requirement the task force recommended for schools to have in place for this upcoming school year.
The Allegany County school board amended its cell phone policy in July so that cell phones “must be silenced during the school day.” However, high school students may use them during lunchtime. Middle school students can as well, but they must first get approval from a school administrator.

Harford County’s board amended its policy in June to prohibit all forms of technology, including cell phones, personal listening device or smartwatches during the school day. The Dorchester County school board voted last week to amend its policy to say that “recording acts of violence, illegal activities, or other inappropriate content” on school property is prohibited. Any video uploaded to social media or other web-based communication will result in an “immediate” 10-day suspension.
Board member Rachel McCusker, the first teacher from Carroll County public schools to serve on the board, who recently became an acting assistant principal, said continued assessment on cell phone policies should focus on enforcement. In some cases, she said teachers may have to enforce a policy that could have a negative effect on student-teacher relationships.
“A large percentage of teachers welcome policies to start to curb cell phone use in classrooms … but they also, which Dr. Duckworth said, they don’t want to be bad cop either,” McCusker said. “If there’s a way for us to study the enforcement piece and how that affects relationships, that would be really great for us to keep an eye on.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/girls-with-phones-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-27 02:57:21.888608

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The federal government has struck an agreement with Maryland, 23 states and the District of Columbia, to release the remainder of $6.8 billion in education funds frozen earlier this summer.
The U.S. Department of Education agreed to release any remaining funds between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 to resolve a lawsuit co-led by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and his counterparts in California, Colorado, and Massachusetts. The suit was filed July 14 in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
Rhode Island stood to lose around $29 million under the freeze, funds that were supposed to cover programs like after school and summer offerings, teachers’ professional development, English language acquisition, and adult education.
Neronha praised the multistate coalition’s success in a Tuesday statement.
“Because of our lawsuit and immense public pressure, billions in critical education funding will rightfully be restored to fund a wide range of important educational programs, without which the growth and enrichment of our young people would be stifled,” Neronha said. “That said, our victory in this case must be put into context: this funding was not the President’s to withhold in the first place.”
Maryland could have lost up to $110 million, according to Attorney General Anthony Brown.

“This victory ensures that Maryland’s K–12 schools and adult education programs will receive every dollar of the $110 million in federal education funding they were promised — resources they depend on to prepare our students for a brighter tomorrow,” Brown said in a statement released by his office Monday.
The joint agreement appears to conclude a saga that began on June 30, when federal officials notified state-level school departments nationwide that the funds were being clawed back.
On July 13, the day before the lawsuit’s filing, the feds relented slightly and released about $1.3 billion tied to Title IV-B grants, the only federal funding source for afterschool and summer learning programs.
The feds promised to release the remainder of the funds by July 25, with disbursements expected to arrive sometime over the week of July 28. The new joint agreement notes that the “first tranche” of funds did arrive the week of July 28, and it ensures that any remaining funds, which it labels the “second tranche” of subsidies, will arrive by the dates specified in October.
But, the agreement text makes it clear the feds and the states do not see eye to eye on the original withholding’s legality.
“Defendants do not concede that any of Plaintiffs’ claims are meritorious, but nevertheless intend to make the Second Tranche of funds available on or about October 1, 2025, but no later than October 3, 2025,” the agreement reads.
The Rhode Island Council on Elementary and Secondary Education — the governing body which oversees the Rhode Island Department of Education, effectively regulating all public K-12 education in the state — is set to discuss the lawsuit’s outcome in executive session at its Tuesday night meeting.
This was Neronha’s 26th lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration. The most recent, and Neronha’s 33rd overall, saw the Rhode Island AG join 20 other states in an Aug. 18 filing against new federal stipulations Victims of Crime Act grants.
“We have built the biggest and best law firm in the country, and we go to work every day for one client: the American people,” Neronha said.

Braswell said in a phone interview Tuesday night there was no loss for her.
“There was great energy amongst my community, but we also know where we are,” she said. “We knew that the only way to make strides here was to make small strides.”
Braswell said she was proud to have done better than Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris did in Cullman and Blount counties in last year’s election. According to election results, 9.1% of Blount County votes and 9.4% of Cullman County votes went to Harris. House District 11 does not cover all of either county.
In her concession speech released on social media, Braswell wished Allbright the best in Montgomery. However, she remained optimistic about a goal the Alabama Democratic Party has set for the next election cycle: to have every race contested.
“We need to brace Alabama in 2026 for every election being contested no matter the odds,” she said.
The seat was left open when former Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman. The district is solidly Republican. Shedd, who won the seat in a special election in 2013, never faced opposition in any subsequent general election.
In the May Republican primary, 654 people voted, according to election results. The turnout Tuesday was much higher, with 3,134 votes cast. Municipal elections were also Tuesday for the counties.
Cullman has another special House election scheduled for October in House District 12, which became vacant after former Rep.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa Republicans’ supermajority in the state Senate was broken Tuesday as Democrat Catelin Drey won the special election for Iowa Senate District 1.
Drey faced off against Republican Christopher Prosch in the election, which was called to fill the seat after Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, passed away due to pancreatic cancer in June. According to preliminary results, Drey, a 37-year-old from Sioux City, won the election by 55% to Prosch’s 44%, according to unofficial results published by the Woodbury County Auditor’s Office.
Iowa Democrats celebrated Drey’s victory, saying the Tuesday results — alongside results from other special elections this year — mark a turning point for the state party following several election cycles of overwhelming GOP victories.
Another Iowa Senate seat was flipped from Republican to Democrat in January, when Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, defeated Republican Katie Whittington in the special election to replace Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer as she joined Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration in December 2024.
In the Iowa House, Rep. Angelina Ramirez, D-Cedar Rapids, won a special election in April for a seat held by Democrat Rep. Sami Scheetz when he resigned to serve on the Linn County Board of Supervisors. Rep. Blaine Watkins, R-Donnellson, is the only Republican to win an Iowa special election in 2025, but Democrats pointed to his tight margin of victory as a positive sign for future elections.
“For the fourth special election in a row, Iowa voted for change,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement. “Catelin Drey will listen to the people, not the powerful, get our economy growing, and bring down costs for families. Christopher Prosch and Iowa Republicans spent over $180,000 on this race while Democrats from all over Iowa came together to give money, knock doors and write postcards. Our state is ready for a new direction and Iowa Democrats will keep putting forward candidates who can deliver better representation for Iowans.”
With Drey’s election, Republicans now hold a 33-17 majority in the Iowa Senate — down from the GOP supermajority held since the 2022 election cycle. While Republicans still have a trifecta of control with a supermajority in the House and all but one statewide elected office, breaking the supermajority does mean gubernatorial nominees requiring a two-thirds majority of approval could face a more difficult path to confirmation. However, as Reynolds has announced she will not run for reelection in 2026, it is unlikely many nominees will go before the state Senate in the 2026 legislative session.
Iowa Senate Democratic Leader Janice Weiner called Drey’s victory “a win for all Iowans.”
“Catelin’s agenda of fully funding public schools, affordable childcare and housing, and putting money in the pockets of working Iowans is a clear rejection of the Republican agenda led by Kim Reynolds and the Senate Republicans that have failed Iowans,” Weiner said. “This win shows that when Democrats fight for Iowa working families, when we get out and listen to Iowans, when we field people who care deeply about their communities, we can win anywhere, including in Northwest Iowa.”
The state legislative race has gained national attention as some Democrats say the race could show a positive forecast for Democrats in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said the results show Iowans — and voters throughout the country — do not approve of Republican policies.
“Iowans are seeing Republicans for who they are: self-serving liars who will throw their constituents under the bus to rubber stamp Donald Trump’s disastrous agenda — and they’re ready for change,” Martin said in a statement. “They are putting Republicans on notice and making it crystal clear: any Republican pushing Trump’s unpopular, extreme agenda has no place governing on behalf of Iowa families.”
Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee President Heather Williams said the special election win for Democrats “should send a flashing warning to the GOP.”
“State legislative Democrats are delivering progress, responding to their communities’ concerns about the chaos in Washington, and providing the steady leadership voters are asking for — leadership that has propelled candidates like Sen.-elect Catelin Drey to victory this year,” Williams said. “More special elections are right on the horizon, and we’re just getting started.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8599-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-26 22:57:28.151783

Kim Reynolds participated in the Tri-State Governors’ Conference in Dakota Dunes on Aug. 26, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)DAKOTA DUNES, SOUTH DAKOTA — Business leaders in the Sioux City area are asking the governors of South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska to help them secure hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for infrastructure improvements.
The projects include replacing a deteriorating runway and parking ramp at the 185th Air Refueling Wing in Sioux City, an Army Corps of Engineers study on Big Sioux River flooding, and upgrades to a Sioux City wastewater plant. The funding needs for the projects amount to about $653 million.
Presenters at Tuesday’s Tri-State Governors’ Conference also shared some concerns about federal funding under the Trump administration. South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen told reporters after the conference that the way to address those concerns is leveraging personal connections with the administration and congressional delegates to address tri-state needs.
“It’s working really, really hard and developing relationships within the federal government,” Pillen said, referencing a meeting this week he has planned with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. “It’s making sure that we have a tremendous sales pitch so they understand the best investment of tax dollars comes to the Great Plains.”
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds did not stay to answer media questions after the event. The three Republican governors met in Dakota Dunes, a South Dakota community just outside of Sioux City, where the three states’ borders meet.
Runway replacement
The National Defense Authorization Act, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee in July, would allocate $148 million to the runway project for the 185th Air Refueling Wing, a unit of the Iowa Air National Guard. The Federal Aviation Administration designated an additional $20 million.
But that funding falls short of the total project cost of $180 million. All three governors said they would support the effort to secure additional funding.
“Even though the runway is located in Iowa, it’s a regional asset that supports all of us in this three-state area and beyond to our entire nation,” Rhoden said.
Without full funding, the city could ultimately lose its airport fire department, airport control tower, the KC-135 air refueling tanker mission and all Air National Guard flying activities, according to the presentation by local officials. The military unit employs over 900 servicemen and women living in the tri-state area.
Wastewater upgrades
The Sioux City Wastewater Treatment Plant is “overloaded” and deteriorating, said Ryan Callahan with RP Constructors. The facility deals with heavy industrial wastewater demands due to food processing companies in the city.
It’ll cost $470 million to make improvements to the facility and meet regulatory requirements by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Iowa Department of Natural Resources. That’s too costly for local governments to handle on their own, Callahan said, asking the governors to “aggressively” pursue federal funding.
“This is a tri-state area issue,” Callahan said. “It’s also a water quality issue. Everybody that is contiguous to that river wants to have good water quality.”
Barbara Sloniker, executive vice president at the Siouxland Chamber of Commerce, said the city expected to receive funding from the Biden administration’s infrastructure programs, but is “a little uncertain” where the funding will come from under the Trump administration. The administration has made wide-ranging cuts to government programs since President Trump returned to office in January.
While Rhoden encouraged the attendees to explore working with the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources for possible state funding, Pillen said businesses driving the increased demand and need should help foot the bill before asking the government to step in.
“I think we should have the expectation that if we have an industry that is growing and making a lot of money in our communities, they should be part of solving that problem,” Pillen said. “I just don’t believe the state should pay for all of that.”
Pillen’s take is “somewhat true,” Sloniker said after the conference.
“If funding can be combined with state funds, that could help ease the burden on our taxpayers, which includes individuals and businesses,” Sloniker said.
Flood study
North Sioux City Administrator Jeff Dooley requested the governors use their positions to encourage the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fund a study of flooding on the Big Sioux River. The study is needed to reevaluate the nearly 50-year-old flood mitigation plan for the area.
The plan came under scrutiny last summer after major flooding on the Big Sioux River damaged or destroyed dozens of homes around McCook Lake, north of Sioux City. The goal of the flood mitigation plan was to protect North Sioux City, Dakota Dunes and parts of Sioux City by diverting floodwaters into McCook Lake, but the plan was overwhelmed by a historic volume of water.
“It’s going to be a huge lift, so the region will have to come together with the states and federal government,” Dooley said.
The study will cost $3 million and take four years to complete, said Rhoden, who added that his office and local leaders have been in contact with congressional delegates.
“We’re looking for ways to support that study and the local match,” Rhoden said.
Potential changes to the Federal Emergency Management Agency discussed by the Trump administration could put a greater burden on states to fund disaster preparedness and responses.
Pillen said he still expects FEMA to play a role. “To say FEMA is over, I think that’d be a little dramatic,” he told South Dakota Searchlight after the conference.
Rhoden added that his “comfort level” is greater after meeting with Trump Cabinet members and administration leaders, adding that he’s “gotten results immediately” when he’s asked for help from the administration.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Reynolds.jpg,,,2025-08-26 21:56:25.446663

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)Writing the date on a mail-in ballot envelope is a minor burden for voters, a federal appeals court said Tuesday. But the impact of making a mistake or forgetting to do so is too great to justify the requirement.
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has now twice considered the date requirement in Pennsylvania’s vote-by-mail law after earlier rejecting claims it ran afoul of federal law. 
This week’s ruling stems from a lawsuit by Erie County voter Bette Eakin, originally filed after her mail-in ballot for the 2022 general election was rejected because she failed to write a date on the return envelope. The 3rd Circuit found the government interests in requiring a date do not outweigh the harm to voters’ rights.
“Because of the commonwealth’s date requirement, an inadvertent typographical error or a flipped number or even a stray pen mark in the date field will remove the ballot contained within the return envelope from consideration. And the voter may never be the wiser,” Circuit Judge D. Brooks Smith wrote for the unanimous three-judge panel.
Democratic backers of Eakin’s case called the decision “a victory for free and fair elections,” and the right of Pennsylvanians to participate in democracy.
“It’s also a reminder that the Republicans’ playbook for the midterms is to disenfranchise voters across the country because they know they can’t win on their failed governing record,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Executive Director Julie Merz and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Executive Director Devan Barber said in a statement. “Democrats are united in the fight to ensure every legal vote is counted, in Pennsylvania and across the nation, and will not let these Republican attacks go unanswered.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Greg Rothman and lawyers for the GOP did not return calls Tuesday.
Pennsylvania voters first had the option to cast ballots by mail without an excuse for not going to the polls in 2020. The convenience appealed to voters, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many sought to avoid crowds. County election offices received more than 3 million requests for mail-in ballots.
In every election since, voters’ failure to correctly date their ballot envelopes has caused significant numbers of ballots to be rejected. Voting rights advocates estimated more than 10,000 voters were disenfranchised because of such errors in 2022. Even after the Department of State redesigned ballot envelopes to reduce errors and omissions, about 4,500 mail-in ballots were rejected in 2024, according to the opinion.
In an earlier challenge to the law, Eakin, argued the date requirement violated voting rights protections under the Civil Rights Act – specifically, its Materiality Clause, which bars requirements (e.g., literacy tests) that aren’t material to whether someone is qualified to vote and could disenfranchise them. 
U.S. District Judge Susan Paradise Baxter in western Pennsylvania agreed with Eakin. But the 3rd Circuit overturned her decision, with Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro writing that the provision only applies when the state is determining who may vote and not how they must cast a ballot.
In the current case, Eakin claimed the date requirement violated her First Amendment right to vote and 14th Amendment right to equal treatment under the law. Baxter again sided with Eakin. This time, the 3rd Circuit panel agreed that Baxter had correctly employed a longstanding test balancing the interests of the states in administering elections against the burden on voters that could keep them from casting ballots.
The 3rd Circuit panel rejected arguments that the date requirement was crucial to election administration on appeal by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, its national counterpart and the Republican National Congressional Committee. 
“The date requirement seems to hamper rather than facilitate election efficiency. By its nature, it fails to add solemnity to the process of voting,” wrote Smith, who was nominated for the court by President George W. Bush. 
He also rejected the Republicans’ argument that the date requirement assisted in detecting and prosecuting ballot fraud. 
In the six years since Act 77 introduced no excuse mail-in voting to Pennsylvanians, such a scenario has played out “only in the extremely rare instance involving a hapless fraudster who obtains a recently deceased voter’s mail-in ballot, completes the ballot, and adds a date on the return envelope postdating the deceased voter’s death,” Smith noted.
“One bizarre instance of the date requirement helping the commonwealth prosecute a criminal case of voter fraud — fraud that had been detected by other means — cannot justify the burden the date requirement imposes that affects thousands of Pennsylvania voters every election,” Smith said.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)From the White House to the Statehouse — with an airport layover — mid-cycle redistricting took center stage Tuesday as dozens of GOP legislators talked with Trump officials about a variety of topics, including the controversial map do-over. Meanwhile, Democrat lawmakers called out their colleagues and Hoosiers gathered to protest the maneuver.
One staunch opponent, Rep. Jim Lucas, said his stance softened after hearing from Vice President JD Vance. Previously a “hard no,” Lucas said he isn’t yet a yes but he is worried about the paralyzing effect a Democratic House majority would have on President Donald Trump’s agenda.

“I’m open minded to it,” Lucas summarized. “… we’ve seen what happens when the Democrats have the House. President Trump spent his first four years fighting off attack after attack after attack.”
In particular, he pointed to the potential of nuclear facilities proposed under Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, saying that his constituents were battling increased utility costs.
“If the Trump administration is bogged down fighting Democrat attacks for the next two years after the midterms, then all Hoosiers lose out,” Lucas said.
Much of the conversation with White House officials on Tuesday confirmed that Indiana “is on the right track,” he added, stressing that redistricting wasn’t the only topic. 
“The biggest takeaway is how genuinely nice and down to earth everybody in that administration is,” said Lucas, a Republican from Seymour. “There was absolutely zero pressure applied on us. No threats, nothing like that.”
He emphasized that much of the discussion centered on how Indiana leads in comparison to other states, including its ban on using food benefits to purchase soda and candy. He pointed to concerns about the state fiscal impacts of chronic health conditions like obesity and diabetes, especially for the Hoosiers enrolled on Medicaid. 
“We’re already doing a lot of those things,” said Lucas about agenda items like school vouchers and immigration. “… It was really nice. A lot of that meeting, they basically praised Indiana for the great job we’re doing.”


Based on posts from Facebook and X, the Indiana Capital Chronicle identified the following lawmakers as White House attendees:
Reps. Becky Cash, Michelle Davis, Robb Greene, Dave Heine, Andrew Ireland, Chris Judy, Ryan Lauer, Jim Lucas, Chris May, Doug Miller, Timothy O’Brien, Kyle Pierce
Sens. Liz Brown, Stacey Donato, Tyler Johnson, Eric Koch, Jeff Raatz, Linda Rogers, Michael Young, Andy Zay
Sources: Fox59 and CBS4 Reporter Max Lewis, personal social media accounts for Brown, Ireland, Johnson, Lucas and Pierce.


House Speaker Todd Huston and Sen. Pro Tem Rodric Bray reportedly had a private meeting with Trump, according to Politico reporters, who said “more than” 55 lawmakers attended. Huston’s daughter, Liz, is an assistant to Trump’s press secretary. 
Another Indiana Liz — Sen. Liz Brown of Fort Wayne — had some choice words on redistricting following the meeting, citing curses from prominent national Democrats about redistricting.
“The rhetoric coming out of Democrats’ mouths right now as they call for liberal states to gerrymander in Democrats’ favor is violent and disgusting,” said Brown on Facebook.
“I attended because Hoosiers know our conservative values could be at stake if states like California are allowed to have a louder liberal voice in Congress. I support President Trump in his efforts and I look forward to returning to Indiana and discussing next-steps to ensure our conservative values are fairly represented in D.C.,” she concluded.
At least three lawmakers, including Lucas, said they didn’t use taxpayer dollars to fund the trip. All lawmakers are allowed to claim one trip annually, though communications staff with the Republican caucuses said they didn’t know who might file for that reimbursement.
 From the airport

Earlier Tuesday morning, as Republicans potentially caught flights to the nation’s capital, Democrats urged their counterparts to resist Trump’s redistricting push at a “Sayonara, Sellouts” press conference held at the Indianapolis International Airport.
Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, shared that lawmakers would receive roughly $213 per day for a special session, a higher rate than their typical non-session pay. Across all 150 legislators, that would be a nearly $32,000 daily expense for food and housing. That doesn’t include mileage. 
Hunley called on her Republican colleagues to forgo not only their travel stipend for the Washington D.C. trip, but also their allowances during a special session. 
“It’s time to put your money where your mouth is, not just the taxpayers’ dime,” Hunley said. “At a time when our state budget is already crunched, it is so irresponsible to ask our taxpayers to foot the bill.”

Additionally, outside legal counsel might be needed if the maps are challenged in court. Attorney General Todd Rokita vowed to defend any new maps in a Tuesday release. 
The gathered Democrats seemed confident that a lawsuit would be necessary if proposed maps divvy up Marion County’s 7th Congressional District. It’s the state’s most racially and ethnically diverse district, with less than half of residents identifying as white.
“I don’t see that Republicans will be able to get nine Republican districts without carving up the minority votes in the minority districts,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis. 
Pryor asserted that District 7 was already drawn in a way to advantage Republicans, who shaped the district to include the upper two-thirds of Marion County, rather than the bottom two-thirds, in 2021. She said that was done to shore up Republican support in the 5th District north of Indianapolis, which was turning purple prior to the change.
Democrats openly wondered if Hoosier Republicans felt financial pressure, noting that Indiana is the third-most reliant state on federal funding. They also referenced newly released polling indicating that most Hoosiers oppose mid-decade redistricting.
But Pryor didn’t think it would be enough.
“I think we will go into a special session; I think that Republicans will fall in line; and I think that we will have to have a lawsuit,” Pryor said. “… (but) I hope that they have backbone, and I hope that they can come up with the courage to say no to Donald Trump.”
At the Statehouse
Hundreds of irate Hoosiers rallied behind the Indiana Statehouse Tuesday evening, booing Indiana’s Republican U.S. representatives — all seven professed their support last Monday — and cheering for the smattering of GOP state lawmakers who’ve come out in opposition.
“We want to thank the elected officials who are actually standing up to incredible pressure from D.C. to change these maps mid-decade,” Indiana Conservation Voters Executive Director Megan Robertson said, to cheers from the crowd.
“We’ve had about 10, 11 Republicans come out publicly, too, saying they don’t want it, so we need to thank them — and keep that backbone! Be strong!” She continued. “They’re doing what’s right, and we need them to know that we’ve got their backs.”
Speakers repeatedly denounced the effort as “cheating.”

The president and his supporters “know that they can’t run on merit because their ideas are terrible,” MADVoters Indiana Executive Director Amy Courtney said. “… If you can’t win on merit, what do you do? Well, if you’re Donald Trump or his sycophant, (Gov.) Mike Braun, or any of the MAGA Republicans, apparently, the answer is, you cheat!”
Courtney called on attendees to “resist,” adding, “Don’t give them the privilege of your apathy. Don’t tune out. Take action today to use your voice and demand fair elections, because there can be no cheaters in a democracy.”
The Rev. David Greene, president of the Concerned Clergy of Greater Indianapolis, noted the effort may target Indiana’s only Black member of Congress — Democratic Rep. André Carson — and the votes of those he represents.
“We must call it what it is: modern day voter suppression,” Greene said. “It’s being done with software instead of segregation. It’s being done with district lines instead of a poll tax. … Sixty years ago, the Voting Rights Act was signed because people marched; they bled and died for the right to be counted. Now, in 2025, some want to reverse that progress.”
He, like other speakers and attendees, blamed out-of-state influences.
“Gov. Braun, let me speak clearly and directly to you,” Greene said. “This is not Texas. This is not Florida. This is Indiana. We don’t need Washington insiders telling us how to draw our lines or silence our neighbors.”

(Photo by Getty Images).The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission at its Aug. 21 meeting approved purchasing a conservation easement across a more than 50,000-acre swath of land spanning three counties in northwest Montanan, permanently providing public access and protecting wildlife habitat. 
Phase Two of the Montana Great Outdoors Conservation Easement Project will more than double the protected land in the Cabinet Mountains between Kalispell and Libby, following the acquisition of a similar easement that the Montana Land Board approved last fall. 
The land is owned by Green Diamond Resource Company and the full project, first proposed in 2021, will ultimately protect nearly 86,000 acres of working forest land around the Thompson Chain of Lakes. Under the easement, the land will remain under private ownership and contribute to the tax base of the respective counties, while allowing for permanent public access for recreation. 
“For many years, in fact, probably three generations, these lands have been open to public use, generously provided by those forestry companies that have owned these grounds and they’ve been treated as quasi public. That use will continue here,” Bill Schenk, Land and Water Program Manager for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks told the commission. “The other thing it does is it allows and incorporates, again, as a conservation value, the perpetuation of timber production on this ground.”
The Montana Great Outdoors Conservation project has drawn a groundswell of support during the years from timber companies, conservation groups, politicians and recreationists, many of whom submitted public comment in favor of the easement. 
Timberland in northwest Montana has become smaller and more fragmented during the decades as companies have bought and sold vast amounts of forestland and parceled bits and pieces off for development.Despite that, conservation organizations and the state have sought to protect as much land as possible. 
A decade ago, much of Montana’s privately-held forest land in the northwest  — nearly 900,000 acres —was owned by Plum Creek Timber. That company was purchased by timber giant Weyerhaeuser in 2016 and three years later, sold off more than 600,000 acres to Southern Pine Plantations, a real estate investment company. Southern Pines subsequently sold nearly 300,000 acres to Green Diamond, a sixth-generation timber company. 
“We play what we call the long game,” Eric Schallon, Director of Real Asset Sales for Green Diamond, told the commission. “We are stewards at heart. This property needs a chance to come back. It was hit pretty hard by prior owners, so it’s in a regenerative state.”
The forestry work Green Diamond does on its land outside of timber harvest, including thinning for fire resiliency, is expensive, Schallon said, and conservation easements help fund that forestry work while ensuring the land will remain in timber production. 
“Another takeaway for this — hunting access is great. Lots of people here today can speak to that,” Schallon said. “It’s also good for clean air, it’s good for clean water, and it’s good for the animals, which I know you all care about because fragmented habitat is bad for all the critters. So this keeps large blocks together, and it keeps jobs in rural communities that need them. So we’ve got working forests that stay working.”

Multiple conservation, recreation and wildlife groups spoke up in favor of the conservation easement including the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Montana Sportsman for Fish and Wildlife, Montana Wildlife Federation, Montana Audubon, Trout Unlimited, Libby Rod and Gun Club, Montana Conservation Voters Education Fund, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, the Big Sky Upland Bird Association and the Trust for Public Land.
The Trust for Public Land was key in fundraising for the first phase of the conservation project, coordinating $4.2 million in private fundraising. 
“The completion of Phase One … was critical to prevent the very real threat of land conversions and subdivision and development, and this Phase Two doubles down and improves recreational access for hiking, hunting, fishing and more; will continue to ensure sustainable timber management; and stitches together over a quarter of a million acres of forest legacy projects completed over the last 20 years,” David Weinstein, northern Rockies director for TPL said. “This is the kind of project commensurate to the heritage and wildlife habitat and local economy of the residents of northwest Montana.”
While the Trust did not help fundraise for the purchase of the Phase Two easement, Weinstein pointed out that for every dollar invested through the state’s Habitat Montana program, funded through nonresident hunting license fees and a portion of recreational cannabis sales, leveraged $38 from landowners and the federal government. 
The county commissions for Flathead, Lincoln and Sanders counties all submitted letters supporting the conservation easements. 
But one dissenting voice spoke up at the commission hearing. Peter Scott, an attorney for WRH Nevada Properties, which owns 54% of the mineral rights across the project area, said that the commission should pause its decision to fully consider those rights. 
“This conservation easement specifically allows for mineral activity on more than half of the property you’re considering,” Scott said. “It is expressly incompatible with perpetual protection as provided in those guidelines.”
Scott said the state had not adequately consulted with the company about the easement or made an offer to purchase the mineral interests. 
Similar concerns arose during discussions on Phase One of the conservation project, but last year a court order from Lincoln County District Court Judge Matthew Cuffe clarified that “it is unreasonable to interpret the plain language of the Proposed Easement as interfering with WRH Nevada’s mineral rights.”
According to FWP’s environmental assessment of the project, “there is a low potential for any development of locatable or leasable minerals.”
The environmental assessment also states that the easement will provide habitat connectivity for numerous animal species, including numerous species of concern or Endangered Species Act-listed animals such as grizzly bears, Canada lynx and bull trout. 
Completion of this project will build on the success of the nearby 32,821-acre Phase 1 of the Montana Great Outdoors Conservation Easement, the 142,000-acre Thompson-Fisher Conservation Easement (FWP), the 100,000-acre USFWS Lost Trail Conservation Area (USFWS), and connect to other protected lands including the Kootenai and Lolo National Forests, and the Thompson Chain of Lakes State Park.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Utah Attorney General Derek Brown joined a bipartisan effort this week to combat a growing online threat — deepfake pornography. 
Brown, along with attorneys general from 47 other states, penned two letters on Tuesday asking internet search engines and payment platforms to do more to stop what has become a pervasive and humiliating trend.  
Also called “computer-generated deepfake nonconsensual intimate imagery,” deepfake pornographic images or videos often manipulate a person’s real picture, sometimes using artificial intelligence, to depict the person in an intimate setting.

It’s a growing problem, Brown’s office said, that can embarrass, intimidate and exploit people, the majority of them women. Celebrities and regular people alike have become victims, including several high-profile cases of teenagers, who say the fake images have devastating impacts on their mental health, job and college prospects and physical safety. 
According to data from the Attorney General’s Office, a whopping 98% of fake online videos contain deepfake pornographic imagery. The 10 most popular websites dedicated to deepfake pornography have generated more than 300 million views, the office said. 
“As this technology becomes more powerful and creates more potential for harm to the public, businesses that help people search for, create, and distribute this content need to be aware of their role in propagating this content and work to prevent its spread,” reads the letter, addressed to Google Search, Microsoft Bing and Yahoo! Search.

Just like search engines limit access to content related to suicide, terrorism and other criminal activity — such as searching “how to build a bomb” — Brown’s office said they can block content related to deepfake pornography. That includes now-common searches like “how to make deepfake pornography,” “undress apps,” “nudify apps” or “deepfake porn.”
In a separate letter to Visa, Mastercard, American Express, PayPal, Google Pay and Apple Pay, the attorneys general urged the payment platforms to do more to identify and remove payment authorization for transactions related to deepfake pornography. 
“The same principles that have led payment processors to withdraw their services from sellers who engaged in other harmful activities should also apply to sellers that are distributing deepfake (nonconsensual intimate imagery) tools and content,” the letter reads. 
Utah lawmakers in 2024 passed SB66, a simple bill that added “generated” images to the definition of a counterfeit intimate image. Now, anyone who commits unlawful distribution of a counterfeit intimate image could be charged with a class A misdemeanor, or a third-degree felony if they are a repeat offender, punishable by up to one year in jail.

Alaska’s public schools rank among the worst in the country according to national standardized testing data, and members of the bipartisan, bicameral task force have been charged with identifying ways to improve performance by changing the way schools are funded and manage their students.
Legislative leaders have said the task force will also have the opportunity to examine funding for schools and ways to address rising costs of transportation, utilities, insurance and maintenance. 
Members of the task force will hold a series of hearings and discussions before drafting recommendations for new laws that legislators might implement. Those recommendations must be delivered before lawmakers arrive at the Alaska Capitol in January 2027.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy called legislators into a special session to address education issues, but lawmakers have ignored that call and are not planning to hold formal meetings before the special session ends at the end of the month. Legislative leaders have said they prefer to work through the task force instead.
Dunleavy is term-limited and will be out of office by the time the task force’s recommendations are complete.
“The current state of Alaska’s education is not where we’d like it to be, but I know that we can get to a better place if we all work together, we find common ground, and we build upon what we agree upon,” said Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the task force.
But on Monday, it appeared that finding that common ground could be difficult, as task force participants identified different areas they prefer to focus upon.
“John Muir said that when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe. The same is true in education,” said Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka. If we take steps to improve teacher quality, that has an impact on the classroom. If we take steps to make sure kids are fed, that has an impact. If we take steps to make sure that we have the right ratios of teachers with students. All of these things have impacts.”
Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, said he would like the task force to consider how it measures results. What standardized tests, if any, should be used to consider performance?
“I think accountability broadly is a place that I hope to go, and I hope that the (Alaska Department of Education and Early Development) can have some input on that,” he said.
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, suggested that the task force should be “looking at how we empower local government” to deal with education decisions, while Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok, said he wants to make sure the task force is “focusing on policies like the READS Act,” which was a bipartisan bill intended to improve reading performance among younger students.
“We are seeing success in that, and those are the kind of policies we need,” he said.
This year, lawmakers voted to increase the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-pupil funding formula, but Ruffridge suggested that lawmakers need to examine other aspects of the formula to see whether they are delivering the intended results.
Alaska, for example, multiplies the base student allocation for students with “intensive needs” and those in rural Alaska.
“It’s a scary proposition to open up the foundation formula, but I think it’s something that we are really tasked with doing in this group,” he said, adding that the state has failed to properly maintain school facilities, particularly in rural Alaska.
Cronk, in prior comments, said he also is concerned about school maintenance. In most of Alaska, proper maintenance depends on funding from the state government.
“If we want to continue to have (stable) education funding, us as a collective group need to create a fiscal plan for this state,” he said. 
“I’m hoping that if we’re talking about funding, that should be our goal as part of this, to make sure that we can come up with something so we do have a level funding for all the government services,” Cronk said. 
A legislative task force in 2021 did draft a long-term state plan to bring expenses and revenue into balance, but lawmakers have not adopted any legislation suggested by that task force.
The next meeting of the education task force is scheduled for Oct. 30 in Juneau.
