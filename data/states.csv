HOST: Paul Hattis & John McDonough
GUEST: Dr. Kiame Mahaniah, Health and Human Services Secretary







MASSACHUSETTS’S NEW SECRETARY of Health and Human Services has long had equity on his mind, even if national pressures now discourage using social justice language to describe it.  
“The way I think of health equity is the capacity of the system to spend more resources and more money on those who need it the most,” Dr. Kiame Mahaniah said on the latest episode of The Codcast.  
“Even though ‘Trump 2’ tries to stay away from the word equity, when they talk about rural health, they’re talking about equity. When they’re talking about substance use disorder, they’re talking about equity,” he said. “When they’re talking about bringing in a digital infrastructure and rural areas, that’s digital equity. They’re using different words, but the concepts – that the more pain that you’re in, the more services you should receive – I think those are right. Those are accepted concepts. And I don’t see us veering away from that in Massachusetts.” 
This week, on the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast, John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute spoke with Mahaniah as part of CommonWealth Beacon’s health care access month and its special “Critical Condition” coverage. 
Mahaniah served as undersecretary of health for most of Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh’s tenure. Upon Walsh’s departure for personal reasons in July, Gov. Maura Healey appointed Mahaniah as a permanent replacement.  
Massachusetts was already dealing with system stressors before the second Trump administration began, Hattis and Mahaniah noted. That included the primary care crisis, provider burnout, and difficulty for certain regions and populations to reliably access the health care they need.  
“As the improvement engineers say, your system is designed to get the results that it’s getting,” he said. The current system is complex and built on “a financing system that is not favoring primary care,” he said. 
Massachusetts, rather than a fee-for-service model, could consider payment systems that force a certain amount of primary care spending or work on a pre-paid prospective model. 
But when it comes to ensuring access to medical care like vaccines facing federal complications, the state is in a difficult position. While the Healey administration is crafting a process for recommending vaccines separate from the federal government’s position, there will likely still be issues securing those vaccines at an affordable rate, Mahaniah said. 
“I think the harder part is what’s going to happen to the purchasing and the distribution of these vaccines, because that was really coordinated by the CDC, and it was predicated on the CDC covering the vaccines from its own committee,” he said.  
The federal government was able to purchase tens of millions of doses for a negotiated rate that even a collaboration of states just cannot match, he said. “Will that whole infrastructure go away – meaning the ability to order vaccines and distribute them? … We really do worry about the purchase, the distribution, and then of course, the impact that it could have on health coverage.” 
On the podcast, McDonough, Hattis, and Mahaniah discuss looming Medicaid cuts (5:30), the primary care crisis (19:15), and how to make sure the vulnerable can still access health services (26:30).

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-15 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Constitution Pipeline: What to know about the controversial gas project,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/15/constitution-pipeline-natural-gas-new-york-pennsylvania-ct/,The Constitution Pipeline will link up with two existing pipelines that serve both CT and the wider region.,"At first glance, the route of one of America’s most controversial pipeline projects might not seem to have much to do with New England.
The proposed 125-mile pipeline between Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale field and upstate New York, however, is part of a long-standing effort to increase the flow of natural gas into parts of Connecticut and, by extension, the neighboring states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire.
Such efforts have recently drawn interest from a politically-diverse group of figures such as Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont as well as Republican President Donald J. Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, all of whom view natural gas as a way of reducing the region’s cost-of-energy burden.
Opponents, meanwhile, argue that building a new pipeline will only worsen pollution and the release of climate-altering greenhouse gases, while doing little to bring down prices. 
What is the Constitution Pipeline?
The Constitution Pipeline is being developed by Williams Companies, a large operator of pipelines across the United States. The pipeline would have the ability to carry up to 650 million cubic feet of gas a day, according to the company, enough to serve about 3 million homes.
Williams first received federal approvals to build the pipeline more than a decade ago, but the project hit a snag when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation declined to issue a water quality permit in 2016.
The project continued to languish until the developers resubmitted applications to state and federal regulators earlier this year. 
“Williams remains committed to advancing the Constitution Pipeline project and has submitted permit applications,” to regulators in New York and Pennsylvania, the company said in a statement this month. “We are also continuing to work with the states, Congress, and the Administration to strengthen U.S. energy markets, lower costs for American families, and support long-term economic growth.”
Pending those approvals, Williams estimates that the pipeline should begin construction next year and enter service near the end of 2027. 
Is Connecticut involved?
While the Constitution Pipeline itself will not carry gas into Connecticut, its terminus in New York will link up with two existing pipelines — the Tennessee and Iroquois systems — that serve both the state and the wider region.
Those pipelines already operate at or near capacity, officials say, creating a supply bottleneck particularly during winter months when gas is used to both heat homes and fuel the power plants that produce the bulk of the region’s electricity.
In order to reduce that bottleneck, pipeline operators in Connecticut are pursuing their own expansion projects.
Iroquois pipeline’s owners, for example, are seeking to build a series of compressors that would push an additional 125 million cubic feet of gas through the each day, an increase of 8.3% over its existing capacity. Meanwhile, Canadian energy company Enbridge has its own plans to expand its regional pipeline, the Algonquin, by 2029.
Carolina Kulbeth, a spokesperson for Tennessee Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, said in a statement that expanding pipeline capacity is “critical” to eliminating existing constraints on gas supply.
“New pipeline infrastructure is the only way to ensure reliability and affordability in the New England region, as demand continues to rise among residential, commercial, and industrial customers,” Kulbeth said. 
Trump himself has touted the pipeline’s benefits, saying that it would lower energy prices by up to $5,000 per family in the Northeast — figures that critics say are wildly inflated.
“I can tell you Connecticut wants it and all of New England wants it,” Trump said in March. “And who wouldn’t it?”
What does it have to do with wind?
In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that the resurrection of the Constitution Pipeline was linked to negotiations between the Trump administration and New York over the fate of another project, Empire Wind.
Federal authorities had pulled permits for the wind project in April, only to reverse course around the same time that Williams resubmitted its pipeline applications. 
While New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has denied making any explicit promises to approve the pipeline, she has expressed a willingness to work with the administration and developers on unnamed “new energy projects” that comply with state law. 
Lamont, however, has strongly suggested that the two projects are intertwined. 
After the Trump administration last week ordered a halt in construction on another wind project being staged in New London, Lamont expressed surprise at the decision given his prior support for the development of new pipelines. 
“We’re already having very productive conversations with Williams pipeline company and [the secretaries] of Energy and Interior regarding how we can get additional sources of power here to this region, including American natural gas,” Lamont said. “So I don’t think there’s a conflict there.” 
What do opponents say?
Critics of pipeline expansion argue that projects such as Constitution are at odds with the commitments made by local elected officials to slowly wean the region off of its reliance on fossil fuels. Connecticut, for example, has laws pledging to get all of the state’s power needs from carbon-free sources no later than 2040 and achieving economy-wide net-zero emissions 10 years after that.
In addition, they point to the region’s already sky-high energy prices to argue that importing more natural gas is not an effective solution. 
“This is not about what’s better for the climate, or air or energy costs,” said Samantha Dynowski, the Connecticut state director for the Sierra Club. “This is about, you know, Trump’s buddies, his fossil fuel buddies.”
During his presidential campaign last year, Trump pledged to ease environmental restrictions and approve new drilling, pipeline and other fossil fuel projects. At the same time, he attempted to solicit $1 billion in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry.
Pipeline projects such as the Iroquois and Algonquin expansion projects have also faced local opposition in Connecticut, particularly in Brookfield where residents have complained about plans to build a new compressor station in close proximity to a middle school.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced its tentative approval of the compressor on July 31.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP807089399687-1024x672.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

The site is the most significant site at Chaco Canyon National Historical Park, which Pueblos and advocates say remains under threat from continued oil and gas development, and worry protections could by scaled back by the new administration. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Suspended thousands of feet in the New Mexico skies Sunday, Pojoaque Pueblo Gov. Jenelle Roybal could see the indelible impressions of Pueblo Bonito nestled under Fajada Butte.
Built by Ancient Pueblo society, the half dome structure constitutes  the most recognizable archaeological site in the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in the state’s northwestern corner. 
However, recent federal efforts to revoke a 10-mile buffer zone for oil and gas development around Chaco Culture National Historical Park threaten the sacred site for New Mexico Pueblos, the Hopi Indians of Arizona and the Navajo Nation.

In a plane, the buffer just across the butte is crossed in minutes. Beyond it extends miles of oil and gas development in the Mancos Shale in the San Juan Basin. One of the busiest gas producing areas in the U.S. from the air, the land is marked with the straight cuts of roads ending in oil pads and pumpjacks. 
“That land was really torn up —  it’s just roads everywhere, that land’s never going to go back to the way it was,” Roybal said from the Double Eagle II airport in Albuquerque Sunday morning. 
Roybal said protecting the sacred site is crucial not only for tribal sovereignty, but also for holding the connection to the site’s sacred value.
“Any land in New Mexico impacted affects my people,” she said.
The flight, provided by volunteer pilots with the conservation organization LightHawk and the Acoma-based Native Land Institute,  kicks off a week of advocacy during which at least 10 Pueblo governors are headed to Washington D.C. to meet with U.S. Congress members to press for further protections as the Trump administration vows to “unleash” oil and gas development. 
In April, members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation re-introduced federal legislation to make permanent a Biden-era ban on development within 10 miles of  the site. But a competing Republican-backed bill and the Trump Administration’s efforts to unwind the order are threatening that progress, the delegation said in a June letter.

Roybal recently went to Washington D.C. with other tribal governors to meet with U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, to urge further protections for preventing oil and gas encroachment around Chaco Canyon. 
She said Burgum,  who personally attended the August meeting,  seemed receptive to visiting Chaco Canyon in the future. 
“He definitely wanted to continue the conversation,” Roybal said of the meeting with Burgum. “He was very interested in coming out and looking. I think that’s important, it’s where they need to see their impact. ”
Joey Sanchez, a former governor of Santa Ana Pueblo and now a tribal liaison with Native Lands Institute, said protecting Chaco means keeping “a living museum” alive and connects generations of Pueblo people throughout time. 
“When you go to touch the walls, that spirituality comes back to life with you,” he said.
Federal efforts to revoke buffer zone around Chaco Canyon prompt delegation letter

Alyssa Sanchez (Santa Ana Pueblo), 32, said she wants to protect Chaco for future generations, and worries that further pollution or encroachment will despoil the site for her young nephews and others. 
“You really can tell from a bird’s-eye-view that while 10 miles seems like a lot, it isn’t even two minutes in a plane,” she said. “That damage is going to spread, 10 miles is nothing, it’s just sad.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pueblo-Bonito-1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

If successful, it will imperil nearly a half-billion dollars lawmakers counted on for state budgets. (Getty Images)Comcast is suing to block a new Washington law imposing sales tax on advertising services, imperiling a financial linchpin lawmakers relied on to balance the state’s budget.
The cable giant contends that the statute set to take effect Oct. 1 violates federal law because it does not apply the tax to all advertising services in the same manner.
Attorneys for the corporation also assert that parts of the law are not allowed under the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bars states from imposing “discriminatory taxes” on electronic commerce. 
“Almost all forms of advertising conducted over the Internet are subject to the tax, while most forms of advertising conducted off the Internet are not subject to the tax,” they wrote.
If Comcast succeeds in getting the tax overturned, it could force major recalibrations in the budget.
Striking the tax on advertising services alone would reduce tax collections by roughly $475 million over the next four fiscal years, said Mikhail Carpenter, a spokesperson for the state’s Department of Revenue.
The lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court on Sept. 9 names the state and the Department of Revenue as main defendants. 
A Comcast spokesman said the lawsuit lays out the company’s concerns and declined to comment further.
Department of Revenue officials are reviewing it with legal counsel, Carpenter said.
The fight centers on a section of Senate Bill 5814, a major expansion of business taxes passed by the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate in April and signed by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson in May. Republicans in both chambers opposed the bill.
This bill is counted on to raise roughly $1.1 billion in this two-year budget and $2.7 billion over four years, much of it by charging the retail sales and use tax on more services, such as digital advertising, security services and temporary staffing.
It is one of the largest pieces of a $9.4 billion package that Democrats approved in April to balance the current budget, and the next one as well.
Comcast is contesting provisions that will require sales tax be collected for ads sold by streaming services, while exempting advertising services of newspapers, radio and television broadcasting, as well as on billboards and buses. Naming rights and ads in stadiums will not be subject to the tax either.
This would mean, for example, a Seattle television station won’t charge sales tax on ads sold to a local business, but a streaming service like Netflix must charge sales tax if it sells an ad to the same business.
“These excluded categories of advertising were drawn in such a way that the burden of the tax falls on Internet-based advertising, rather than non-Internet based advertising,” reads the lawsuit.
The lawsuit is not raising a new issue.
A coalition of streaming services, including Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, and the Walt Disney Co., urged Ferguson to veto the bill, arguing the new advertising tax would lead to higher costs for customers or fewer options if services leave the market.
“Singling out one segment of the ad economy for this kind of discriminatory treatment is the wrong way to address the state’s fiscal needs and would do far more harm than good,” the Streaming Innovation Alliance told the governor in a letter.
The Department of Revenue is in the process of writing final rules for implementation of the tax law. 
As part of the process, in July, it held two “listening sessions” in which business owners and operators sought clarity on what advertising services would be covered, questioned the legality of the approach, and expressed concern consumers would be negatively impacted.
The department expects to issue “interim guidance” on advertising service in the next two weeks, Carpenter said. It will provide taxpayers with instructions “they can rely on while the department continues to review issues and adopts final interpretive guidance.”
This guidance will not address the legal issues raised by the lawsuit, he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gavel-and-money-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

(Getty Images)The Indiana Department of Correction will begin sending payments to dozens of counties on Monday to cover costs for housing state prisoners, ending months of delays that left local jails without reimbursements.
“In recent months, the Indiana Department of Correction has been working to ensure calculations of any money owed to the counties are accurate,” DOC spokesperson Annie Goeller said in a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
She explained that two separate streams of payments are at issue: funding tied to Level 6 felony diversions, and per diem reimbursements for state prisoners held in county jails awaiting transfer.
Story continues below.
County Hold Master Summary - FY 2025
 
Level 6 offenders used to be sent to state prisons until a criminal justice overhaul in 2013. After that, low-level felons were kept in local jails at state expense.
Goeller said the outstanding costs associated with Level 6 diversions were governed by a funding formula established by the General Assembly in 2019.
“This formula has since become outdated and no longer reflects current data, resulting in overpayments to several counties,” she said.
To resolve that, DOC will forgive those debts rather than seek repayment, Goeller said.
In total, the department will forgive about $7.7 million in overpayments across 51 counties, including large amounts in Kosciusko County, which was overpaid nearly $599,000; Greene County, which was overpaid more than $254,000; and Clark County, where the overpayment was about $264,000, according to a DOC payment summary provided to the Capital Chronicle.
Indiana Department of Correction readies to pay $12 million in jail back payments

The department will also resume reimbursements for jail holds, where inmates who have been convicted of state crimes remain in county jails until DOC picks them up. 
State law requires pickup within five days, but counties are reimbursed at a daily rate for each additional day an inmate is held. 
The General Assembly raised that per diem earlier this year, and Goeller said DOC currently owes counties “approximately $6.1 million to 41 counties for these holds.” 
“The department will begin reimbursing these counties immediately,” she added.
The largest payments are set to go to several northern Indiana counties with high numbers of state holds. 
Elkhart County is owed more than $638,000 for 34,024 days of holds, while St. Joseph County is owed nearly $397,000 for 21,910 days. In Lake County, where 13,463 hold days were recorded, the reimbursement totals just under $178,000.
Additionally, Delaware County will receive roughly $216,000 and Vigo County about $290,000 — both for more than 10,000 days of holds. Hendricks County, meanwhile, is set to receive more than $171,000. 
Other counties are owed smaller amounts, such as Monroe County at about $53,000; Jennings County at nearly $27,000; and Fountain County at about $39,000, the DOC summary shows.
Goeller said the reimbursements will come in a single distribution next week, and that “money will come from IDOC’s budget, which includes funding for jail payments.”

Bob Ferguson signed an executive order Sept. 3 creating Your Washington, a division of the executive branch that will focus on improving how the state delivers services to residents. Jesse Jones, the director, speaks with Ferguson after the signing. (Photo courtesy of governor's office.)For two decades, embattled consumers knew having investigative journalist Jesse Jones on their side could very likely make things right for them.
Now, Gov. Bob Ferguson is counting on Jones to level up such success for residents across the state.
Ferguson renamed and rebranded Results Washington, an obscure data-driven creation of his predecessor, into a “customer experience hub” called Your Washington that launched this week. He hired Jones in January to lead the transformation, which became formal with Ferguson’s signing of an executive order on Sept. 3.
“Washingtonians know that when there is a problem to be solved, you get Jesse,” Ferguson said in January. “Government must work better. Jesse’s track record makes him an ideal candidate for this role.” 
The executive order directs agencies under Ferguson’s control to provide Your Washington staff with an overview of how they account for customer experience and track their delivery of key services. In six months, each agency must begin implementing a Customer Experience Improvement Plan. Quarterly progress reports must be filed with Your Washington.
“In my inaugural address, I promised to improve customer service in state government. We’re going to make it happen,” Ferguson posted on social media after signing the executive order.
Ferguson’s effort follows a series of initiatives along these lines that Washington governors have pursued over the past three decades.
As part of the governor’s order, Jones and his staff are working with WaTech, the state’s IT agency, to expand wa.gov, the state’s existing online portal to state services, programs and information. 
The Your Washington website, meanwhile, is a place where residents can share their experiences and state employees can learn best practices for serving the public.
Jones said there are plans for a hotline for people to call to leave complaints and compliments about government agencies. There is also going to be a small studio where “folks can come in and tell their customer service story,” he said.
And, each quarter, two state employees “who embody the spirit of service excellence” will be recognized. They’ll be chosen based on the nominations from the public, Jones said.
“Our role is to assist, embrace and help these agencies do their best with customer experience,” said Jones, who joined Ferguson following 20 years as an investigative and consumer reporter with two Seattle television stations. “It is a huge undertaking for a group of 10 people,” he said.
In search of better customer service
Customers, in the vision of Your Washington, are “anyone who interacts with a state program or service” including residents, businesses, organizations, and agency employees.
Customer experience, or CX for short, is defined as “a shared mindset” in the design of services for those who use and deliver them.
The website has a resource page with links to research and tools for better understanding the mindset of customers. There is information on practices such as influence mapping and empathy mapping to help employees get a broader picture of those affected by a potential decision.
Jones, in a statement on the website, says customer experience “doesn’t start at the front counter – IT STARTS INSIDE. How leaders support staff, and how managers treat their teams, directly shapes the experience we deliver to the public.”
A new way to address an old idea
Ferguson is the latest Washington governor with a scheme to make state agencies relevant and responsive.
In the late 90s, Gov. Gary Locke unfurled priorities of government to figure out what services people most wanted and needed from the state, and how to best fund them.
Gov. Christine Gregoire followed with Government Management Accountability and Performance, which she introduced in February 2005, her second month in office. It called for developing “clear, relevant and easy-to-understand measures” to show whether programs were successful. Department managers to front-line employees were required to work “creatively and cooperatively” across agency lines “to improve government service.”
Then came Gov. Jay Inslee with Results Washington in September 2013, his first year on the job. Its team did deep dives in data collection, then used findings to craft policies in the areas of education, economy, clean energy and environment, health and safety, and government accountability. A lot of the data is retained on the Your Washington site.
With Results Washington, the director was responsible for “implementing a continued customer-oriented approach to state government” centered on expanding public participation “in efforts to improve our state.”
For his endeavor, Ferguson is counting on Jones’ media savvy to further enhance public interest and awareness in such work. 
“Washingtonians deserve efficient, responsive, and person-focused government services that respect their time and meet their needs,” Ferguson said in an emailed statement. “This executive order is the next step in our efforts to ensure we deliver.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/YourWashington-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in south Minneapolis last month has state lawmakers searching for ways to reduce gun violence, which is the leading cause of death for children in the United States. 
Minnesota already has stricter-than-average gun laws, and it’s not clear whether any of the gun control measures up for discussion would have prevented a 23-year-old Minnesota resident from firing more than 100 rounds through the windows of Annunciation during the first Mass of the school year. 
Even if Minnesota had banned semiautomatic military-style assault weapons, like the one used by the shooter, they’re available for purchase in every surrounding state. The assailant also brought a shotgun and handgun to the school.
The shooter would have passed background checks and didn’t trigger the state’s red flag law, which allows courts to order the confiscation of weapons from people who threaten their own life or others. 
In other words, America’s permissive gun culture and laws — cultivated over many decades by the gun lobby and bipartisan but now mostly Republican politicians and their supporters — mean that even the most rigorous measures taken by individual states can only reduce deaths around the margins in a country that’s home to nearly 400 million firearms.
But those measures and others can still prevent future gun deaths, and are worth implementing, according to studies and gun violence prevention researchers.
In states with more permissive gun laws and higher gun ownership rates, more people die in shootings — and the gap between states with permissive and restrictive gun laws is growing, according to one study.  
Although mass shootings draw the most attention, only 1% of firearm deaths in the U.S. occur in mass shootings. Most are suicides, and some are accidental deaths. Others are isolated homicides, many of which are committed by intimate partners. 


America’s penchant for owning guns is striking compared to other countries. For every 100 Americans, there are 120 civilian guns, according to Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey — far more than the second-highest, which is 62 guns per 100 people in the Falkland Islands.
“I am not going to allow anyone to try and make the case that the United States is unique in either mental health issues or other things,” Walz said on Sept. 2 while announcing plans to call a special legislative session on gun violence. “The thing that makes America unique in terms of shootings is we just have more guns and the wrong types of guns that are on the streets.”


Walz’s priority for the special session is banning firearms like the AR-15-style rifle used by the Annunciation shooter. A DFL-led Senate Working Group on Gun Violence Prevention will evaluate other special session proposals this week.
“My hope is that the special session will be focused on the future as well — on what could prevent the next shooting — because it’s not going to be exactly what happened (at Annunciation),” said Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins University. 
Here’s what data and experts say about the effectiveness of various gun control policies: 
Assault weapon and high-capacity magazine bans
What constitutes an “assault weapon” varies state-to-state, but definitions usually include semi-automatic firearms that accept a detachable magazine and include one or more “military-style” features, such as a folding or telescoping stock.
Semi-automatic firearms fire one bullet each time the trigger is pulled, and automatically reloads the next bullet as the trigger is released. Most popular handguns, like the Glock 22, are semi-automatic; so are AR-15s and AK-47s. (Automatic firearms, which fire continuously while the trigger is pulled, and devices that convert semi-automatic weapons to automatic are highly restricted by federal law.)
Minnesota law lists 17 firearm makes and models, and all those with similar specifications, as “semiautomatic military-style assault weapons.”

Since 2000, one-third of mass shootings involved assault weapons, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Prevention Project at Hamline University. Most mass shootings — 52% — involved handguns. 
A majority of the deadliest mass shootings, however — like those in Uvalde, Sutherland Springs, Orlando and Sandy Hook — involved assault rifles. 
AR-15s and AK-47s are often selected by mass shooters for their ease of use and high velocity, which creates shockwaves that cause devastating damage to bodies even with smaller bullets than many handguns. A 2025 study found that the use of an assault weapon is associated with a slight increase in the number of injuries and deaths in mass shooting incidents. 
The federal government banned the sale of assault weapons from 1994 to 2004, but people who purchased those guns before the ban took effect were allowed to keep them.
During the federal assault weapons ban, mass shooting incidents and deaths decreased. The trend reversed when the ban expired in 2004. 
Ten states ban assault weapons. Fourteen states prohibit high-capacity magazines, usually defined as those with more than 10 rounds. (The standard magazine size for an AR-15 is 30 rounds, but some magazines hold up to 100 bullets.)
Some studies show that state-level high-capacity magazine bans reduce public mass shootings and fatalities. 
There is less evidence that state-level assault weapons bans have the same effect, in part because laws vary widely from state-to-state, making comparisons difficult, said Roskam, the Johns Hopkins researcher. 
Because high-capacity magazine bans and assault weapons bans often go hand-in-hand, researchers struggle to disentangle the two policies. 
Regardless: “It is incredibly clear that assault weapons are used in and facilitate a lot of mass shootings. And despite the lack of clear evidence, because of some of the research limitations that I identified, we do feel that they would have a protective effect,” Roskam said.
A range of factors could limit the impact of a state-level ban: The grandfathering-in of existing weapons; the ease of transporting firearms across state lines; and the rush to purchase affected weapons before a ban takes effect.
Extreme risk protection orders, or “red flag” laws
If a person poses a significant threat of bodily harm to others or is at risk of suicide, family members or law enforcement officers can ask a judge to order the confiscation of that person’s firearms for up to one year.
This policy, called an “extreme risk protection order” or “red flag law” took effect in January 2024 after the DFL-controlled Legislature passed a law in 2023.

Extreme risk protection orders can reduce gun deaths, including suicides, homicides and mass shootings, according to a limited body of research. Indiana’s red flag law is associated with a a 7.5% reduction in firearm suicides, and gun suicides declined nearly 14% in Connecticut after a similar law passed there. 
There’s also evidence that red flag laws prevent some mass shootings; For instance, out of 159 orders issued from 2016 to 2018 in California, 21 subjects displayed intent to commit a mass shooting. After their firearms were confiscated, none of those people committed suicide or homicide.
Red flag laws are relatively new, and the evidence to support their effectiveness is less robust than that of the federal assault weapons ban.
“It’s also very difficult to prove a negative — to prove the shootings that don’t happen,” said Jaclyn Schildkraut, executive director of the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium at the Rockefeller Institute of Government.
The impact of extreme risk protection orders is dependent on the public’s knowledge of the law, and law enforcement agencies’ participation, Roskam said. 
In Minnesota, more petitions for extreme risk protection orders were filed in the first seven months of 2025 than in all of 2024, signaling increased public participation and enforcement of the law, MinnPost reported. 
Safe storage laws
In Minnesota, it’s illegal to negligently store a loaded firearm in a location where the person knows, or reasonably should know, that a child is likely to gain access, unless the owner takes “reasonable action” to prevent the child from accessing the gun.
The statute is known as a child-access prevention law, a type of safe storage law, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent suicides, accidental shootings and homicides by minors, according to several studies. 
And while there’s not substantial evidence to prove that child-access prevention laws reduce mass shootings, one study found that two-thirds of school shooters obtained their firearms from family or friends.  


The Minnesota House passed an even stricter safe storage bill in 2024, but it did not come to a vote in the Senate. That bill would have required gun owners to store their firearms unloaded and equipped with a locking device; or, loaded or unloaded, in a locked firearm storage unit or room.
Most research on safe storage policies focuses on the child access piece of the law. While safe storage laws are usually not proactively enforced, they provide a path for parents to be charged in the event that their child accesses a negligently-stored firearm and uses it in a crime.
“It’s not just about the passage of the law, or even the enforcement of the criminal penalties — It’s also about educating people about the benefits and the risks that they face from not doing it,” Roskam said.

School safety

Minnesota Republicans say they will approach a special session with a focus on school safety, rather than gun control. 
Schildkraut’s team at the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium is examining the effectiveness of behavioral threat assessments, which are used to identify and monitor people who may pose a threat of violence to themselves or others. (Federal funding for that project was canceled earlier this year because it does not align with the Trump administration’s priorities, Schildkraut said. The research is ongoing with other funding sources.)
“To undergo a behavioral threat assessment process, you need that person to be on somebody’s radar. And when you’re thinking about schools, the people whose radar…he or she is most likely to be on, is the other students,” Schildkraut said. 
Teaching students about the warning signs and behaviors of students in crisis and creating anonymous tip lines can help schools and law enforcement agencies identify students who may pose a threat — before they commit a violent act against themselves or others.
“The firearm is the means, right? But the motivation and the method … why they’re doing this and what is underpinning all of that certainly doesn’t always revolve around that firearm,” Schildkraut said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_0364-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As an immigration attorney, I work with indigent noncitizens seeking both naturalization and lawful immigration status as survivors of human trafficking, severe harm in their home countries, and certain serious crimes in the U.S. I am going to outline practical information where the effect of current immigration law and policies is fostering fear among noncitizens in our communities. 
This article coincides with the  “Welcoming Week” (September 12-21) — an annual tradition when events are organized nationwide to recognize and celebrate the contributions of immigrants in our communities and the work carried out at local levels to be welcoming places for all community members. In the spirit of this tradition, here are a few points (not to be interpreted as legal advice) that may help immigrant community members and their neighbors, friends, and advocates continue to navigate this challenging time.
Know the rights of all people in the U.S., regardless of immigration status
Everyone in the country, whether or not a U.S. citizen, has certain basic rights and protections under the U.S. Constitution. Suffice it to say here that the application of these rights can be complex and depend upon the circumstances at hand, but national and local non-profit organizations have distilled information, which has been translated into multiple languages, and, locally, private and non-profit attorneys regularly conduct information sessions tailored to current events with an eye toward empowering community members. 
Two Indianapolis-based organizations that house resources are the Immigrant Welcome Center and the Coalition for our Immigrant Neighbors. At this point, many people are familiar with “Red Cards” that list short phrases to allow people to exercise their rights in different situations.
Connect with qualified attorneys and advocates
It’s not only recommended but also can be critical to obtain the advice of a qualified and licensed attorney before applying for an immigration benefit. If appropriate for the issue, a Department of Justice accredited representative — a trained attorney authorized by the DOJ to provide immigration services — may be of assistance. If a person is in “deportation” proceedings, statistically, it is well settled that representation makes a vast difference in the outcome of the case. Several non-profit immigration service providers exist to serve eligible low-income and vulnerable immigrants in Indianapolis and statewide. The American Immigration Lawyers Association is a non-partisan, non-profit, voluntary network of immigration attorneys nationwide. Its mission includes advancing immigration attorneys’ skill and professional development, so seekers of immigration help may wish to retain a member of the AILA Indiana chapter.

Because immigration law is a federal practice area, licensure in Indiana versus another state is not required to represent Indiana-based clients in immigration court or before an immigration agency/officer, but hiring an attorney licensed in Indiana could offer practical benefits like familiarity with local resources, courts, and agencies. This Indiana Courts link shows the status of an attorney’s licensure in Indiana and disciplinary action history.
Have a family safety plan or help others form one 
Certain public spaces like schools and courthouses were exempt from immigration enforcement under a federal government policy until its rescission in January 2025, so people must invoke basic constitutional rights. An explanation from a national non-profit is publicly available here.
Any parent or caretaker may take steps to ensure the safety of their dependents if they become incapacitated for any reason, including immigration detention, and community-based resources exist. Knowing a person’s noncitizen (“A”) number is key to helping someone detained for immigration reasons. State family law governs guardianships, and power of attorney documents may be executed but may not be needed by everyone in every circumstance. For questions or concerns, consult a qualified attorney. 
Take care of yourself and others
Studies show that more than a majority of adults in the U.S. have experienced potentially traumatic events during their lives and, in my experience, most immigrant clients have experienced trauma in at least one form during their immigration journey. If they wish, immigrant survivors can connect with advocated trained to help in overcoming the effects of trauma, and this can put immigrant clients in better position to work with their attorneys on a legal case. 
For those in crisis, emotional and mental health support is available by calling/texting 988 (available in English, Spanish and to those who are deaf or hard of hearing). Vicarious or secondary trauma often affects those in roles aimed at helping survivors of trauma. Identifying signs of vicarious trauma and practicing self-care activities are at a minimum worth exploring. 
In conclusion, I hope that at least one piece of information in this article was helpful. May you be welcomed in your community, and may you be well.

Every state — usually the attorney general — decides who gets the money, how it’s allowed to be spent and whether the families most impacted by addiction can know or advise how the dollars are spent. 
When the first opioid settlements were being finalized in 2021, Mississippi’s main decision maker, Attorney General Lynn Fitch, asked the state’s towns, cities and counties to sign on to an agreement to join the lawsuits. The agreement says local governments receive 15% of Mississippi’s total share, and their elected officials can spend the money like any other public dollars without reporting where the dollars go. 
Nearly 150 Mississippi cities and counties signed onto the agreement, and most started receiving their payments in the fall of 2022. For the next two and a half years, they told their constituents almost nothing about how they were spending their money. 
Beginning in May, Mississippi Today put in records requests to all local governments receiving Mississippi opioid settlement money. One hundred and forty one of the 147 opioid governments that received opioid settlement funds told Mississippi Today how much money they’ve received and how they’ve been using the dollars. Five localities provided Mississippi Today with incomplete information, and Mound Bayou provided the newsroom with no information.
Cities and counties were scattered in the timing of their responses, from a few providing information the same day and others fulfilling requests months later. The presentation of their responses also took a variety of forms; some local record keepers provided detailed spending ledgers and official city or county meeting minutes where elected officials voted how to spend their dollars. Others replied to the email with a few sentences explaining how much money they received and how it’s being used. 
To clearly show how much money local governments have received and how they’ve been using those dollars, Mississippi Today created its database. We broadly identified five pieces of information from the responses: 

How much money a government has received
Whether a government’s settlement money is being used for a specific project and what that project is
Where a government’s settlement money is being deposited into its general fund
Where a government’s settlement money is unallocated or used for unknown purposes because the officials didn’t respond
When the locality responded to our request.

To say whether the spending addressed addiction, Mississippi Today compared a government’s response to the list of opioid prevention uses the settlements’ lawyers recommend. 
From there, we sorted the governments into:

Those that were using settlement money to address addiction
Those that were not using settlement money to address addiction
Those that used some settlement money to address addiction 
Those that did not respond to our request for spending plans 
Those that have yet to spend their dollars.

When a local government administrator provided official records that showed the money is being spent, Mississippi Today uploaded the documents and linked to the file in the database.
To make sure this information was presented accurately and consistently, Mississippi Today hired an independent fact checker to review the database. The fact checker was not paid based on the results of the assessment.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/02091825/naloxone.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446
,Mississippi Today,2025-09-15 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi Today opens ‘black box’ of opioid settlement spending,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/15/black-box-of-opioid-settlement-spending/,"A Mississippi Today investigation found that after nearly three years of state and local governments receiving money, they have reported spending less than $1 million – or less than 1% of the money received so far – to prevent more drug deaths.","Mississippi has received tens of millions of dollars in lawsuit settlement money each year since 2022 from corporations that contributed to the opioid overdose epidemic, a public health crisis that’s killed roughly 10,000 people in the state since 1999.
But a Mississippi Today investigation found that in the three years of receiving the funds, public officials across the state reported spending less than $1 million – or less than 1% of the money received so far – on direct measures to prevent more drug deaths.
The attorney general’s office split the money – expected to total around $421 million through 2040 – between Mississippi’s state and local governments. Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office and the Legislature oversee most of Mississippi’s opioid settlement dollars, but they’ve only spent money on attorneys’ fees so far. The remaining portion – 15% of Mississippi’s funds – goes to cities, counties and towns. 
Management of the local dollars has mostly been a mystery until now. Fitch created a contract with towns, cities and counties that allows them to spend their portion on whatever they see fit – unlike agreements in at least 34 other states. They’re also not required to report what they do with the dollars.
But how Mississippi governments spend money is information that can be requested by anyone. From May to August, Mississippi Today filed public records requests with all 147 towns, cities and counties that have received settlement dollars to find out how much they’ve gotten and how they’ve been using the funds.
The newsroom accounted for about $15.5 million and received responses from almost every city and county receiving settlement shares. It filed an ethics complaint against Mound Bayou, the only local government that didn’t provide any information. Mississippi Today tracked how that money is being spent and analyzed the data to determine how much Mississippi is spending to prevent overdoses, treat addiction and connect people with recovery.
Mississippi Today has published a database for anyone to search how local governments are spending opioid settlement dollars.

Here are some of the biggest takeaways:

Since September 2022, the 146 towns, cities and counties that responded to Mississippi Today reported receiving roughly $15.5 million. Leaders for those governments have spent about $6.4 million of that.


Around $945,000 has been used to address addiction with the strategies laid out in one of the opioid settlements, which plaintiffs’ lawyers called “an exemplar.” Most of that money has been used to support drug courts and mental health crisis intervention services. All of the states bordering Mississippi report using at least $4 million each – significantly more than Mississippi both in terms of dollars and percentage of total share – on strategies to address the overdose crisis, and most have committed tens of millions of dollars already.


The remaining $5.4 million is being used for other purposes. Local officials have deposited $4.2 million directly into accounts for general expenses, often making it impossible to track the dollars. Some expenses not related to addiction include police equipment in Oxford and fiber optic cable installation in Jackson. The city of Vicksburg purchased and firefighter suits and donated to a crisis pregnancy center.


Over the past three years, 20 of the 147 local governments have spent or finalized plans to spend some or all of their opioid settlement shares to address addiction, officials told Mississippi Today, and 53 governments have not spent or made plans to spend any opioid dollars.


Just one of the 147 governments, Hattiesburg, indicated it would create opportunities for public input on how to spend its opioid settlement dollars. Mayor Toby Barker initiated his plan after Mississippi Today submitted its public records request in May. 


Public health and legal experts who reviewed Mississippi Today’s data said the pattern of Mississippi’s local spending is a problem, as the money was won from companies that profited while residents struggled with addiction.
Representatives for the towns, cities and counties pointed out to Mississippi Today that Fitch’s contract advised them to spend their dollars for any public purpose. The attorney general has minimized the amount of Mississippi opioid settlement money that must be spent addressing addiction. 

Mississippi cities and counties, lacking state guidance, spend millions of opioid settlement dollars on general expenses

While most states have developed plans that say all opioid settlement money needs to go toward addressing addiction, the Mississippi attorney general’s version says the state can use 30% of its dollars on other purposes, the most allowed by the national lawsuit settlements. Fitch included all of the local dollars in that 30%.
In addition to the attorney general’s directive, some city and county officials said the small amounts they were receiving made it difficult to identify the right addiction-related project. They instead highlighted other efforts they have undertaken to address substance use disorder, like funding local drug courts with other public dollars.
Mississippi Today emailed Fitch a letter with these findings, and she did not answer whether she still believes it was the right decision to allow cities and counties such free rein. Her chief of staff, Michelle Williams, said in a statement that the opioid crisis has cost the country hundreds of billions of dollars, and the settlements allow state and local governments to pay for prior opioid expenses over the past three decades. 
She said the attorney general’s office is working with the Legislature and a new state opioid settlement advisory committee to use the majority of Mississippi’s settlement dollars to prevent more overdoses.
“The Attorney General’s Office is committed to doing everything we can to get the money out to where it is needed quickly,” Williams wrote. 
But the state’s share likely won’t be distributed until July 2026, after the Legislature passes its next budget. Until then, the local dollars are the only Mississippi opioid settlement funds expected to be spent on anything besides lawyers’ fees and administrative expenses.

Dr. Rahul Gupta, former director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and an expert witness in several of the lawsuits against opioid companies, said these dollars should be an opportunity to prevent more suffering after the defendant companies’ business models led to an unprecedented number of drug deaths.
He said Mississippi’s local spending reminded him of how states used money from the 1990s tobacco lawsuits — for purposes other than ending a public health catastrophe.
“We should have learned a lot from our tobacco settlement funds,” Gupta said. “It’s disheartening and disappointing to see that.”
‘There was just nothing’
In 2022, when Tricia Christensen established the Appalachian Opioid Remediation project, she created a database to track how 13 states in the region spent their opioid settlement dollars. For the next two years, she led a team that pored through Google alerts, media reports and local public meetings in those states, including Mississippi.
She and her team found opioid settlement spending information in every state, except one.
“In Mississippi, there was just nothing,” said Christensen, now a consultant who advises states on how to spend opioid settlement money. “It was like a black box.”
While a few local governments provided Mississippi Today with spending resolutions passed by city and county officials, most appear to be spending their dollars without any public announcement. Many officials didn’t produce any internal documents that detailed how they were using their money and instead emailed the newsroom a few sentences that outlined their expenses.
Officials with McComb and Charleston said they didn’t know how much opioid settlement money they’d received – despite the fact they were already spending it. Mississippi Today referred clerks for the cities to the management firm in charge of distributing national opioid settlement money so they could determine how much their governments had secured.
When they provided the newsroom with that information and their spending, the records showed each had already spent a large amount of their dollars. McComb used $106,500 of its roughly $151,000 for new police cars, and Charleston had used the roughly $1,000 it received for payroll expenses and police supplies.
Dr. Judith Feinberg, a West Virginia University behavioral medicine and psychiatry professor, helped write a set of best practice guidelines for how states can use these dollars to prevent more overdose deaths. She said she believes state officials who don’t require or even encourage public reporting of opioid settlement spending are prioritizing politics over public health.

“If no one writes anything down, then there’s nothing to investigate,” she said.
Not every government provided Mississippi Today with all the requested information. Officials for Rankin County, which is expected to get the third largest amount of opioid settlement money of any local government, provided Mississippi Today with checks they’ve received but no documents that detail how they’ve been spending nearly $510,000. 
In county attorney Craig Slay’s response, he included a copy of Fitch’s contract with local governments. The sentence that says counties can spend opioid dollars on anything they deem appropriate was highlighted.
Slay did not respond to calls and emails from Mississippi Today about the spending, and he didn’t engage with a reporter for the newsroom at a Rankin County Board of Supervisors meeting in August when he was asked how these dollars were spent. 
“The fact that no one has to report is tragic because you don’t know what the money was spent for,” Feinberg said. “And there’s no accounting. That’s really crazy.”
Thinking about the larger picture
Mississippi’s local governments are expected to accept at least $48 million more in opioid settlement funds over the next 15 years.  
Dr. Cathy Slemp led the West Virginia health department as the state battled the country’s deadliest overdose crisis in the late 2010s. She said the unspent dollars could be an opportunity for local elected officials to begin developing the treatment and recovery resources needed to stop more Mississippi drug deaths.
It’s easy to understand why local governments might want to use the funds to plug budget holes, she said. But she cautioned whether that would be the wisest decision, as many Mississippians struggling with opioid addiction still don’t have access to effective treatment. 
“We can continue to just fill holes, or we can think about it in the larger picture,” she said.
Melody Worsham, a peer support specialist for the Mississippi Recovery Advocacy Project, said she’s hopeful this money can eventually find its ways to groups like hers — organizations that rely on the expertise of those who’ve dealt with addiction and can share which strategies may reach others in similar situations.
But she said the management of the opioid settlement funds mirrors a concerning pattern of how officials in Mississippi spend public dollars. 
“When they get the money, the state figures out, the governments figure out how to spend that money as quietly as possible.”
Editor’s note: Mississippi Today sent almost all of its public records requests in mid-June. Local governments responded on dates that ranged from the same day we sent the request to early September. The settlement administrators sent some payments out throughout July, and governments that wrote back to the newsroom in June have likely received more money since then. We’ve noted the date of when we received the information in our database. Additionally, some towns, cities and counties may have used money or formalized spending plans since they responded. 
When governments provided totals with and without interest, Mississippi Today used the total without interest, as more governments responded in that format. Some checks originally earmarked for towns and cities, especially those set to receive relatively little opioid settlement money, were reallocated to their counties. Because of that, the total these governments expect to get may differ slightly from what they will get.

About $4.3 million of that has been designated for routine government expenses.","For the past three years, 147 towns, cities and counties have controlled millions of Mississippi opioid settlement dollars meant to address the overdose epidemic. 
However, elected officials have been much more likely to spend the money on routine government expenses than on addressing addiction, a Mississippi Today investigation found. And they are doing so legally: Attorney General Lynn Fitch allowed them to spend these dollars on any public purpose rather than addressing the public health catastrophe that’s killed over 1,300 Mississippians since the state received its first lawsuit check.
Mississippi Today filed public records requests with all cities and counties that have received National Opioid Settlement dollars to learn how much money each has received and spent. Of the over $15.5 million local governments have received, they’ve used roughly $6.4 million as of this summer. About $4.3 million of that has been designated for routine government expenses. 

Most of Mississippi’s opioid settlement money is controlled by the state Legislature, which tasked an advisory committee with recommending how lawmakers spend the state’s share to treat and prevent opioid addiction. But applications for those dollars only went out last month, and that money is unlikely to be distributed until the Legislature enacts a budget in July 2026. 
Until then, the only Mississippi lawsuit money that can likely address addiction is funds that went to the 147 local governments, which are expected to net around $48 million more in settlements over the next 15 years.  

Mississippi Today opens ‘black box’ of opioid settlement spending

Melody Worsham, a peer support specialist for the Mississippi Recovery Advocacy Project, has worked to address the harms of the addiction epidemic for over a decade. She said she sees missing resources in the state’s effort to prevent overdose deaths every day, and she hopes the settlement money will eventually go to groups such as hers that build on the knowledge of people who’ve experienced addiction. 
She said that she would be willing to fill potholes herself after Mississippi Today told her the amount of local government opioid lawsuit money being used for city and county general expenses.
“I’ve got people to volunteer to do the potholes if they stop spending the opioid money for that,” she said. “I’m disgusted. I’m disillusioned. I’m actually kind of speechless, I really am.”
Jackson County on the Gulf Coast and the city of Jackson are two of the five local governments that have received the most money in the state to date. Neither are using their dollars to address addiction, records responses show.
Jackson County, the county with the most suspected overdose deaths last year, is using over $1 million for unspecified government expenses. The city of Jackson has spent some of the roughly $547,000 it reported receiving for fiber optic cable installation, office moving expenses and a shelving system. 
Both Jackson County Board of Supervisors President Barry Cumbest and Jackson Mayor John Horhn did not respond to emails asking whether their governments have made the best use of these lawsuit dollars. Records show Horhn took office after the city of Jackson spent some of its settlement money for general purposes.
Mississippi Today could only account for about $945,000 across all 147 localities that has been spent to address and prevent addiction. Most of that went to fund mental health emergency services and drug intervention courts, programs that direct some people struggling with substance use disorder away from jails or prisons and toward treatment programs. 

Officials for the dozens of governments depositing opioid settlement checks into general expense accounts told Mississippi Today that once the money goes into those accounts, it’s impossible to trace where the dollars go. Many of them pointed to a settlement agreement and letters authored by Fitch’s office, which told local governments to use the money however they see fit.
Across the country, there’ve been other instances of local governments spending opioid lawsuit dollars for resources that may not directly address addiction. But unlike Mississippi’s contract, most states’ agreements make elected officials conform to an approved list of uses that are intended to respond to the public health crisis. 
Dr. Judith Feinberg, a West Virginia University behavioral medicine and psychiatry professor, co-authored a guide with other public health professors that lays out how states can use opioid settlement money to prevent more deadly overdoses. After reviewing Mississippi Today’s data, she said the local governments’ spending so far has been “very tragic.”

“From a public health perspective, this is complete and utter bullshit,” she said. 
After Mississippi Today sent Fitch a letter that outlined the local governments’ spending, she did not answer a question about whether she still stood by the decision to allow cities and counties to spend the money on any public purpose.
In a statement, Fitch’s Chief of Staff Michelle Williams said the opioid crisis cost hundreds of billions of dollars, expenses that affected government health care, criminal justice and social safety net services. Williams said the settlements can be used to reimburse cities and counties for some of these costs. 
It’s a different message than Fitch communicated when announcing at least one of the settlements in 2021. When an agreement was finalized with the consulting group McKinsey, her office said the funds were being provided “to address the crisis.”
In a July interview, Williams said that the attorney general’s agreement was the best way to encourage Mississippi’s towns, cities and counties to join the national opioid lawsuits. 
But she said she couldn’t recall if any local governments said they wouldn’t sign on to the lawsuits unless they could spend their money on any purpose, though she believed it helped get more to join. 
Fitch is reported to be considering a run for governor in 2026, which Feinberg said could have played into her decision. 
“It’s just politically to make everyone happy at the local level,” she said. “Like, ‘Oh, here’s a little slush fund for you. Do what you would like.’”

Pine Belt resident Jane Clair Tyner watched her son Asa Henderson struggle with opioid use until he died at 23 years old in 2019. When Mississippi Today told her about the settlement spending of the cities and counties, she said it adds heartache to the grief she continues to carry. 
Tyner said she has no interest in receiving settlement checks from the pharmaceutical companies, as the money would be better used to prevent more overdoses. But the spending shows that Fitch’s new message is the one cities and counties have taken to heart. 
“It’s just incredibly unjust,” she said. “It makes a mockery of our entire justice system. It makes a mockery of court cases. It makes a mockery of settlements.” 
‘The epidemic is marching on’
While U.S. and Mississippi overdose deaths have slightly decreased over the past two years, both the state and national death rates are higher than they were in the late 2010s, when the country’s surgeon general said combating the opioid epidemic was his top public health priority.
Dr. Caleb Alexander, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor and an expert witness in many of the opioid settlement lawsuits, said all the money Mississippi is receiving is a valuable resource that can prevent more deaths. 
“The epidemic is marching on, and enormous harms continue to occur in cities and counties, big and small,” he said. 
Shortages in the state’s treatment and recovery resources, ones that more local financial support could help address, have likely prolonged the epidemic. A 2023 Journal of the American Medical Association study found that among Mississippians on Medicaid, a federal-state health insurance program for vulnerable people, less than a third of those diagnosed with opioid addiction received effective medication for the disease. 
Sixty-eight of Mississippi’s 82 counties didn’t have any recovery residences, also known as sober living homes, according to a 2022 report from the Public Health Institute. The report says the availability of these homes, which the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has said is crucial to curbing more overdoses, is among the lowest of any state in the country.
To Tyner, the mother who lost her son to an overdose, these are some of the resource holes that the settlement dollars could help fill. 
“We have an opportunity to open more beds, to create more community mental health centers, to make recovery possible,” she said.
The only government that reported spending its money to improve access to opioid use disorder medication or recovery residences was Horn Lake, which donated about $75,000 to a local treatment center in June. 
DeSoto County has used all of its settlement money for the construction of a new crisis stabilization unit, and Lamar County plans to do the same with its hundreds of thousands of dollars. But these centers are designed for stabilizing people in crisis or experiencing psychosis, and they don’t provide long-term services for addiction.
Melody Madaris oversees one of these units as the executive director of the community mental health center Communicare in north Mississippi. Centers like hers run both crisis stabilization units and addiction treatment programs, and she said local officials who want to prevent more overdoses should look to fund the treatment services instead.

Unlike private rehabilitation centers, addiction treatment programs at community mental health centers serve all regardless of Mississippians ability to pay. Madaris said that makes for difficult financial situations.
“We all operate in the red every year,” she said. 
Some of the Mississippi settlement spending that counts as addressing addiction is unlikely to prevent more overdose deaths, according to public health researchers. The city of Starkville is using about $15,000 for its police to teach the Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or DARE, a program that most research indicates isn’t effective at preventing drug use. 
The city of Clarksdale’s deputy clerk said the government is spending roughly $36,000 so its police and fire departments can buy more naloxone, the opioid overdose-reversing medication. But Worsham, the Mississippi peer support specialist, said the criminal nature of opioid use makes it unlikely people will call law enforcement to respond to an overdose. 
“They’re putting it in the hands of people who are least likely to be able to hand it to the people who need it,” she said. 
David Engel, the Copiah County administrator, said he believes the drug court addiction treatment program his government is sending its settlement dollars to is amazing. 
But beyond that, he said he and the supervisors are unclear how best to prevent more opioid deaths. And the attorney general’s office messages saying the money can be spent on anything aren’t helpful.
“That’s no guidance whatsoever,” he said. 
Repeating history could doom future crisis response
Dr. Rahul Gupta, the former Office of National Drug Control Policy director, said it should be the responsibility of the state government to encourage local governments how best the dollars can be used to stop the public health overdose crisis.
Fitch’s counterparts in states such as North Carolina and Utah have developed instructions for how these dollars can best be used to prevent more overdoses. Fitch did not answer a question about whether she would consider making a guide like those for the local governments.
“It’s not fair to blame them (localities) for utilizing money in different ways if we’re not providing that overarching guidance to them,” Gupta said. He added that public health bodies such as Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health have created helpful national guides for opioid settlement spending.
Only one of the 147 governments, the city of Hattiesburg, indicated that it would seek input from residents who’ve been impacted by addiction to guide how it should use its settlement funds. It reported receiving roughly $54,000 in May.


Mayor Toby Barker said in June he wanted to seek the advice of families who’ve lost loved ones, addiction treatment providers and law enforcement officers of how to best spend its dollars.
“I don’t want us to do something to do something,” he said. “I want to see Hattiesburg make a focused investment on where it can do some good.”
Feinberg, the West Virginia University professor, said community input is the best way to make sure these dollars reduce the overdose death rate. She said other local elected officials may want to look to Hattiesburg as an example of what’s possible, as she thinks it could have the best luck at saving lives.
It’s important that these dollars be spent to prevent more overdose deaths not just for this crisis but also for future ones, Gupta said. The opioid lawsuits were modeled after tobacco cases in the 1990s, and a lot of that money didn’t end up addressing the public health emergency at hand. 
If that happens again, Gupta said, judges could be hesitant to demand response money for the next public health emergency created by corporations.
“It’s going to be very difficult to argue why these are required to abate that crisis,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/11135521/MT-OpioidSettlement-story2-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-09-15 07:58:12.659446

But it has worked out for the former AGs who have successfully used the office to get the hell out […],"Eric Schmitt answers questions during a press conference after filing to run in the Missouri Senate primaries on Feb. 22, 2022 in Jefferson City (Madeline Carter/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s three most recent former attorneys general — all of whom claim to be “constitutional conservatives” — tripped over themselves to out-racism each other while auditioning for Trump. 
This has not been good for Missouri. But it has worked out for the former AGs who have successfully used the office to get the hell out of Missouri and into federal office without having to pretend to do the work of being attorney general for too long (It’s a four year term, but we’ve had four in six years). 
When I wrote about the hateful and wasteful anti-diversity crusade of former-as-of-last-week Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, I wondered if I wasn’t whitewashing his efforts by avoiding using the more apt synonym for “anti-diversity,” which is “white supremacist.”
When U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley gave a speech last year in which he proudly proclaimed to be a “Christian Nationalist,” I thought the white supremacist dogwhistles couldn’t get any louder.
But Missouri’s junior senator and second most recent AG-for-a-minute, Eric Schmitt, yeeted the dogwhistles in a speech telling us exactly what he and the MAGA movement he has pledged allegiance to stand for: rewriting history to justify the dominance of white, purportedly Christian men.
Schmitt’s speech at the National Conservatism Conference followed one speaker who argued at length that America’s biggest problem is white guilt and another who insisted the U.S. is in a crisis that can only be resolved by becoming a Christian nation. 
Schmitt went full blood and soil. 
In the speech, titled “What Is an American,” he proclaimed that America is not “a proposition” or a shared set of values, rather it is a country for white people descended from European settlers, whose accomplishments should not be diminished by acknowledging the people that some of them enslaved, the Native Americans they killed, or anyone else denied equal rights at the founding.  
Real Americans, in his view, can trace their ancestry to settlers. He frames his German ancestors as real Americans. He doesn’t call them “immigrants,” of course, instead contrasting them with other immigrants, Native Americans, and the enslaved people who long pre-dated his ancestors’ arrival. That requires either astounding ignorance or deliberate obfuscation of the fact that neither Germans nor Catholics were initially considered white or American.
Schmitt dismissed Americans’ outrage at the death of George Floyd and valorized Confederate generals.
Schmitt mocked the idea that “a poem on the Statute of Liberty” or “five words in the Declaration of Independence” define who is an American. 
The five words he finds overemphasized and a tool of the woke: “all men are created equal.” 
I kid you not. Read the speech.
Schmitt is peddling a perverse and revisionist originalism in which only the founders who won the debates of the time matter. He calls us back to when the Constitution was first signed — when it counted enslaved people as 3/5ths of a person to appease slaveowners. 
He is rejecting the Constitution that the people of the U.S. amended with the 14th, 15th and 19th Amendments to include those of us who are not male or white.
Schmitt made repeated allusions to the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory. This is the increasingly widespread conspiracy theory that Jews are bringing non-white people into this country to replace its rightful white owners. That’s what the “good people on both sides” as Trump put it, who chanted “Jews will not replace us!” in Charlottesville were referring to. 
Schmitt hired a staffer who was fired by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign for making a video containing Neo-Nazi imagery and has too many ties to white supremacists for me to detail here. 
Schmitt’s proposition that certain people are entitled to rule based on ancestry or power, rather than required to convince voters of varying backgrounds to vote for them, is not just a horrifying thing to say outloud. It’s an ideology that underlies so many real world illegal power grabs — from Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election to Governor Mike Kehoe and Republican legislators’ effort to redistrict away Kansas City area citizens’ voting power. 
Nevertheless, I take solace in the fact that — though truly horrific words came out of the mouth of our sitting senator — the video shows his speech was sparsely attended and everyone looked bored. 
There are more of us than there are of them. Schmitt can try to rewrite our history and claim this country isn’t “based on a proposition,” but Lincoln was right. This nation was “conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000006-scaled-e1757792868662-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-15 06:57:03.965662

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Iowa congressional candidates took time Saturday at the Polk County Democrats’ Steak Fry to condemn political violence in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing in Utah.
Van Hollen, gave a keynote address at event, an annual Iowa fundraiser that featured speeches from Democratic candidates for Iowa’s U.S. Senate race, as well as from the 3rd and 4th congressional district races. He spoke about Kirk’s death, saying the shooting is a reminder of “how fragile our democracy can feel,” while criticizing Trump’s response to the issue.
On Wednesday, Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot while answering a question at an event at Utah Valley University. The suspected gunman was identified and taken into custody Friday.
Politicians and leaders mourned Kirk’s death and called for a change to prevent future politically motivated violence.
“The answer cannot be more violence,” Van Hollen said. “The answer cannot be vengeance. And sadly, the president is using this moment not to unite America against political violence, but to engage in finger pointing.
“But we will not be silenced. We will speak out for what we believe vigorously, courageously and peacefully,” he said.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said it has been a “really hard week” in light of Kirk’s death, and that Democrats, and all Americans, need to take steps to ensure these threats are eliminated.
“We don’t have to look very far to see other examples of violence that has occurred because of political leanings,” Hart said, in part referring to the fatal shooting of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman in June. “And none of us find that to be acceptable, because it simply isn’t.

“We live in a country that was founded on the principle that we could stand up in a place like this and express our feelings, our thoughts, our attitudes, our beliefs and our political leanings, and not get shot because we have an opinion or a thought that’s different than somebody else’s,” she said.
In Iowa, there has been an outpouring of sympathy for Kirk’s family and calls to stop political violence. Speaking with reporters, Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate called for an end to political violence.
In recent days, there has been some criticism from Republicans and others of Iowans, including some teachers, who have made controversial social media posts about Kirk’s death.
Democratic Senate candidate Jackie Norris, the school board president for the Des Moines Public Schools, said political violence was unacceptable, and that teachers — alongside most people — should be more cognizant of what they are publicly posting on social media. However, Norris added, “we have to respect that people have different views,” including teachers.
“It is important that we tone down the rhetoric, but we also have to respect that (teachers) have strong feelings too,” Norris said. “It’s a balance.”
Van Hollen calls Democrats ‘spineless’ for not backing Mamdani
Van Hollen also told Iowans at the event that winning in 2026 will mean Democrats must be outspokenly in support of Democratic candidates running in 2025 races — including New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.
The Maryland Democrat said Iowa would play an important role in the 2026 midterms — but that supporting Democrats in 2025 races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as for New York City mayor, will help build “momentum” for 2026.
Van Hollen criticized New York Democrats for not supporting Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who won the Democratic mayoral primary. He said many Democrats representing New York in the U.S. House and Senate have “stayed on the sidelines” as President Donald Trump and others have mobilized to defeat the Democratic candidate.
“That kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of,” Van Hollen said. “They need to get behind him and get behind him now.”
Van Hollen criticized other aspects of the Democratic Party, saying the Biden administration was “feckless” in holding the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accountable to U.S. and international law. But he largely focused his remarks on Trump and Republicans in control of Congress.
Maryland leaders denounce political violence in the wake of Charlie Kirk killing

In addition to talking about Medicaid cuts and criticizing Trump’s foreign policy decisions, Van Hollen said the Trump administration was violating people’s constitutional rights by pursuing mass deportations. Van Hollen gained a significant national platform earlier in 2025 for his work involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador erroneously and held in prison there before being returned to the U.S. He is currently being held in Virginia by immigration authorities.
Van Hollen was one of the major advocates for returning Abrego Garcia to this country and allowing his case to go through the U.S. court system. At Saturday’s event, he said he was advised not to pursue the issue, as immigration is not a winning topic for Democrats, but said he continued to fight for Abrego Garcia’s due process rights because “our democracy cannot survive on silence or equivocation.”
“And lo and behold, Americans across the political spectrum do believe in the red, white and blue essential right to due process in the United States of America,” he said. “They do believe in the principle that no one in America — I mean, no one — should be disappeared by the state without having a chance before a court of law.
“And Americans understand this is not about one man,” Van Hollen said. “It’s about all of us. Because when you strip away the rights from one person, you threaten the rights … of all of us.”
Abrego Garcia has been returned to the U.S., though the Trump administration has said it intends to deport him again, potentially to the country of Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland.
Van Hollen said he would “never, ever apologize for standing up for anybody’s constitutional rights,” and said Democrats need to do more to speak out on issues they believe are important, even if polls or pundits say the topics are not politically advantageous. This will be especially important in states like Iowa, he said.
“We can and we will win here again, if — if — we speak to our core values, if we show people what we will stand up for and we will fight for,” Van Hollen said. “That’s why it’s great to be here to flip steaks and flip seats.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)On a sunny Friday afternoon, a half-dozen lawmakers and at least as many passenger rail advocates boarded an Amtrak train in Columbus, Wisconsin, for a 90-minute ride across the countryside.
Their destination was Tomah, where they spent another 90 minutes talking about why Wisconsin should expand train service and how to make that happen.
The event was a debut of sorts for the state Legislature’s Passenger Rail Caucus, a body that began coming together this year.
State Rep. Lori Palmeri
There are many reasons to expand passenger rail service in Wisconsin, according to Rep. Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh), a principal organizer for the group.
She sees economic and environmental benefits to rail travel — moving more people with less pollution per individual. But it also provides options for people no longer interested in driving but who don’t want to be stuck at home.
Rail service can address “the spatial mismatch between where people are living and where people are either working or going to school or getting their health care or recreating,” Palmeri said in an interview. “When I talk to seniors, they want to have that access to not just urban centers, but some of our second-class cities, too.”
An adult granddaughter of hers has epilepsy and will never be able to drive, Palmeri said, but others in that age group appear to drive less for other reasons.
“Fewer and fewer younger people are investing either in the learning piece” — driver training — “or the financial piece of car ownership,” she said, especially as cars get more expensive to own.
In short, for lawmakers in the passenger rail caucus and for the advocates encouraging them, passenger rail service is more than a nostalgic indulgence. It’s an underappreciated alternative to cramped airliners and congested highways.
‘Our time to stand up’
And it’s an alternative that Susan Foote-Martin, vice president of communications for the Wisconsin Association of Railroad Passengers, says will require a concerted campaign to gain more attention and support.
“We feel now is our time to stand up, and to speak up, and to ante up for the things that mean something to us,” Foote-Martin told the lawmakers and other advocates gathered in a Tomah restaurant’s banquet room.
“If we don’t do it, it’s not going to happen,” she said. “We can’t wait for a posse to come riding out of the sunset to save us. We are the posse.”
The caucus is building up steam while the view ahead is murky.
Amtrak’s Borealis train, which makes round trips once a day from Chicago to the Twin Cities through southern and western Wisconsin, has lived up to early projections, transporting nearly 230,000 riders in the first year of  its launch in May 2024.
Meanwhile, a  bus service connecting the Amtrak station in  Milwaukee to Green Bay through the Fox Valley will end abruptly Oct. 1. The service was funded through the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), but money to continue the route was left out of the 2025-27 state budget.
“We’re working with WisDOT to do more, but to do more takes funding,” Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari told the assembled group. “And if there’s a way to put that back together again or find funding for it, we’re at WisDOT’s disposal and yours to go hunt that down.”
The bus service offered, in effect, proof of concept for a long desired  revival of passenger rail service to Green Bay. That proposed extension is the farthest along in development and planning of various Amtrak extension proposals in Wisconsin, according to Larry Rueff, who represents NEWRails, a nonprofit formed to promote the Green Bay extension. (The first three letters in the name stand for Northeast Wisconsin.)
The line is ready for the next phase in planning. “We need to know that it’s going to be funded, or it won’t get any further — and that’s going to be bad for Green Bay and bad for the rest of the state’s projects,” Rueff said in an interview.
High-speed memories
There’s no shortage of other ideas. Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said he’d like to see passenger service into Beloit some day. Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point) would like to see service connecting Stevens Point and other central Wisconsin communities to the Twin Cities through the Chippewa Valley.
“I just want to see passenger rail as being a viable alternative to everyone having to have a car right now,” Miresse told the Wisconsin Examiner. “I think people would like the opportunity to travel to Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison and be able to hop on a train and not have the burden of having a vehicle.”
The choice of Tomah for Friday’s discussion harkened back to the high-speed rail project approved during former Gov. Jim Doyle’s second term. After Scott Walker was elected governor in 2010 promising to cancel the project, Doyle killed it just before leaving office at the end of that year.
The project’s demise also put off plans to put a passenger stop in Madison. Columbus, the nearest Amtrak station, is 27 miles northeast of the capital city.
“As someone who works in Madison almost every week, it was a great disappointment to lose that high speed rail option,” Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse), who also came to the Tomah meeting, said in an interview. “There are times when I’m driving to Madison and I think, ‘I could be on a train working right now.’”
Tomah had begun planning an intermodal hub as part of the high speed rail project. While that plan died, Tomah City Administrator Nick Morales told the group the city has seen bustling tourism and regularly draws in traffic to the region’s two military bases and a veterans hospital.
“We struggle with a lot of our transportation needs, and increased rail services to Tomah would greatly benefit us,” he said.
Getting Republicans on board
The lawmakers and advocates who gathered in Tomah contend that expanding rail service in Wisconsin should be a bipartisan objective, but only Democratic legislators were on hand for Friday’s event.
The late Republican Rep. Ed Brooks is reported to have proposed a railroad caucus years ago. “This was a dream of his,” Billings told the group, recalling fondly how she got to know Brooks early in her Assembly career.
Palmeri said she has reached out to several GOP lawmakers, some of whom have put their names on railroad-related bills in the past. “The hope was that we would have folks on the other side of the aisle also join us and hear the same information,” she said after the session was over Friday.
The canceled bus connection to Green Bay was among the casualties when the Republican majority on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee  removed $15 million for passenger rail service from Gov. Tony Evers’ draft budget.
The new passenger rail caucus is working on a bill that would make up for what was lost. There isn’t yet a draft, but Palmeri doesn’t expect it simply to be a rewrite of the Evers proposal.
“No disrespect to what was put in the budget, but I think there are some folks who are interested in going big or going home,” she said.  
Such legislation is unlikely to advance without support from Republicans, however. Asked what it would take to persuade GOP lawmakers to take it up, Palmeri answered, “them not being in the majority.”
So does that mean the developing legislation is intended for Democratic campaign messaging in the 2026 legislative elections?
“To a certain extent,” Palmeri said. “But I do also have the belief — maybe somewhat naïve — that there are people on the other side of the aisle who know this is good for their districts and who know that this could be their future — right?”

(Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images) Just before 8 a.m. on Jan. 31, an explosion rocked a nondescript one-story office building in an affluent suburb of Detroit.
The building was home to The Oxford Center, a health clinic that provided hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat a variety of disorders.
Inside the clinic, a spark had ignited the high-pressure, pure-oxygen atmosphere in a hyperbaric chamber where 5-year-old Thomas Cooper lay with a pillow and blanket, receiving treatment for ADHD and sleep apnea. A fireball consumed the inside of the chamber in seconds, killing the boy, law enforcement later said.
His mother suffered third-degree burns on her arms as she tried to free her son.
Within weeks of the tragedy, Michigan Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel charged three Oxford Center employees, including the center’s owner, with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and a fourth employee with involuntary manslaughter. Nessel said the staff disregarded multiple safety protocols.
The Michigan death and another fatality less than six months later at a wellness clinic in Arizona have thrown a spotlight on the largely unregulated world of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. A treatment once primarily confined to hospitals, it has surged in popularity in alternative health spaces in recent years.
About 1,200 hyperbaric medicine programs operate in the United States, according to estimates from the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, a nonprofit organization recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an accrediting body for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Of those, 140 are accredited by the organization.
While nearly a dozen states require hyperbaric oxygen chambers to comply with certain safety standards, no states have comprehensive requirements specifically for accreditation or inspection of HBOT facilities.
Wellness clinics, sometimes without physician supervision, use the pressurized chambers for off-label treatments — those not approved by the FDA.
Before the explosion that killed Thomas Cooper, Michigan state Sen. Stephanie Chang had never heard of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The Oxford Center is located in her district, just a block from where she takes her daughter for tutoring, she said.
Chang, a Democrat, was aghast when she learned the state doesn’t accredit or regularly inspect clinics that offer the therapy. It doesn’t even track where such clinics operate.
“I think many people in the community felt the same way,” she said. “This is happening in our community without any regulation? We’ve got to do something.”
MAHA fans
Earlier this year, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited wellness podcaster Gary Brecka at his home, where they hung out in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber before taping an episode of Brecka’s show.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has found a support network inside Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement, among wellness influencers and anti-aging gurus. Podcasters including Brecka and Joe Rogan have touted the benefits of the chambers, while a hyperbaric chamber manufacturer had a presence at this year’s MAHA Spring Gala in Florida.
Before Trump’s reelection, Kennedy said in a social media post that the “FDA’s war on public health” was about to end, and he criticized its “aggressive suppression” of alternative health treatments, including hyperbaric therapy.

In hyperbaric oxygen therapy, also known as HBOT, patients rest inside a special chamber where they breathe pure oxygen. The air pressure in the chamber is raised to a level higher than normal to help increase the amount of oxygen in the blood to in turn accelerate healing.
Modern HBOT has been used for decades and is approved by the FDA to treat more than a dozen conditions, including burns, carbon monoxide poisoning and non-healing diabetic wounds.
Last month, in the wake of the Michigan and Arizona deaths, the FDA issued recommendations for HBOT providers and facilities to help reduce safety risks.
But as the wellness industry has ballooned, HBOT has seen “an exponential increase” in nonmedical providers, said John Peters, executive director at the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.
Wellness clinics like The Oxford Center in Michigan advertise that HBOT can treat a multitude of conditions off-label, from cancer and HIV to dementia and autism. Scientific research has been inconclusive. For example, some studies have shown benefits for children with autism, while others have found insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment.
Peters believes much of the off-label claims are exaggerated.
“There are people with discretionary income willing to spend it on these sales pitches,” said Peters. “What’s more sad than that are the people who are vulnerable. These are individuals who have sick family members or are sick themselves and they’re grasping at straws, looking for any relief. And they are tricked by these carpetbaggers.”
Most insurance plans will cover HBOT for FDA-approved uses, including the treatment of burns or carbon monoxide poisoning. Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare — the health insurance for active-duty and retired members of the military — also have a short list of approved conditions. For everything else, it’s cash-only.
And HBOT typically isn’t a one-and-done treatment. It can cost $200 or more per treatment session, with dozens of sessions recommended. Thomas Cooper had been on his 36th of 40 treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sleep apnea, the Detroit Free Press reported. The FDA has not approved HBOT for either condition.
Unaccredited clinics like The Oxford Center are “making a lot of money and they have no one overseeing them,” said Michigan Democratic state Rep. Sharon MacDonell, who also represents the district where The Oxford Center was located and is working with Chang on a bill to regulate HBOT.
“No health insurance company is asking for documentation, no system is checking in. No state has figured out a way to do this, so we’re trying really hard.”
States in the dark
Deaths in hyperbaric chambers are rare, but the Michigan incident was one of two fatalities this year: In July, Walter Foxcroft, a 43-year-old physical therapist, was killed in an apparent flash fire in a hyperbaric chamber at his wellness clinic in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, according to municipal officials. First responders found him dead inside an intact chamber that appeared to have been on fire.
There have been other deaths and injuries over the past two decades.
In 2009, a 4-year-old boy and his 62-year-old grandmother died in a fire when a chamber exploded at a Florida clinic. That clinic, like the ones in Michigan and Arizona, was not accredited.
In 2023, a hyperbaric oxygen chamber exploded at a wellness spa in Utah, seriously injuring the two people inside, according to local fire officials. And in 2012, a hyperbaric chamber at a veterinary center in Florida exploded, killing the horse inside and a woman who had been operating the unit.
Nearly a dozen states require hyperbaric oxygen chambers to comply with certain safety standards for pressure vessels laid out by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
But Peters, with the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, said a large number of hyperbaric chambers imported from countries such as China and Poland that don’t meet those standards. He said experts believe there could be 20,000 noncode compliant chambers operating in the United States.










The FDA guidance does nothing to curb the proliferation of noncode compliant chambers into the country and the use of those chambers.


– John Peters, executive director at the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society


That’s one reason he believes the recent FDA guidance for safe use of the chambers rings hollow.
“The FDA guidance does nothing to curb the proliferation of noncode compliant chambers into the country and the use of those chambers,” he said. “It does nothing to address the secondary market. You can buy a hyperbaric chamber and sell it to another individual without any requirement.”
Access vs. safety
Chang and MacDonell say they want to require accreditation for hyperbaric chambers and for the clinics that offer the therapy, including requiring a physician or other medical provider to oversee treatment.
But some people, including some autism advocates, have expressed concern that overregulation could hurt access to HBOT for families that want it.
“I think these folks recognize they want to keep access but don’t want people getting taken advantage of by bad actors in this space, and want to ensure they’re going to a facility that’s doing things the right way,” Chang said.
Chang said the bill would not regulate a newer, more portable type of hyperbaric chamber that are popular in wellness circles and sometimes used in homes. They have soft outer shells and seal with a zipper, unlike traditional steel-cased chambers. The soft-side chambers provide so-called mild hyperbaric oxygen therapy at lower pressure and aren’t considered medical devices like hard-shell chambers. But in North Carolina, state fire marshals have shut down the use of such devices at wellness clinics over safety concerns.
Fire officials in other states, including Utah, have also expressed concerns over the soft-side chambers.
In a first for states, Texas might put MAHA warning labels on snack foods

In recent years, veterans groups have pushed for HBOT to be available and covered for treating traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Thirteen states have passed legislation to require or support such treatments for veterans, according to Eric Koleda, national director of state legislative efforts for TreatNOW, a coalition that promotes HBOT access for veterans.
Koleda said he’s glad the Michigan lawmakers are working on the issue, though he’s not convinced stricter regulation is needed.
“We’re not proposing that there needs to be an enormous amount of regulation because there are already safety standards in place, and if they’re adhered to, that ensures a safe level of operation,” he said. “This is treatment that’s already done safely every day.”
In July, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe signed a bill into law establishing a fund to pay for HBOT for veterans with a traumatic brain injury or PTSD. The bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the legislature.
Veteran-related HBOT bills have also been introduced this year in Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York and Oregon. Koleda said his organization is also working to get the FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to add traumatic brain injury and PTSD to the list of conditions approved for HBOT treatment.
Indiana state Sen. David Niezgodski, a Democrat, introduced a resolution in April urging the state’s legislative council to study regulation of HBOT. The deaths in Michigan and Arizona caught his eye, he said, because Indiana has a law promoting the treatment for veterans. The resolution passed but wasn’t taken up by the council.
“I am 100% for trying to do everything we can to get this treatment where those who need it are truly able to benefit from it,” he told Stateline. “Though I want to be certain that we do everything we can to make sure that when they receive that treatment, it’s going to be safe at all times.”
The Michigan lawmakers stress their bill doesn’t restrict HBOT’s off-label use and they’re continuing to work with stakeholders. They hope to get it filed before the end of the year.
“When you go into what you believe to be a medical facility, you assume it is being regulated and that it is licensed and that the people running this complex technology know what they’re doing,” said MacDonell. “That’s our goal.”

Sylvia Ortiz-Velez secured Republican support for her resolution and, unlike the Hispanic Caucus, was able to get a scheduled floor vote. Ortiz-Velez speaks at a press conference in January. Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Monday marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, and this year’s celebration could be the first time that the Wisconsin Legislature officially recognizes the month. 
Assembly Joint Resolution 83 recognizes that Hispanic Heritage Month runs from Sept. 15 through Oct. 15 and that it presents an opportunity to honor the contributions of Hispanics and Latinos to the “past, present and future” of Wisconsin and the country. The month starts halfway through September because Sept. 15 marks the anniversary of independence from Spanish rule for  several Central American countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
The Assembly unanimously passed the resolution authored by Milwaukee Democrat Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez, though its journey to the floor was marred by a public dispute among Democratic lawmakers. Black History Month resolutions have also stirred controversy in the past and for many years faced roadblocks to passage. This year the Black History Month resolution passed smoothly. 
Ortiz-Velez authored her resolution after she was not included as an author on a similar effort  by members of the Hispanic Legislative Caucus. Ortiz-Velez had declined to join the newly formed caucus, and its members explained that the authors of their resolution were exclusively  caucus members. 
Ortiz-Velez’s resolution differed from the caucus version in that it doesn’t honor the work of any specific individuals. 
Ortiz-Velez secured Republican support for her resolution and, unlike the Hispanic Caucus, was able to get a scheduled floor vote.
Ortiz-Velez said on the floor that in writing her resolution she “wanted to make sure that I focused on the values that bind us together, so everyone can feel that they were included and had a seat at the table.” She noted in her speech that Hispanic and Latino people make up 7.8% of the state’s population — the largest minority group in Wisconsin. 
“Across the state, Hispanic and Latino families are helping revitalize small towns and urban neighborhoods by opening businesses and buying homes and restoring vacant properties, supporting local schools and churches,” Ortiz-Velez said. “Hispanic and Latino Wisconsinites share the same core values… faith, family, hard work and service to community and country.”
The resolution states that Hispanic and Latino people settled in the area before Wisconsin achieved statehood in 1848 and that the 20th century was a time when Central and South Americans increasingly migrated to Wisconsin for work, becoming a “vital part of Wisconsin’s agricultural economy.”
“Wisconsin has become home to more than 450,000 Hispanics and Latinos, who represent one of the fastest-growing demographic groups in the state,” the resolution states. “Hispanics and Latinos live and work all across the state, enriching and revitalizing rural and urban communities alike.” 
It also recognizes that Hispanic and Latino residents have served as elected officials and “have risked their lives to defend the United States in every armed conflict in modern history.” 
Several lawmakers spoke in favor of the resolution ahead of the unanimous vote last week, including Rep. Priscilla Prado (D-Milwaukee), the leader of the Hispanic Legislative Caucus. 
Prado said the resolution was a “long overdue acknowledgment of the meaningful contributions that Hispanic communities have made to our great state.” 
“Unity is possible, even if we disagree on other issues, and at a time when division can feel ever so present, this resolution promises to lean into our shared humanity. It is not about winners or losers. It’s about the community I represent, and that I identify with,” Prado said. “Today, let’s pass this resolution, not just as a formality, but with excitement and heartfelt recognition to our Hispanic communities and their contribution to our great state.” 
Ortiz-Velez said in a statement that if the resolution passes the Senate, it will be the first time a joint resolution recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month will have ever passed the full Legislature. 
The resolution also has bipartisan support in the Senate with Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) as the leading coauthor. The Senate does not have a scheduled floor session during September.

Four initiatives among federal agencies and in Congress would harm the Western landscape that’s owned by all Americans, conservationists contend.
The post After national parks hearing, MAGA forces continue public land assault, greens say appeared first on WyoFile .","As Congress conducted a high-profile hearing in Grand Teton National Park 10 days ago to support parks funding, President Donald Trump’s administration and supporters were busy elsewhere eliminating public land protections across the West.
The Grand Teton hearing conducted by the House Committee on Natural Resources on Sept. 5 heard widespread support for resolving a backlog of maintenance at national parks, along with calls to restore DOGE staffing cuts.
But the committee meeting at the spectacular Jenny Lake Plaza came amidst a flurry of attacks against rules protecting wildlife, its habitat and preservation funds, conservationists said.
Those attacks include Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ move to rescind the Forest Service roadless rule that protects 59 million roadless acres considered vital to wildlife. Also, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order restricting use of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was created in 1964 to buy and preserve recreation lands.
“The administration is saying that public [BLM] lands should be managed primarily for the good of powerful drilling, mining and development interests.” Alison Flint
Meantime, the U.S. House on Sept. 3 put on the chopping block a Bureau of Land Management plan in Montana that restricted coal leasing. If agreed to by the Senate, the bill would open the door to “legal and regulatory chaos” across the West, the Center for Western Priorities warned.
And on Thursday, the BLM opened comment on the plan to roll back its Public Lands Rule that gave conservation an equal footing with industrial uses of property owned by all Americans.
All that happened in 15 days — about one week on either side of the congressional Teton hearing. But while witnesses were supporting parks in the open air of the Teton Mountains, Trump allies were undercutting conservation with less visible methods, one public lands advocate said.
The rule changes, secretarial orders and legislation are complex and sometimes opaque, said Amy Lindholm, an Appalachian Mountain Club director and spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition.
“It’s not easy to understand what’s going on here,” she said, using Burgum’s order curtailing the LWCF as an example. “It flies under the radar [but] could be as serious as selling off pieces of federal public land.”
The MAGA messages
The administration and its supporters characterized the changes as necessary to help reduce the federal deficit, rectify allegedly unlawful policies and increase energy production, among other things.
“I am so baffled and mortified that for four years our government intentionally tried to impose energy poverty on the American people, all to please the vocal but minority climate lobby,” U.S. Rep Harriet Hageman said on the House floor when voting Sept. 3 for Joint House Resolution 104.
That bill states that the BLM’s Montana management plan restricting coal leasing in the Powder River Basin “shall have no force or effect.”

Hageman’s vote was one of three in the 211-208 tally that helped Republicans use the Congressional Review Act to move the bill through the House.
On another front, Agriculture Secretary Rollins’ roadless-rule rollback will allow loggers “to access our abundant timer [sic] resources,” U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis wrote to a constituent on Sept. 2. The roadless rule “has done nothing to advance our national interest or strengthen our communities,” Lummis wrote.
The rollback “will give state and local leaders, not distant federal agencies, the authority to manage forests responsibly, improve forest health, and implement real wildfire prevention strategies,” Lummis’ letter reads. “I will push back on any policies that endangers [sic] Wyoming families, communities or businesses.”  
In ordering revisions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Interior Secretary Burgum wrote that changes will ensure funds “are managed efficiently and aligned with the goals of the Trump administration.” The account was used to buy and protect the 640-acre Kelly Parcel in Grand Teton National Park. While touting the revisions, Burgum said the Trump administration has “prioritized access to Federal lands and outdoor recreation.”
At the BLM, meanwhile, conservation should not be on equal footing with mining, drilling and grazing, according to a notice seeking public comment on the expurgation of the Public Lands Rule. Also known as the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, the measure is “unnecessary and violates existing statutory requirements,” the notice reads.
Conservation doesn’t rise to a “principal or major use” of BLM land, the Western Energy Alliance said in a statement supporting rollback of the Public Lands Rule. Those principal uses are “mineral exploration and production, livestock grazing, rights‐of‐way, fish and wildlife development, recreation, and timber,” the statement said.
Greens see an assault
Conservationists and others are challenging those MAGA positions. Using the Congressional Review Act to undo the BLM’s Montana plan for the Powder River Basin coal — a move Hageman voted for — risks unleashing “legal and regulatory chaos across the West,” the Center for Western Priorities said.
“If courts interpret this action broadly, every management plan written since 1996 could be challenged in court — potentially invalidating oil and gas leases, grazing permits, and threatening public access to trails and campgrounds,” the Center’s Deputy Director Aaron Weiss said in a statement.
Without BLM resource management plans, operations would revert to “outdated frameworks … written before today’s recreation economy took off,” he said. “Outfitters, guides and businesses that depend on reliable access for rafting, off-roading, and other outdoor activities could face years of uncertainty, permit delays, and costly litigation.”
Road densities are especially high in Wyoming outside of wilderness areas and wilderness study areas, marked in blue in this map. Roads depicted are from the U.S. Geological Survey National Transportation Dataset. (Wyoming Wilderness Association)
On the roadless front, Lummis’ contention that roads can help prevent wildfires contradicts a 2007 study that found “current road systems increase risk of human-caused fire.” Authored by the Pacific Biodiversity Institute, the 40-page paper found that “[a]reas that are very close to roads have many times more wildfire occurrences than areas distant from roads.”
Roadless areas are critical to outfitter Meredith Taylor, who has worked successfully in them for decades, she told WyoFile. Industrializing them could endanger her family, community and business, she suggested. 
“Unnecessary road development would ruin the value of these public lands for people and wildlife who appreciate them as they are,” Taylor said. The Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation and others urged the public to comment before Sept. 19.
Conservation should be equal
Conservationists also decried the pending revocation of the BLM’s Public Lands Rule/Conservation and Landscape Health Rule. “The administration is saying that public lands should be managed primarily for the good of powerful drilling, mining and development interests,” Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement.
“They’re saying that public lands’ role in providing Americans the freedom to enjoy the outdoors, and conserve beloved places … is a second-class consideration,” Flint said. The rule “has solid grounding in a nearly 50-year-old directive from Congress,” she said.
Defenders of Wildlife said the existing rule “requires science-based decision-making and consideration of conservation.” The rule is “foolishly being yanked away in service of the ‘Drill, baby, drill’ agenda,” Vera Smith, national forests and public lands director at Defenders, said in a statement.
Addressing changes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which receives $900 million a year from oil and gas leasing, LWCF Coalition spokesperson Lindholm warned of dangers in Burgum’s order.
“There’s a provision encouraging states to use their state grant dollars [from the federal fund] to buy surplus federal land,” she said. “We don’t want states to use the funds to buy back federal land that’s already been protected, to pay for continued access to places they already have access to,” she said.
Given Burgum’s advocacy for developing federal land for housing, the changes create “a dangerous potential pathway for the selloff of federal lands,” she said.
The agency already has a process for the sale of property that works, Lindholm said. Burgum’s order will reexamine that process “with the intent of increasing the discretion of the secretary.”
Without Burgum’s stated selloff advocacy, “it’s not something we would have necessarily red-flagged,” she said.
Soul of Wyoming
Healthy landscapes and wildlife are the soul of northwestern Wyoming, state Rep. Liz Storer, a Democrat from Jackson, said. Her district covers Grand Teton and parts of Yellowstone national parks, the National Elk Refuge, parts of the Bridger-Teton National Forest and BLM property.
Those lands and the wildlife on them “define who we are,” she said at a Keep Parks Public rally in Jackson on Sept. 4.
Others at the forum chimed in. “These threats to public lands are very much alive,” Lauren Bogard, senior director of advocacy at the Center for Western Priorities, said after outlining DOGE cuts and threats to conservation.EcoTour Adventures founder and wildlife guide Taylor Phillips told the Teton congressional panel that scientists are scared. “In the next five to 10 years, the wildlife as we see it now will not exist unless drastic measures are taken,” Phillips testified of his talks with scientists.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)After weeks of hype, it turns out the Oklahoma Department of Education’s new test that promises to weed out “woke” teachers doesn’t do any such thing.
In fact, it’s impossible to fail Superintendent Ryan Walters’ so-called “America First” test that he promises is “woke-proofing the classroom” and that he wants to require blue-state educators to take before they can teach here. 
It turns out you can get every answer wrong and still receive a “Certificate of Completion” certifying that you have “successfully completed the Teacher Qualification Test.” I know because I purposely set out to get every question wrong by picking the stupidest answers in the 34-question multiple choice exam developed in conjunction with PragerU, a self-described conservative nonprofit, that includes a mix of random history, culture and gender-related biology questions.
The test, which is available to anyone to take, requires you to keep guessing until you pick the correct answer. As a result, there’s no true measure of if someone is too “woke” to teach in our schools or even if they actually understand our nation’s history.
I had been looking forward to pitting myself against the test to get a better grasp about how Walters and PragerU actually define “woke.” Walters, after all, is encouraging schools to use PragerU’s videos as instructional materials in our schools.
So I was disappointed, though perhaps not entirely surprised, to discover after weeks of promises, this test amounts to the latest harebrained antic dreamed up by a headline-thirsty public official. 
The effort does little more than fearmonger against imaginary boogeyteachers who Walters seems to think want to consume Oklahoma children’s little souls with “liberal” lessons.
But this stunt is the biggest embarrassment yet for our Republican state superintendent, and that’s saying a lot given that he has proven time and again to be all show and little substance. He’s already created the do-nothing Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism and once tried to require a video of himself attacking the “radical left” be shown to children. 
I fear this latest effort will do little to help our state attract the quality teachers we desperately need and to bolster faith in the lessons being taught in our classrooms. We’re in the throes of a massive teacher shortage and have seen record numbers of emergency certified educators entering our classrooms. We’re behind the regional average in educator pay, and though Walters has implemented successful signing bonus programs aimed at helping recruit talented teachers, it hasn’t been enough to turn the tide.
Because it wasn’t the actual test questions themselves that were so insulting, though it is pretty bold to require an assessment that doesn’t actually do any assessing and to pass it off as a barometer to prove “your commitment to truth and integrity.”
What I found alarming was Walters’ seeming reckless disregard for protecting personal information. In order to take this dubious “assessment,” people are required to visit PragerU’s site and provide the California-based nonprofit with all sorts of personal information.
Why does PragerU need to know my mailing address, my phone number, my name, my email address and if I’m a parent or teacher in order to access this.
What’s next, a DNA sample?
And I also had to agree to give PragerU carte blanc permission to send me emails and “view, monitor and record” my activity on their site. And, they have wasted no time in spamming me with unwanted emails like a sandwich shop rewards program.
We’re supposed to be able to trust Walters to act in the best interest of our children, and I fail to see how shilling for PragerU does that.
What I also found outrageous was the bizarre, 16-minute video conversation that Walters recorded with PragerU’s CEO Marissa Streit that introduces the test. The CEO lets loose and says the people who are critical of her group “are the same people who don’t care about children,” and “people who have been able to hold schools and our children hostage to their political agenda.”
She also said their group and Walters have the “same enemies.”
Rather than pushing back on that “woke” indoctrination and insulting inflammatory rhetoric, Walters responds: “That’s exactly right.”
“We’re not going to continue to sit back and watch the teacher’s unions use schools to force a left-wing ideology on kids,” Walters also says in the video.
Talk about a political agenda.
Anyone who registers to complete the test receives a welcome email from PragerU containing this gem: “Alarmingly, many young Americans haven’t been exposed to clear, conservative perspectives. PragerU fills that void by offering fact-based content that simplifies complex issues and champions foundational values like freedom and personal responsibility.”
Not surprisingly “conservative” indoctrination is OK in Walters’ eyes.
As a parent, I don’t want any sort of indoctrination going on in my schools. 
And, to borrow one of Republicans’ favorite phrases, shouldn’t I have parental choice in terms of what my children are learning? Why would I want some random California nonprofit determining what’s right for my children or spouting hate about me – their mother – being an “enemy” simply because I’m a critic of PragerU’s efforts to oversimply our history and make fun of historically marginalized people? 
As a particularly revolting example, PragerU has a cartoon on their site that features two time traveling children who go back to 1493 to speak with Christopher Columbus. They’re on a mission to determine whether the U.S. should honor him with a holiday or if that day should honor the Indigenous people of the Americas who lived here when he arrived. When asked about slavery, Columbus justifies it by saying it’s as old as time, and that “being taken as a slave is better than being killed.”
Wow.
Does saying slavery is wrong make someone “woke”? I’m not sure. But teaching children that it’s a better option than death is callous. And immoral.
Walters said he’s fine with allowing his children to learn from PragerU videos, and that’s a choice he gets to make. He’s in a position of power, even if he’s using it irresponsibly. 
But if Walters truly embodies parental empowerment like he claims, he should not be associating in an official capacity with a group that is trying to assert their political beliefs in our schools.
Walters should be pushing back against all out-of-state actors, even conservative ones, who are trying to impose their views on our children. And he shouldn’t be allowing random groups to create “tests.” 
Let’s leave that to the education experts.

On paper, the Equality State appears to have good annual growth, but pockets of extreme wealth skew the numbers, writes columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming’s economic issues are more urgent than we realize appeared first on WyoFile .","For years, Wyoming’s economic picture has been precarious, with major fluctuations in employment and productivity. However, we have reassured ourselves with the conventional wisdom that our “boom and bust” economy will soon have better days. Numbers have generally supported this view. Despite the obvious ups and downs, average incomes continued to rise and, at least based on statewide statistics, we had not yet reached a tipping point. Unfortunately, that perspective may be more flawed than we realize.

Opinion

When we evaluate Wyoming’s economy, we often lose sight of its most important component: its people. Wyoming is made up of people, not numbers on a profit-loss statement. High GDP is great, but if that productivity does not increase the well-being of the people doing the work, it is hollow. When we evaluate our economy’s performance, in addition to factors like average productivity and profitability, we should also look at numbers like personal incomes. Are Wyoming’s citizens keeping up with the rest of the nation? Based on the numbers in recent years, it appears we are not. 
I recently had a conversation with a friend involved in statistical analysis, specifically in the economic and business sectors. He pointed out that while Wyoming’s per capita income statistics appeared to show healthy growth, they were greatly skewed. The inclusion of Teton County and its many high-income residents in Wyoming’s statewide calculations paints a far rosier picture than truly exists. 
It is no surprise that Teton County outpaces the rest of Wyoming when it comes to personal incomes. Teton County is famously among the wealthiest counties in the country, and we all have heard the quips about Jackson’s wealth and the billionaires forcing out the millionaires. What is surprising is how Teton County has sharply differed from the rest of Wyoming in the years since the COVID pandemic. Looking at the 10 most recent years of data included in federal labor statistics, you can get a sense of how things have changed. In the early to mid-2010s, Teton County tended to do better than the rest of Wyoming when it came to income growth, with growth corresponding with the rest of the state. When the rest of the state’s income growth rate changed, Teton County’s tended to as well, and in the same direction. 
In 2019, however, we saw the beginning of a sharp divergence. Whereas the rest of Wyoming’s personal income was stagnant and slightly declining, Teton County began to see massive personal income growth. For example, using 2014 as a baseline, Wyoming outside of Teton County saw its average personal income decline by 4.7% by 2019. In contrast, Teton County saw its average personal income grow by 22.7%. Over the next several years, the rest of Wyoming’s income largely stagnated. It was not until 2023 that average personal incomes caught up with 2014 numbers, and even then, they were only 1.9% higher. Teton County, on the other hand, saw its average personal income skyrocket. Comparing 2014 to 2023, Teton County’s average income nearly doubled, increasing by 94.3%.
Due to Wyoming’s small population, this has major impacts on statewide statistics. When looking at statewide numbers, it appears that Wyoming had fairly healthy annual growth, with a 14.4% increase in incomes between 2014 and 2023. What really happened, however, was that Teton County saw incomes shoot up, while the rest of the state stalled. 
What does this mean? It means that our state policymakers must understand that things may be worse than they appear on paper. Questions about how we encourage quality, high-paying jobs and economic opportunities are likely more urgent than we think. If Wyoming fails to provide the sort of opportunity that can be found elsewhere, people will leave. It is as simple as that.
Unfortunately, we have already become used to this trend. Wyoming ranks last in retaining its young people, with the highest out-migration rate in the country. Census numbers also show that, despite a statewide population increase of around 3.3% between 2010 and 2020, almost every age demographic saw population losses in Wyoming, except the 65+ demographic, which saw an increase of over 48%. This is troubling, as it shows we are losing our productive-aged population. There is little doubt that the lack of economic opportunities plays a real role.
Our policymakers need to take this issue seriously. This goes beyond hoping that our legacy industries will continue to prop us up. They are an important part of our economy and need to be supported, but they cannot be the only part of our economy. Too often, we let discontent with change stifle progress. Either our economy will change, or we will continue to export our opportunity and our young people to the benefit of other states. I want my children to have the chance to get good paying, quality jobs here in Wyoming. If we do not take this issue seriously, they may not have the chance.

(Photo courtesy of Cindy Green's campaign)Virginia’s Democrats have touted the fact that they are running candidates in all 100 House of Delegates seats, but the party isn’t always putting its money where its mouth is, some candidates say. 
The Democratic National Committee, typically focused on D.C. politics, has expanded its efforts to boost parties at the state level. Chair Ken Martin announced earlier this year that the DNC would disburse $17,500 per month to Virginia’s state Democratic Party. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee recently pumped another $1.5 million into Virginia’s races, as part of a seven figure investment. 
“The role of political parties is to build infrastructure everywhere,” Martin said earlier this year.
But not every candidate running for Virginia’s House of Delegates this year has directly benefited so far.
A special fundraising page on Act Blue, a Democratic fundraising site, dubs the 27 Democratic candidates for House seats in Republican-leaning areas the “Virginia Value Pack” who are “punching well above their weight.” 
The Act Blue page’s goal is $70,000 that can be split between the candidates, for which about $60,000 has already been raised from individuals chipping in. 
Cindy Green, who is challenging Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, in House District 44, said it’s heartening to see support from voters.
She and the other 26 candidates also wrote a joint letter to incumbent Democratic delegates and senators asking for support. Some answered the call, like Sens. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, and Dels. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, and David Reid, D-Fairfax, Green said. 
First-time candidate Stacey Carroll, a military veteran and CPA in Northern Virginia, also donated $500, Green said. 
“She’s running just like the rest of us are,” Green said. “So that was very impressive.”
The shared resource from Carroll comes from a sizable coffer for a newcomer. Carroll is taking on Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, in Republican-leaning House District 64, which is eyed as one that Democrats could flip. DLCC, for instance, included Carroll in their latest round of candidate spotlights. 
Green said it’s “ironic” that Democratic leadership in Virginia touts having 100 candidates this year, while not financially backing all of them. 
She said she understands most resources should be directed at those in competitive or potentially flippable seats, but says a little bit would go a long way for candidates like herself. 
“A campaign like mine, it doesn’t take a lot of money to provide support,” Green said.
Her money goes toward brochures to hand out when door-knocking, yard signs, radio ads, and billboards. With a small campaign of volunteers who have full-time jobs like herself, she doesn’t have to worry about paying staff or consultants or large advertisement blitzes. 
“We’re scrappy,” Green said. “We know how to get stuff done.”
Green said that she and the 26 other Democrats running in Republican strongholds are doing it for a few reasons: to give voters choices, help build future party benches in the areas, and to support up-ballot votes for Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi and Jay Jones as governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.
For Green, in particular, it’s also about making her opponent spend money in his district. 
“I’m trying to keep O’Quinn’s money in his district,” she said. “He’s a piggy bank for his party. That will continue as long as no one is challenging him.”
First elected in 2011, O’Quinn has yet to have a Democratic opponent and has only been challenged twice by a Republican who first ran as an independent.
He has since risen through the ranks in Republican leadership to the role of Deputy House Leader in the GOP caucus. Not having to run a serious campaign against challengers means his coffers have continued to grow. O’Quinn has donated nearly a million dollars in political contributions to other Republican candidates.
To ward off Green, he may not need to spend much money locally in places like Washington County and Bristol, but as she ramps up her ground game, he might feel compelled to. 
Though DPVA and the House Democratic Caucus have not directly supported the candidates in donations, caucus spokeswoman Amber Gantt said that Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, and DPVA Chair Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, have given money to Rural Ground Game, an organization supporting rural candidates.
Locally-rooted organizers are otherwise taking matters into their own hands. 
Rebecca Daly, chair of 9th Congressional District Democratic Committee, said she has done what she can to boost rural Democrats in deep Southwest Virginia. That included hosting candidate training for 13 of the 27 “Value Pack” Democrats within the district. 
She said that behind the scenes she has been “preaching” to the state party officials for years about investment in that side of the state. 
She doesn’t feel they’re always getting it, evidenced by receiving just 700 yard signs for Spanberger, Hashmi and Jones recently. With the 9th District being “about the size of the state of New Jersey” Daly said she has to sort out how to divide them up between over 20 local committees and a handful of Young Democrat committees. 
“The position has always been to take care of the crescent,” Daley said of Democratic strongholds in Northern and Central Virginia into Hampton Roads. 
Though the caucus and state party have invested predominantly in Virginia’s Democratic bases, candidates who proved themselves in the past with narrow losses are getting more investment this time. One of those is Lily Franklin in House District 41. Having narrowly lost to Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, in 2023, she now has nearly double his donations — over $350,00 of which comes from the caucus and DPVA. That’s a campaign war chest of about $540,000 to his roughly $248,000.
Green and Daly know most Democrats in rural or certain suburban areas aren’t likely to perform as well as Franklin has, but they imagine a day that could be different. 
“If we don’t build, we’re never going to win in other areas,” Daley said.

Shannon Building (Building One) on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda. (Photo by Lydia Polimeni/National Institutes of Health)A University of Maryland program that encourages undergraduate minority students to research communication sciences and disorders was making strides to help people learn and communicate better — until its grant, like 78 others in Maryland, was cut in May.
UMD-REACH —Research, Equity, and Access in Communication and Hearing — was one of the lucky 47 projects in the state that have seen their National Institutes of Health grant reinstated since the initial May cut by the Trump administration. But program officials said the delay came with a cost.
“We’re happy about the reinstatement, but at the same time, it’s taken a lot of time and work for a bunch of people who would rather be helping people learn things and helping people be healthier,” Matthew Goupell, a co-director of the UMD-REACH program, said.
While UMD-REACH is once again receiving funds from NIH following the July reinstatement, its research and student training has slowed down. The organization is among dozens in Maryland that have seen funding abruptly turned off and then reinstated, disrupting research and programs.
“We had to all spend a lot of time dealing with the uncertainty, and that just takes away from the ability to progress the science,” said Goupell. “It’s about a limitation on our time and our productivity for these slowdowns.”
UMD-REACH was told its grant was being terminated because NIH policy does not prioritize research programs as part of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, efforts, according to an email Goupell received from NIH.
U.S. Supreme Court gives go-ahead for Trump to cancel $783M in NIH research grants

This spring, President Donald Trump (R) and his administration terminated hundreds of science and research grants supported by the NIH, in an effort to drastically slash government spending and reduce federal support for initiatives that focus on DEI, LGBTQ+ issues and other underserved populations.
But in the following months, the administration has reversed its decisions on some grant terminations, while court rulings forced it to reinstate other grants, making the landscape of tracking whether the money is flowing to those research programs difficult.
“Funding terminations and delays are a significant obstacle for researchers at Johns Hopkins and other universities,” Johns Hopkins University said in a written statement. “The university will continue strongly advocating for our research mission, the benefits it provides to our community here in Baltimore, and the value of lifesaving discoveries for people all across the country.”
Grant Witness is an attempt to follow the changing landscape on NIH grants, by collecting firsthand testimony from researchers who no longer have access to funding and referencing official announcements from the Trump administration.
For Maryland, Grant Witness reports that a total of 79 grant programs were terminated throughout the year, affecting $67.5 million in funds.
The database says that 32 of those grants were still terminated as of September, freezing $16.5 million in research grants. The other 47 of those terminated programs may have been reinstated due to court proceedings or administration decision reversals – potentially freeing up about $51 million.
But some programs still face challenges even if NIH funding for those programs have been reinstated, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“Some of these studies were in progress and had to come to a screeching halt,” he said, noting that some studies needed consistent updates that couldn’t be completed while funding was frozen. “Those experiments are ruined at that point.”
The American Public Health Association is currently in a legal battle challenging the grant terminations saying that the terminations were discriminatory in nature. Some of the suspended research grants were reinstated following APHA’s legal challenge to the NIH.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But even then, Benjamin said, the Trump administration has been slow-walking the grant funds for some of the programs that should be receiving funding again.
“Innovation is being stifled,” he said. “The administration is slow-walking a lot of them out the door.”
Johns Hopkins agrees, saying that “many federal agencies have significantly slowed the release of new research awards and the renewal of existing awards, leading to a sharp drop in federal research investment at Hopkins and other universities.”
“From late January through late May of this year, new research funding awards were down by nearly two-thirds as compared to the same period in 2024,” said the statement from Hopkins, one of the biggest losers of grant funding.
Benjamin said that the administration’s targeting of DEI research was “fundamentally being racist and discriminatory.”
“These programs are designed to address health inequity,” Georges said, noting that cutting those grants undermines programs looking to improve health for underserved communities and women.
Court challenges continue.
In August, the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a temporary injunction for the termination of hundreds of NIH grant programs related to LGBTQ+ issues, agreeing with the plaintiffs would succeed in their claims that the terminations were discriminatory in nature.
Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior legal counsel and health care strategist for Lambda Legal, said that he hopes that the NIH complies with the injunction and chooses not to appeal the decision, though there is still time for the agency to file an appeal.
“It guarantees that, at minimum, LGBTQI health-related research won’t be completely stalled under this administration for the time being,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nihbuilding-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-09-15 06:57:03.965662

(Photo by T. Chavis/National Park Service)With access to beginner-friendly hikes with epic views as well as technical, multi-day and backcountry objectives for experts, the Taggart Lake trailhead in Grand Teton National Park is the busiest year-round trailhead in the park.
So busy, according to park officials, that on peak days more than 1,000 people flock to the site, and annual visitations tally more than 160,000.
“Use at Taggart Lake has increased more than 100% in the last 10 years,” Superintendent Chip Jenkins said. That compares to a 20% growth in overall park visitation, showing just how appealing it is.

Facilities are no longer adequate to serve the 700 or so average daily visitors, and park officials have sketched out a plan to expand the parking lot, reconfigure trails, install new toilets and improve other aspects of the trailhead area to accommodate mushrooming use.
Grand Teton National Park is seeking comment on an environmental assessment of the project. The 35-day comment period closes on Sept. 23.
During a Wednesday presentation on the environmental assessment, Jenkins said the so-called preferred alternative would create a more accessible and capacious site that would help protect the resources. Park data documented numerous instances of fecal matter and toilet paper near Taggart Lake in 2022, according to the assessment.
“We think that this preferred alternative will help us make for a better Taggart experience and for a better Grand Teton experience,” Jenkins said.
The project is estimated to cost $14.6 million to construct, with the Grand Teton National Park Foundation providing more than $10 million of that. Much of the remaining expense will be funded through appropriated federal dollars, primarily through the National Park Service Centennial Challenge, Jenkins said. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2026.
The project underscores how Grand Teton and neighboring Yellowstone National Park are wrestling with growing visitors who are filling parking lots, crowding trails and putting a strain on park services like bathrooms and search and rescue.
 Trailhead is Grand Teton National Park hotspot 

As a launching-off point for popular hikes near the park’s southern entrance, the trailhead is one of the most common places for people to start their visit to Grand Teton, Jenkins said. It’s also a well-used parking spot for skiers setting out on winter adventures.
Site maintenance has not kept pace with usage growth. Park officials have been gathering public comment on the Taggart Lake experience for the last year to guide improvements to the site. Proposals are mapped out in the environmental assessment. Under the preferred alternative, the project would:

Expand the parking lot.
Install new permanent toilets and a water station.
Redesign the trailhead area and create more accessible pathways.
Make improvements to the Taggart Lake shoreline to better define access points.
Improve facilities at the nearby Cottonwood Creek Picnic area.

Objectives of the plan include better safety for bicyclists and better protection for nearby wildlife, according to the assessment.
This map from a Taggart Lake project presentation shows that several construction projects are anticipated in Grand Teton National Park in coming years. (Map courtesy of the National Park Service)
The environmental assessment also contains a “no action” alternative, under which Grand Teton would continue to maintain the project area as is.
If the preferred action option takes place, the Taggart Lake trailhead upgrades would be among several construction projects scheduled for the park through 2028.
 Taggart Lake trailhead use an example of broader visitation challenges

The busy Taggart Lake trailhead underscores the broader challenges growing visitation presents to national park managers.
Grand Teton and Yellowstone both reported record visitation in 2021. Visitations dipped since then, but the overall trend is still climbing.
Right now, Grand Teton is on track to tally its second-highest year for visitation, Jenkins said. Yellowstone, meanwhile, has tallied 3.5 million recreation visits through August, up slightly from 2024 but still behind pace to top 2021.
“Our infrastructure is not always adequate for current visitation numbers, let alone for increasing future levels,” Jenkins said during a congressional field hearing held in the park last week.



Though both parks have implemented measures like camping reservations, vehicle limits at crowded lots and a pilot shuttle system, they have yet to adopt more drastic tools like timed-entry systems that Arches and Rocky Mountain National Parks have adopted to manage huge crowds.
Public lands advocates are keeping a close eye on national parks this year in the wake of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency efforts. Since the Trump administration took office, the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff, according to the National Parks Conservation Association.
It appears Wyoming’s parks avoided the brunt of those cuts. Yellowstone National Park’s 2025 staffing is higher than last year, a park spokeswoman told WyoFile.

(Photo: Meharry Medical College via Facebook)NASHVILLE — The Trump administration has eliminated $2 million in HIV research facility funding for Meharry Medical College after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the National Institutes of Health to cancel hundreds of millions of dollars in DEI-linked funding for biomedical research.
Meharry, one of the nation’s oldest and largest historically Black medical schools, intended to use the funding for a “cutting-edge and modern HIV research space.”
For decades, Meharry scientists have investigated why minority populations are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS, working in tandem with Vanderbilt University and other organizations. Meharry was seeking to expand its capacity to conduct clinical trials and produce groundbreaking research.
The grant was terminated in March with no explanation or path of recourse.
“We are very disappointed, because we are working hard and we had a vision for this lab, and now that will not materialize anymore, at least for the time being,” Vladimir Berthaud, the grant’s principal investigator, said. Berthaud has worked at Meharry for nearly 25 years and was instrumental in founding the Meharry Center for HIV/AIDS Health Disparities Research in 2005.
At the same time, Berthaud said he is thankful that the NIH reinstated funding that was initially frozen for a long-standing grant that supports  investigators from Meharry and partner institutions who are studying the inner-workings of the virus to inform efforts to develop a cure and vaccine for HIV, an area of research with limited funding.
The cuts to Meharry are among $783 million in NIH funding eliminated by the federal government for a broad spectrum of disease research — including cancer, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease —  that had diversity, equity and inclusion components. The Trump administration decision to eliminate the programs was upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in August. 
The NIH cuts are among a “catastrophic” series of federal HIV/AIDS program eliminations this year, disrupting the ongoing work of preventing, testing, treating and developing a vaccine for the disease in the U.S. and worldwide, said John Meade, a senior program manager for AVAC, a nonprofit that focuses on HIV/AIDS prevention.
See what research at Tennessee universities was defunded in Trump’s federal grant cuts

Thus far this year, the government has eliminated 191 HIV-specific grants worth $200 million, and brought 56% of active HIV clinical trials to a halt, Meade said. 
It has terminated U.S.-backed international HIV research and slashed the NIH workforce tasked with HIV/AIDS work. In May, the NIH announced it would eliminate the annual $67 million budget for the Consortia for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development, which has worked to develop a vaccine for the disease.
“This will leave a hole in infectious disease research for the long term,” said Meade, who noted HIV/AIDS funding is especially vulnerable to anti-DEI initiatives because the disease disproportionately impacts people of color and LGBTQ individuals. 
“I believe there was a very targeted attack when it came to HIV specifically, primarily because the populations it primarily impacts,” he said.
Local advocates said the federal research cuts will have a direct impact on people living with HIV/AIDS or those at risk for contracting it.
“The sum total of federal cuts to research, prevention and suppression send the intended message: the government doesn’t care about eliminating HIV,” said Molly Quinn, executive director for OUTMemphis, an LGBTQ advocacy organization that offers support and services to people living with HIV/AIDS.
“As a service provider for HIV patients, these cuts make it harder for us to do our work, more likely for people to remain untested, and harder for patients to get the health care they need,” she said.  “Service providers across the South have to stand together and redouble our efforts, because we’re all interconnected. HIV can be eliminated, but our silence won’t save us.”
 HIV/AIDS research in jeopardy 

Meharry and Vanderbilt established a teaching, research and patient care alliance in 1999. Both schools have received NIH funding for AIDS-related research for years.
In 2003, NIH granted the schools $2.25 million over three years to establish a new Center for AIDS Research operated by the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. At the time, the center was the first to include a historically Black university like Meharry.










We envisioned a lot of opportunities, so those opportunities are gone for research and training for what they call the next generation of HIV researchers.


– Don't forget to add author


NIH funding supported the creation of the Meharry Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research in 2005. A decade later, a five-year NIH grant allowed Meharry and Vanderbilt to expand their AIDS research center to include the Tennessee Department of Health, establishing the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research (CFAR.) 
By 2020, the center grew into a partnership between Vanderbilt, Meharry, the state health department and Nashville CARES, an HIV/AIDS service nonprofit providing education, confidential testing and support services to more than 20,000 Tennesseans.
NIH granted an additional $7.5 million meant to span five years “to enable the CFAR to continue its efforts to reduce the burden of HIV by supporting a wide range of scientific research, training and mentoring, and community engagement in Tennessee and beyond,” according to a May 2020 news release.
The funding was, in part, a result of the Biden administration’s effort to implement diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives now being gutted by the Trump administration. 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center grant cuts may include faculty, research diversity initiatives

In response to former President Joe Biden’s directive that each federal agency create a DEI plan, the NIH sought to redistribute research funding more broadly beyond elite colleges and universities to institutions that represent underserved communities. 
Historically black colleges and universities such as Meharry received infrastructure grants to expand their research capacity in order to compete for future grants, such as the $2 million grant to upgrade lab facilities at Meharry, Meade said. 
“There was a lot put into HBCUs to increase their infrastructure so they would be able to carry out and be more competitive” against institutions like Harvard and Stanford, who have historically received the lion’s share of biomedical research funding, he said.
 $2M training facility grant terminated; others reinstated

The $2 million award started on Sept. 16, 2022, but was terminated on March 21 before construction began. About $114,000 had already been spent on pre-construction activities when the remaining funds were rescinded, according to usaspending.gov, a government-run federal spending database.
Meharry worked closely with the NIH to ensure compliance with the highest standards in each step of the design process for the new center, which was 95% designed when the federal government terminated the funds needed to bring those plans into reality, Berthaud said.
The funding would have paid for a “cutting-edge and modern HIV research space” at the college, which has been researching “factors responsible for the profoundly disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS among minority populations” for the last two decades in partnership with Vanderbilt and other organizations. 
The new lab facility would have included space and equipment for up to six new investigators near the Meharry Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, according to a grant summary. The center’s current setup features four labs within the center and other HIV/AIDS investigators scattered among other university buildings.The lack of modern facility space “severely impedes” the college’s ability to attract new research faculty to the center, the grant summary states.
Because the grant was solely focused on construction of the lab, its termination did not impact any researchers’ employment. 
The loss of the grant doesn’t directly impact Meharry’s other work in HIV/AIDS research, but it does represent a setback in the college’s overall plans to attract other HIV researchers to come to Meharry for their work.
“We envisioned a lot of opportunities, so those opportunities are gone for research and training for what they call the next generation of HIV researchers,” Berthaud said. “And this was not just for Meharry. We’re supposed to train and offer opportunities for anyone around the country who would like to use this lab for training and research.”
A separate multi-million dollar award to continue work at the Research Centers in Minority Institutions Program in Health Disparities Research at Meharry Medical College was also terminated, but NIH reinstated funding around July. The grant is a renewal of a long-standing program that appears to stretch back to at least 2017, according to transaction history listed on usaspending.gov. 
Changes at NIH give political appointees greater power to fund or block research

 
The program is focused on eliminating health disparities, specifically in diseases with detrimental impacts on minority health, including HIV/AIDS, the award summary states. Mentoring early-career researchers and improving relationships with community organizations are among the program’s broader goals.
The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities obligated around $4 million to the program in late July, usaspending.gov records show.
Another grant funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration that supports international AIDS relief — the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — was also reinstated after a funding freeze. The international program was founded in 2003 and has since saved more than 25 million lives, Berthaud said. Meharry uses PEPFAR funding to reduce mother-to-baby HIV transmission rates in multiple African countries, and conducts exchange programs with universities in low- and middle-income countries, according to the college.
Berthaud said that while HIV treatment is now relatively simple, staying on treatment can be difficult for people, especially those living in less wealthy countries.
“We shouldn’t let our guards off regarding HIV,” he said. “Yes, we have made tremendous progress, and most of this progress, we owe it to the NIH. The major discoveries in HIV research have been funded by the NIH.”
Meharry’s partner institutions have not publicly addressed the NIH funding cuts or freezes. 
Nashville CARES declined to comment while Vanderbilt University Medical Center offered no response. 
The recent federal funding cuts introduce more uncertainty in the timetable for a cure, or a vaccine, while HIV in Tennessee continues to grow.
There are nearly 20,000 people living with HIV in Tennessee, according to the state’s health department. Memphis is among the top 50 cities for new HIV infections.
“The biggest thing is that it continues to slow down the process to study HIV and hopefully find a way to do vaccine trials that people have been waiting for,” said Ray Holloman, chair of the transgender task force at the Tennessee Equality Project.
“There’s been years and years of these grants coming through and the government saying, yes, we need to find a cure and, now, it’s not so much,” he said.

Fraser was also connected to a neurologist at Duke, kindling his interest in neuroscience. 
The Summer Scholars Program in Genomic Science and Medicine at Duke University that gave Fraser those opportunities lost what was left of a $540,000 National Institutes of Health grant this year, one of dozens of academic programs at private and public universities across the country to lose federal funding for efforts to help increase diversity in medicine and biological sciences. 
In addition to working in labs, participants in the Duke scholars program created poster presentations of the lab work and explained their research to audiences, familiar exercises for scientists attending professional conferences. 
Duke’s program focused on college students who had completed their first or second year, Fraser said, and offered him an opportunity that’s now been closed for others. 
“Freshmen and sophomores won’t be able to get their own foot in the door,” he said. 
About 5% of doctors in the United States are Black, according to 2023 data from the Association of American Medical Colleges, while about 14.4 % of the U.S. population identified as Black that year, according to the Pew Research Center. 
In 2024, 6.6% of the doctorates in STEM awarded to Americans or naturalized citizens were earned by Black researchers. 
While more than 19% of the population was Hispanic/Latino in 2023, about 6.5% of the medical doctors were Latino. Latino scientists earned 10% of the research doctoral degrees awarded that year in science, technology, engineering and math. 
As it targets diversity and equity, the Trump administration has ended funding for projects that encourage a diverse STEM workforce, research by early-career scientists, and research about health disparities, HIV, mental health, and nutrition.
Programs at Duke, Stanford University, Hampton University, Washington University, and others lost federal money for programs aimed at increasing diversity in genomic research, according to a list of canceled grants obtained by U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (D-Raleigh). 
U-RISE was among the formerly federally funded programs supporting undergraduates who aspired to earn advanced degrees in biomedical research. The acronym stands for Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement.
UNC-Pembroke, the state’s Historically American Indian University, was one of the UNC campuses that had its U-RISE grant canceled.
The program matched eight students with faculty researchers, according to an online description. Its goals were to increase the number of students that applied for and entered STEM doctoral programs, provide them with a “rigorous research experience,” and prepare them to be successful scientists. 
The program ended after one year. 
Diversity and equity are targets of state and national politicians. Last year, the UNC system banned DEI policies. 
Efforts to increase diversity in biomedical sciences provides students with mentors, lab experience and a chance to form friendships with other students who share their goals. 
Students also learn what makes for a compelling research question and how to present their research in an engaging way, said Julie Posselt, a professor of Education at the University of Southern California who has published books on graduate education and equity in science.
“The mere existence of opportunities changes people’s aspirations,” she said. 










The NIH says they are not banned words, but there’s literal PDFs of banned words.


– Annelise Mennicke, UNC Charlotte professor


“The  long term effects will also be felt by the average American in terms of the access to new health care techniques, access to new technologies, improvements to systems that affect all of us,” she said.
Grants aimed at increasing the presence of marginalized groups in STEM were the first to be targeted, said Ebony McGee, an expert on diversity in STEM education. The elimination of funds aimed at marginalized communities in STEM will be a factor in deciding who continues in research careers, said McGee, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University. 
She knows of graduate students who would have quit their programs if not for the coaching they received. 
“It gave them a way to continue to be motivated in those racialized spaces and places,” she said.  
Generation of science lost
The canceled funding has not only stifled on-going research, it has pulled up the ladder for up-and-coming scientists, faculty and students at North Carolina universities told NC Newsline.
“There’s going to be an entire decade or generation of science that is left behind because all of the DEI programs are cut, all of the — I mean, the NIH says there are not banned words, but there’s literal PDFs of banned words,” said Annelise Mennicke, a UNC Charlotte professor studying counseling for LGBTQ+ survivors of sexual violence.
The federal government stripped funding from Mennicke’s study, which aimed to assess how to improve counseling options for LGBTQ+ individuals. As a researcher who focuses on gender and sexuality, she feels the National Institutes of Health has essentially barred support for her field.
“If we’re not able to study LGBTQ+ health, then that entire group of people is left out of the conversation,” Mennicke said. “Their health will worsen, will be set back because we don’t understand basic mechanisms of their health, but also we’re not training scientists to do that kind of research.”
The NIH has slashed hundreds of millions in research grants to North Carolina institutions with a focus on projects that the administration deems related to gender and sexuality, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and vaccine research.
For students, that means an abrupt stop to research they were involved in and a loss of future opportunities to grow their scientific abilities.

“I know people whose salaries have either been, you know, cut in half just by losing the supplemental fellowship income or totally just losing their summer fellowship,” said Nyssa Tucker, president of the UNC graduate workers’ union. “People are having to totally pivot in their directions — so folks who have been pursuing that as their thesis, their doctoral work, are now faced with the quandary of saying, ‘Do I keep doing this?’”
Even where funding has been reinstated — Mennicke’s research money is once again flowing — graduate students may not return. “What can’t be reinstated is the negative impacts on the students,” Mennicke said. “This was undermining their belief in public health and in the value of the science that they were doing.”
Epidemiology and community health professor Jessamyn Moxie, Mennicke’s co-lead on the study, said two of the original student researchers on the project did not return. “Morale was just broken,” Mennicke said. 
Those who did come back largely asked to be kept out of the loop on the status of funding.
“It was just so stressful for them to have that uncertainty. I think, in this era especially, you know, in the best of days, students being involved with research is a somewhat stressful activity for them,” Moxie said. “A lot of our team is LGBTQ, so you put the larger climate of uncertainty about rights and their safety that they’re already navigating, and this is their employment — across UNC Charlotte, generally, a lot of our students work in order to survive.”
“The students really I think just wanted to dial this down in this one area that they could choose to dial down the uncertainty for themselves,” Moxie added.
The future of  the project is still uncertain. Mennicke said there had not been clear communication from the university on what the recent Supreme Court decision authorizing grant cancellations means for researchers at the school.
“Nobody really knows what the impacts of that Supreme Court case will be for individual researchers,” Mennicke said. “We’re still kind of waiting and seeing and acting as if we have — because we have the grant right now. So we’re just going to get on with the rigorously evaluated, peer-reviewed process that we went through to do the science that we believe in.”
Up in smoke
Students are also losing access to fellowship programs that helped them to connect with scientific peers and mentors, another avenue that has long fostered research careers. In April, the NIH canceled its MOSAIC program, aimed at helping postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds transition into faculty careers.

Mark Peifer, a cell biology professor at UNC Chapel Hill, said it was shameful that the government was canceling research awards to talented scientists “for reasons that have nothing to do with science.”
“It’s targeted at something really important, right, which is helping people make that really critical transition between post-doctoral fellow and faculty,” Peifer said. “People were worried that they wouldn’t be able to get a job and so many of our most talented scientists were choosing to move into the private sector.”
These programs serve a dual purpose: They help propel burgeoning young scientists while also bringing outside funding to research projects at universities that may not have otherwise been possible.
The administration’s actions, Peifer added, have had a chilling effect on private fellowships aimed at diversity as well. He pointed to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which canceled its $60 million inclusive excellence program as well as pausing the Hanna Gray Fellowship for early-career researchers. 
“What we’re learning is that this cohort building experience is really, really powerful at accelerating people’s development as scientific leaders, you know, because you’ve got people to talk to,” he said. “This is a phenomenal program.”










We’re going to definitely see a drop in the number of people who can do research of any type here in Chapel Hill, but I mean, across the nation.


– Nyssa Tucker, president, UNC graduate workers union


Moxie, the epidemiology and community health professor, expressed concern that the loss of opportunities would prevent young researchers from finding their lifelong passions. She said one of her formative research experiences was an ethnographic study on people living with HIV in Vietnam, which helped lead her into a career aimed at sexual health. 
“Researchers feel like it is gatekept for many students. They don’t know how to break into something that feels bigger than them,” Moxie said. “I think that when that is the case, then when the opportunities are limited, many students, if they enter in one particular area, that may not be the thing that ignites them.”
Tucker, the student worker union president — herself a toxicology and environmental health researcher — said it feels like “these careers are just up in smoke.”
“It’s not only people’s careers, it’s their livelihood, but also the work is done to benefit everyone,” Tucker said. “We’re going to definitely see a drop in the number of people who can do research of any type here in Chapel Hill, but I mean, across the nation.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Duke-Poster-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-09-15 06:57:03.965662

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Army Sgt. Chase Murray)North Dakota National Guard troops have not been requested for local or federal law enforcement operations, according to the governor’s office.
State Guard officials have not had any specific discussions about deploying soldiers and airmen domestically, said Adjutant General Mitchell Johnson.
About 1,000 North Dakota National Guard members trained last weekend in their specialties, Johnson told the North Dakota Monitor, but there have not been any discussions about deploying them imminently to assist with crime reduction or immigration enforcement operations.
“I would say we are always training to be ready for whatever we might be called for,” Johnson said. 
Johnson, also director of the Department of Emergency Services and an Air Force brigadier general, said Friday the National Guard can be activated either federally or by the state to support firefighters and local law enforcement.
What deployments look like are “situation dependent,” Johnson said, and responsive to each scenario as it comes in.

“Bottom line is, if resources are exceeded, and local resources are exceeded, for instance firefighting resources are not enough, then there’s a good chance that the National Guard is an answer, maybe not the answer, but an answer to that acute problem,” Johnson said.
He said he has not participated in any preliminary discussions about deploying National Guard members or resources to assist with local or federal law enforcement operations domestically.
Johnson said the 54 adjutant generals from all 50 states, three U.S. territories and Washington, D.C., hold regular calls on administrative concerns involving Guard members, but those typically revolve around funding, not specific deployments.
More than a dozen states have approved recent National Guard deployments to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles with some ordered to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to Stateline.
On Friday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee confirmed to the Tennessee Lookout that he’s been in “constant communication” with President Donald Trump’s administration about deploying the state’s National Guard members to Memphis as part of an effort to crack down on crime.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong was unavailable for an interview last week. Spokesperson Mike Nowatzki declined to answer questions about what circumstances could prompt the governor to authorize a National Guard deployment.
“We don’t speculate on potential North Dakota National Guard deployments,” Nowatzki said in a statement.
He added using National Guard soldiers and resources is a decision that is “not taken lightly” since every deployment pulls soldiers and airmen away from their families and employers.
“We all realize how important it is to support the citizens of North Dakota and also what it means to take Guardsmen away from their day jobs to do that, so it’s always a balance,” Johnson said.
Johnson said the state’s National Guard can perform crowd control and other types of law enforcement operations, but most of the time the Guard’s military police or security forces perform those types of actions.
North Dakota National Guard to assist search effort after flash flooding in central Texas

North Dakota National Guard members have supported law enforcement operations in the past, including during the 2016 and 2017 Dakota Access Pipeline protests, though they did not make arrests.
North Dakota Guard troops have also been deployed multiple times to the southern border.
“Every situation is unique, with multiple variables to consider in determining whether Guard mobilization is appropriate and, if so, under which status,” Nowatzki said.
State national guards can be activated by the governor and paid for by the state. They can also be deployed and paid for by the federal government under Title 10. A third option is a deployment controlled by the state, but funded and regulated by the federal government.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requested Guard assistance from Armstrong in July through a state-to-state emergency compact in the aftermath of flash flooding that killed more than 135 people. Johnson said North Dakota’s Fargo-based 119th Wing of the North Dakota Air National Guard flew drone operations from Fargo for seven days in Texas in response to Abbott’s request, which cost the state about $22,000. State deployments were also authorized in the past to combat wildfires or help with natural disaster recovery.

(Photo by Lexi Browning/West Virginia Watch)Funding for 17 research projects at West Virginia University has been cancelled or suspended, including federal research dollars axed by President Donald Trump. The Republican president cancelled billions of dollars in research money for universities as he pushes for a more conservative ideology in higher education. 
Shauna Johnson, WVU’s executive director of strategic communications, said the cancelled research projects had been supported by a mix of state, foundation and federal grants.
“WVU is an R1 university where quality education and the cutting edge go hand-in-hand. Budget reductions in research and student aid will have an impact on the university’s education and research missions,” Johnson said. 
The funding cancellation or suspension included some multi-institution projects on which WVU was a partner.
Federal funding agencies that were supposed to fund projects included the U.S. Department of Education, National Endowment for the Humanities and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Documents shared by the university showed that the EPA had canceled more than $945,000 in funding for WVU’s Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design.
“WVU has worked with our congressional delegation, and with our higher education partners overall, in efforts to preserve research funding,” Johnson said. 
“It’s important to note that federal funding investments in research have implications far beyond the present day. The research we are doing now will benefit future generations and we are hopeful the support will be continued,” she continued. 
Trump’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion policies directives has also impacted higher education funding. Johnson explained that the anti-DEI directives had impacted some research funding at WVU, but it was not the main reason for cancelled or stalled projects.
The president cancelled $783 million in National Institutes of Health research funding for any projects tied to federal DEI efforts. The U.S. The Supreme Court last month upheld Trump’s directive, which is expected to slash hundreds of research projects nationwide.
“To my knowledge, there has been no loss of funding linked to DEI initiatives at Marshall.  Additionally, the impact of new federal guidelines on research grants has been minimal at Marshall University,” said Leah Payne, director of university communications at Marshall.
Hans Fogle, executive director of university communications at Shepherd University, said “None of our federal grants have been cancelled due to any assertion of a DEI issue.”

Severe weather reduced crop yield, inflation made production more costly and trade negotiations with China, Tennessee's largest soybean customer, mean prices are too low to profit. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)As Tennessee soybean farmers harvest their crop after a difficult growing season, they are facing a farm economy that resembles “death by a thousand cuts,” Tennessee Soybean Promotion Council Executive Director Stefan Maupin said.
Persistent inflation since the pandemic has made it more expensive for farmers to produce crops, and weather extremes over the last year mean they will see a significant loss in yield, he said. 
On top of that, bushels will soon hit a market where prices are low and Tennessee’s largest soybean export partner, China, is entirely absent amid trade negotiations with the Trump Administration. 
“We’re in a significant and desperate situation where … none of the crops that farmers grow right now return a profit,” Maupin said. “They don’t even break even.”
Another year in the red will be tough to survive for farmers still struggling to recover from last year’s losses, he added.
Soybeans are Tennessee’s most prominent row crop, logging more than $990 million in cash receipts in 2023. Tennessee farmers planted around 1.75 million acres of soybeans in 2025, mostly in West and Middle Tennessee.










We’re in a significant and desperate situation where … none of the crops that farmers grow right now return a profit. They don’t even break even.


– Stefan Maupin, Tennessee Soybean Promotion Council


Soybeans also topped the state’s commodity exports in 2023, bringing in $489.4 million, followed by cotton at $302.7 million. Soybean meal came in fourth with $129.6 million in export earnings, according to United States Department of Agriculture data.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January and began imposing tariffs on imported goods — including Chinese imports — China has answered with its own tariffs on U.S. goods. China began boycotting the purchase of U.S. soybeans in May, according to the New York Times, turning instead to crops from Brazil and other South American countries.
American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland urged Trump in an August 19 letter to reach a deal with China to remove retaliatory tariffs and secure soybean purchase commitments. 
“U.S. soybean farmers cannot survive a prolonged trade dispute with our largest customer,” Ragland wrote.
The American Soybean Association points to losses farmers experienced during trade tensions between China and the U.S. in 2018. Soybean farmers in the United States lost $9.4 billion that year, according to a USDA estimate.

A University of Tennessee Agriculture Extension study estimates that Tennessee experienced a total economic loss of nearly $40 million due to uncertainty caused by soybean tariffs in 2018, even when considering government payments made to soybean farmers in an effort to offset their loss of income.
Maupin said that Tennessee soybean producers are exporting to other countries, but demand outside of China — where the market is expanding — is not as high.
University of Tennessee estimates soybean losses at $110 million for 2025
Maupin said farmers’ financial strain is evident in the math.
The USDA predicts an average yield of 53.5 bushels per acre for soybeans this year. Maupin said this is likely too high an estimate for Tennessee, where spring storms brought widespread flooding in West Tennessee fields that delayed planting, and the dry weeks that followed starved plants of moisture. Tennessee averaged 47.4 bushels per acre from 2014 to 2024. This year, Maupin has heard some farmers say they’re looking at closer to 30 bushels an acre due to the dry conditions, he said.
Based on an average yield of 50 bushels per acre, farmers are projected to lose about $84 per acre on soybeans as of Aug. 12, according to estimates from the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. If a farmer has 3,000 acres, that’s a roughly quarter-million dollar loss.
Estimates may change as costs fluctuate, but prices so far have hovered more than a dollar below UT’s estimated break-even price of $11.72 per bushel. The university’s Aug. 12 report estimates losses of nearly $110 million for Tennessee soybeans this year.
As difficult as conditions are for soybean farmers, Tennessee’s other major row crops — cotton, corn and wheat — are expected to see even higher losses per acre, according to the University of Tennessee. Farm level net losses for the state’s four primary row crops are expected to top $360 million in 2025.
Weather, inflation and tariffs squeeze farmers
Alan Meadows started working on his fifth-generation family farm in Lauderdale County when he graduated from high school about 25 years ago.
“This has been a really tough year for us,” he said.
Lauderdale County was among several West Tennessee counties to suffer flooding in April. Meadows planted his soybeans in late March.
“It started off really good … we were in the field in late March, which is early for us,” he said. “But then the wheels came off, so to speak, pretty quick.”
Before the plants could sprout, a four-day downpour dumped about 13 inches of water on the fields. Some of the crop was lost, and Meadows had to replant. If the crops continued to see some rainfall, that wouldn’t be an issue, he said, “but you know, as luck would have it, we turned out extremely dry this summer.”
Flood fallout poses challenges for West Tennessee soybean farmers

Supplies and equipment were more expensive this year, too, Meadows added, due to inflation and import tariffs.
“So much of what has happened and what’s going on here is totally out of our control,” he said. 
“We just want a free, fair and open market where we can sell our goods … as competitively as anybody else around the world,” Meadows said. “And we do feel that we produce a superior product here in the United States, and we just need to have the markets.”
Planning for 2026 and searching for relief
Even if a favorable trade deal is reached soon, Maupin said it will likely be too late for Tennessee’s soybean farmers to benefit.
“It will be very difficult to survive this year, and they’re harvesting crops now,” he said. 
Farmers pay most bills yearly, after revenue from selling their crops comes in. With projected losses, this means farms will not have money to pay electric bills, house and tractor payments, among other needs, Maupin said.
For those that have enough equity to hold out a little longer, he estimates the tide will need to turn before December, when farmers typically decide what to purchase and plant for the next growing season. 
Farmers, like other businesses, depend on financing to cover pre-sale costs. 
“Right now this year and looking like going into next year, the crop will not cash flow,” Maupin said, so farmers will likely have to put up something else — their farm, home, vehicles, or anything that holds equity — to secure the loan.
If next year’s harvest returns another loss instead of a profit, they risk losing that collateral. 
Those in the toughest position are younger farmers who “have just not had the opportunity to build up their equity in order to survive economic conditions like this,” Maupin said.
Soybean farmers are looking toward other possible uses that may help increase domestic sales. Maupin said biofuels hold potential, and the budget reconciliation bill passed in July included biofuel incentives that could provide a boost for that industry next year.
Farmers will continue to work with some states like California and Washington that are working to put fuel standards in place, but it’s not clear how widespread adoption will be across the country.
Ultimately, Maupin said, farmers will need help from the federal government.
Congress has not passed a new Farm Bill — multiyear legislation that authorizes funding for agricultural and food programs — since 2018. Instead, lawmakers have signed one-year extensions. The American Relief Act of 2025 extended the 2018 Farm Bill’s programs through Sept. 30. 
Maupin said without a fresh farm bill, “we do not have a workable safety net program when things like this happen in our economy.”
In the meantime, Maupin acknowledges the mental toll on farmers. 
“They have done everything right, they’ve managed their finances well, they have put in a good crop … but they cannot change the weather, they cannot change the economy, they cannot change the markets,” he said. “The weather is in the control of a higher power, and the economy and the markets are in control of Washington, D.C.”

Dormant prisons in Hudson and Walsenburg have been eyed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for expansion this year. (Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Two months after it became public that Walsenburg could soon host a detention center for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, there has been more speculation and debate over the issue than actual answers from the federal agency.
“I suspect we will be one of the last to hear anything. Most likely, the media will be presented with an announcement from (private prison company) CoreCivic as to the opening long before we will be,” Karl Sporleder, a Huerfano County Commissioner whose district includes the site, wrote in an email.
Walsenburg, a town of about 4,600 about 50 miles south of Pueblo, first landed in the conversation around expanded immigration detention capacity in July, when the American Civil Liberties Union and ACLU of Colorado posted a list of potential sites they obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. It included the Huerfano County Correctional Center along with a handful of other Colorado locations.

CoreCivic, which owns the 752-bed site, then listed job openings for detention officers in Walsenburg “contingent on contract award,” the Colorado Sun reported in July.
The facility also showed up on an internal ICE planning document from July obtained by The Washington Post, along with new detention sites in Hudson and Ignacio and an expansion of the existing Aurora facility.
The correctional center was operational until 2010 and housed inmates from Arizona as the Colorado Department of Corrections moved away from using private prisons. If it reopened under an ICE contract, it would be part of an ongoing effort to expand detention and deportation efforts under the Trump administration. Those plans are bolstered by $45 billion in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved over the summer.
City and county leaders say they have no control over whether CoreCivic enters into a contract with ICE.
“The city doesn’t have a say in this,” said Walsenburg Interim City Administrator John Galusha. “The prison is permitted and has every right to open, as far as we’re concerned.”
Galusha said a CoreCivic representative called him in early September to establish communication, but did not have any information about when or if the site could open.
“There’s been discussion about opening the Walsenburg facility and it’s been around all over, including ICE internal memos, but there’s no commitment one way or another yet,” he said.

At the same time, businesses that operate in southern Colorado are preparing for the possibility. In a Sept. 4 email obtained by Colorado Newsline, the aviation director of the Pueblo Memorial Airport sought to connect Freeman Jet Center, an aviation services company, with CoreCivic leadership.
“They manage multiple jet centers across the US and service the ICE deportation flights in other communities,” Greg Pedroza wrote to Walsenburg city administration. “I am hoping you may have a contact with the detention center in Walsenburg who can speak to Freeman Jet Center management to propose Pueblo Airport to provide service to these flights, if needed.”
Pedroza did not return a request for comment.
A city administrator forwarded his email to Andrea Evans, a senior director at CoreCivic, who responded that she would send the information to her team. Freeman Jet Center did not respond to a request for comment or information about where they currently service immigration flights.
In a statement, CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said that the company plays a “limited and important role” in the American immigration system and works within ICE’s established procurement process.
“We know this is a highly charged, emotional issue for many people, but the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively,” Gustin said. “These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
‘Not our dream situation’
The opening of the facility is a massive unknown, but many leaders would be supportive and welcoming of it, said Carlton Croft, the executive director of Huerfano County Economic Development. It would bring jobs, sales tax revenue and create a major utility customer.
“We need something to bring in younger families, and that’s jobs and economic growth,” he said. “This is not our dream situation, but we need the economic driver that something like this facility could bring.”
“It’s just hard in rural Colorado to attract the jobs, and if we don’t have jobs, these communities can slowly die and blow away,” Croft added.
Huerfano County has a median household income of about $52,000 and an employment rate of about 37%, according to recent census data. Colorado’s employment rate sits at about 65%.
Croft said he would love major manufacturers or data centers to set up in the county — he highlighted cosmetic manufacturer Chaé Organics as an example of Huerfano County success — but energy and infrastructure needs can be massive barriers. It also takes years and a large amount of capital investment to build those sites. The mothballed detention facility already exists, and has the right permits.

But others aren’t so sure about the sustainability of an ICE detention center as an economic driver in the county.
“It’s true there will be some significant revenues, but it will be short-term,” said Brian Lalander, who was the town’s mayor in 2020 and 2021 and now sits on the Historic Preservation Commission. “Let’s be realistic — these kinds of facilities are financed based on political ideology. This is not going to be the solution to Walsenburg’s economic problems.{
There is also the question of whether an operational detention center would draw its workforce from the county itself or attract commuters from Pueblo, Trinidad and other surrounding cities. Huerfano County has an aging population and a median age of 55 years old, and there’s not a lot of housing, especially rental properties.
“We’re very lucky that we have a nice hospital, but they’ve got most of the professional staff coming in from Colorado Springs and from Pueblo,” Croft said. “Very few actually live in our county, and we’ve got to figure out a way to make that possible.”
If the correctional facility opens up as an ICE detention center, it could need a few hundred employees, but those workers might not meaningfully contribute to Walsenburg’s economy if they live, shop and dine elsewhere.
“They’ll get an extra soft drink on their way home from Loves, but it won’t have this great effect,” Lalander said.
Still, Croft said he has picked up calls from hotels, restaurants and retail stores since the news of a possible ICE facility broke. Those would not be economic powerhouses, he said, but they would bring in a modest amount of jobs. Galusha said he remembered at least three more restaurants in town when the detention center was open.
A group of protestors have demonstrated in Walsenburg against the Trump administration every Friday since mid-February, and their attention is now largely focused on the detention center. Dee Maes-Sandoval is one of the few dozen who show up regularly. The Walsenburg native now lives in Colorado Springs and said she sees a level of apathy from Walsenburg residents on the issue.
“We’re kidnapping people because of the color of their skin,” she said, referencing immigration enforcement operations. “Read books about the Holocaust and what happened. We’re in the beginning stages, and people turned a blind eye because they didn’t want to get involved.”
Maes-Sandoval said she does not believe a detention center would be an economic boom to Walsenburg, since the workforce would likely come from outside the city. She sees hope in a lawsuit over a planned ICE facility at a CoreCivic property in Leavenworth, Kansas, where the city tried to block the prison’s reopening as an immigration detention center over permitting ordinances. A judge ruled in favor of the city and issued a temporary restraining order in June.
“The (city) ordinances presented a problem for that, and that’s what we’re hoping for in this case,” Maes-Sandoval said. “We’re hoping we can find something to stop it.”
That would require money and political willpower from the city or county. Maes-Sandoval acknowledges that CoreCivic is acting as if everything will move forward, and she won’t be surprised if it reopens. She drives to the facility when she can, and has noted the new barbed wire around the perimeter. If it does reopen, she said she will continue her activism.
“It’ll just mean that we will be out there more,” she said. “We will be out there, protesting at the site and seeing what we can do to help the people who will be detained there.”

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories in your inbox every week.
For years, North Dakota’s mineral owners have said state officials have ignored their pleas for help as companies deduct money from their share of income from oil and gas production. 
Now, some state lawmakers agree they need to take action. Responding to a recent North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica investigation, more than a half-dozen said a committee should study the issue and propose solutions before the next legislative session in 2027. Others suggested changes to state law, including one proposal to prohibit deductions unless a lease specifically allows them and another that would require companies and royalty owners to renegotiate their contracts every few decades. 

This is the fourth story in a series. Read the collection here.

The Legislature meets every other year. North Dakota lawmakers rejected proposals to protect private mineral owners in 2021 and 2023, and did not address the issue during this year’s session.
“It will definitely come up in 2027,” said Sen. Chuck Walen, a Republican from New Town. “I don’t know what the outcome will be, but it will definitely be coming up.”
North Dakota officials have taken steps to safeguard state-owned royalties. Since 1979, all state leases with oil and gas companies prohibit deductions. But that protection does not extend to leases that are negotiated by North Dakota’s estimated 300,000 private mineral owners.
“I definitely think something has to be done, especially since the state has protected itself,” said Rep. Patrick Hatlestad, a Republican from Williston. “I think it needs to do something similar for its citizens.”
Some lawmakers also have suggested they may need to make changes to the state’s postproduction royalty oversight program, created in 2023 to address minerals owners’ mounting frustration about postproduction deductions — the money companies withhold to cover the costs of processing and transporting minerals after they are extracted and before they are sold. That program has not alleviated concerns over postproduction deductions and, as of August, had not resolved any cases about that issue, the news organizations found.
Why it matters
Mineral owners have the rights to oil and gas found underground. They can lease those rights to companies in exchange for a cut of the revenue when oil is produced, called a royalty. 
But while the leases have remained the same for decades, the industry has changed. Oil and gas are now sold farther from the well, and companies incur more transportation and other costs to get the products to the point of sale. The companies pass on a portion of those costs to mineral owners, which North Dakota courts have determined is usually legal unless a lease says otherwise. 
Most leases signed decades ago don’t explicitly mention postproduction deductions, and leases don’t expire unless oil production lapses. 
North Dakota mineral owners say oil companies unfairly keep millions from checks without oversight

Deductions began surging in North Dakota about a decade ago. About 20% of royalties are deducted, on average, according to two estimates as well as interviews with royalty owners. That would have amounted to about $1 billion in 2023. 
Estimates provided by the North Dakota Petroleum Council suggest companies withhold at least hundreds of millions of dollars in North Dakota every year.
Why some lawmakers are pushing for change  
Several lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Don Longmuir, said that because the state’s legislative season is a relatively short 80 days, it’s important to have an interim legislative committee conduct a study and propose a solution ahead of the 2027 session.  
“We can’t wait until the session starts,” said Longmuir, of Stanley, in the oil-producing region of the state. “That’s something that you know really needs to happen before session starts, so that maybe they can come up with something.”
Assigning a new study to an interim committee would require a directive from Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, chair of the Legislative Management Committee. Hogue, a Republican from Minot, said he “would consider it” and will likely make a decision in the next month or two.
“I really need to do more self-education right now,” Hogue said. The recent series has raised “awareness that there is an issue out there,” he said. 
Sen. Dale Patten, who has served as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and would likely have influence over any legislation, said he is open to a formal legislative study but said it should be initiated only with input from the full Legislature.
“I would be comfortable with taking a look at it and see if there’s a way to resolve it,” said Patten, a Republican from Watford City. 
Some lawmakers are already thinking about ways to address the issue in the next session. 
One lawmaker said he may introduce legislation that would limit the length of leases to 30 years. Republican Sen. Jeff Magrum, who represents Hazelton and has supported landowners on other issues, said he hopes limiting leases will give future generations of mineral owners the opportunity to renegotiate contracts and incentivize companies to be more mindful of how they treat North Dakotans. 
“I don’t think that’s right for someone that’s not even born yet to have to honor a contract that I signed today. It’s just not fair to them,” Magrum said. “Look at how times have changed. Everything’s changed and they’re stuck in the contract that was written in the 1950s.” 
Magrum has introduced 13 bills related to property rights issues in the past two legislative sessions. All but one failed.
They can’t get answers from the oil industry. North Dakota’s oversight program hasn’t helped.

Rep. David Richter, a Republican from Williston, said he thinks it would be difficult for the Legislature to modify existing leases in that way, but it could limit the length of future leases.  
“Going forward, I think that might be an option worth taking a really hard look at,” Richter said. “But that doesn’t do anything to alleviate the situation of the leases that are already in place.”
For those existing leases, Richter said it is often “unclear” whether deductions are permitted, and some lawmakers said they should pass a state law to address the issue.
Richter said he prefers that companies and mineral owners renegotiate the contracts to specify whether deductions are permitted. But if that doesn’t happen, he said he is open to legislation that would “clarify” how leases that don’t mention deductions should be interpreted by the courts.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, a Democrat from Fargo, said lawmakers should pass a  law stating that companies can’t take postproduction deductions unless leases explicitly allow them to do so. Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Republican from Williston who supports oil development but who also has tried to help mineral owners, proposed such a measure in 2021. 
“We could write legislation clarifying this easily,” Hogan said. “But we’ve never been able to get it done.”
Industry, state officials respond
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, an organization that lobbies on behalf of more than 550 oil and gas companies, said many of the proposals would be a “substantial infringement” on mineral owners’ property rights. 
“We believe direct state involvement/interference in the contractual agreements of hundreds of thousands of private mineral leases is the wrong approach,” Ness wrote in an email. “Suggested actions like this would have a detrimental impact on mineral development in North Dakota.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican who worked for his family’s privately owned oil company earlier in his career, did not respond to a request for comment for this article. 
But during an Aug. 18 appearance on a KFGO radio program, the governor said he was open to making tweaks to the royalty oversight program. The program was created by legislators in 2023 and was envisioned as a way to mediate disputes about deductions between mineral owners and companies, but that hasn’t happened. 
Some states restrict the oil industry from taking mineral owners’ earnings. Not North Dakota.

“If this one isn’t working, we should find out why not and figure out if we can tweak it and make it better,” Armstrong said.
Some lawmakers said they don’t see a need to take any action. 
Sen. Kent Weston, a Republican from Sarles, said he’s discussed the issue with colleagues in the Legislature and North Dakota Petroleum Council staff in recent weeks. He said the status quo is  “fair” and necessary to ensure the oil and gas industry continues to invest in the state.  
House Majority Leader Mike Lefor and Rep. Todd Porter, the longtime chair of the committee overseeing the energy industry in the House, could not be reached for comment.

(Courtesy of the National Park Service)LINCOLN — Nebraska would have to dig into its pocketbook if it wants to take over management of the scenic Niobrara River from the National Park Service.
That seems clear after officials from Ohio, a state that has a rare “cooperative agreement” to manage federally designated wild and scenic rivers within its state, told the Examiner that is spends $1.2 million a year on its state scenic river program. Ohio manages three, federally designated scenic rivers and 13 other streams that have either a state scenic, wild or recreation designation.
The state assigns 11 staff members to manage stream quality, promote preservation of forest corridors and scenery and protect sensitive areas along the streams, as well as assist landowners, developers and other stakeholders. State personnel also work with advisory councils associated with each of the scenic rivers to give local landowners and other interests a voice in management decisions.


Federal law
“It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States that certain selected rivers of the Nation which, with their immediate environments possess outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural, or other similar values, shall be preserved in free-flowing condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.”
— An excerpt from the Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968


The issue of cost came up after Nebraska State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman proposed an interim study of the state possibly taking over of management of the Niobrara River, a federally designated scenic river, from the National Park Service.
Part of Storer’s district includes the 75 miles of the Niobrara that was added to the federal list of wild and scenic rivers in 1991. The designation followed an effort that prevented the damming of the unique stream by the proposed Norden Dam.
Currently, the Park Service operates on an annual budget of $1.2 million to help police the popular river, help conserve the wild and scenic nature of the Niobrara and staff a visitors center in Valentine. In addition, the Niobrara Council, a committee of local officials that provides input and runs some river-related programs, gets about $52,000 a year from the state and, until this past year, $100,000 a year from the federal government to help fund its activities.
Advocates for retaining federal management of the Niobrara maintain that the State of Nebraska lacks the expertise and the funds — given its recent budget shortfalls — to take over river management. Meanwhile Storer and the head of a local natural resources district have pushed back on that, saying they doubt it would take too much money. They maintain that the interim study — set for a hearing at 1 p.m. on Friday at the State Capitol — will help answer the cost question.
Bob Gable, the scenic rivers administrator for the Ohio Division of Natural Areas and Preserves, said he could not separate how much of his state’s money and staff were devoted to Ohio’s three federally designated scenic rivers — the Big and Little Darby Creek, Little Beaver Creek and the Little Miami River. He said it wasn’t as simple as dividing the funding equally among the 16 rivers, which would be about $75,000 per river spent in Ohio.
Gable said managing federally designated rivers comes with additional coordination with the federal government. For instance, the National Park Service must review and approve water resource projects that impact banks and streams. All told, Ohio manages 945 miles of streams in its scenic river program, a program that began in 1968, a few months before the federal government passed the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
“This is a fact that we are very proud of,” Gable said in an email, of the Ohio program preceding the federal act.
Storer did not respond to calls and texts seeking comment on this story.
Sändra Washington, who worked with scenic river programs in Ohio and later with the Park Service, said it would be difficult to estimate what it might cost for the state to take over the management of the Niobrara River.
Much, said Washington, now a member of the Lincoln City Council, would depend on whether state agencies have the expertise to do it. It would certainly cost more to create a new scenic rivers program from scratch than if the state had an existing one.
Storer has said that uncertainty about federal funding for the National Park Service to manage the Niobrara River and funding for a local river advisory council, the Niobrara Council, call for a look at taking over management of the scenic river by the state and some local entities, such as the Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, called for the cancellation of the lease on the scenic river visitors center in Valentine. That decision was later reversed.

Education requires that teachers and students feel free to try out ideas without fear that they will immediately be accused of bias and prejudice. Yet teachers will be forgiven for thinking it is too risky to discuss what American Jews and Israelis openly discuss as part of a genocide education unit.
The post State commission to combat antisemitism misses t[...]","LAST MONTH, the Massachusetts Special Commission for Combatting Antisemitism quietly passed a series of recommendations for K-12 education. As a Jewish American parent with two children in Massachusetts public schools, I do not look forward to the implementation of these recommendations.  
The commission said that public concerns about these recommendations, including those submitted by many Jews, were mainly about “semantics,” not substance. Much more than words are at stake. In practice, different aspects of the recommendations contradict each other or put staff, teachers, and students in impossible educational situations.  
The recommendations treat Jews differently from others, fail to create an open educational environment, and will produce a climate of confusion and suspicion. This can only make the problem of antisemitism worse not better. Consider some concrete examples. 
One of the commission’s recommendations is that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) establish an “Advisory Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education” to facilitate implementation of the “Genocide Education Mandate.”  
It is reasonable to ask teachers and students to have informed and curious discussions about genocide. However, the committee also says that educators and staff must “be informed by” the International Holocaust Remembrance Association (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. For unclear reasons, the committee chose the most politically controversial, even among Jews, definition of antisemitism.  
Various aspects of that definition make saying Israel is committing genocide a form of antisemitism. That means educators are ordered to have open and frank discussions about genocide, while making it impossible to consider whether what students learn about genocide may be applied to Israel. Regardless of whether you think Israel is doing that or not, given that Israelis themselves, including a former Israeli attorney general and former speaker of the Knesset, have said that Israel is doing so, means that it must be permissible to consider. But the committee’s recommendations cut that discussion off.  
Education requires that teachers and students feel free to try out ideas without fear that they will immediately be accused of bias and prejudice. Yet teachers will be forgiven for thinking it is too risky to discuss what American Jews and Israelis openly discuss as part of a genocide education unit. Subordinating instruction to what counts as antisemitism makes education look more like indoctrination. 
Elsewhere, the committee instructs the state education department to establish an anonymous government hotline for reporting antisemitic incidents as part of a “statewide Bias Reporting Program.” The committee claims this will help provide a way for students to report harassment and provide a “mechanism for reporting problematic curriculum.” In the absence of any guidance, beyond again being “informed by” the International Holocaust Remembrance Association definition of antisemitism, the committee seems to think that the judge of whether something was antisemitic is just how a hearer felt about it.  
So now students, teachers, and staff can fear that they might be anonymously reported based on a politicized definition of antisemitism. This will only further chill discussion and undercut teachers, who will have to tiptoe around anything perceived as controversial. Historically speaking, the kinds of societies where acquaintances can report each other anonymously to a government agency are not known for their open, high-quality learning environment.  
Consider another problem. One genuinely well-meaning recommendation is the development of new “model curricula and best practices” around “teaching antisemitism and Jewish identity” that “may include Jewish history, positive Jewish contributions to America, Jewish diversity, and manifestations of contemporary antisemitism.” On its own, this sounds fine. But when integrated with a “mandatory anti-bias education for school committees and all K-12 faculty and administrators that includes antisemitism,” anonymous reporting hotline, and that pesky definition of antisemitism, things look different.  
Somehow, antisemitism education now amounts to emphasizing “positive contributions” of Jews while condemning any negative statements about anything associated with Jews as antisemitic. The overall message will be that Jews don’t do bad things – unlike ordinary human beings they can’t hate others, or commit genocide, or be racist. To even suggest that will already to be under suspicion of antisemitism.  
Such an approach can only backfire. It sends the message that Jews are essentially different, almost inhumanly different. Worse than that, given that these messages will arrive as state-level mandates, it makes it seem like Jews are trying to force people to believe that they are different.  
There is no doubt that there are all kinds of nasty, antisemitic ways in which Jews are criticized as Jews. But the broad and confused way in which antisemitism is presented in the recommendations does not capture that problem. Instead, this “antisemitism education” will likely function in an actual classroom only to discourage or browbeat students into seeing Jews as different or special. That cannot possibly be good for reducing antisemitic prejudice. 
Finally, there is the wider problem of speech suppression. The commission said it values academic freedom. But the thrust of the recommendations is that if students feel that “protests, walkouts, postering,” and ordinary discussion are antisemitic, then the presumption is those acts of expression should be punished or shut down. There seems to be no thought at all about how in a diverse democracy like ours there will be vigorous and strong disagreements, which we accept and tolerate even if we happen to find them offensive.  
It is strange to see Massachusetts following in the footsteps of the Trump administration in its approach to education. And it cannot be good for the fight against antisemitism to associate Jews with new limits on speech and the degradation of the learning environment.  
The commission has tied its shoelaces together and then tried to start running. On the one hand, it issues new orders for educators and students to talk more about Jews, antisemitism, genocide, and Israel. On the other, it creates new disciplinary procedures and constraints, enforced according to poorly defined and politically controversial standards, that will make those conversations stilted and non-educational.  
Kids know when they are being set up or told that they may only think in certain ways, not others. Even on their own terms, these recommendations cannot possibly advance the aim of fighting antisemitism. Never mind how incompatible they are with open-minded education on controversial topics about which reasonable people might disagree.  
Instead of rushing these ill-considered measures out, right before the school year, the state should have hit pause. At minimum, the Massachusetts legislature needs to step in with some oversight of this Trumpist approach to educational policy. This issue is too important to mess up.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)When I think about healthcare in Tennessee, I think of my childhood and the long drives from rural Appalachia to Chattanooga to see a specialist for my partial blindness. 
I think of TennCare, our state’s Medicaid program, and how I relied on the program again as an adult when I was diagnosed with cancer that almost derailed my future. But most of all, I think of my son who now relies on TennCare to cover his daily caregiving.
Without access to Medicaid, my family may not be here today. And yet, even with coverage, the safety net is already fraying. When Kramer Davis Health — the only clinic in Tennessee specifically designed for adolescents and adults with severe autism and intellectual disabilities — closes its doors this year, families like mine feel this impact immediately. For so many of us, TennCare is the only bridge to the kind of specialized care our loved ones need to survive and thrive.
TennCare supports nearly 1.5 million Tennesseans, funds rural clinics from the Cumberland Plateau to West Tennessee, and sustains vital specialty services like mental health treatments, addiction recovery programs, and care for children with complex medical needs. It also covers nearly half of all children and nearly half of all pregnant mothers in the state. The Medicaid cuts that Congress passed in the reconciliation bill threaten to sever a lifeline for many Tennesseans, especially in rural communities like the one I grew up in.
250k Tennesseans could lose TennCare, private insurance under Congressional spending bill

 Born in rural Appalachia, healthcare was hard to reach for me and even harder to afford. My family depended on TennCare for everything. Because of my blindness, I spent much of my childhood traveling to eye specialists in Chattanooga. Years later, when I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, TennCare helped cover treatment, surgery, and follow-up care. Medicaid gave me back a childhood, allowed me to go to college, and even helped me break the cycle of poverty in my family.
 Today, TennCare is just as essential to my son’s life as it was to mine. He lives with intellectual and developmental disabilities and has relied on a Medicaid waiver his entire life. Now, as an adult, TennCare provides him with the support he needs to live independently. Thanks to Medicaid coverage, my son is able to maintain stable housing, receive daily caregiving, and stay employed. Without it, he would lose everything, including his house, caregiving support, job, and most importantly, ability to thrive independently.
 My Medicaid story spans generations, but the truth is the same: TennCare makes life possible As former director of Family Voices of Tennessee, I worked with families of children with disabilities or special healthcare needs. They turned to us to help navigate therapies, benefit programs, mentorship, and connection. Most of the families we served rely on TennCare because it covers treatments most private insurance companies simply don’t. They simply cannot afford to lose it.
 The recent actions in Washington should concern everyone. The so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”, supported by eight  of Tennessee’s nine-member congressional delegation, would slash Medicaid funding by $7 billion over the next decade. For our state, that means fewer resources for TennCare, the program that underpins healthcare for millions of children, people with disabilities, and rural residents.
 Tennessee already has the highest number of rural hospital closures per capita in the nation, so we know what is at stake. Our state has nine rural hospitals–or 18%– that are at risk of closing with over one-fifth of the state living in such rural areas. Entire counties face the risk of being left without mental health care or other specialty care and services. TennCare is often the only reason providers can keep their doors open. 
Already, we are seeing glimpses of the fallout from these cuts. A rural obstetrician at one of the state’s few remaining birthing hospitals says the system is on the verge of collapse, anticipating women’s and pediatric care likely among the first services to go. Another rural hospital damaged by Hurricane Helene now faces uncertainty about rebuilding and reopening because of reduced federal Medicaid funding under the Big Beautiful bill. If federal funding is slashed, more services will be cut, hospitals will close, and more communities will be left without care.
For families, the impact would be devastating. Imagine a child with autism losing access to speech therapy, a new mother in rural Tennessee who cannot find prenatal care because her local clinic shut down, or an adult with disabilities like my son, who could lose the support that allows him to live independently. Those are not hypotheticals — they are the direct consequences of cutting TennCare.
I’ve seen the Medicaid system from every angle: first, as a patient, then as a mother, and now as a public servant and advocate. I know what it’s like to depend on this program, but more importantly, I know that it continues to deliver essential care to millions. Medicaid gave me the chance to live a healthy life, and now it gives my son — and countless other Tennesseans — the same opportunity.
For families like mine, TennCare is survival. That’s why Congress’s proposed cuts are dangerous: they threaten not just services, but futures. I urge our leaders to remember the Tennessee families whose lives depend on this program and protect TennCare, not weaken it.

(Getty Images)Around 112 scientific grants in Pennsylvania from the National Institutes of Health have been impacted by cuts or freezes instituted by the Trump administration, according to a group of researchers and scientists who have been tracking the terminations.
An estimated 82 are currently affected, with another 30 having possibly been possibly reinstated. Losses are believed to total nearly $40 million. Yet researchers say the impact could extend beyond academia, with scientific grant funding often creating jobs and resulting in boons to local economies.
In August, a U.S. Supreme Court order allowed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to terminate $783 million in grants funding initiatives promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. Last month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to give political appointees even more power to terminate federal grants, including those at the NIH.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The project Grant Witness has found more than 5,100 NIH grants across the country that have been impacted since the administration first began terminating funding en masse in February, resulting in roughly $5.3 billion in losses. The cuts have sometimes left scientists with no way to continue ongoing research or clinical trials.
It says it believes more than 1,300 frozen or terminated grants have been possibly reinstated.
Noam Ross, one of the founders of Grant Witness, which is led by scientists and researchers, began tracking grant terminations around March after he and others who had been doing the same work independently banded together.
“We recognized there was going to need to be an understanding of what was being terminated,” Ross said. “Everything just accelerated from there in terms of the government just became much more large scale and more brazen with its terminations. Things moved from NIH to the [National Science Foundation, or NSF] and more agencies than we’ve been able to cover.”
Ross estimates the group has captured roughly 80% of all NIH grants terminated since the Trump administration cracked down on scientific spending. Data was compiled by scraping government websites, collecting and verifying social media and news reports, and gathering stories from impacted researchers.
The stories and data can sometimes be hard to parse. Ross said tracking has to occur on multiple fronts. That’s because many grants have been frozen and then unfrozen, different federal datasets tracking grant spending have misaligned and it can sometimes take more than a month to see when a grant is reinstated because of a lag in reporting.
“Everyone on the team thinks the American scientific system is a huge, underlying component of what we would say makes this country great, American Prosperity,” Ross said. “The system that we have certainly has its flaws, but it’s done really well for the past almost hundred years. It’s, from our perspective, hugely damaging, discriminatory and probably illegal what the administration is doing to undercut it.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which contains the NIH, did not respond to a request for comment. But officials have said the goal is to align scientific spending with the priorities of the Trump administration.
The NIH calls itself “the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world.”
Impacted grants in Pennsylvania have covered a wide swath of subjects at 16 universities and research institutions, with many, but not all, focused on individual social groups or advancing equity in health care. 
Grant projects include studies ranging from topics such as brain development in children with autism, veterans’ access to organ transplants, racial disparities in kidney failure mortality, uptake in HIV prevention and treatment among transgender women, and efforts to encourage various minority groups to enter scientific fields.










If those opportunities are cut, we’re going to see fewer people who are getting into this pipeline in the first place, and fewer people who have the chance to train as a scientist.


– Allie Sinclair, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School of Medicine


The most affected universities in Pennsylvania were the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and the University of Pittsburgh with 34 and 33, respectively.  Four at the University of Pennsylvania and six at the University of Pittsburgh are listed as “possibly reinstated.”
All but eight of the 112 impacted grants in the commonwealth contained words reportedly flagged by the Trump administration to weed out projects that may be linked to DEI initiatives. They include “bias,” “trans,” “race” and “diverse,” words that sometimes have different meanings in scientific and colloquial contexts. “Trans,” for example, is used as a prefix in chemistry to indicate certain arrangements of atoms in molecules.
Yet even grants that did focus on subjects related to gender or diversity can be important, Ross said. Disparities still exist in health outcomes between people of different ethnicities and social groups. And those differences, he noted, contribute to America’s lagging health indicators and life expectancy when compared to other developed countries.
“That’s the big health science challenge in America these days,” Ross said. “The richest, most well-off communities do as well as any other rich country, but our average health outcomes are much worse because we haven’t figured out how to deliver health care to other communities.”
Cuts may mean fewer people train as scientists
Allie Sinclair, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School of Medicine, worked on NIH-funded projects as a PhD student, and was supported by a fellowship from theNational Science Foundation. 
Like the NIH, the NSF has slashed funding for grant projects under the Trump administration, and that’s also had an effect on schools, research institutions, and their ability to support students in medical science fields.
“This past spring, we saw that universities all over the country were cutting down on the number of PhD students that they were admitting,” Sinclair said. “That’s because PhD students don’t pay tuition out of pocket. Rather, they’re actually paid a stipend to live because they’re really crucial workers in our scientific economy. They’re doing the day-to-day work of science.”
Much of that work is covered by the NIH, but right now, that funding is volatile.
Undergraduate students working on federally-funded projects can get an early chance to do hands-on scientific research. For some, it’s their first exposure to the field. For others, it’s a way to help pay their way through school.
“If those opportunities are cut, we’re going to see fewer people who are getting into this pipeline in the first place, and fewer people who have the chance to train as a scientist,” Sinclair said.
While she wasn’t personally affected by recent grant-funding cuts, Sinclair joined a group of researchers on a project to measure their economic impact. And some of them had their work effectively terminated.

Their research, which led to the creation of a website called Science Impacts, discovered counties across Pennsylvania and the rest of the country may lose millions of dollars in future revenue, all due to the loss of NIH grants and the accompanying jobs and local spending.
It’s based in part on a 2025 study that found NIH grant funding can have a roughly 250% return on investment when it comes to dollars driven into local economies. Mapping jobs lost to scientific grant cuts across the country, and using census data to approximate where researchers may live and spend money, allowed her team to estimate what local economies may lose. They also considered a proposed 40% cut to the NIH’s budget in 2026 to help estimate potential future losses.
“When a university like Penn or Temple or Drexel in the Philadelphia area is impacted by these cuts, the effects will be felt in the surrounding region, not only for people who are right at that institution,” Sinclair told the Capital-Star.
But the impacts won’t just be felt by students and communities around research institutions. Terminated grants, Sinclair said, often represent projects that are already underway.
In most cases, the work was already in progress and then they were abruptly frozen or ended  by the government so the funds are no longer being disbursed,” she said. “Those research projects are disrupted. That can halt clinical trials and things like that.”
Moreover, cuts to scientific grant funding, like the Trump administration’s recent proposal to slash the NIH budget by about 40%, also represents a loss of future research that can lead to all sorts of scientific and medical advancements.
Between 2010 and 2019, over 99% of all drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were created, at least in part, with NIH funding.
“That’s a demonstration that, despite the fact that big pharma and the private sector want to be generating new discoveries, they still really crucially depend on some aspect of federal support for discovering new cures,” Sinclair said. “This sort of broad spectrum investment from the government in health research really leads to tangible benefits for Americans.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-490826621-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 05:59:39.720032

(Getty Images)“If Appalachia is to survive, land reform is a must.” — Jim Branscome, Mountain Eagle (Whitesburg, Kentucky), January 4, 1973
A half-century wait for justice
In early 1973, I wrote those words for the Mountain Eagle of Whitesburg, Kentucky, making the case that nothing could really change for Appalachia’s people — no matter how many government programs or anti-poverty initiatives — until we broke the pattern of absentee land ownership that has defined and damaged our region for more than a century.
Today, 52 years later, much has changed in our mountains, and much, regrettably, remains the same. The coal industry that once promised prosperity has largely collapsed, leaving behind environmental devastation and economic despair. Climate change has brought unprecedented flooding that kills our neighbors and destroys our communities. Yet the fundamental issue I identified five decades ago persists: ordinary mountain people remain “landless in their own country,” while corporate interests control the fate of the best land for housing not subject to flooding, land that can support renewable energy projects, vertical agriculture, carbon credits, and otherwise be the inspiration for new visions by mountaineers of what a post-coal, post-industrial era can look like.
The urgency of this moment cannot be overstated. The catastrophic flooding of July 2022 that killed 45 people in eastern Kentucky, and the many floods since all over coal country, served as a brutal reminder that our current path is unsustainable. Families were swept away in their sleep as waters rose in narrow valleys where safe, buildable land has long been monopolized by coal companies and outside speculators. Meanwhile, on the high ridges above the floodplains, vast tracts of corporate-owned land sit empty or scarred by strip mining.
Meantime, the depopulation of the coalfields continues. Projections from West Virginia University’s Bureau of Business & Economic Research show further steep declines by 2040 across the southern coalfields. McDowell is projected to lose nearly a third of its people (-31.8%), with Summers (-20.2%), Mingo (-19.4%), Wyoming (-18.2%), Boone (-17.1%), Fayette (-16.6%), Logan (-14.4%), Nicholas (-12.1%), Raleigh (-9.5%), Mercer (-8.7%), and even Kanawha (-6.6%) not far behind. Statewide, West Virginia’s population peaked at 2,005,552 in 1950 and fell to 1,793,716 by 2020. In McDowell County alone, population plunged from 98,887 in 1950 to 19,111 in 2020 — a decline of more than 80%.
We’re not just losing numbers — we’re losing the critical mass that keeps communities alive. Shrinking tax bases strain schools and clinics. Volunteer fire and rescue squads struggle to replace aging equipment. Local businesses close earlier, then for good. And after every flood, more families ask if it’s sustainable to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow while idle acreage sits on benches and ridgelines above town. The worst projected decline I have seen is minus 48% for Buchanan County in Southwest Virginia, according to the University of Virginia. Harlan County, Kentucky, is projected to lose nearly 45%, according to the University of Kentucky. The coalfields have a lot more in common than just coal history.
The stranglehold of absentee ownership
No place demonstrates the consequences of absentee ownership more starkly than Southern West Virginia. In the 1990s, journalist Beth Spence led a landmark investigative series, “Who Owns West Virginia?” working with the Appalachian Leadership and Education Foundation. Her research confirmed what people in Mingo, Wyoming, and McDowell counties long suspected: vast acreage and the mineral wealth beneath it were held by a handful of out-of-state corporations and land companies.
Spence found that in some southern West Virginia counties, fewer than a dozen entities owned more than half the private land. In McDowell County, just ten companies owned more than 75% of all private land, rendering local government and residents virtual tenants in their own communities. Over 25% of West Virginia’s surface was held by just ten absentee corporate owners.
While much has changed — coal companies renamed, assets traded and new timber and energy interests seeking short-term profit — the basic reality endures. Nearly half of the state’s surface acreage and most of its mineral rights remain controlled by outside entities rather than local hands.
The costs are visible from Williamson to Bluefield. Land is held off the tax rolls or under-assessed, depriving schools and public services of crucial revenue. Economic development is stymied not by lack of initiative, but by lack of access. Would-be homeowners and small farmers cannot buy or borrow while the best land sits idle or cut-over or stripped. Decisions about land use — whether to strip mine, replant or sell off for speculation — are made from boardrooms in Pittsburgh, Houston or New York, not from courthouse squares in Welch or community meetings in Pineville.
Learning from Kentucky’s bold response
The devastating 2022 floods that claimed 45 lives in eastern Kentucky sparked an unprecedented response from Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration. Rather than simply rebuilding in the same flood-prone valleys, Kentucky launched an ambitious program to create new high-ground communities on safer ridgetop locations. The state is acquiring land, building infrastructure and offering families the chance to relocate to elevated sites that could withstand future floods. There are no reasons West Virginia cannot do the same.
Beshear’s efforts represent exactly the kind of bold, land-focused thinking that West Virginia desperately needs. Beshear’s approach recognizes that climate resilience requires fundamentally rethinking where and how we build communities. It acknowledges that the old pattern — of families crowded into narrow valleys while corporations control the high ground — is not just unjust but deadly.
West Virginia faces the same climate threats that devastated eastern Kentucky.  The narrow valleys flood regularly, and climate scientists warn that extreme precipitation events will only intensify. Yet we continue to allow the safest, most buildable land to remain in corporate hands while families crowd into flood-prone areas.
Tools for transformation
The mechanisms for change exist today in ways they didn’t in 1973. Community land trusts have proven successful across Appalachia, from the Woodland Community Land Trust in Tennessee to similar efforts in Kentucky and West Virginia. These organizations keep land accessible for housing, farming and business while protecting it from speculation and corporate takeover.
Land banks have become vehicles for returning tax-delinquent or abandoned coal lands to community use. Environmental cleanup programs offer opportunities to acquire and remediate damaged lands. Federal infrastructure investments provide unprecedented resources for rural development.
Most importantly, millions of dollars in federal and state funding are now flowing into West Virginia for mine reclamation, broadband infrastructure and climate adaptation. This represents a historic opportunity to reshape land ownership patterns while building resilient communities. The state could begin with a $100 million demonstration project using funding available from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
An Appalachian Homestead Act
My proposal for a modern Appalachian Homestead Act would harness these resources to finally address the land question that has plagued our region for generations. The state would acquire tax-delinquent, bankruptcy, and underused corporate acreage, particularly in the southern coalfields with the most concentrated absentee ownership.
These lands would be redistributed as 10-to-40-acre homesteads to local families, returnees, and new settlers committed to adding value to the community. Each plot would come with tax relief and essential infrastructure, from broadband to flood-resistant siting on high ground. Homesteads would be part of community land trusts or similar shared-ownership models, protecting against outside speculation while preserving individual autonomy over homes and improvements.
New landowners could plant orchards, vineyards or native hardwoods. They could build farm stays, small mills or food businesses. They could sell carbon credits, harvest wild ginseng or develop renewable energy projects. Most importantly, they could live on and live from their own land in communities designed for climate resilience rather than corporate extraction.
West Virginia University and the state’s other colleges could provide technical assistance not just for industrial agriculture, but for small-scale, diversified, locally rooted economies. Extension agents could help new landowners navigate everything from sustainable forestry to agritourism to renewable energy development.
The moment of decision
As West Virginia stands at another crossroads, the choice is clear: decline by inertia, tolerate the continued depopulation of Southern West Virginia, or renewal through justice. The tools exist. The money is finally arriving. The political will, fueled by necessity and decades of local organizing, is growing.
The 2022 Kentucky floods reminded us that our current land use patterns are not just economically unjust but physically dangerous. Beshear’s response shows that bold action is possible when leaders prioritize people over corporate interests. West Virginia can learn from Kentucky’s example while charting its own course toward land justice.  Nothing is more American than homesteading. Conservatives can cherish local initiative and private property values; progressives can celebrate meaningful change that did not happen with previous poorly funded economic development projects.
Fifty years ago, I argued that Appalachia’s future would be decided by who owned the land and how it was used. No area bears this out more clearly than Southern West Virginia. The land — and its people — have waited long enough for justice. With bold land reform, the Mountain State can become a model not only for Central Appalachia but for rural renewal across the country.
The choice belongs to this generation of West Virginians. The land remembers those who fought for it. History will judge whether we had the courage to finally claim it for our people.

When the Frontier Housing CEO explains the concept, he hearkens back to when he played with Lego bricks growing up. Just like a Lego toy set, the boxes are put together to make the “building blocks of a house.”

“I remember when you got a box of Legos and there wasn’t a prescribed thing to build, and my brother and I would build stuff,” Manning-Beavin said.
What Manning-Beavin is hoping to tackle now is the stark shortfall of affordable housing in Eastern Kentucky by reinventing the way the nonprofit has been building homes for 51 years. 
Instead of constructing a house on site from the ground up, he and his colleagues want to manufacture their component “boxes” in a factory and transport them to the site, where they could become a finished  house much more quickly and at lower cost, while still maintaining the sturdiness and quality of traditionally built homes.
That would be in contrast to the vast majority of single-family homes across the country that are “site-built,” meaning all the materials are brought to a site where workers turn them into a house.

A world of ‘boxes’ 
In the warehouse, Manning-Beavin points out a “wet box” where water is hooked up for a bathroom, laundry space and kitchen. From there, a “suite box” with a master bedroom could be added onto the “wet box.” A “kids box” could be added with two small bedrooms for children. The “boxes” could be mixed and matched depending on homebuyers’ needs, ranging from 576 square feet with two boxes to over 1,400 square feet.with five boxes. 
The factory-made boxes would be built with the same materials, same tools and to the same code as traditional “stick-built” homes, he said.  
“It is like building a car on an assembly line,” Manning-Beavin said. “I think what this does is it creates a lot of flexibility for the buyer, creates choice. It also creates simplicity and replicability in the factory.”

The Morehead nonprofit  is adopting the modular housing concept, called a DreamBuild, from a Texas nonprofit builder. Come Build, Come Dream in Texas launched its version of DreamBuild homes to offer families more choice in the design of affordable housing. It’s a level of buyers’ choice that Manning-Beavin hopes to bring to Eastern Kentucky and that is largely unavailable in other types of factory-built housing. 
Manning-Beavin said Frontier Housing’s board agreed to take on the concept in the summer of 2023, and the nonprofit received funding from the James Graham Brown Foundation last year to continue to build prototypes.
The housing shortage in Eastern Kentucky has been exacerbated by catastrophic flooding in recent years. Fahe, a network of more than 50 nonprofits across Appalachia including Frontier Housing, has set an ambitious goal of rehabilitating or building 60,000 homes through 2030 — double its normal pace.
Meanwhile, the rising cost to build a house also is driving the region’s housing shortage, says Manning-Beavin.
After the 2022 flooding, Manning-Beavin started to see DreamBuild as “part of the solution for providing homes at a pace that was needed.”
Frontier Housing’s first completed DreamBuild home is roughly 50% more energy efficient than an average home built to a 2000s-era standard. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
“Lots of people just in Rowan County …  are frustrated because they want to own a house, there’s nothing to buy, and we can’t afford to build a house at a price point that they can afford,” Manning-Beavin said. “Our hope is that we start to change that equation, not just in Rowan County but across Eastern Kentucky, and perhaps parts of West Virginia, parts of Virginia, parts of Ohio.” 
Housing costs — and a ‘dream’ to lower them
Generally, he said, the costs to construct traditionally built homes exceed the home’s value, even though traditional financing offers a loan covering only the value of a home. It’s a trend seen nationwide for a number of reasons ranging from the costs of regulation to rising land values to  the costs of materials, effectively disincentivizing the construction of affordable homes because developers know they will lose money on them. 
Manning-Beavin said the Kentucky Housing Corporation, a quasi-governmental corporation that distributes federal housing monies, has offered Frontier Housing subsidies to cover the gap between the cost of building a home and its value.
The “wet box” of a finished DreamBuild home showcases a kitchen, bathroom and laundry space next to each other. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
The hope is that DreamBuild homes can be made efficiently and quickly enough to cut down construction costs by about 10% to 15%. Then, Frontier Housing could break even on building a home without subsidies and open up access to more traditional house financing such as through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
Manning-Beavin is confident they can get there, pointing to experience of fine-tuning the construction of energy-efficient homes in Whitley County with the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corp. 
But plenty of growing pains await the nonprofit as they perfect their model.
Tod Barhorst, Frontier’s Housing director of construction, worked in the construction industry for about 20 years before joining the nonprofit. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
“It’s going to be one of the things that’s going to ramp up,” said Tod Barhorst, the director of construction at the nonprofit. “We’ve kind of been really baby-crawling right now.” 
The nonprofit has had to build prototypes of the various “box” types, dismantle the boxes and rebuild again to see what works and what doesn’t. One challenge is getting state code enforcement approval for designs without having to get approval for each different version of box types being put together. 
Another challenge: how to effectively transport the boxes, especially with Kentucky’s lower height limit for vehicle loads compared to Texas, where the DreamBuild concept started. 
Barhorst said the nonprofit also wants to distinguish its product from other manufactured housing, emphasizing the DreamBuild homes’ “stick-built” quality. 
“A lot of questions to answer, a lot of things to work out,” Barhorst said.

Painting the final touches
The project has the potential to significantly increase the number of homes it can build if the project succeeds. The nonprofit is aiming to build 12 traditional “stick-built” homes this year. In contrast, the nonprofit believes it could produce around 60 DreamBuild homes or more every year.
Frontier Housing has leased a 55,000 square foot building in Martin County to ramp up production of DreamBuild housing, including duplexes for a 50-unit apartment complex in Maysville. Manning-Beavin said the Maysville project will use 152 boxes. He also hopes to build and send DreamBuild homes to the Skyview higher ground community in Perry County. 
For now, a glimpse of what’s possible can be found along Redbud Circle near the Bath County line. Inside one of two prototype homes, there are windows with lots of light pouring in. A master bedroom with a full bathroom. A kitchen with new appliances. A large porch with a gravel driveway.

It’s not until Hunter Plank points out small, nearly unnoticeable details along the walls that where the “boxes” were put together become visible. 
Plank, who went from building more traditional homes for Frontier Housing to building these DreamBuild homes, said the home is “double built” in some ways, especially around where two boxes come together. The prototype homes are planned to be energy efficient; the first finished DreamBuild home is roughly 50% more energy efficient than an average home, according to one rating system. 
“There’s no corners cut,” Plank said. 
On an afternoon in August, Plank and his co-workers were busy painting the place.
“The idea isn’t for you to think about how it was built. That’s our problem. You’re just getting a home,” Plank said.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Electricity customers across a broad swath of the country will bear the costs of running an outdated fossil fuel power plant in Pennsylvania that federal energy regulators pulled back from the brink of retirement earlier this year.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last month approved a plan that allows PJM Interconnection to recover its payments to the plant’s owner, Constellation Energy, from electricity users across its 13-state territory.
Environmental and renewable energy advocates and stakeholders in the regional electric grid opposed the system-wide cost sharing plan, arguing that it would unfairly raise electricity bills in areas that see little benefit from the old plant remaining online. 
The groups, including the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), say the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) claim of an emergency as the reason for keeping the plant online doesn’t exist. 
The agency last month extended its order requiring the plant in suburban Philadelphia and another in southwest Michigan to keep operating for a total of 180 days beyond their planned shut down dates. 
Opponents warn that it will add to soaring energy costs for consumers and prevent badly needed new electricity generators from connecting to the grid. The groups say the regulatory interventions used to keep the plant running and spread out the costs will be used in the future as U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright executes the administration’s fossil fuel-first energy policy.
Wright, a former oil drilling and mining company executive, has described the future of coal as “long and bright.”

“There are like 40 coal plants that are supposed to close this year, and our biggest impact is going to be to stop the closure of most of those,” Wright said in July during a visit to the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown, West Virginia.
In an MSNBC interview in June, he said peak electricity demands and growing consumption are driving the need to keep older power plants running.
The Trump administration and other Republicans, including Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick have framed the continued use of coal and other fossil fuels as crucial to developing artificial intelligence technologies superior to China’s.
“We need to stop digging the hole, keep working power plants open today, and do everything we can in the regulatory framework to allow new capacity to be added to our grid so we can lead in the AI race,” Wright said in the interview.
Rachel Gleason, executive director of the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance, said fossil fuel generation remains essential to electric reliability in the commonwealth. The commonwealth’s net electricity generation decreased from 39% in 2013 to about 5% in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.
She noted two of the commonwealth’s remaining “workhorse” coal power plants, the Keystone Generating Station in Armstrong County and the Conemaugh Generating Station in Indiana County, each capable of producing more than 1,500 megawatts, were essential during recent spells of arctic cold and a June heatwave.

“Keeping all of the available capacity we need online rather than prematurely shuttering it will be essential for energy security, grid reliability, and mitigating price pressures that will otherwise continue to escalate for ratepayers,” she said.
Environmental groups noted in a filing opposing PJM’s cost sharing plan that while it called on Constellation’s Eddystone Generating Station in Delaware County to run during the June heatwave, it wasn’t because of a shortage of electricity. PJM exported power to other regional systems in the midwest and New York during that time.
In their protest of PJM’s cost allocation plan for Eddystone, the groups said the plant’s generators ran less than 1% of the time from 2020 to 2023.
“There is no need for this plant to continue operating,” Jessi Eidbo, senior advisor at the Sierra Club, said. “We’re waiting for a compelling reason and one is not emerging.”
The cost of keeping Eddystone online, estimated at nearly $70 million annually according to a report by the power industry consulting firm Grid Strategies, may not be noticeable when it’s spread across PJM’s 65 million customers, Greg Wannier, senior counsel at the Sierra Club, said. But prolonging the life of more gas, oil and coal plants that operators are ready to shut down will cause costs to mount, he said.
“The Trump administration has made very clear that they are going to issue an order to every coal plant that is going to retire in the next few years,” he said. “Were they allowed to do that for four years, the cost for consumers very quickly would go up.”
The Grid Strategies study projected the cost of keeping retiring power plants online to be between $3 billion and $6 billion nationwide by 2029.
Watchdog agencies in each state have warned of the potential impact on consumers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Since the DOE issued the initial order for Eddystone, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission has been involved in the stakeholder process PJM launched to determine how to allocate the cost of keeping the plant in operation, Chairman Stephen DeFrank said in a statement to the Capital-Star. He noted Pennsylvania doesn’t have an energy shortage and exports power to neighboring states.
“Our concern is making sure Pennsylvania families and businesses are not forced to shoulder the cost of power shortages in other states,” DeFrank said. “While the added expense from Eddystone may be modest right now, if this becomes a pattern with larger plants, the price tag for consumers could grow quickly — and those costs should fall more heavily on the regions that actually need the extra power.”
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is challenging the DOE’s order to keep the Campbell plant running in federal court. Her office also intervened in a request by the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy Co. to recover the cost, arguing that the DOE exceeded its authority and that requiring electric utility customers to pay is unjustified.
A spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday didn’t respond to questions about the DOE and FERC’s actions on the Eddystone plant. The DOE also didn’t respond to the Capital-Star’s questions.
PJM said in a statement that it has documented its concerns about demand growth and power plant retirements leading to serious ramifications for reliability and affordability. It called the agency’s recent order extending the Eddystone plant’s operation, “a prudent, time-limited step.”
Constellation, which emphasizes its role in accelerating a transition to a clean energy economy, said it’s working with the DOE and PJM “to meet the need for power at this critical time when America must win the AI race.” 
Constellation and PJM did not respond to questions about the cost of keeping the Eddystone plant operational.
Wannier, the Sierra Club attorney, said because Eddystone and Campbell’s retirements were already planned, the plants were not part of the auction processes  their respective grid operators used to establish the prices for generating capacity. 
Jon Gordon, director of the electricity industry group Advanced Energy United, said that puts their owners in an advantageous position to negotiate an agreement to be ready to run when needed.
“It’s really the most expensive way to meet resource needs for ratepayers,” Gordon said.
Ready to retire
Eddystone Generating Station in Delaware County was built in the late 1950s and burned coal, initially. Standing on the Delaware River waterfront about two miles from Philadelphia International Airport, its brightly illuminated smokestacks were a landmark on the suburban skyline for decades. Its location, on the border of the city of Chester, is close to one of the poorest communities in the commonwealth.
The original coal-fired units were retired about 15 years ago, but two 380 megawatt oil- or natural gas-burning units installed in the late 1960s remain operational, along with four smaller oil burning units used only during peak demand, according to Constellation. (A single megawatt for an hour is roughly the amount of electricity used by 500 to 1,000 homes for the same amount of time.)
Constellation had planned to retire the plant at the end of May following a lengthy process in which it sought and received approval from PJM. The regional grid operator, which manages the supply of electricity across its territory from New Jersey to Illinois, determined that taking Eddystone out of service would not affect reliability of the power grid.
In an emergency order on May 30, the Energy Department used its authority under the Federal Power Act to direct PJM and Constellation to ensure that Eddystone was ready to run for 90 days beyond its retirement date. In the order, Wright cited growing concern that “available generation capacity may fall short of required reserves” in an extreme scenario.
The order cited a May 2 news release from PJM that stated despite concerns about future capacity, “adequate resources” were available to meet the grid’s demand during the summer, when electricity use peaks. During a heat wave, on July 23, the grid’s electricity load reached 160,560 megawatts, its highest since 2006.

The DOE in May also ordered PJM counterpart Mid-Continent Independent System Operator, which runs the grid for 15 states and Manitoba, to ensure that the coal-fueled J.H. Campbell Power Plant in Michigan remains available for operation for 90 days past its planned retirement.
Last month, the DOE extended the orders requiring both Eddystone and Campbell to remain ready to produce power through mid-November.
Casey Roberts, an attorney at the NRDC working to oppose the emergency orders, said it’s clear the Trump administration is using the DOE’s emergency powers to put its energy policy into effect. 
Exploding demand
On the day he was inaugurated, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy” encouraging domestic energy exploration and production to establish the United States as a “global energy leader.” It called for the elimination of policies that would burden domestic energy development and revoked a dozen Biden administration orders on clean energy and climate change mitigation.
Roberts said the orders to keep Eddystone and Campbell running differ from those issued by the DOE over the previous two decades. 
Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act gives the Department of Energy authority to order actions by electric generators or grid operators in response to sudden increased demand or shortage of electricity.
Eidbo, of the Sierra Club, noted that between 2000 and 2022, the DOE used its Section 202(c) power only a dozen times. This year it has issued seven orders, four of which relate to Eddystone and Campbell. 
The other three involve an extreme weather event in North Carolina and ongoing reliability issues in Puerto Rico. 
“Those are all really focused. They have a strong factual basis. There is a short-term emergency,” Roberts said, noting the orders for Eddystone and Campbell point to future conditions in which there could be a shortfall. “Neither of these regions have an ongoing adequacy crisis.”
Demand for electricity is growing as a result of increased electrification of transportation and industry but primarily due to the proliferation of data centers housing computer equipment to run internet streaming services, cloud computing and power artificial intelligence. 
PJM predicts that its peak demand will grow by about 70,000 megawatts to 220,000 megawatts by 2040. 
New generating capacity has been slow to come online because of a backlog of new projects waiting for PJM approval to connect to the grid.

As a result, PJM has negotiated its own deals with power plant operators to keep older plants online to meet capacity demands. In January it reached an agreement with Talen Energy to operate two Maryland oil- and natural gas-fired plants past their retirement dates. 
Gordon, of Advanced Energy United, said on-demand generation saved the day during heatwaves this summer. Gleason, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance, said coal fired generation more than doubled from 14.5 gigawatts to 31 gigawatts.
From the industry’s perspective, Gordon said, the concern about future capacity is a problem of PJM’s own making.
“PJM has just utterly failed in this process to get new projects online,” Gordon said.
The queue for new projects has been closed since 2022. While FERC has ordered PJM to make changes to make the process faster and more transparent, nearly 9,300 requests are pending, mostly for renewable energy sources, according to the utility information tracking website interconnection.fyi.
Electricity customers in PJM’s territory saw their electric bills spike this summer as a result of the tightening market. Gov. Josh Shapiro filed a complaint with FERC late last year claiming the higher costs were unjustified because new projects would not come online in time to meet the demand. It resulted in a settlement that capped the rate for this past summer’s auction, but prices still jumped nearly 22%.
Gordon said that’s a clear economic signal for producers to build new power plants, solar and wind farms and battery storage facilities. But the Trump administration’s energy policy, including a permitting freeze, elimination of tax credits and stop-work orders for wind projects, is getting in the way, he said.
“You have this administration striking down wind to keep these plants running,” Gordon said, “which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_9533-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 05:59:39.720032

(Getty Images)Poverty is down in Kentucky, new federal data shows, though the percent of Kentuckians living in poverty exceeds the national rate and the state is the nation’s 46th poorest.
The American Community Survey (ACS), released by the United States Census Bureau last week, shows 15.6% of Kentuckians lived in poverty last year, more than the 10.6% rate in the United States. That’s an improvement from 2023, when 16.4% of Kentuckians lived in poverty. 
Child poverty levels are at 19%, down from 22% four years ago. Kentuckians also made more money in 2024 than in 2023. The state’s median household income was $64,526. That lags national median income by about $16,000 but is up from $61,118 in 2023.
Within Kentucky, disparities persist across racial groups and regions. Median income for Kentucky’s Black households was $47,881 in 2024, compared with $66,749 for white households. The poverty rate for people in Eastern Kentucky’s 5th Congressional District was 24.3% in 2024, compared to 15.6% for the state as a whole, reports the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy.
Matthew H. Ruther
While incomes have risen so have costs, especially for housing. Matthew H. Ruther, the director of the Kentucky State Data Center and a University of Louisville professor, said housing costs “have been increasing faster than other elements of other typical expenditures, and they’re a huge part of — particularly poor — families’ budgets.” 
The median gross rent in Kentucky was around $998, lower than the national average of just under $1,500.
And though senior citizens (65 and older) are the least likely group to live in poverty, Ruther said, the data shows poverty levels in this age group in Kentucky increased in recent years from 12% to 13%. 
Patience Martin, a state policy fellow for the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the “slight progress” on several data points is “obviously, not sufficient enough.” The positive changes in 2024 were likely due to specific post-pandemic shifts, Martin said. 
“The economy had become strong due to all of the COVID-19 stimulus funds, and there were a lot of federal job-creating investments specifically in things like infrastructure and clean energy,” she told the Lantern. “So that … unique boom in spending in the economy in 2024 did kind of pave the way for these improvements to be made.”

Recent federal changes made by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and Gov. Andy Beshear’s recent forecast that tax revenues could fall short of budgeted expectations in this fiscal year raise concerns that these American Community Survey numbers could worsen in the future, she said. 
“We are certain that these new policies will present new hardships and undermine what progress we have made as a state,” Martin said. 
Ruther shares some concern, saying the law is “not going to be good for lower income individuals.” 
Meanwhile, education levels for Kentuckians lag behind the nation, which is “certainly related” to income levels, Ruther said. In 2024, the American Community Survey shows, about 28% of Kentuckians had at least a bachelor’s degree, compared with 37% across the country.

Dan McKee, left, and his 2026 Democratic primary rival Helena Bounanno Foulkes, right, are already bickering over Rhode Island's opioid crisis. (Left photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current; right photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)It didn’t take long. 
On the same day Helena Foulkes launched her second gubernatorial run, Gov. Dan McKee’s campaign team released a 60-second digital ad titled “She Knew.” The ad accused CVS of fueling the opioid crisis during Foulkes’ tenure as president of the pharmacy division, and it strongly implied that Foulkes had specifically profited from this. 
“Not all drug deals look alike” the ad’s narrator says, as images of powders, pills, and cash flash onscreen. The ad echoed a line of attack from McKee and Foulke’s first Democratic-primary showdown in 2022.
In response, Foulkes told WPRI’s Ted Nesi that, on her watch, CVS pharmacy reduced its dispensing of opioids by almost 40%, and specifically stopped filling scripts for 600 “pill mill docs.” She said the pharmacy completed a massive drug take-back campaign and partnered with other drugstores to pursue legislation to reduce the number of pills patients received after minor surgery.  And as for McKee’s not-so-subtle suggestion that she was a drug dealer?
 “I think the governor is either attacking our biggest companies or losing our biggest companies,” Foulkes said. “And this is what you do when you’re a desperate man and you know you haven’t done anything for the people of Rhode Island.”   
There it was: The 2026 governor’s race was only hours old, and the conversation had already turned to opioids.
As both a longtime reporter on Rhode Island politics, and the author of a nonfiction book about the opioid epidemic — specifically, a “pill mill doc” of the kind Foulkes referenced in her Nesi interview — I watched this uneasily. 
The scale of the opioid crisis is staggering: according to the CDC, more than 800,000 people died from an opioid overdose between 1999 and 2023.  The amount of pain and grief caused by this problem defies comprehension. It’s a subject that ought to be approached with tact, care, and precision. I worry that in the coming months we’ll see it reduced to mere point-scoring political fodder. 
They didn’t ask me, but I have some advice for what the candidates — and the rest of Rhode Island — should keep in mind as we embark on a bitterly fought campaign where overdoses are a key issue.










The 2026 governor’s race was only hours old, and the conversation had already turned to opioids.


None of what follows is an attempt to shield Foulkes from scrutiny over her record at the helm of CVS Pharmacy. CVS, like Walgreens, has agreed to pay billions to settle lawsuits over its role in the opioid epidemic. More recently, the Department of Justice sued CVS for what it described as years of knowingly filling illegitimate prescriptions. That lawsuit, which covers activity beginning in 2013, includes the four years Foulkes was at the helm of CVS pharmacy, from 2014 to 2018. It’s entirely fair to ask Foulkes about this and let her answer those questions.
But this is a public health crisis that can be influenced by the things our leaders say and the policies they enact. So here are a few points for the candidates to keep in mind as ever-larger audiences tune in to what they’re saying.
1. The human toll should be centered in any conversation about overdoses. People who struggle with substance use are discriminated against while they’re alive, and then treated as lifeless statistics after death. It’s a cliche at this point to note that every person who dies from an overdose was someone’s child, someone’s sibling, someone’s parent, someone’s friend. But it’s necessary because of the pernicious stigma they face. Like thousands of people in Rhode Island, I know someone in the state who died from an overdose. I have seen the agony etched on their family members’ faces at the funeral service. And I know the unceasing pain that those folks still carry. To McKee and Foulkes, I’d ask, “Are you speaking in a way that honors this pain or cheapens it?” They would be wise to discuss drug use as if they’re in the presence of someone who’s grieving a loved one’s overdose or actively battling substance use themselves. 
2. This crisis is ongoing. In 2024, the last year for which we have complete data, 329 Rhode Islanders died from overdoses. And you only have to go back to 2023 to see that rate surpass an average of one death per day.  That’s not to say this is the same crisis of 2005 or 2010 or 2015 or 2020. As the CDC notes, what began as a pill problem became a heroin problem, then became a fentanyl problem. In recent years, researchers have written that a problem once dubbed the opioid epidemic is now “a polysubstance-overdose death crisis.” Accurate communication about life-and-death matters of public health is important for a governor. When speaking about overdoses, they should communicate that this isn’t over and it isn’t the same problem it was a decade ago.
3. Political punch-throwing about overdoses does little to stop them. It wastes precious air time that could be used to actually combat the issue. Clearly, McKee and Foulkes both have points they want to make; I’m not going to suggest they stop talking about it. But whenever possible, they should focus on messaging that’s in the public interest, not just their own. Public health advocates could only dream of the kind of airtime that McKee and Foulkes will have in the coming months. So the candidates could use it to remind Rhode Islanders that Substance Use Disorder is an illness, not a moral failure, and that folks affected by this problem deserve dignity and compassion. They could point people to the wonderful Prevent Overdose RI website. They could call for wider access to life-saving harm reduction tools, like naloxone, fentanyl test strips, and sterile needles. They could urge more cities and towns to open Overdose Prevention Centers like the groundbreaking one that launched last year in Providence. They could discuss the ways they’ll make it easier for any Rhode Islander, in any financial situation, to access treatment.
One of the only potential benefits of the politicization of overdoses is if it sparks a competition for the most aggressive plan to address them.
Now, I’m not naive. I don’t foresee McKee and Foulkes avoiding the subjects of opioids and overdoses any time soon. But how they discuss this issue matters. 
It is, in fact, its own test of leadership.

Richardson, who served as president of Morgan State University during a period of rapid growth and advancement, from 1984 to 2010, died Sept. 13, 2025, the university announced. ()Photo courtesy Morgan State University)Earl S. Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who helped organize a 2006 lawsuit against the state of Maryland for providing more resources to predominantly white institutions that ended in a $577 million settlement, died at the age of 81.
The school released a statement Saturday about the death of Richardson, who served as president from November 1984 to June 2010. A school spokesman said in an email that after he stepped down as president, Richardson remained at the institution for several years and taught a graduate-level course, when he held the title president emeritus.
“Dr. Richardson’s commitment to excellence and his ability to inspire confidence restored faith in the University at a time when its future was uncertain,” said Morgan State President David K. Wilson in a statement. “He leaves behind a legacy of perseverance, innovation, and an unshakable belief in the transformative power of education.
“On a personal note, I am deeply humbled to have followed in the presidency after Dr. Richardson’s tenure,” Wilson said. “The foundation he built allowed us to continue Morgan’s upward trajectory, and much of what we have achieved in recent years is possible because of the strong platform he left behind.”
Richardson was the force behind the 15-year legal fight that got settled in 2021 when the state agreed to direct $577 million over the next decade to Morgan and the state’s other three Historically Black Colleges and Universities – Bowie State and Coppin universities and the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore.
The suit claimed the state provided more resources to predominantly white institutions and allowed them to duplicate programs already offered at the four Black schools.

Because Richardson a state employee, as president of Morgan, he couldn’t sue the school. So a group of HBCU alumni and supporters became plaintiffs in the suit and formed the Coalition for Equity and Excellence in Maryland Higher Education Inc.
In addition, a group known as the Maryland HBCU advocates also pushed publicly on the importance of those schools in the state.
Sharon Blake, a 1972 Morgan State alumna and member of the HBCU advocacy group, said Richardson’s “history, vision and passion” served as the catalyst for why the settlement happened and helped all HBCUs nationwide. In addition, she said he understood those schools after graduating from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. When he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in social science in 1965, the school was called Maryland State College.
“I remember when we talked about starting the advocacy piece, I said to Dr. Richardson, ‘If you’re serious about moving forward on this public piece, I’m going to go down with the ship,’” Blake said in an interview Saturday. “We saw the love and the passion that Dr. Richardson had. [His death] is a tremendous loss for our society and Morgan State University.”
Several people posted messages on social media including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and Gov. Wes Moore (D), who called Richardson “a pillar of Maryland and the Morgan State University community.”
Le Shaun Quander-Mosley, also a member of the Maryland HBCU advocacy group, said the work to fight for those schools continues.
Two years after the settlement, Wilson and other HBCU advocates accused Towson University of creating and duplicating a business analytics doctoral program that was similar a business administration doctoral program at Morgan. Towson eventually withdrew its proposal.
Last year, the General Assembly approved legislation that revised the program-approval progress when higher education officials want to establish new programs at state universities. Part of that included the Maryland Higher Education Commission approving bylaws for a 21-member Program Review Process Advisory Council to make sure processes are “practical, efficient, and transparent.”

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Sanders’ quest to build a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County has been so beset with shifting explanations, tactical missteps and public relations blunders that it’s hard to imagine administration officials could do anything to make matters worse.
Until they did.
In a decision both mystifying and arrogant in equal measure, the governor’s office decided not to send any of her senior staff to defend the prison project at a hearing held last week by the legislature’s Joint Performance Review Committee — including Joe Profiri, the prison guru Sanders brought from Arizona as her first corrections secretary and who parachuted into a role as senior adviser in her office when he was fired by the Board of Corrections.
After opponents of the Franklin County prison spent more than an hour offering a detailed and devastating critique of the prison site selection process, two lower-level Sanders administration officials were sent to twist in the wind, at times struggling to answer questions they said were “not in our lane” or “not our role” and occasionally making admissions that were less than helpful to the governor’s cause.
Profiri was not just a no-show; the governor’s office didn’t even respond to lawmakers’ invitation for him to testify, according to the committee’s co-chair, Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron, who tried unsuccessfully to get his colleagues to issue a subpoena: “I think it is a slap at this body not to even answer us and say he cannot be here.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, at a hearing on the Franklin County prison on Sept. 9, 2025. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)
Noting that he had seen Profiri in the Capitol earlier in the day, prison critic Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, was even more biting: “It looks like we’ve got a better chance to get Jeffrey Epstein here to talk about child sex trafficking than we do Mr. Profiri, who’s paid almost a quarter million dollars a year in salary and benefits.” (Profiri’s salary is $189,210.94, according to the state’s transparency website.)

Clearly perturbed, Rep. Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, suggested that “we need to let them know over there [in the governor’s office] … that he is either going to come over here, or we’re going to take his pay away.”
Profiri’s murky role in the Franklin County prison was highlighted later in the hearing when two Board of Corrections members who voted to fire him — Benny Magness and Lee Watson — testified that he had stopped communicating with them, although administration staffers working the project appear to be relying on information he provided.
“We don’t give [Profiri] anything to do,” Watson said. “We have almost no communication with him and have had no communication.”
Whoever made the tactical mistake to have Profiri skip the hearing ensured that news coverage would focus on his absence. For Sanders, it was a lost opportunity to defend the centerpiece of her incarceration-forward criminal justice strategy and try to quiet rising skepticism among legislators.
“I’m trying to figure out a way to vote for the appropriation, and all I do is get further and further and further away,” said Sen. Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, after he tried and failed to get a cost estimate for water infrastructure upgrades required for the site.

Watson and Magness also pointed out the irony that the governor’s inability to move the project forward — because of a controversy of her own making that she’s making worse — is getting in the way of her stated goal of increasing prison beds to alleviate a backlog of state prisoners in county jails.
Indeed, administration officials admitted at the hearing that no effort is currently being made to find an alternate site, calling into question whether any new prison will be up and running before Sanders leaves office.
The two administration officials who testified at the hearing — Anne Laidlaw, director of the Division of Building Authority, and Shelby Johnson, a geographer who heads the geographic information services office — did not take the opportunity to present a detailed response to the presentation by prison opponents, but they did answer legislators’ questions.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)
While both were involved in the site selection process, they were clearly less equipped to speak to details that went beyond their narrow remit, as Profiri presumably would have been. And Laidlaw and Johnson continued to insist, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary, that the Franklin County site is viable and the process used to select it was sound.
At times, that required suppression of incredulity.
Johnson told Wooten the Franklin County location met the site selection criteria for water infrastructure because an 8-inch water pipeline nearby could be extended to the site, based on information from the Arkansas Department of Health. But he conceded that he didn’t know if Fort Smith or Ozark had enough water to put in the main (both have said they don’t), and that wells on the property were drilled after it was selected as the prison site.
“It wasn’t my role to approve the site. We were making a recommendation for the site,” Johnson said.
Making their argument against the prison, Gravel & Grit founders Adam Watson and Natalie Cadena from the Franklin County and River Valley Coalition pointed out that the chosen site did not meet many of the criteria set out before the search began. That prompted Johnson to explain that those criteria were merely a tool to narrow the search and did not necessarily preclude sites that didn’t meet them.
Watson also accused administration officials of “watering down” the criteria to fit the parcel of land they decided to purchase, which he said was “the opposite of due diligence.” Laidlaw and Johnson insisted they were not pressured by anyone to try to make the site work.
But just as they couldn’t speak to macro-level details about the prison project, they also can’t speak to what pressure might have been applied higher up the food chain. Indeed, the assertion that the site selection wasn’t being reverse engineered would have been more credible had it come from Profiri or perhaps one of Sanders’ cabinet secretaries.
During her testimony, Laidlaw also mentioned working with the Department of Corrections in planning the project, which drew this rather pointed clarification from Magness: “When she said she was talking to DOC, I can only assume that she was talking to [Profiri] because he wasn’t including us in all those conversations or those decisions.”
Rice said he and his committee co-chair, Rep. Bruce Cozart, R-Hot Springs, called the hearing for the sake of “transparency,” after opponents of the prison submitted a formal complaint with more than 1,200 signatures, reflecting the level of concern in Franklin County.
By not taking the hearing seriously or sending officials equipped to answer legitimate issues raised by the well-sourced, factual presentation from opponents, the Sanders administration once again showed its disregard for both public sentiment and legislators who dare to ask impertinent questions.
Meanwhile, nearly a year had gone by since the governor sprang her prison site on the unsuspecting residents of Franklin County, and she’s no closer to turning the first shovel of dirt.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Louisville Metro Government created an Office of Inspector General in 2021 in response to a number of high-profile breaches of public trust committed by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD). 
The tragic police shooting of Breonna Taylor in March of 2020 laid bare the need for widespread reforms and for better oversight from outside the police department. The goal of an inspector general’s office is to help restore community faith in policing and ensure shared police accountability by offering an independent review of alleged wrongdoings by police officers.
Ed Harness, a seasoned attorney and former Milwaukee police officer who spent six years building Albuquerque’s civilian oversight system, was chosen in late 2021 to lead that office. His appointment was grounded in a blend of law enforcement experience, legal acumen, dedication to reform and an ability to communicate across differences.
Since then, Harness has brought real momentum to the fight for accountability. His office conducts independent investigations in response to citizen complaints about LMPD. These inquiries are timely, whereas LMPD’s internal reviews have routinely dragged on well past the police union’s own contract deadline of 180 days, sometimes taking years. 
Soon the Metro Council and mayor will decide whether to reappoint Ed Harness.
Harness is the right person for a second term as inspector general. He has navigated a difficult role with fairness and integrity, and in doing so he has amassed a great deal of valuable local institutional knowledge. He has worked consistently with diligence and professionalism to bring about community reform under three police chiefs and two mayors.
He has a track record of standing up for justice and reform even if it places him at odds with the chief of LMPD and the Fraternal Order of Police. When Harness took on this role, the Louisville Metro Police Department was far from welcoming. Initially, it took Harness months of pushing just to gain access to basic resources like body camera footage and internal documents. But by 2023, Harness described the year as “positive” for accountability, thanks to improved relations with police leaders and expanded access to records.
The Civilian Review & Accountability Board, which oversees the work of the inspector general’s office and works most closely with Harness, strongly supports his reappointment. They are joined by leading community organizations — including the People’s Consent Decree Coalition, Louisville NAACP, Louisville Urban League and Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression — in calling for his continued leadership.
Harness approaches his role with a deep respect for the work of oversight and a belief that lasting reform is only possible through collaboration. His work is grounded in building partnerships — with LMPD, the Civilian Review & Accountability Board and the broader community — to ensure that change is both practical and enduring. Harness’recent publication of  Detectives Best Practices Study is an example of how this collaborative approach can lead to research-driven recommendations that improve policing and strengthen public safety.
Yet the path to reform has been anything but smooth. After Breonna Taylor’s senseless death, the Department of Justice’s 2023 investigation exposed multiple patterns of unconstitutional policing that included excessive force, discriminatory enforcement and use of invalid warrants. Negotiations on a federal consent decree that would mandate specific reforms assessed by an independent monitor dragged on until December 2024 — only for the new Trump administration to dismiss it.
Mayor Craig Greenberg responded by introducing a local “Community Commitment” that included most but not all key elements of the federal consent decree. Most notably missing was robust community input.
Our community stands at a crossroads in its police reform efforts.
As the city pivots to the “Community Commitment” model, maintaining steady leadership continuity is essential.
Replacing Harness holds no guarantee of better results and could derail progress. It risks undermining the progress and momentum his office has built, as well as damaging community trust at a crucial time.
We call on Mayor Greenberg and Metro Council to renew Ed Harness’ appointment to ensure the city remains committed to transparency, justice and a police force that earns our confidence — one that makes us all feel safe. 
Losing Ed Harness risks a return to the broken system that led to tragedy.

(Photo by Capital News Service)Thomas King is used to cycling around Richmond. The Church Hill resident often rides on weekends and he also commutes by bike to his office a few miles away. He knows the best routes to take, what supplies to bring – such as spare tires – and now, he knows how to report almost-accidents on PlanRVA’s Near Miss Dashboard. 
On a recent Sunday after a ride near the University of Richmond, King almost collided with a driver. He was heading downhill on River Road going about 20 miles per hour. He was about to turn left back onto campus, when a driver also began to turn left out of the university.
“I had my arm out for like 200 yards, signaling that I was turning left into U of R Drive,” King said. “And as I was turning left, this guy starts turning into my body as I’m going.”
King said he either would have to go wide, which would make him go off the road and launch himself into the bushes.
“Or I hold the turn and pray that this guy doesn’t swipe my back wheel out and splatter me down the hillside,” he said. “I looked behind me as he did it and he missed my back wheel by less than six inches.”
However, that wasn’t King’s only near miss that day. In Westover Hills a driver made an illegal left turn to try to cut through a CVS parking lot.

“He just turned straight into me,” King said. “I had to launch my bike over to the side [to] not fall over. I was just like, ‘man, what is going on today? It’s like two near misses in one day.’”
Those two incidents led King to submit a report on PlanRVA’s Near Miss Dashboard. It’s the third time he’s logged his close calls in the new tool. 
PlanRVA’s goal is for the data they collect from their Near Miss map to be used to create safer streets for all users, according to Elizabeth Greenwell, a data analyst at PlanRVA who helped create the map. 
“A near miss is any event that does not result in an injury, but could have,” she said. “So for transportation planning, what we’re really looking at is those events that are unreported to the police. Something nearly happened or could have happened, but didn’t.”
Greenwell said the dashboard is a public engagement tool for safety in the region to crowdsource those “Near Miss” events, and particularly for bike and pedestrian transportation.
“A major thing that we want to come out of it is (to) take the data and provide our localities with information from the dashboard in a short report that would give them some hotspots of activity,” said Greenwell. “Maybe some analysis about what types of events are going on. Do they happen at crossings or what speeds are posted?”
PlanRVA’s map is still new in terms of the amount of data they’ve collected, said Greenwall, so they’re not quite ready to post any concrete findings just yet.
“Right now we have 184 responses, which feels like a lot considering it went live in March,” she said. “But I think we could get a lot more before we start getting into analysis with the data.”
Although it’s still relatively early in their data collection, they are already seeing some trends.
“These are extremely initial results, but a big thing is poor sightlines and poor visibility,” said Greenwell. “People don’t feel seen and that limits how safe they feel in a space. So that’s an interesting early takeaway.”
 How it works

PlanRVA’s digital map includes nine localities in the Central Virginia region, from Hanover County and the Town of Ashland to New Kent and Charles City and everything in between. Once you’re on the map, you can zoom into exact street locations and drop a pin — that’s when the survey window pops up. 
“It’s going to ask you, ‘how are you traveling? Were you walking, biking, wheelchair, on a scooter, micromobility device, e-bike?’” said Greenwell. “Was it a near miss, a collision or did you witness this?”
PlanRVA’s mapping tool is based on similar near miss dashboards, such as BikeMaps and the Northern Virginia Families For Safe Streets, which have been in existence much longer. BikeMaps started in 2014, while Families for Safe Streets in NOVA started in 2017. Both are able to parse out the data into chunks of statistics, such as  the highest number of near misses during certain hours of the day or which days are busiest for near misses. 
The Families for Safe Streets dashboard has had time to hone their data to make it useful for area officials, said Mike Doyle, founder and executive director of the Northern Virginia Families for Safe Streets. He started the non-profit after being released from the hospital after a car crashed into him while he was driving his car.
“In Alexandria we work well with the transportation people,” Doyle said. “They’ll ask us, what is your data saying on such and such a road, because they want to make a proposal. It helps support improvements that are all safety focused.”
Greenwell at PlanRVA said they are hoping to collect more data in the future. 
“We’re expanding our data storage so that we can start accumulating multiple years worth of data as it grows,” Greenwell said. “I’m working on the dashboard page to have a heat map, (and) better map pop-ups on the existing map so that users can see those comments about the events recorded as they interact with the map.”
Greenwell said they’d also like to be able to analyze both bike and pedestrian count data, which is something that BikeWalkRVA does every year, because it would give them a clearer picture of how risky some roads are and hopefully prevent people from using it until the infrastructure is improved. 
For now, residents like King can keep sharing their near misses as the dashboards get up to speed and help bolster public safety.
“You have these traumatic experiences and you’re the only one who’s experienced it and you want to do something a little bit more than just tell your friends this crazy thing happened,” King said. “You hope someone will do something about it.”

Most Virginia campaigns are won or lost on hot-button issues like taxes, education, reproductive rights, guns and gay marriage, so everyone who runs for office has a position on these questions. This holds true for candidates in this year’s high-stakes races for the state’s executive branch and all 100 House of Delegates seats. 
Inevitably, though, there are topics the average candidate doesn’t completely grasp. Some are narrow and – thankfully – nonpartisan. Where do you stand on Sunday hunting? Should I-81 have more lanes? How do you feel about skill games? Will you vote to save the menhaden, whatever a menhaden is? (It’s a fish, and I encourage you to say yes.)
Other topics affect the lives of every Virginian, but they are, frankly, complicated. One of these is energy. Not only is it hard to get up to speed on energy issues, but technology is changing so rapidly that keeping abreast of developments would be a full-time job. Who would spend that kind of time on such a dreary topic?
Uh, that would be me. 
So here we go: I’m going to cover five things political hopefuls need to know about energy in Virginia before you get to the General Assembly and start passing laws that affect your constituents’ wallets and futures. And for voters, these are things you should ask candidates about before they earn your vote. 
First up:
 If you are going to talk about energy, you have to talk about data centers

By now you surely know that Virginia has embraced the most energy-intensive industry to come along since the steam engine launched the Industrial Revolution. Northern Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, which already consume an estimated 25% of the state’s electricity, with massively more development planned. The reason isn’t vacation photos or Instagram cat videos; it’s the competition to develop artificial intelligence (AI).  
After putting tax incentives in place to attract the industry 15 years ago, the General Assembly and the current governor have rejected all attempts to put guardrails on development or make data centers more energy efficient. The subsidies now cost taxpayers a billion dollars per year (and counting). Virginia asks for almost nothing in return. 
Under the best of circumstances, the skyrocketing demand for electricity would put upward pressure on energy prices. But our situation is even worse: Virginia already imports about half our electricity from other states, and the regional grid that we’re part of faces its own energy crunch. 
Grid manager PJM has been so slow to approve new generation that governors from member states, including Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, wrote a letter taking PJM to task and urging it to move faster. But the damage has been done. Supply is tight, electricity prices have risen, and prices will continue to rise unless and until supply catches up.
PJM has decided to fast-track new high-cost, gas-fired generating plants ahead of the cheaper renewable energy projects that make up 95% of the queue. It’s a much-criticized move and seems more likely to increase costs. Once built, fossil gas plants burn a fuel that has doubled in price just over the past year, threatening a repeat of the post-pandemic price surge that Virginia ratepayers are still paying for. And there is no relief in sight, with utilities now having to compete with a doubling of U.S. natural gas exports.
Short of unleashing all the renewable energy stuck in the queue, there is no easy way to protect Virginia residents from higher electricity costs. Dominion Energy, Appalachian Power, and at least one of the electric cooperatives have proposed special rate classes for large-load customers, but that would shield residents from only some of the costs of serving the data centers. 
Utility bills are going up. Dominion Energy is seeking hefty rate increases that would push up residential bills by an average of more than $10 per month in base rates plus almost $11 per month in fuel costs, primarily due to those higher natural gas prices. Coal-heavy APCo has seen even steeper rate increases in the past few years.
Dominion proposes higher utility rates, new rate class for data centers

Virginia needs new legislation ensuring data centers bear the full expense and risks of serving Big Tech, and they should be required to source their own clean energy. Localities, meanwhile, must be required to evaluate the costs to all Virginians before they issue permits to data centers, including considerations like where the energy will come from, water impacts, and the siting of transmission lines.  
 You can’t get from here to there without solar

Virginia wasn’t producing all of its own energy even before the data center rush, and PJM’s problems are now pushing us into a crisis. Our near-term options are limited; new data centers are breaking ground at a breathtaking rate, and only solar can be installed on the timeline needed to prevent an energy shortfall. Even if we were willing to pay for high-priced gas or nuclear plants, developers face a backlog of as long as seven years for gas turbines, and advanced nuclear is still not commercially viable. 
Fortunately, solar is not just the fastest energy source to deploy, it’s also the cheapest and cleanest. Though President Donald Trump blames rising electricity prices on renewable energy, that’s false, just one of many myths the fossil fuel industry has propagated against solar. Nor is solar unreliable, another myth. When solar is paired with battery storage, it can match the rise and fall of demand perfectly.
The war on woke…energy?

It’s true, however, that while the great majority of Virginians support solar energy, many rural residents oppose it on aesthetic grounds. Of course, they would also oppose nuclear reactors and gas fracking in their neighborhoods. Legislators should  be sensitive to their concerns – but having chosen to welcome data centers, Virginia leaders can’t just shrug off the need for energy.
We also have to recognize that many farmers need to lease their land for solar in order to keep the land in their family and generate stable income. This should be as important a consideration to lawmakers as the objections of people who aren’t paying the taxes. Preventing landowners from making profitable use of their land is more likely to lead to the land being sold for development than to it remaining agricultural. 
The good news is that solar panels are compatible with agricultural uses including livestock grazing, beekeeping, vineyards and some crops. Dominion Energy uses sheep instead of lawnmowers at several of its solar facilities in Virginia and plans to expand the practice. The combination is a beautiful synergy: sheep and native grasses improve the soil, and in 30 years when the solar panels are removed, the land has not been lost to development.
While there is no getting around the need for utility-scale solar projects, rooftop solar also has an important role to play. In addition to harnessing private dollars to increase electricity generation, distributed solar saves money for customers and makes communities more resilient in the face of extreme weather.
This year the governor vetoed a bill to expand the role of distributed solar in Virginia. The legislation had garnered strong bipartisan support, so it will likely pass again next year. However, lawmakers will need to go further to encourage customer investments in solar now that federal tax credits will be eliminated for residential consumers at the end of this year.  
 Batteries: For all your reliability needs

The fastest-growing energy sector today is battery storage. Batteries allow utilities to meet peaks in demand without having to build gas combustion turbines that typically run less than 10% of the time. Batteries also pair perfectly with intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, storing their excess generation and then delivering electricity when these resources aren’t available.  
Battery prices have tumbled to new lows, while the technology continues to improve. Most lithium-ion batteries provide 4 hours of storage, enough to meet evening peak demand with midday solar. When renewable energy becomes a larger part of Virginia’s energy supply (it’s less than 10% now) we will need longer term storage, such as the iron-air batteries that are part of a Dominion pilot program. This year the governor vetoed a bill that would have increased the amount of storage our utilities must invest in. Given the increasing importance of batteries to the grid, the legislation will likely be reintroduced next year.
In Puerto Rico, customers are helping to keep the lights on. Could a Virginia program do the same?

Batteries installed at homes and businesses can also play a vital role in supporting the grid. Alone or combined with distributed solar, smart meters and electric vehicle charging, customer devices can be aggregated into a virtual power plant (VPP) to make more electricity available to the grid at peak demand times. Dominion will be developing a VPP pilot program under the terms of legislation passed this year. 
 Advanced nuclear is still in Maybeland

The enormous expense of building large nuclear plants using conventional light-water technology has made development almost nonexistent in this century. Proponents believe new technology will succeed with scaled-down plants that can, in theory, be standardized and modularized to lower costs. Many political and tech leaders hope these small modular reactors (SMRs) will prove a carbon-free solution to the data center energy problem. 
It’s hard not to think they’re kidding themselves, or maybe us. Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power plan to develop one SMR each, with Dominion shooting to have one in service in 2035. Not only is this too late to meet today’s energy crunch, but a single SMR would add less energy to the supply side than new data centers add to the demand side each year. Virginia still needs near-term solutions, which means solar and batteries. 
Industry enthusiasts believe the 2035 timeline can be shortened, while critics say SMRs may never reach commercial viability. SMRs have to be able to compete on cost with much cheaper renewable energy, including wind, solar and emerging geothermal technologies, and cost parity is a long way off. The economic case for nuclear reactors also requires that they generate power all the time, including when the demand isn’t there, so SMRs need batteries almost as much as renewable energy does.
Geothermal energy is having a moment. Could it power Virginia’s data centers?

Finally, radioactive waste remains a challenging issue, as much (or more) for SMRs as for legacy nuclear plants. The U.S. has never resolved the problem of permanent storage, so nuclear waste is simply kept onsite at generating stations. The risk of accidents or sabotage makes it unlikely that communities will accept SMRs in their midst, especially if the idea is for SMRs to proliferate on the premises of privately-owned data centers near residential areas statewide.  
A nuclear technology with less of a waste problem?  Fusion energy. A fusion start-up plans to build its first power plant in Virginia in the “early 2030s,” if the demonstration plant it is building in Massachusetts proves successful. While fusion would be an energy game-changer, there are so many uncertainties around timeline and cost that only an inveterate gambler would bet on it helping us out of our predicament. 
 Pretending climate change isn’t real won’t make it go away

We don’t have to talk about climate change to make the case for transitioning to carbon-free renewable energy, but global warming hovers in the background of any energy debate like an unwanted guest. If you need a primer or are even slightly tempted to say you “don’t know” whether human activity is responsible because you’re not a scientist, read the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s summary for policymakers. The continued habitability of the planet is too important for ignorance to be an acceptable dodge – and of course you, as a respectable candidate, would never stoop to such a thing.
Virginia codified its own action plan in 2020 with two major laws. One provides for the commonwealth to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a multistate compact that uses auctions of carbon emission allowances to incentivize a shift away from fossil fuels and raise money for energy efficiency and climate adaptation. After taking office in 2022,  Youngkin removed Virginia from RGGI – illegally, as a court ruled. Virginia remains outside RGGI while the appeals process continues. 
The second law is the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which creates a pathway for Dominion and APCo to transition to carbon-free electricity by 2050. The VCEA includes provisions requiring Dominion and APCo to invest in renewable energy, storage and energy efficiency and make renewable energy an increasing portion of their electricity supply. 
The VCEA contains special provisions for offshore wind, which I haven’t addressed here because  Trump is determined not to allow projects to move forward while he is in office. This is a shame, as there is bipartisan support in Virginia for this industry and the huge economic development opportunities that come with it. Still, Virginia’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project is 60% complete and will start delivering power next year. Eventually, hopefully, it will be remembered as the first of many.
The VCEA also prohibited new investments in fossil fuel plants except under certain conditions. Dominion is currently seeking permission from the State Corporation Commission to build a $1.5 billion, fossil gas-fired peaker plant, citing data center demand and a need for reliability. Local residents, environmental organizations and ratepayer advocates oppose the plant and filed expert testimony showing that solar, storage and other less expensive technologies would better serve consumers.
In what passes for a bombshell in the energy space, Dominion was forced to admit last month that it had not obtained an independent review of the bid process before selecting its own gas plant over resources offered by third-party bidders.
 “No regrets” solutions are progressive and conservative

As you’ve probably figured out by now, there is no perfect power source available today. And yet we would need new generation even if we stopped data center construction cold in its tracks – which isn’t in the plans. Solar is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest source of generation, allowing us to preserve land – and keep options open – for the future. If the data center boom goes bust, having surplus clean energy on the grid will let us eliminate dirty sources faster, while saving money. 
Who would run against that?

(Photo by Allegra Boverman/New Hampshire Bulletin)Maria Khan spent much of this year terrified as she watched Congress debate whether to cut funding for federal food assistance and other programs she relies on.
“It severely affected my mental health,” she said. “I was getting really bad. I had to get off social media. I’ve had to stop looking into it because I couldn’t function. I was just living in fear, and I was finding that I was really having a hard time parenting and functioning for myself.”
In July, her fears were realized when President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law. The behemoth legislation touches nearly every segment of the federal government and makes severe cuts to Medicaid and other social programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP or food stamps, that Khan uses to feed her family.
The SNAP changes, many of which go into effect as soon as states can implement them while others will be implemented as late as 2028, are expected to cause roughly 44,000 families in New Hampshire — and 22.3 million nationwide — to lose some or all of their benefits, according to analysis from the Urban Institute. However, many economists and hunger experts say the consequences will be much more far-reaching, straining food banks and other social services, hitting the bottom line of farmers and grocery stores and municipalities.
The new law restricts what factors will be taken into account when deciding how much help a family receives. And it caps future increases to SNAP at the rate of inflation. It also makes work requirements stricter and bans many legal migrants from the program.
Will the state pick up the slack?
Laura Milliken is executive director at NH Hunger Solutions, an advocacy group working to address hunger in the state. She vehemently opposes the law.
“Increasing the burden on the lowest income folks to benefit the highest income folks seems like an incredibly unjust thing to do,” Milliken said. “And I am very worried about people in New Hampshire who are already struggling to make ends meet.”
The new law passes off much of the program’s administrative cost to state governments, and Milliken said she hopes New Hampshire can come up with the additional nearly $6 million it will need. She acknowledges that “would be incredibly hard.” The state already pays $11 million to administer the program. And starting in 2027, the state will have to cover some of the food costs which are currently federally funded.

Asked whether she would support the state appropriating money to do so, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte told the Bulletin she’s evaluating it.
“We’re evaluating how can we make sure we can serve as many people as possible and people who are being served now with the resources we have,” she said. “And also, I’m going to continue to fight for as many federal resources as I can when it comes to SNAP and other programs.”
Ayotte said she disagreed with the SNAP reductions, adding “I think SNAP is a really important program.”
But it’s unclear if the state can afford to absorb the costs. It’s coming off a difficult budget cycle characterized by heavy infighting. Lawmakers crafting a state spending plan this year made significant cuts to agencies across state government to deal with months of lagging business tax revenues, the end of pandemic-era federal funds, and millions of dollars in settlements for victims of abuse in the state’s juvenile detention system. 
Drew Cline, executive director at the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a New Hampshire conservative think tank, said the state should’ve seen this coming.
Cline argued New Hampshire “has relied for far too long on these pretty high federal expenditures on these programs, and it was becoming increasingly clear as the deficits started to really grow in recent years that the federal government simply wasn’t going to be able to maintain its commitment to these programs.”
Cline argued it’s also important to consider the increases in SNAP spending over the past few decades. Adjusted for inflation, SNAP spending rose from roughly $31.3 billion in 2000 to $97.9 billion in 2010 and $100.3 billion in 2024, according to Food and Nutrition Service data compiled by USAFacts. He argued this was unsustainable.
“There’s just no way we should be borrowing and spending as much as we do without some sort of catastrophic economic crisis,” he said.
The spending cuts in the law were designed to make space in the budget to extend a series of tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term. The tax cuts have been lambasted by those who point out that they disproportionately benefit the wealthy and are expected to add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Cline said the tax cuts will bring economic growth to the state. As for the top 1% of New Hampshire households receiving 16% of the tax savings, according to analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, he said it isn’t an issue because “the rich are the ones who pay the vast majority of income taxes.”

Hunger in New Hampshire
Khan, 39, lives in Portsmouth with her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son. She lost her job as a software engineer for Liberty Mutual during a mass layoff last year. Since then, she has been doing gig work with Door Dash, but still struggles to find the money to feed her family amid skyrocketing grocery costs. She’s hoping to go back to school in an effort to get a job that pays more.
She enrolled in SNAP last winter. Until recently, she received $440 in food benefits, but a few months ago her benefits increased to $550. She also receives help from Gather, a food pantry in Portsmouth, and her ex-husband contributes child support, she said.
“Even that is not enough,” Khan said. “Cereal is like six or seven bucks now. It’s not enough. So to cut that is going to be — I don’t even know what we’re going to do.”
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which tracks U.S. grocery prices, a “low-cost plan” for feeding one 9- to 11-year-old child a healthy diet is $261.50 a month and for an adult woman (19-50 years old) it’s $259 a month. A “liberal plan” would cost $390 for a 9- to 11-year-old and $383.40 for an adult woman. Khan is feeding two children and herself.
Food pantries worry they’ll struggle to keep up with increased demand as benefits are reduced.

Cynthia Tokos, director of parish life at Christ the King Parish in Concord, said in an email to the Bulletin that the food pantry the parish operates doesn’t ask those they help for information about what benefits they receive. However, volunteers tell her they hear “generic comments about ‘my benefits were cut’ or ‘income guidelines were changed, so I’m getting less help with food.’”
The cuts from the massive tax and spending cut law haven’t taken effect yet, but enrollees and food pantries have felt cuts previously. In March 2023, increased SNAP benefits instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic expired, resulting in New Hampshire SNAP recipients losing a total of nearly $7 million in benefits per month, according to the Food Research and Action Center.
“Sometimes we see new clients because they are now struggling to make ends meet due to cuts in aid, where they had previously been getting by,” Tokos said. “It might not be 100% related to SNAP — we’re not always sure what aid people are receiving; however, it’s a linear relationship — when food benefits are cut, more help/support from food pantries and other food sources is needed.”
She said volunteers also hear people talking about food they’re no longer buying because of higher costs and “constant conversations about the increase in price of most food items at the grocery store, and through these conversations it is clear that our clients are working hard to stretch every food dollar.”

Ripple effects through the economy
Many economists view SNAP as a strong economic driver. They point out it’s a direct infusion into local economies as enrollees spend their benefits at local grocery stores that in turn hire local employees. And it also frees up other resources needed to pay for housing, medicine, or clothing. In a 2021 study evaluating “bangs-for-the-buck,” Moody’s Analytics determined SNAP is one of the most effective programs at growing the economy, particularly because it grows when the economy recedes. 
“SNAP is particularly effective economic stimulus because it provides resources to households that do not have very much to begin with, and those individuals and families spend them quickly and directly in their local economies,” Phil Sletten, an economist and research director at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, wrote in an email to the Bulletin. 
“Dollars spent on SNAP support jobs at community grocery stores and provide supports to families that may otherwise go without food, hurting their abilities to be healthy and participate in the economy in other ways, such as working,” he continued. “Less federal money flowing to New Hampshire through SNAP, and the Granite Staters that benefit from it, could reduce economic activity in the state, including in rural areas.”
Research from the Center for American Progress found that the SNAP cuts are likely to harm more than 27,000 retailers across the U.S. In New Hampshire, there are 1,053 SNAP retailers, according to that research.
Those grocery stores source many of their goods from American farms. The bill that created the modern SNAP program, by reauthorizing and renaming the food stamps program in existence since the 1930s, was the 2008 Farm Bill. Lawmakers envisioned it as a boost to agricultural sales.

Beth Hodge, who co-owns Echo Farm with her sister, said she’s concerned low-income customers will be forced to cut back on dairy products at the grocery store, reducing demand across the industry.
“Then there’s the other piece of knowing that people in your own community, in your own state, are going to be impacted by that,” Hodge said. “We want to feed people. You don’t go into this business if you don’t want to feed people.”
Echo Farms has around 120 cows on 35 acres. It provides roughly 80% of the milk it produces to a Cabot Cheese plant in neighboring Vermont. The remainder is used in a pudding made in-house.
The USDA doesn’t track how SNAP benefits are used, making data hard to compile. However, Hoard’s Dairyman, a national dairy trade publication, reports that 35% of dairy products are sold at retail, and SNAP benefits account for 8.6% of that retail spending.
Hodge noted that dairy is a product distributed more locally than others. Because of this, dairy farms are “really tied to the economy.” She called dairy “the linchpin to the agriculture in the state.”
“In the Northeast and New England, New Hampshire in particular, the one local food that’s really consistent yearround, that’s consistent in most households, in schools, is dairy,” she said. “We’re not going to grow oranges in New Hampshire. It’s just not possible. We’re always going to be bringing that in from another part of the country. Dairy is something that we can produce really well. … It’s something that typically stays local. So if you’re consuming dairy products, if you’re buying milk from Hood, it’s not coming from California. It’s going to come from dairies that are close by the plant.”
Hodge acknowledged the bill, which is nearly 900 pages, does include provisions that help dairy farmers, including one that increases the amount of milk that can be covered by farm insurance at special reduced rates. She also noted that other unrelated factors make it a good time to be a dairy farmer in the Northeast, like new Chobani yogurt and Fairlife milk plants breaking ground in Upstate New York that are expected to increase demand across the region.
“Then you start hearing those other new things, and it starts to dampen that sort of enthusiasm,” she said.
To Hodge, farming is sentimental and something intrinsically tied to the community. She and her sister got into farming after raising cattle in 4-H when they were young. They’re proud to say that over 90 local teenagers worked their first job at Echo Farm. They see feeding communities as the core of what they do.
“The thought that somebody is food insecure or somebody has trouble getting a meal is something that farmers feel deeply,” Hodge said.
Hits to property taxes
Somersworth Mayor Matt Gerding said his first thought after hearing about the cuts was, ‘What are some of the folks that live here in Somersworth going to do?’”
“It feels like what Congress and the president were doing was targeting communities like us,” he said. “And it’s scary.”
Matt Gerding
Gerding said he’s heard from lots of concerned residents and he’s spoken with the Somersworth Housing Authority about how this will hurt low-income people’s ability to pay rent, as well leaders in the school system about how they want to push to get people enrolled in free-and-reduced lunch. (Being on SNAP automatically enrolls students for free-and-reduced school lunches.) 
He’s also concerned about the city’s Welfare and Human Services Office being further burdened, and about a hit to the city’s property tax revenues.
“I think what I’m most nervous about is that, because these tax bills come only twice a year, these families are going to have to be making decisions about where they’re spending their money,” Gerding said. “And I think, and I certainly can’t blame them, that the annual tax bill might be at the bottom of the list of the things that they want to pay for.
“Taxes are the least of their worries when they have mouths to feed,” he said.
Other programs cut
The law also requires that enrollees work 80 hours a month or lose Medicaid coverage despite research that suggests work requirements for SNAP, Medicaid, and other social programs don’t increase employment, but often strip benefits from eligible people due to the burdensome bureaucracy needed to administer work requirements. In SNAP specifically, the requirements resulted in a 23-percentage-point increase in disenrollment and kicked 64% of people subject to the requirements who are actually eligible off the program.
Khan, who also relies on Medicaid for her Type 2 diabetes medication and doctors’ visits, said she can’t afford the skyrocketing price of child care in New Hampshire, which makes it hard for her to work during summer or outside of school hours. On top of that, her rent is set to increase to $2,300 in September.
Asked about her worst fears, Khan said “lack of food, lack of housing, lack of medical care.”
“Am I going to be healthy enough to take care of my children, being a single mom with no family,” she continued. “What is that going to look like for my family? It is a very scary situation, and my kids rely on myself to have food on the table.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/snap2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 05:59:39.720032

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The State Library of Ohio is one of many libraries across the country awaiting legal battles over federal funding and congressional debates as to how much they’ll receive next year.
The library receives state funding, but in the past has received support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which serves as the federal bucket of funding for libraries and museums across the country.
Lawsuits
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order seeking to eliminate funding to the institute as part of slashing of funds in partnership with the Department of Government Efficiency, a non-governmental agency then run by Elon Musk. He attempted to eliminate the institute, among other arts and humanities cuts, in his previous administration as well.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe American Library Association is part of a lawsuit attempting stop that executive order. The association said in their initial complaint that following the March order, the institute was “gutted” by DOGE. Staff were placed on administrative leave, and grants were canceled, all without congressional approval.
“Without grant funding or IMLS staff to process reimbursements, local and state libraries will suffer an immediate and irreparable inability to pay vendors or staff hired in reliance on IMLS’ promise to make these reimbursements,” attorneys for the ALA stated.
In May, the district court judge in the case granted a temporary pause in enforcement of the order “to preserve the status quo” as the case continued. However, in June, the judge denied a motion for a further pause to the executive order.
“While the court laments the executive branch’s efforts to cut off this lifeline for libraries and museums, plaintiffs have not established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,” Judge Richard J. Leon wrote.
Most recently, the ALA filed a motion to end the case via summary judgment, which is an order by the judge that the case is cut-and-dry enough to rule without a trial or further proceedings.
The ALA, along with the advocacy group Democracy Forward, asked that a judge in a D.C. district court rule in their favor under violations of the constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine, among others. The groups called the actions of the Trump administration “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion” and “unconstitutional.”
Another lawsuit targeting the the executive order was filed by attorneys general in 21 states, not including Ohio. On Thursday, an appeals court upheld the previous court’s decision in that case, meaning the Trump administration still can’t enforce the executive order as the case goes on.
The beat goes on
As legal challengers await final decisions, libraries still have to open their doors and provide needed services.
“Local (library) budgets are tight enough, and not honoring those federal tax dollars will put communities in a crunch,” said Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association.
Helmick said the loss of those previously mandated funds could mean reductions in services, and “could unintentionally cost state and local taxpayers more” because contracts have already been signed with consortiums and other resource organizations that are owed money, whether its federal monies as promised, or not.

The State Library of Ohio is not a member of the ALA, but it does receive funds from the institute. The state agency uses the funds to bolster digital resources across the state and other resource-sharing programs with local libraries. State funds go toward conservation efforts within the state library, to keep Ohio’s founding documents and other historical artifacts properly stored.
The library’s funding mechanism on the state side changed slightly with the passage of the most recent state operating budget. Funds going to the State Library of Ohio were put into an operating expenses fund under the Public Library Fund umbrella. The expenses fund provides $9 million over the next two years to the state library, which State Librarian Mandy Knapp said was a cut of $245,000 in fiscal year 2026 and another $331,000 in 2027, compared to the House’s version of the budget.
“Unfortunately, our budget has faced significant reductions, resulting in the elimination of a substantial number of staff positions over time,” a spokesperson for the State Library of Ohio told the Capital Journal. “Flat funding for the State Library this year has contributed to a loss of 26% of our state funding over the last 20 years, leading to a 50% decrease in staff positions over that same time.”
On top of uncertainty as to how the lawsuits will resolve and less-than-desired state funding, the state library is awaiting final word on federal funding for the Institute for Museum and Library Services in fiscal year 2026, which is still being ironed out in both chambers of Congress.
‘Access and opportunity’
In 2025, the State Library of Ohio received $5.4 million from the IMLS’ Grants to States program, according to institute data.
The institute uses a population-based formula to distribute the funds to state library administrative agencies. Agencies use the funding directly or through “competitive sub awards” to libraries of all kinds.
Some of the federal funds the state library received through the federal program went toward monthly deaf storytimes, a digital microfilm scanner for newspapers and historical records, along with e-readers and e-books for home-bound Ohioans.
Other awards went to the Toledo Lucas County Public Library to support a Science of Reading project and more than $340,000 spread between 18 rural public libraries for technology training like computer instruction and one-on-on tutoring.
Without the funds, library users across the country could see limited access and longer lines for digital resources and even the loss of programs like summer reading and employment help.
“When federal funds are cut, communities lose access and opportunity,” ALA President Helmick said. “A reader delayed is a reader denied.”
Libraries have made strides to broaden their reach and tailor their services to their local communities, and have had to do so with thinner and thinner pocketbooks. For Helmick, the scrutiny over library funding is a distraction from other existing problems, when public support for libraries has remained strong.
“Teaching our children how to think instead of what to think has always been the American way,” Helmick said.
Federal funding for next year has survived a congressional hurdle, having passed out of committees in both the U.S. House and Senate.
The funding proposals are similar, with the U.S. House version recommending an IMLS budget of $291.8 million in 2026. This proposal is a $3 million cut from the funding the institute received in 2025, but it’s an about-face from President Donald Trump’s discretionary budget, which proposed only $6 million for the fiscal year.
The House Appropriations Committee specifically mentioned the IMLS’ “commitment” to working on the 250th anniversary celebrations for the signing of the Declaration of Independence happening next year in a Sept. 9 report.
“IMLS has a key role in supporting existing activities and new projects at the state and local levels that enhance civic engagement, innovation and community collaboration in preparation for the 250th Anniversary,” the committee stated in the report.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderLiving in a rural area, almost by definition, means being a little bit further away from the big box stores and modern conveniences, like rideshares and food deliveries. Rural living should not, however, mean that you cannot access health care. Right now, too many Georgians living in small towns and rural areas struggle to access care, often going longer between doctor’s visits and waiting months to see practitioners a county or two over. Unfortunately, this problem will only get worse if Congress fails to renew the enhanced premium tax credits that 1.4 million Georgians rely on to afford their health insurance.
These tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year, meaning premiums will undoubtedly skyrocket for this nearly 13% of Peach State residents. With families’ budgets already stretched thin, these increases will lead to more uninsured Georgians. For those living in rural areas, which we know have higher rates of uninsured residents than their urban counterparts to begin with, the downstream effects of this considerable coverage loss will be especially devastating.
Tragically, patients who do not have coverage are more likely to delay care, and may land in the emergency room when their condition worsens. Without access to affordable coverage, those trips to the emergency room add to the uncompensated care that’s placing additional strain on already fraying rural health systems.
Unfortunately, many of Georgia’s rural hospitals are already operating on razor thin margins. In fact, nine rural Georgia hospitals have closed since 2010, and as many as 18 more are now struggling and in danger of closing or dramatically reducing services. And recent federal cuts to the Medicaid program are further threatening rural hospitals’ stability. The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill identified four rural Georgia hospitals at high risk of closing or reducing critical services — exacerbated by the recently-passed reconciliation bill in Congress. As it is, our state is behind only Tennessee and Texas in the number of hospital closures. When a hospital closes in a small community, the ripple effects are felt for both miles and decades to come.
When a rural hospital closes, doctors, nurses, orderlies, and countless other hardworking medical professionals lose their jobs and may be forced to move away in search of other employment. Suddenly, emergency care and other health services are much further away or even out of reach from residents. Local pharmacies, diners, and other businesses fueled by hospital traffic and jobs become desolate and eventually shutter their doors as well. And as more and more hospitals close, rural residents are forced to travel counties away to get the care they need. In emergency situations, this can be the difference between life and death. And in non-emergency situations, the cost of delaying or foregoing preventive care is enormous — both for the health of our rural communities and our economy. When people are unable to access timely care, they can fall sick, and become unable to actively participate in the workforce and provide for their families.
Thankfully, Congress has the ability to avoid this huge increase in uncompensated care and the disastrous effects it would have on rural hospitals, economies, and communities: they must extend the enhanced premium tax credits before they expire at the end of the year. Our federal representatives on both sides of the aisle have the opportunity to extend the tax credits through legislation moving in the coming months — and protecting access to affordable health care for rural Georgians should be a bipartisan issue.

But competing proposals — along with sizable behind-the-scenes influence from lobbyists — have left the state still without a comprehensive data privacy law. 
When lawmakers return in January, the issue will again be in play. However, this time, they will have insight into how the more stringent version of such law actually works in practice.
Deviating from the more than a dozen states that have adopted a model favored by industry groups, Maryland passed a version that places stricter standards on what data companies can collect or sell, similar to the proposal in Maine that has been favored by the majority of the Judiciary Committee. That law will take effect on Oct. 1. 
In an interview with Maine Morning Star, Maryland Sen. Sara Love, one of the lead sponsors of the soon-to-be law, said it took several years and intentional countering of a sizable lobbying effort to get it passed. Quoting Maine Morning Star’s 2024 article on lobbying in Maine and across the country, Love said it was like “death by a thousand cuts” with trade organization lobbyists backed by Big Tech asking for more and more amendments. 
“A legislator wants to work with groups and compromise with them, but all of a sudden you realize, if you do that, you have nothing — you have a bill that is not worth the paper it’s written on,” Love said. “So we decided ahead of time, what are the most important things to us? Where can we compromise, and where are we drawing the line?”
Lawmakers still split over data privacy policy as bill advances to floor

What ultimately got the bill over the finish line, Love said, was supportive committee chairs and “I think for us, the tech community overplayed their hand.” Another effort to undermine the Maryland law was attempted this year with a bill that Google explicitly supported, though it failed. 
In Maine, there is still steep opposition from some lawmakers and local businesses to the proposal most similar to Maryland’s law. Some of the resistance is similar to that seen in Maryland, including concerns about untested language, but an uncertain economic landscape is now also part of the picture, including impact from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The proposals in Maine 
Lawmakers started 2025 with three separate proposals. 
The one favored by the Judiciary Committee was carried over into next year and, despite not actually making it to a vote in the Maine Senate or House of Representatives, it drew the most lobbying spending. This bill, LD 1822 sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), would make Maine have some of the strictest consumer protections in the country. 
The committee nixed a competing plan that was the favorite of business interests, LD 1224 sponsored by Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick), unanimously voting it down in an attempt to limit the number of proposals considered by the full Legislature. 
A similar plan, LD 1088 sponsored by Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), did make it to the floor but died upon adjournment after the House rejected it. But Henderson plans to propose her version again as an amendment to LD 1822 next year. 
Disagreement over what the fundamental framework of such a law should be remains. 










We decided ahead of time, what are the most important things to us? Where can we compromise, and where are we drawing the line?


– Maryland Sen. Sara Love


Kuhn’s bill relies on a data minimization standard, which broadly means limiting the collection of personal information to only what is necessary to fulfill the consumer service. This is the standard Maryland’s law uses. 
The version businesses favor uses what’s referred to as an opt-in model, allowing companies to collect data as long as consumers agree to it.
“The whole point of a data privacy law is to reduce the amount of data overall that is collected about us, and this, in fact, would do that,” Kuhn said of her proposal.  
Whereas Henderson said, “I know for sure that it does not go too far,” referring to her proposal’s regulations on businesses, “and that isn’t something I can say for LD 1822.” 
Roberts did not respond to Maine Morning Star’s request for comment. 
How will the proposals impact small businesses? 
In both 2024 and 2025, a key point of pushback from businesses to the stricter proposal was that it would limit their ability to do targeted advertising, a tactic opponents say is disproportionately relied on by small businesses with limited marketing dollars. 
Kuhn built her bill off of one considered in the 131st Legislature and said she met with small businesses to try to address remaining concerns before the 132nd Legislature began. 
She preserved exemptions that had already been negotiated, including for entire companies whose data collection is already regulated by federal laws. She also made a handful of tweaks based on feedback from businesses. 
Notably, she eliminated data identifying an individual’s “online activities over time and across 3rd party websites or online services” from the definition of sensitive data, which would have reduced the ability to track cookies.
“It is critically important that Maine small businesses have access to these digital marketing tools,” Kuhn said. “That question is not in dispute.” 
However, business interests are not satisfied.

Targeted advertising
Kuhn’s proposal wouldn’t restrict a business’ ability to do targeted advertising to existing customers, Curtis Picard, CEO of the Retail Association of Maine, which testified against LD 1822, told Maine Morning Star. 
But Picard said it would place limits on how they can target new customers — a claim that Kuhn argues is false.
Picard gave the example of someone coming across an ad on social media that they engage with and then after the company pushes an ad or an email giving that person a discount on their first purchase. 
“This is an example of a commonly stated generic concern — ‘businesses won’t be able to reach future customers’ — that has been frequently made without any substantiation,” Kuhn said.
Kuhn pointed out that, in that scenario, if a consumer is presented with an ad on social media and then clicks on the link, the consumer has requested a product or service — in this case, access to the website — and received it. Therefore, she said, cookies can be attached and subsequent ads are permitted.
Kuhn’s proposal sets two thresholds for data collection. 
It would restrict the collection of personal data (information that can be reasonably linked to a consumer) to only what’s “reasonably necessary and proportionate” to provide the service requested by a consumer. It would also restrict the collection of sensitive data (such as race, citizenship, genetic and other information as defined in the bill) to only what’s “strictly necessary” in that scenario, and outright ban such information from being sold.
“A lot of well meaning small businesses are saying it’s going to hurt them but they can’t articulate how,” Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), a co-sponsor of Kuhn’s bill who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, told Maine Morning Star. “The only answer we’re getting back is uncertainty, which is, in Augusta speak, we don’t actually have any policy concerns with the bill anymore.”
At a work session on May 23, Kuhn asked Stacy Stitham, managing partner at Brann & Isaacson who was working on behalf of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, “Where in the bill is there a barrier to reaching a new customer?” 
Stitham responded, “You have to go back to basically the first sentence of the statute which limits the collection of data to what’s reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer,” which is the data minimization standard. 
This mirrors the Maryland law. Stitham added, “As we know, the Maryland law is not in effect yet. We don’t know how that’s being interpreted, but it’s much different than the standard that’s used by other states which talk about disclosed purposes.”
During the final work session for the bill this year on May 30, ​​Maine Assistant Attorney General Brendan O’Neil from the consumer protection office said, “I don’t see a restriction on targeted advertising in the bill.”
There is currently a patchwork of state laws and parts of federal legislation governing internet privacy, as there remains no one overarching federal law, despite several proposals. Connecticut was the fifth state to enact an omnibus privacy law in 2022 but its version, the one favored by industry groups, has been the model adopted by most states that followed. 
In the work session, O’Neil pointed to the Connecticut’s attorney general’s recommendation for its state Legislature to amend the law to strengthen data minimization provisions rather than rely on its current “exploitable” consent model.
Reading from the officer’s report, O’Neil summarized, “‘serious privacy and data security concerns could have been offset, if not fully alleviated, if companies had properly minimized the data they collected and maintained.’ That’s really what LD 1822’s data minimization standard aims to do.” 
Connecticut tweaked its law in several ways this spring, but did not ultimately adopt the data minimization standard as seen in Kuhn’s proposal and the Maryland law. 
Consumer consent
On May 29, a coalition of business groups including the Maine State Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee outlining their major concerns, notably the data minimization standard. 
But the letter also took issue with the sensitive data restrictions — which mirror those in Maryland’s law — arguing instead that data use should be tied to consumer consent, not based on data type. 
This was another common argument brought up by those who favored Henderson’s version. 
“They want to completely remove consent so that a consumer can’t even consent to have their information used to get discounts or to be marketed to and I want to keep that consent piece,” Henderson said.
Stitham, representing the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, made a similar point this spring. 
“While clearly intended to be more consumer protective,” Stitham said, “by shifting the focus from consumer consent to disclosed purposes to whatever the business can characterize as needed to provide or maintain a requested product or service, the bill actually eliminates consumer choice and control, and potentially leaves room for businesses to justify broad data collection practices without the consumer’s clear, informed consent.”
Kuhn and lawmakers who favor her proposal said this argument rests on a false contention that Maine consumers engage in informed and voluntary consent now.

Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said Henderson’s bill “was essentially preserving the status quo with regard to the protections that consumers currently have in the absence of any data privacy law.”
It would take the average person more than 40 hours per month to read the privacy policies that an American consumer typically encounters each month, according to testimony given to the committee and affirmed by recent studies.  
Kuhn gave the example of health tracker apps that require consumer consent to the terms and conditions in order to use the product when saying, “That’s not voluntary consent. It’s a mandatory threshold.”
Henderson drew a distinction between lengthy terms and conditions and what would be required in her bill. “It has to be clear, conspicuous, bold,” she said of the privacy notice allowing consumers to opt out of having their data sold or used in marketing.

Uncertainty 
When asked to comment on their latest stance on Kuhn’s bill, L.L. Bean deferred to the company’s testimony, in which legal counsel Christy van Voorhees argued LD 1822’s data minimization standard effectively bans the vast majority of personalized, targeted advertising.
This testimony echoed that of many businesses, but also underscored that the current political landscape is another key factor. 
“These restrictions are being proposed at a historically challenging time for Maine retailers,” van Voorhees said. “The ongoing retreat of Canadian customers from U.S. businesses, coupled with the increased costs associated with new universal and threatened reciprocal tariffs, is squeezing marketing budgets. That means that the marketing investments we do make have to be efficient. Personalized, targeted ads are among our most efficient marketing investments.” 
Concern of economic uncertainty — which was also raised by industry associations such as HospitalityMaine and individual businesses like Union River Lobster Pot restaurant — makes Kuhn believe the decision to carry over her bill to the next session was the best choice, as well as opportune timing with the start of Maryland’s law. 
With an effective date of Oct. 1, Maryland’s law will provide three months of results by the time the Maine Legislature returns in January, though there is also a cure period, giving entities 60 days to adhere after a notice of violation from the Maryland Attorney General on or before April 1, 2027. 
“We’ll be able to see, what impact did this phrasing, this language, have on small businesses in Maryland?” Kuhn said. “Were they able to continue to draw ads just as they can now?” 
As Maine has considered a data privacy law, businesses have stressed the importance of interoperability between states. 
“I’m getting tired of Maine being this petri dish for national groups trying to get first-in-the-nation type of legislation,” said Picard, of the retail association. “I do think Representative Kuhn was trying to make it work, but ultimately it ends up being convoluted and complex language that has been untested.”
Now, Kuhn and supporters of her proposal say Maryland’s law will provide that test, affording a preview of how passing such a law would go in Maine.
But others say it’ll be too soon to tell. 
“You’re not going to see the sky fall in a few months,” Henderson said.
Kuhn and Henderson said if either version of a data privacy law is finally passed next session, continuous adjustments will still be needed. Both of their bills would require annual reviews by the state attorney general, similar to those required in other states. 
Currently, LD 1822, Kuhn’s bill that was carried over, is still in possession of the Maine House. It’s unclear whether the body will recommit it to committee or take action on the floor when lawmakers return. 
Other than shifting the implementation date back, Kuhn doesn’t plan to amend her proposal, but she said she’s leaving the possibility open if any glaring need for changes become apparent once Maryland’s law is in effect. 
There is also a concept draft, LD 595 sponsored by Carney, being carried over into next year. It currently reads that it could “further update certain consumer privacy laws in response to recent developments in federal and state consumer privacy laws.”
Carney said she originally filed the placeholder bill not knowing what the changes would be made to Connecticut’s law or possible federal law. The legislation will now serve a similar purpose next year as a way for the Judiciary Committee to address the moment — whatever it may look like — if needed.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)President Donald Trump won’t play a role in the Ohio redistricting process, according to Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, who said that he won’t be pressured into giving the administration their desired maps.
Even though Ohio leaders just announced the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting on Wednesday, the process is already rocky.
“We’re off to a bad start when the other side calls a press conference and says ‘It has to be this or nothing else,'” Huffman (R-Lima) said.
The speaker and Ohio Republicans are disappointed in the Democrats, arguing that they are not playing fair because redistricting should be a bipartisan process.
The joint committee is supposed to start the process, drawing a map publicly. Each of the House and Senate leaders gets to appoint representatives, with four Republicans and two Democrats per chamber.
State Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, will be the co-chair and will be joined by Reps. Nick Santucci, R-Niles, Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron, Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, and House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati.
Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, chose state Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, as co-chair, and she will be joined by Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, Bill Reineke, R-Tiffin, Willis E. Blackshear Jr., D-Dayton, and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood.
“They didn’t want the map drawn ‘behind closed doors’ is the metaphor — which was apparently what happened with the map yesterday,” Huffman said.
On Tuesday, Democrats introduced their version of a map.
Ohio Democrats introduce congressional redistricting proposal

Currently, there are 10 Republicans and 5 Democrats representing Ohio in the U.S. House. President Donald Trump won Ohio 55-44% in 2024. With that result, Ohio’s 15 congressional districts would proportionately be eight Republican and seven Democratic. This proportionality was reflected in the Dems’ map.
“The fairest redistricting proposal that either party has put forward,” Antonio said Tuesday.
House Assistant Minority Leader Phil Robinson, D-Solon, said that their proposed map is bipartisan and made with input from Ohioans. They are also worried, since GOP leaders have already said they want a 12-3, or 13-2 Republican majority map.
“The Democratic caucus simply submitted, in public fashion, to the portal — a map,” Robinson said. “It’s not our map, it’s the voters’ map.”
The joint committee has until the end of September to pass a bipartisan map, or else the Ohio Redistricting Commission takes over.
The ORC is made up of seven spots. Two will always go to Republicans and two to Democrats in the legislature. The three remaining seats include the governor, secretary of state and auditor.
The redistricting commission is controlled by the GOP, including Huffman.
“I think that the specific thing… I think the number one thing is that: a lot of people want to talk about 12-3, 13-2 or 10-5, or exactly what it is — we have a process that the voters approved — follow the process.” Huffman said.
He added additional challenges he had faced throughout the years, such as wanting to avoid lawsuits like in previous years, but said that people knew the current redistricting process better now than when it first passed in 2018.
“I think the main thing is: avoid ancillary side conversations that are designed to incite people in Ohio or throughout the United States, stick to the Constitution and make decisions based on that,” the speaker said.
While Huffman promoted teamwork, Democrats were quick to point out how he was called out by the bipartisan Ohio Supreme Court in 2022 for being the ringleader in ignoring anti-gerrymandering laws.
Huffman, who at that time of being reprimanded by the court, sat on the ORC, said Wednesday that he will be appointing someone else as the House representative on the commission.
Still, some Democrats are feeling cautiously optimistic, since Huffman added that he won’t be pressured by the White House’s efforts to gain more seats in Congress. The Trump administration had advocated for this in other states, but most notably, Texas.
“I’m most interested in what residents of the state of Ohio have to say,” Huffman said when asked about Trump and national influence. “Of course, the President of the United States is an important person too, but there are 11 million+ people in the state of Ohio.”
Trump, the members of Congress and citizens all have a right to lobby about what they want, he said — but Ohioans are who he cares about.
“The state of Ohio is a sovereign entity… We make decisions about what is going on,” he said.
The lawmakers will determine the maps, and if bipartisanship can be reached, the speaker continued.
“We have to have 50 votes to pass the map, and what I think are unreasonable demands aren’t going to get passed,” he said.
When pressed further about Trump, Huffman reiterated that any president of any party would like to have more members of their party in Congress.
“I don’t think the president’s going to call Matt Huffman and say, ‘Here’s what I want,’ or anything like that…” the speaker said. “There are so many specifics to this and constitutional mandates that that’s really what’s going to guide us here.”
The first redistricting meeting is set to take place Sept. 22. Huffman doesn’t think it’s possible to pass a bipartisan map by the Sept. 30 deadline; thus, the ORC would have to take over for the next part of the process.
Ohio is redrawing congressional districts. What does that mean?

Deadlines and process
Sept. 30: The lawmakers need to pass a map with at least 60% in each chamber with at least 50% support of Democrats.
If that fails, it goes to the ORC.
Oct. 31: To meet this deadline, at least four members of the ORC, including two Republicans and two Democrats, must approve.
If that fails, it goes back to the legislature.
Nov. 30: This map can also pass with just a simple majority, and the map must be replaced after six years.

Mike DeWine has extended the state’s National Guard troops’ deployment to Washington, D.C. until the end of November.
This month, 150 troops were expected to come home from patrolling the nation’s capital — but those plans just got delayed.
“I really think it damages morale,” veteran and state Sen. Casey Weinstein, D-Hudson, said. “It really damages the institution.”
Weinstein is disappointed in DeWine after he extended the 30-day surge in D.C. for 60 more days.
The original mission was to combat what President Donald Trump called a rise in crime.
“Over the last year, it was a very unsafe place,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “Over the last 20 years, actually, it was very unsafe.”
Violent crime is at a 30-year low, according to D.C. police. Recently, troops have been spotted cleaning up trash and performing landscaping tasks. A Joint Task Force–District of Columbia Spokesperson told us that Ohio troops haven’t been on trash patrol, though.
“Out there on a mission that they’re not even clear is a real need, right?” Weinstein said. “Doing mulch or picking up trash — to me, that is a degradation of what the guard is supposed to represent.”
But after a month, President Donald Trump said his mission of making the capital safer had been accomplished.
“Now, it’s got virtually no crime,” Trump said. “We call it ‘crime-free.'”
So why are Ohio troops still there?
“I talked to the head of the Washington, D.C. National Guard,” DeWine said Wednesday. “One of the things he said to me is: ‘Governor, you having people out here allows my people not to have to work 14, 16-hour days.'”
Ohio troops being in the D.C. allows for the police to tackle violent crime, the governor’s team said, while National Guard members are patrolling buildings.
“To me, that’s a very good reason for us to continue to have the guard there to back the guard up there,” DeWine said.
The governor has been standing by this decision because he said he tends to accept every ask for help, like he has done in the past for both Republican and Democratic leaders of other states during natural disasters or from mayors when there is civil unrest in Ohio cities.
“This is something that deserves extra scrutiny, particularly in the way that this deployment and this extension are being politicized,” Weinstein said.
Trump’s emergency declaration to take over D.C. just expired, but that doesn’t change anything with the National Guard as long as DeWine approved their deployment.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)The reinterpretation of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 by the current administration is not just another policy shift buried in bureaucratic jargon. It is a betrayal — a betrayal of immigrants, a betrayal of communities of color and, perhaps most corrosively, a betrayal of the very institutions and organizations that once claimed to uphold diversity, equity and inclusion as core values.
The new guidance makes clear that immigrants, regardless of how deeply rooted they are in our communities, will face new barriers to education, resources and opportunity. It has led public institutions such as Johnson County Community College and Kansas City, Kansas, Community College to announce they will begin requiring immigration documents for enrollment in certain programs. These are the same institutions that, less than a year ago, proudly advertised their campuses as “welcoming to all” and wove DEI principles into their mission statements.
That those commitments could unravel so quickly should alarm us all.
It forces us to ask hard questions: Were those values ever authentic? Or were they convenient talking points — easy to put in glossy brochures when it cost nothing, but discarded the moment political pressure mounted? The rapid retreat suggests that for many institutions, DEI was never a true pillar, but a facade.
This betrayal isn’t confined to higher education. Cities and municipalities across the country, once eager to celebrate diversity and enact inclusive ordinances, are now preemptively dismantling programs meant to serve immigrants and other marginalized groups. These actions are framed as compliance with federal shifts, but in truth, they represent a cowardly eagerness to align with racist values rather than defend the humanity of all residents.
The hypocrisy stings all the more because it undermines the very communities that sustain our cities and colleges. Immigrants and communities of color are not peripheral contributors — they are central to our economic prosperity, our culture and the very idea of America as a thriving, pluralistic society. The erasure of their access to education and opportunity not only weakens individuals but hollows out the collective strength of our communities.
The question is not only how such betrayals will harm us now, but also what happens when this dark chapter eventually ends. Because history teaches us that it will end. Extremist policies never stand forever. But when we emerge from this moment, how will institutions rebuild trust with the people they so callously abandoned? Will communities of color and immigrant families forgive and return to schools, organizations and cities that once shut their doors in their faces? Should they?
Repair will not come easily. Trust cannot simply be declared restored; it must be earned back through courage, consistency and action. Institutions will have to prove — through policy, not platitudes — that they are willing to stand up for the very people they once excluded. Communities will rightfully be wary of shallow gestures.
In the meantime, silence is not an option. It is up to us — residents, students, educators, advocates, neighbors — to use our voices and demand accountability. We must make clear that these harmful actions are not reflective of the values of our communities. We know what builds healthy, prosperous communities: opportunity for all, regardless of immigration status. When people are able to learn, work, and live without fear, entire neighborhoods flourish. That truth does not change with the tides of political power.
This is not the time for cowardice. It is the time for leaders, especially in education and local government, to double down and prove their values are more than marketing slogans. It is the time to resist policies that divide, to stand up for the people who enrich our campuses, workplaces and neighborhoods, and to insist that diversity and inclusion are not negotiable.
The betrayal we are witnessing is painful and profound. But it is not permanent — if, and only if, enough of us refuse to accept it. The question that hangs in the balance is whether our institutions will continue to bend the knee to racist ideologies, or whether they will summon the courage to live up to their promises. For the sake of our future, the choice is theirs. The responsibility to hold them to it is ours.

Ron DeSantis, want to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida law as well as rules and regulations. (Stock photo by Getty Images)To: The Nebraska Legislature
From: A constituent 
Re: Don’t be like Florida
As the 49 current Nebraskans who write laws and make policies that affect the way and quality of life for the rest of us Cornhuskers, please don’t be like Florida. 
Maybe it’s the heat or the humidity or the alligators or the hurricanes, but the Sunshine State drove its public health bus deep into Everglades muck when it became the first state to do away with school vaccine requirements. 
It did so without any research into what the absence of a vaccine mandate for school children would do to the overall health of the state. I’m neither a doctor nor do I play one in op-ed commentaries, but that calculus sounds neither healthy nor wise. 
One might go as far as to think Florida is making it up as it goes along.
So, dear state senators, please do some bud nipping if such an idea arrives in your email inbox, at a neighborhood barbecue or on the Unicameral floor. Obviously, Nebraska looks to other states for best practices in solving common problems. Why reinvent the wheel, right? 
Florida’s anti-vax idea, however, should be neither emulated nor entertained. Contrary to information from officials there, including the state’s surgeon general and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, we have the data. Vaccines work. Full stop.
Florida’s no-poke plan begins in January and excludes vaccine requirements for hepatitis B, chickenpox, Hib influenza and pneumococcal diseases, such as meningitis. The Florida Legislature also convenes in January and would have to vote to remove requirements for measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, mumps and tetanus individually, a distinct possibility given the current vaccine vibe among state leaders.
We insist on sending children to school in enclosed spaces to get an education, so we require inoculations to foster the public good … in this case public health. While vaccine requirements are generally left up to the states, the U.S. Supreme Court has been clear for 120 years: States may require schoolchildren to be vaccinated to increase the health and safety of all students. 
Without those protections, chances increase that children will contract and spread communicable diseases, even to the vaccinated because as doctors and epidemiologists point out, no vaccine can guarantee 100% efficacy. 
As infected students interact with families, medical professionals at hospitals and clinics and in the general public, everyone’s risk increases, especially those whose immune systems may be compromised from chemotherapy, post-op complications or even age, making grandma and grandpa more vulnerable than they have to be. 
Measles is a sad case in point. According to the Journal of American Medicine, as vaccination rates have fallen since the pandemic, measles cases have risen, especially worrisome because the percentage of vaccinated has fallen below 95, the gold standard for herd immunity. The CDC reports that in 2020, the U.S. had 13 cases of measles. In 2025, the number is 1,431. Twelve percent of those individuals had to be hospitalized. Three died.
Florida argues that the government should not be mandating vaccines because individuals should have autonomy over their bodies — and what goes in them. Fair enough, although such logic and sentiment fail to square with the state’s highly restrictive abortion ban (nothing after six weeks). 
Florida’s decision is yet another chorus of the noisy and occasionally nonsensical chirping coming from the federal HHS, with its vaccine-skeptic leader and his apparently like-minded new advisory board. To date, research money has been pulled from mRNA research, which gave us the COVID vaccine. HHS has also added restrictions to the vaccine’s availability. 
In response to such dissonance, four states on the other side of the country, California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii have formed an alliance to give its citizens data-driven, scientifically-sound vaccine recommendations. Several New England states are also considering such a collaboration. 
The freedoms and rights woven into a democratic republic’s constitutional principles require both personal and civic responsibilities. John F. Kennedy, before he became president, once said as a U.S. Senator, “In a democracy, every citizen is in a position of responsibility, regardless of their interest in politics.” 
Requiring vaccines for school children — out of respect for their health, their families’ health and their community’s health — seems a fitting example of his idea. So go ahead, senators, tackle property taxes, address budget deficits, reconsider term limits, whatever. Argue, debate, spit, even cuss if you must. But keep our schoolchildren — and the rest of us — safe.  
Don’t be Florida.

(Photo by Rosanne Skirble for Maryland Matters)By reframing child care from a commodity into a human right, we can shift the conversation away from whether or not child care is possible to being beneficial to families, housing stabilization and sustaining the precarious transition to independent adulthood.
Based on international principles like the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the widespread belief that every child has a right to care that is nurturing, safe, and supportive, this is not some radical transformation – it should be commonplace.
Despite this, in the U.S., infant and toddler care is viewed as a market good and not a piece of essential public infrastructure. In 2022, Organization for Economic and Community Development member nations averaged spending of over $14,000 per child annually, and the U.S. spent less than $500 explicitly on child care. This allows countless families to spend up to 32% of their income on care.
Affordable, reliable care can also be recognized as a silent linchpin to housing stability. Parents experiencing child care challenges, not limited to but including single parents and low-income families, also suffer the stress of relying on absent employment. When parents cannot care for their children, they become uninsured and their providers turn into commensurate, obligated equivalents.
Governments fare better in prioritizing and funding child care and supporting families when they value human development and quality of life over market-based decisions.

For example, for ALICE [Asset Limited, Income-Constrained, Employed] families in Maryland, child care is frequently their top monthly expense. At 38% of the survival budget, these families will not foster slow or sudden economic independence.
Beyond high levels of associated stress and reduced well-being, most reports suggest that for these families, as part of the 45% of Maryland’s parents of children age 3 and younger, we lose $2.41 billion in productivity for employers from employment disruption resulting from gaps in child care. One report estimated that Maryland loses $117 million annually in state tax revenue from parents in this population missing significant employment.
When child care falls apart, housing often follows: The rent gets paid late, eviction risk rises, or worse, individuals become homeless. Emerging adults between the ages of 18 to 25 are further impacted. This life stage provides a tenuous bridge for young people beginning careers, pursuing education and establishing their own households.
For young parents, having steady support is critical. Research points to the fact that access to quality child care translates to better long-term educational outcomes, job stability, and upward mobility.
Current research, “Exploring the Perspectives of Emerging Adults in Public Housing: Workforce Development, Economic Mobility and Structural Barriers,” provides evidence of these relationships with the voices of 18 emerging adults in public housing who were part of workforce development programs. It found that structural barriers, including the cost of child care and transportation, severely hamper their ability to sustain employment or even contemplate a stable future.
Without consistent child care, these young parents’ options are more limited to dropping out, further income loss, and housing insecurity. With child care, the young parents can find stability, grow their households and fully participate in their communities.
Maryland is just beginning to turn things around. Family support centers support student parents in completing their education and entering the workforce. These intergenerational approaches are an example of working models but are too limited in scale. What we also need is a universal, bold initiative; child care, like public education or libraries, public, consistent, and universal. Such an initiative could enhance household stability, encourage job sustainability and allow an emerging adult the opportunity to thrive in adulthood.
If we treat child care as a human right, then we need to invest in it. This means universal, publicly funded child care available to all; living wages and training for caregivers; and coordination of child care with housing support and child/traditionally youth-focused services.
One of our neighbors, Canada, has a successful model with the investment of $27 billion in making child care less than $10/day in many provinces. If Maryland could add this type of change to their current housing and youth services, we could realize the results would evidence fewer evictions, growing family resilience and engaged, enthusiastic emerging adults with the confidence to step into their futures.
Caring is more than compassion; it is a civil, economic, and social infrastructure. Universal child care is more than children’s rights; it is about building a stronger, more stable and more equitable Maryland.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/thumbnail_6_cropped-e1757921006279-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-15 03:57:21.648575

(Photo courtesy Bryce Mitchell/University of Florida)Retailers tell us Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year.
Please.
We barbarians, defenders of the indefensible, rationalizers of blown knees and brain damage, know college football season is the most wonderful time of the year, four months when it’s perfectly OK to make animal noises and behave like 7th graders on meth, display irrational hatreds, eat appalling food, and shout at people on television to whom we have not been introduced.
I am a victim of this madness.
Or perhaps I’m a perpetrator.
I can tell you every single thing that’s wrong with college football: its celebration of brutality, its fetishization of the hyper-masculine, its gleeful embrace of tribalism.
Look at the injuries: shredded ligaments, broken spines, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) from hundreds upon hundreds of sub-concussive hits.
Look at the money: For all you anti-education dolts out there whining that college professors get paid too much, the average faculty salary in Florida is around $75,000 a year, which sounds pretty good until you compare it to what football players at UF, FSU, or USF are paid: anywhere from $100,000 (for a pretty good freshman) to $1 million-plus for a hot QB.
And the coaches? The University of Florida’s Billy Napier makes $7.4 million a year.
However, the poor bugger may soon be sacked. His Gators have now lost two in a row, first to USF, then to LSU. But don’t feel too bad for Napier. He’ll get $22 million if UF has to buy out hos contract.
If the Bull Gators, sufficiently incensed by USF’s upset of his team, fire him, he’ll get even richer: It’ll take to buy him out.
Ain’t capitalism grand?
Look at the retrograde gender roles: gigantic armor-clad men beating hell out of each other on the field while tiny women in short skirts with little girl bows on their heads cheer them on.
Addiction, hypocrisy
Look at the team mascots: Notre Dame’s pugilistic Leprechaun with his dubious facial hair, representing an Irishman who, as we all know, wants nothing more than to get in a fight; or the University of North Carolina’s Ramses, an angry sheep in a sweater; or Florida State’s Osceola, a white frat boy impersonating a multiracial Seminole war leader who was betrayed by the United States and died in a South Carolina prison.
Look at the confusion of football with war: the military flyovers, the presentation of colors, calling the quarterback (who throws “bombs”) a “field general.”
Given the game is all about invading your enemy’s territory, I guess it makes sense.
Football, unrepentantly violent, irrationally angry, hopelessly parochial — that’s 21st Century America. (Getty Images)
Certainly made sense to the South’s historically white universities which, until the 1970s, saw college football games (especially against Yankee teams) as a Johnny Reb do-over of the Civil War, complete with battle flags, bands playing “Dixie,” and comparisons to Gettysburg.
People, this stuff is flat-out weird.
Nevertheless, I am a lifer, an addict, and a hopeless hypocrite.
Culture is a tough old bird and college football has sunk roots as deep as a live oak into my culture.
I was raised in Tallahassee; “FSU” is tattooed on the inside of my brain; I’ve been going to games since I was nine years old.
I know the all the words to the FSU “Fight Song,” the “Alma Mater,” and “Hymn to the Garnet and Gold.”
I watched (or attended) every single FSU game last year — that would be the Seminoles’ 2-10 season.
Painful. But then, to love college football (especially FSU football) is to learn to suffer.
(Listen: There’s nothing you can say to me I haven’t already said to myself).
Pick a team!
It used to be said baseball was America’s Game. As the great George Carlin pointed out, baseball is played in a park by people in caps, not helmets, and in baseball, the “object is to go home.”
If that was ever true, it ain’t anymore. Football, unrepentantly violent, irrationally angry, hopelessly parochial — that’s 21st Century America.
It’s who we are.
From the White House on down, the country has finally caught up with college football’s 150 years of tribalism: You are Red or Blue, you are one of us or you are the enemy.
If you are the enemy, you must be crushed.
The South is the beating heart of college football and Florida — no matter how many Ohioans move here — is a Southern state.
College football matters here, so much so the governor grouses about it when teams that used to be good are not good anymore.
Last year, he criticized the transfer portal and declared a Florida team should always be playing for the national championship like in the good old days when the Seminoles, the Gators, and the Hurricanes bestrode the gridiron like shoulder-padded gods.
College football, however, is one of the long list of things DeSantis does not understand.
He thinks he should be for whatever Florida team is playing against whatever non-Florida team, so he shows up at last year’s FSU-Georgia Tech game in Ireland and says he’ll attend this year’s UF-Texas match this October.
This is not how you do it.
You pick a team. You are loyal to that team.
Former Gov. Jeb Bush was a Hurricane; former Governor Lawton Chiles was a Gator; former Speaker of the House T.K. Wetherell was a Seminole.
They did not pander.
Bread and circuses
At this moment, college football programs still need colleges to attach themselves to. The university is a kind of beard, lending cover, a facade of “student-athlete” respectability.
UM, USF, FSU, and UF are pretty much pro teams now, but no one wants to admit this, least of all the universities.
University presidents and trustees know winning football teams mean higher alumni donations and higher enrolments.
How long can this charade go on?
DeSantis has made it clear he thinks Florida universities — the non-sports parts — are his enemies, bastions of wokery, and means to whip them into line with his shiny new, as-yet-unpeopled accreditation body.
The “Commission for Public Higher Education” is supposed to replace the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) which, DeSantis claims, tried to force Florida universities to “do DEI.”
Those of us out here in the reality-based community can tell you SACS never demanded anybody “do DEI.”
The accreditor did express disapproval of DeSantis’s attempt to stop three UF professors from testifying as expert witnesses in a voting-rights case — it’s called academic freedom — but since when does truth stop a gubernatorial temper tantrum? And people wonder why a third of faculty in Florida are looking for jobs outside of Florida.
OK, back to the important stuff, i.e. football. How can a progressive justify loving the game?
I can’t. Not really.
The world is particularly bleak right now: The president of the United States is enabling (if passively) Putin’s invasion of Ukraine; the people of Gaza are starving; the people of Sudan are starving; the planet is choking on greenhouse gases.
Here in America, free expression is under attack, we’re shooting each other on the regular, and masked goons are rounding up brown folks and throwing them into gulags.
You can grant all the criticisms, the heartfelt and rational objections, but seeing FSU whip Alabama was a moment of sheer joy.
Even watching third- and fourth-string Seminoles beat the tar out of the unfortunate Lions of East Texas A&M (I know: cupcake) was a feast of elegant passes, beautiful runs, and actual (rare for FSU) blocking.
It won’t last. The Miami game is coming.
Yes, football is bread and circuses, a distraction, inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.
But sometimes a little bread and a gridiron circus is just what a body needs.

But now Trump has halted construction on a nearly finished wind project that was on track to power more than 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
The unprecedented and likely illegal attempt to shut down Revolution Wind is the latest evidence that Trump is hell-bent on replacing clean, job-producing, and affordable solar and wind projects in New England with price-volatile gas from out of state. If Trump and his fossil fuel cronies prevail, they’ll drive up our energy costs, harm our health, and throttle our opportunities for local economic development.

Shannon Laun
The Trump administration has our clean energy economy in its crosshairs. Federal agencies are on a mission to find new bureaucratic means of stopping clean energy projects that are already financed and under construction or fully permitted. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has been meeting with political leaders in the northeast to demand that they concede to new gas pipelines that do not have financial support and are unlikely to reduce energy costs. 
If the administration and the fossil fuel industry get their way, New England families and businesses could be stuck with expensive bills to pay for gas infrastructure and price-volatile gas for years after Zeldin and President Trump are long gone.
In Connecticut, Governor Lamont doesn’t seem to grasp that investing in new gas pipelines would be costly and shortsighted. While Lamont supports the state’s climate goals, he has cravenly agreed with Trump’s demand to expand gas pipelines in the region. Lamont claims he’s responding to high electricity rates, but new gas pipelines are not the answer. In fact, investors have been unwilling to finance new pipelines in the region because they’re not a viable investment and there are no buyers for long-term gas contracts. 
What Zeldin and Lamont seem to forget is that New England has been here before. In 2016, the region rejected a similar push for new gas pipelines. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that it was not legal to charge electric customers for the high cost of a pipeline and the Maine utility regulator determined that the plan was not cost-effective, those plans fell like a house of cards.
What Lamont is really doing is bowing to pressure from Trump and the fossil fuel industry at the expense of the people he represents. Industry front groups with deceptive names like Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future and Consumers Energy Alliance are mobilizing in support of fossil fuels and attacking clean energy. They release pro-fossil fuel studies and surveys of questionable accuracy while receiving funding from fossil fuel companies, or in the case of Mass Fiscal Alliance, refusing to say who funds them. 
Despite the fossil fuel industry’s attempts to strangle clean energy, deployment has exploded across the U.S. and globally. Nationally, solar, wind, and batteries dominate as we race to add new sources of electricity to meet growing demand. Solar is the cheapest and fastest growing source of energy in the U.S. and globally. 
But the transition to clean energy in the U.S. is not happening fast enough to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil fuels. The Trump administration is making things worse by taking unprecedented – and often illegal – actions to slow the transition and continue inflating the profits of fossil fuel companies, which already enjoy huge government subsidies. 
The Trump administration’s support for fossil fuels is purely ideological and unbelievably myopic. Nationally, 90 percent of new capacity added to the grid is from solar and wind. In the winter, wind power – a free and local resource – ramps up just when we need it most. In summer, abundant sunshine makes solar an excellent source of power. During the heat wave that hit the region this summer, rooftop solar and batteries saved us from losing power – and saved consumers almost $20 million in fuel costs.
Revolution Wind created 1,200 jobs in New England and was on the cusp of providing Connecticut and Rhode Island with clean electricity. If Trump succeeds in killing the project, he will destroy jobs, increase energy costs, and threaten grid reliability.
When the federal government does the bidding of multibillion dollar corporations while driving up costs for the average American, we need states to step up. Our state and local leaders have a responsibility to lead where this administration has failed us: by investing in clean, local, and affordable sources of energy, enabling families and businesses to access clean technologies that are more efficient and better for our health, and refuting Trump’s nonsensical claims that fossil fuels are the future. 
Not in New England, they aren’t.

Home to Bangor, a city of roughly 32,000, the county has identified 28 new cases over nearly two years. That’s seven times the typical number for that length of time. Nearly all cases are among people who use drugs and are homeless.
Public health experts and local advocates say the outbreak is fueled by a confluence of on-the-ground factors: the sidelining and closing of programs that distributed sterile syringes to people who use drugs, a shortage of medical providers focused on HIV, and the clearing of the city’s largest homeless encampment, which upended care for newly diagnosed people living there.
But those issues may not remain local for long.
The Trump administration is pushing similar tactics nationwide. In a recent executive order, Trump called for defunding programs that engage in harm reduction — a broad term that encompasses many public health interventions, including syringe services, aimed at keeping people who use drugs alive. Such efforts are sometimes controversial, with critics saying they enable illegal activity. The executive order also supports forcing homeless people off the street and into treatment. This comes after the administration cut or delayed funding for various addiction and HIV-related programs and hollowed out federal agencies focused on these topics.
The administration says its approach will increase public safety, but decades of research suggest otherwise. Many advocates and researchers warn these efforts could spark more outbreaks like the one in Bangor.
“That feels inevitable,” said Laura Pegram, director of Drug User Health for NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs.
She said people who use drugs face a trifecta of risks: HIV, hepatitis C, and overdose. “Across the country, I think we’ll start to see those three things starting to be on the rise again.”
“That will be incredibly costly,” she added — in dollars and “in a real human way.”
Outbreaks that start among people who use drugs can easily spread to those who don’t.
Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, was a Bangor-area nonprofit that distributed more than half a million sterile needles a year to people who use drugs. The organization ran out of supplies repeatedly in the lead-up to the first HIV case of the current outbreak in October 2023, and it shut down in early 2025. (Photo courtesy of Amy Clark)
 An HIV outbreak

The first HIV case in Bangor’s current outbreak appeared in October 2023, well before Trump’s return to the presidency.
Puthiery Va, director of Maine’s public health department, attributed the emergence to the opioid epidemic, housing shortages, and the greater Bangor area’s sparse health care services.
Local advocates highlighted an additional, acute factor: supply shortages at the region’s largest syringe services program and its subsequent closure.
A nonprofit that provided health care and social services to people who use drugs, Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, distributed more than half a million sterile needles annually.
Like other such programs nationwide, its goal was to prevent the spread of infectious disease that can occur if people share needles to inject drugs.
However, financial struggles and mismanagement led to severe shortages in recent years. Former HEAL executive director Josh D’Alessio acknowledged such issues, telling KFF Health News, “We did run out of syringes” at times or limit how many participants could take. Several of these shortages struck in the fall of 2023, leading HEAL staffers to suggest a link to the first HIV case.

 The future of harm reduction

Research suggests a strong connection between past HIV outbreaks among people who use drugs and lack of access to sterile needles, said Thomas Stopka, an epidemiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine.
A 2015 outbreak in Scott County, Indiana, and one in the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts a few years later were curbed only after syringe services programs ramped up, he said. If such programs had existed sooner in Scott County, more than a hundred infections could have been prevented, one study suggested.
Va, who leads the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said she considers the shortage of syringe services in the Bangor area to be a factor in the outbreak but not the primary cause.
Stopka said the best practice during an outbreak “is to amplify access to sterile syringes.”
But Trump’s recent executive order links harm-reduction programs to crime, saying such efforts “only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.” The order doesn’t name syringe services programs — which have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the past — but it targets “safe consumption” sites, where people can use drugs under supervision. Many advocates worry the attacks will be broader.
A letter from the nation’s leading addiction agency expanding on Trump’s executive order said federal funds cannot be used to buy syringes or drug pipes. However, that has been true for most of the past few decades. The letter did not address supporting general operating costs for syringe services programs.
Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News that the administration is committed to “addressing the addiction and overdose crisis impacting communities across our nation.” But he and spokespeople for the White House did not respond to specific questions about the administration’s stance toward syringe services.
In Bangor, some locals have raised concerns about harm reduction that echo the president’s. At a March 2024 City Council meeting — shortly after a syringe services program was newly certified by the state to operate locally — residents and business owners said they felt unsafe with the growing population of people who were homeless and using drugs. They worried syringe programs were fueling the behavior.
But research suggests syringe services programs reduce discarded needles in the community and do not increase crime. They can halve new HIV and hepatitis C cases, increase entry into addiction treatment fivefold, and save taxpayer money. They are also leading distributors of overdose reversal medications, the use of which many communities — and the Trump administration — have said they support.
The city ultimately decided the newly certified program, Needlepoint Sanctuary, could not operate in prominent public parks or squares.
In the following months, Needlepoint ran its syringe services only at the city’s largest homeless encampment, where several people had tested positive for HIV, said the group’s executive director, William “Willie” Hurley. That ended in February when the city cleared the encampment.
This summer, Needlepoint secured a private location for its syringe services but shut it down five days later when city officials raised zoning concerns.
Jennifer Gunderman, director of Bangor’s health department, said the city is trying to strike a balance between “making services available and what the community wants.”
“Getting the buy-in of most of the community” is “critical to the future of harm reduction,” she said.
Other cities in Maine and beyond have seen backlash result in new laws that restrict how syringe services programs operate or shutter them.
Gunderman said she is hoping to avoid that in Bangor.

 Clearing encampments

Trump’s recent executive order also calls for clearing homeless people off the street and involuntarily committing them to treatment facilities.
The administration is enacting this policy in Washington, D.C., where it has bulldozed tents and threatened homeless people with fines and jail time if they don’t leave the streets.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said people have the option to be taken to a shelter or receive addiction and mental health services.
Similar policies have taken hold nationwide in recent years, even in liberal hubs like New York and California.
Last year in Bangor, as a homeless encampment that had existed for several years grew to nearly 100 residents, business owners and locals called for its clearing.
Some advocates and social service providers warned that doing so could exacerbate the HIV outbreak and overdose crisis. At two City Council meetings in November, they explained that it would be difficult to find people they served after a clearing and that scattering newly diagnosed people could spark HIV clusters elsewhere.
“Plenty of people said you’re going to lose track of these people,” Amy Clark, a board member for the Bangor Area Recovery Network, told KFF Health News. “They did it anyway.”
 ‘I’m still alive’

Two months after clearing the encampment, the city reported not knowing the location of more than a third of the people who had lived there.
Clark said it’s not surprising that the city couldn’t connect everyone to housing or treatment. Many people distrust these services, shelters are frequently full, and treatment services are scarce. “Where exactly are these people supposed to go?” she said.
City officials stressed in Council meetings and reports that they were taking a humane approach. They ramped up social services for months leading up to the clearing, connecting people to everything from housing to storage facilities and laundry.
Gunderman, the city health director, said she knows the sweep wasn’t ideal but that neither was crowding folks in an unsanitary encampment. “It was a situation where there weren’t a lot of great answers,” she said.
To help track folks from the encampment and keep them engaged in HIV treatment, the city is now using about $550,000 in opioid settlement funds to hire two case managers. (The only other local HIV medical case management program shuttered over the summer.)
“What we know from outreach we’ve been doing already is that we spend a lot of time looking for people,” Gunderman said.
Jason, who has been homeless for most of the past decade and tested positive for HIV this year, has seen that in action.
Members of what he calls his medical team have scoured the streets for hours to find his tent and remind him to take his HIV treatment shots, he said. Some picked up prescriptions and delivered them to him.
“They’ve made sure I’m taken care of,” Jason said. (KFF Health News agreed to use only his first name to protect his privacy.)
Jason believes he got the virus last year at the homeless encampment while using drugs that someone else prepared. He had tried to avoid the encampment for months. But whenever he set up his tent elsewhere, he said, police officers told him to move.
When he got the diagnosis, he thought of his uncle, who died of AIDS in the 1980s.
“It hurts to talk about,” Jason said, “but I’m still alive.”
After months of treatment, his viral load is now undetectable. Over the summer, his team helped him find housing.
But Jason is still struggling to find sterile needles regularly. He worries about others facing a shortage.
“That’s how this outbreak has been spreading more and more,” Jason said. “Every time we turn around there’s another case.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)CEDAR RAPIDS — U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, officially launching her U.S. Senate campaign Sunday, said Iowa Republicans can’t be complacent in 2026 if they want President Donald Trump to be able to accomplish his agenda.
The Marion Republican announced her run earlier in September, hours after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said she would not seek reelection in 2026. After entering the race, Hinson quickly consolidated support from national Republican leaders, gaining endorsements from Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott.
Hinson has pledged to be Trump’s “strongest ally” in the U.S. Senate if elected, saying she will support the president’s agenda on issues like immigration, education and agriculture. At the Sunday event, she reiterated her support for the Trump administration’s agenda, saying her campaign was “embarking on a journey to continue fighting alongside President Trump, to transform the America First agenda into our America First future.”

“I’m incredibly grateful to have earned the support of our great president, President Donald J. Trump,” Hinson said. “I am honored to fight alongside him to fix what Joe Biden broke. We are putting America first, and we are making America great again. Mr. President, I want to say thank you for your support. I will not let you down.”
Speaking to supporters, Hinson said she was focused on issues like border security, deporting undocumented immigrants, and stopping transgender women from competing in women’s sports. She also said she would continue her work on issues like supporting Iowa farmers and “strengthening Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security for our seniors” if elected to the Senate.
Hinson, who was first elected to represent Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in 2020, described herself as a “mama bear who refuses to stand by and allow my kids to grow up in a country run by liberals who want to ditch the American experiment and set up some kind of crazy liberal dystopia.” She said “radical left lunacy” has harmed states like California and New York — and that Democrats running for the U.S. Senate seat want Iowa to become more like these states.
“That’s the vision the Democrats in this race in Iowa are fighting for,” Hinson said. “They want to push Iowa to the coasts. They want to push our country past the brink. Guess what? I’m not going to let them do that.”
There are currently four Democrats competing to become the party’s nominee in the 2026 Senate race — state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville; state Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs; former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage and Des Moines school board chair Jackie Norris.
All four candidates spoke at the Polk County Democrats’ Steak Fry in Des Moines Saturday about the race and said their approaches to the campaign trail will not change despite shifts in the competition.
Hinson called out Wahls specifically at the event, referring to the state senator a “far-left” Democrat who is pretending to be a moderate, “hoping to fool Iowans into believing that they share our values.” She made a joke that Iowans “rejected the last Walz,” referring to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 presidential election who has a similar last name, and said “we’ll do the same for this one.”
Wahls told reporters Saturday Hinson has supported the same policies as Ernst that are unpopular with Iowans which contribute to a “broken economy” and political corruption in Washington. “Whether it’s Joni Ernst, Ashley Hinson, I think Iowans understand that Washington leaders have failed our state and they’re ready to change,” Wahls said.
While Hinson has emerged as a frontrunner for the GOP nomination after Ernst left the race, former state legislator Jim Carlin and former Libertarian candidate Joshua Smith are also vying for the Republican nomination.
Hinson said Iowans support her and Trump’s policies — and have shown their support by electing Republicans across the ballot in recent election cycles — but she also warned the 2026 election will be difficult, and said “Democrats are not just going to fade silently into the night.”
“Sure, today, it seems like they are pretty much a joke, right?” Hinson said. “They don’t have a leader, they don’t have a message, and they really don’t have a clue what to do about it. … We cannot rest on our laurels, though, and I think we all know that we have not come this far to only go this far. We have to keep Iowa red when it comes to the Senate, when it comes to our governor’s race, all of our statewide offices, our congressional seats and our leaders in the legislature. If we keep Iowa red, we will help make sure President Trump can have a full four years of wins and deliver results for you that will last for a generation and beyond.”

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
If you watched Ole Miss out-score Arkansas 41-35 Saturday night, you know this: Rebel quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, a transfer Division II from Ferris (Michigan) State, can play. He is the real deal. He can run. He can throw. He has the “it” factor.
The Ole Miss roster lists Chambliss  at 6-foot-1, and he might be 6 feet tall in his spikes, which is probably why he played first at Ferris State and not at Michigan or Michigan State. But he runs like a halfback, and throws with accuracy and zip. He makes good decisions, and he makes plays. 

Rick Cleveland
Chambliss led Ferris State to the Division II national championship last year throwing for a gazillion yards and running for a zillion more. He produced 51 touchdowns in a single football season, which is crazy good in any league.
But still, it’s a gigantic leap from the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference to the SEC. Chambliss has played before more fans in two SEC games than he did in his entire career at Ferris State, located in Big Rapids, Michigan, in the west central part of the state. The Ferris State stadium is called a field and seats about 6,000, although that many seats are rarely needed.
Chambliss played well in relief duty a week earlier when Ole Miss starter Austin Simmons suffered an ankle injury at Kentucky. Making his first SEC start against Arkansas, he threw for 353 yards and a touchdown and ran 62 yards and two touchdowns. He was, in a word, terrific. Lane Kiffin will have an interesting decision to make when Simmons regains his health. It won’t be easy to sit Chambliss back down.
The guess here is we might see Chambliss set a trend across college football. It wouldn’t surprise me if there aren’t a lot more DII players who make the jump. This much I know: There have been plenty of DII players in the past, some right here in Mississippi, who could have played at the next level. 
Exhibit A would be Josh Bright, the splendid Delta State quarterback, who led the Statesmen to the 2000 DII national championship and won the Conerly Trophy in the process. Bright ran coach Steve Campbell’s option offense to perfection, running and passing for more than 1,000 yards. Asked Sunday whether Bright could have played in the SEC, Campbell, who has since coached at several Division I schools, laughed before answering. “You know he could have, you saw him” Campbell said. “Not a doubt in my mind. He was a no-brainer. All you had to do was watch him.”
But you don’t have to take it from Campbell – or me. Back then, I happened to be working on a book with legendary Ole Miss coach John Vaught, who watched on TV as Bright put up 63 points in the national championship game. Said Vaught of Bright, “He damned sure could have played quarterback for me,”
Said Campbell, “We had some other players who could have played at the highest level. Rico McDonald, a running back on that championship team, could have played anywhere in the country.”
At least two other recent Delta State quarterbacks likely could have played big-time college football. Most recently, Patrick Shegog, almost exactly the same size as Chambliss, threw for 32 touchdowns and only two interceptions in 2023, leading the Statesmen to 10 wins. He, too, won the Conerly.
Scott Eyster, a four-year DSU starting quarterback, was a four-time finalist for the Conerly Trophy, a three-time All-American. He threw for 128 touchdowns in four years. That’s all. Ron Roberts, one of his DSU head coaches, is now the defensive coordinator at Florida and has also coached Baylor and Auburn. I texted Roberts Sunday morning, asking if Eyster could have played at the SEC level. “No doubt,” Roberts answered, and then he mentioned that Seth Adams, who played behind Eyster at DSU and transferred to Hinds Community College, eventually wound up starting at quarterback for Ole Miss.
Eyster, now the principal at Bay High in Bay St. Louis, says he has no regrets about his Delta State career, but knows in his heart he could have played DI football. He said he was contacted by Mississippi State about the possibility of transferring. “But back then, I would have had to sit out a year and there was no NIL money,” Eyster said. “It wasn’t worth it. Plus, I loved Delta State. They were good to me there. I have to admit, I’d be a lot more tempted now that you don’t have to sit out a season when you transfer and there’s all that NIL money.”
Fast Freddie McAfee could have played for anybody, too, when he helped Mississippi College to a DII national championship. Indeed, he did play for five different teams in a 16-year NFL career. Vicksburg native Malcolm Butler played his college football at DII West Alabama, before he became famous for making a Super Bowl-saving interception for the New England Patriots. 
Campbell, the national championship coach of Bright at Delta State, once played on a DII national championship at Troy State. He well remembers blocking a linebacker named Jessie Tuggle, who played at DII Valdosta State, before a long career with the Atlanta Falcons.
“Everybody should remember who Jessie Tuggle was,” Campbell said. “His name is on the stadium in Atlanta. He was a load.”
Tuggle probably was overlooked by the SEC powerhouses because he stood only 5 feet, 11 inches tall, which is still three inches taller than Sam Mills, the linebacker who is both the New Orleans Saints and Carolina Panthers halls of fame. Mills played his college football at Division III Montclair State.
“Here’s the deal,” Steve Campbell continued. “There are great players at every level of college football, especially at the skill positions. It would not surprise me at all if you see more players moving up a level with NIL and the portal.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/14163514/AP25257112784465.jpg,,,2025-09-14 17:57:04.598159

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Apologies, shaming and a state employee’s departure have come to Indiana following insensitive posts and comments about the murder of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.
Kirk was assassinated Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University.
Indiana’s Department of Child Services posted on social media Saturday, Sept. 13, that a worker was no longer with the agency after making a comment that was in poor taste and “does not reflect the values of this agency or the standards that have been set by this administration.”
“As public servants, state employees are held to a higher standard of conduct and ethics,” the statement continued. “That is certainly the case at the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) where child welfare and safety are paramount.”
Then, the post asked the public to stop calling Indiana’s Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline to complain about the former employee and also stop calling DCS offices about it.
“Our team members assigned to the hotline work 24/7 to address genuine child safety concerns throughout Indiana’s 92 counties,” the agency said. “Overwhelming the hotline and offices with complaints unrelated to child safety only hampers our ability to respond to emergencies.”
DCS would not confirm if the employee was fired or if she resigned.
Libs of TikTok, a conservative account, highlighted the woman’s statement: “Today was a real pain in the neck but I survived.”
Ball State University is dealing with a similar issue.
“The administration at Ball State University is aware of social media posts by two university employees. Both posts were on the employees’ personal accounts, and the posts do not reflect the culture on our campus nor the enduring values of the university,” the university said in a Friday statement. “The administration is gathering additional information about the posts in order to determine what discipline, if any, is appropriate and permissible under the First Amendment to the Constitution.”
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita also has a message for Hoosiers: “If you have evidence of Indiana educators or school administrators making comments that celebrate or rationalize the assassination of Charlie Kirk, we need to hear from you. These individuals must be held accountable — they have no place teaching our students.”
He encouraged people to submit evidence to his Eyes on Education portal, which previously has been used to report pro-diversity and pro-LGBTQ actions or materials.
Meanwhile, the Bartholomew County Democratic Party apologized for a post it made about Kirk.
The group had posted a news article about Kirk’s death with the comment, “Violent delights have violent ends.”
In a statement, the county party said Kirk “spent a good deal of his time advocating for the second amendment even to the moment that it took his life. In trying to convey the tragedy of this, a quote was taken from a well known Shakespearean tragedy. The quote was a message given that such a great passion like this could result in a terrible end, as this death was. It is obvious that our post was not received in the way it was meant and we are terribly sorry for the hurt it has caused.”
The party continued by saying, “We do empathize greatly with those who have lost people to gun violence and the pain that it brings, so we removed our post and its reminders from our page. We promise to be more mindful about our quote selections in the future. As always, we do not condone gun violence nor violence of any nature no matter what.”
Breitbart also published a story about a staffer for U.S. Rep. André Carson who posted the following on Instagram:
“Charlie Kirk isn’t a martyr. He’s a casualty of the violence he incited.”
“You’re never going to gaslight me into mourning a Nazi. Never.”
Carson has not commented directly on the staffer, but did condemn political violence in a post about receiving a death threat.
“My office received a death threat today — unfortunately, a common occurrence,” he wrote. “Political violence has been normalized for quite some time, and it must end. In this vulnerable time, I join my colleagues across the aisle in calling for compassionate dialogue, not reactionary hate.”

“Our Caucus exists to advance the interests and concerns of African Americans across Michigan – ensuring equitable access to education, homeownership, economic opportunity, and the full promise of the American Dream,” Caucus Chairman Keith Williams said in a statement. “Congresswoman Stevens embodies these values and has proven, through both her record and her vision, that she meets our high standards.

Stevens also previously garnered support from former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit), U.S Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids), and former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), among others. 
Stevens will face state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018, in the August 2026 Democratic primary.
On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (D-White Lake) is the sole candidate seeking the nomination.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has rated the 2026 Senate race a “toss up” between the two parties.

The timeline of Ed Lazowska’s life in computing doubles as a quick history of the field. From mainframes to PCs to the internet’s public debut in the 1990s and today’s artificial intelligence surge, Lazowska has been both witness and builder.
While he will continue to teach select courses as an emeritus professor at the University of Washington, Lazowsha recently retired and joined Inside Olympia host Austin Jenkins to take stock of a nearly 50-year career in computer science that coincided with the rise of the software industry and the state’s dominant role in it.
He joined the university’s computer science faculty in 1977 and became department chair in 1993. He was the first UW computer science and engineering faculty member elected to the National Academy of Engineering, the first fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the inaugural holder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Chair from 2000 to 2020.
In that role, he was a prime mover behind the infrastructure that let UW scale with Washington’s tech boom. He directed the fundraising campaign for the Paul G. Allen Center, which opened in 2003, and later did the same for the Bill & Melinda Gates Center, a $110 million building that opened in 2019 and doubled the school’s space. Those twin anchors — and the 2017 endowed name change to the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering — expanded degree production and deepened ties with a regional industry that now stretches “from Amazon to Zillow,” with “more than 7,000 engineers” each at Google and Meta in Seattle and Redmond. “We are also, by the way, the center of cloud computing,” he notes. 
That outcome, he argues, was no accident. Washington has spent decades preparing for this moment. “We grew up alongside the industry,” Lazowska says.
Coupled with a track record in research, scholarship and teaching — and outsized advocacy for computing education and entrepreneurship — Lazowska helped turn a strong program into a civic engine that educates talent, anchors research and partners extensively with industry.
Lazowska’s public profile grew in parallel. In addition to roles at the national level, he became a familiar translator at home between campus, Olympia and industry. “I’m a hopeless left winger,” he says with a grin, “but we need to be reasonably pro-business in our cities and in our state,” because the tech sector “is responsible for a fair amount of the resources that allow us to achieve our dreams as a region.”
He views the industry’s cyclical nature with equanimity. After the dot-com bust, the Great Recession and recent post-pandemic layoffs at Microsoft, Oracle, F5 and other companies, his verdict is steady: “Every field has its ups and downs, and computer science has had ups and downs in employment.” The long-term trajectory, he argues, still points up, powered by compounding capability and the elasticity of software demand. The one constant is change — especially now, as artificial intelligence reshapes tools and workflows. “AI caught those of us in the field by surprise,” he says. Even so, he remains bullish: “I’m an optimist. I think that we need to look at applications of AI that are human augmentation rather than human replacement.”
Given the disruption, displacement and volatility, what drew him — and draws students now — to the discipline? Lazowska offers two answers. The narrow one: “All of us like rapid instant gratification. And when you write a computer program and it runs, there’s instant gratification … it’s an intellectual exercise. You’re solving a puzzle.” The broader one: “Computer science gives you the power to change the world … you don’t have physical constraints, only intellectual constraints.”
That worldview has informed how UW teaches in an AI-infused era. The school, he says, encourages facility with new tools while doubling down on fundamentals — problem solving, teamwork and ethics. Debugging, design and verification matter more than ever “because you’re going to have AI generating buggy programs.” And across the university, he argues, every student — not just future AI researchers — needs to be not just literate but fluent in how the technology works and where it fails.
For Seattle, the stakes are generational. The region’s transformation — from Boeing and Physio-Control to platforms, cloud and AI — has brought prosperity and growing pains. But Lazowska believes the path forward is clear: invest “top to bottom, from pre-K through graduate school,” so “our kids are the first-tier beneficiaries of the modern innovation economy we’re creating here.” As he moves into his emeritus role, he has a pragmatic charge to students, educators and policymakers alike: keep building, keep learning and make the machines work for people. If that doesn’t happen, he says, remember the maxim that once featured prominently on his Allen School homepage: “If you’re not part of the steamroller, you’re part of the road.”

The Iowa Great Lakes include seven water bodies in the Okoboji region, including Big Spirit Lake and both East and West Okoboji lakes. Aquatic and fisheries research will inform conservation strategies for the area and other Midwest lake systems. 
Mary Skopec, the executive director of the Iowa Lakeside Laboratory which is located on West Okoboji Lake, said the partnership with DNR will give “graduate students unparalleled opportunities to conduct impactful research.” 
“It’s an investment not just in science, but in the future health and sustainability of our lakes, rivers, and watersheds,” Skopec said. 
Several lakes in the Iowa Great Lakes system have been listed as impaired by the department due to undesirable pH, turbidity and high levels of certain nutrients. 
Mike Hawkins, DNR’s northwest regional fisheries management supervisor, said the fellowship will attract the “brightest graduate students” to the “unique and valuable ecosystem.” 
“The Iowa Great Lakes are not only a natural treasure for our state but also a living laboratory for understanding aquatic systems,” Hawkins said in the press release. “This program ensures that future scientists will have the resources, mentorship, and access they need to continue protecting these waters for generations to come.”
Interested graduate students can apply by contacting Andrew Carlson, the fisheries biologist at the Spirit Lake Fish Hatchery, at andrew.carlson@dnr.iowa.gov.

Lincoln Hough, R-Springfield, on the first day of the 2024 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate died at 1:42 p.m. Friday afternoon when Republican leaders refused to allow debate on a measure weakening the initiative petition process, GOP state Sen. Lincoln Hough said in an interview with The Independent.
A two-week special session to gerrymander Missouri’s congressional map and make it virtually impossible for voters to amend the state constitution ended Friday when Senate Republicans voted to cut off debate and steamroll both bills across the finish line. 
Hough was one of only two Republicans who opposed every motion to cut off debate and voted against the bills. 
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

About 20 minutes after the Senate adjourned, Hough said Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin visited his office and removed him as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. Hough has been chairman or vice chairman of the committee since he joined the Senate in 2019.
“She said, ‘​w​e are tired of fighting with you,’” Hough said. ”To which my response was, ‘did you fight with me this week, or did I just go out here and vote no on something that was handed down to the Missouri Senate and a bunch of elected members who are not allowed to talk?’” 
It was the second time Hough has bucked his party this year when it sought to deploy procedural maneuvers to shut down debate. The first came in near the end of the 2025 session in May on bills repealing voter-approved laws expanding sick leave and protecting abortion rights. 
“What I’ve seen at the end of last session, and what I saw this week, is a dismantling of what the Senate is supposed to be,” Hough said.
O’Laughlin did not respond to text messages seeking comment on Hough’s removal as chairman or his description of how it occurred. As of Saturday morning, the change in the committee line-up had not been posted to the Senate website. 
Hough said he is not sure if he is still a member of the committee.
“I’ll be honest with you,” he said. “When the news was delivered to me, I didn’t ask a lot of follow up questions.”
The other Republican who broke with his party on Friday was state Sen Mike Moon of Ash Grove. Reached by text message Saturday, Moon said he had not been told of any changes in his committee assignments. He chairs the Veterans and Military Affairs Committee and the Select Committee on Equal Protection and DEI.
Moon, who has been punished by Senate Republican leadership in the past for some of his actions, declined to comment on the removal of Hough as Appropriations Committee chairman.
Lawmakers were meeting in their second special session of the year to do the bidding of President Donald Trump and gerrymander the 5th Congressional District to unseat U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat. The Senate passed the new map first, shutting off debate after letting Democrats speak against it for about four hours.
Next came the proposal added to the agenda by Kehoe to require both a majority of statewide votes and a majority of the votes in all eight of the state’s congressional districts to pass constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
But along with the motion to take up the measure, state Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair, sent the motion to cut off debate before it began.
“My understanding of how this process is supposed to work is, if someone brings a bill before the body, then members are given the opportunity to have a conversation about it,” Hough said. “Maybe, I mean, call me crazy, but maybe even draft amendments and think about ways to improve something or change something.”
Republicans used several unprecedented maneuvers to muscle the two measures to final passage. The steps were orchestrated from the start to get the bills finished by Friday afternoon.
Then-Senate Majority Leader Cindy O’Laughlin of Shelbina speaks in May 2023 after passage of a $51.7 billion state budget as Sen. Lincoln Hough of Springfield waits for his turn to speak (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
When the Senate convened, O’Laughlin presented a new set of rules intended to sidestep every opportunity Democrats could use to stall proceedings.
As a result, no senator was allowed to introduce a bill during the special session, the daily journal was never presented to the body for approval and House-passed legislation became the chamber’s top official priority for the first time in its existence.
The procedural step to shut off debate, called the previous question, is commonly used by the majority in the 163-member Missouri House, where no member can speak for more than 15 minutes on a topic, to move priority legislation.
But until this year, it was a rare move in the Senate, where the rules allow a member to speak as long as they like on any subject once they have the floor. Invoking the rule requires a motion signed by 10 senators.
The previous question has been used to move four bills this year, twice in the regular session and twice in the special session. It was also used to implement the new Senate rules. 
But it had never before been used to pass a bill without any debate at all.
“It’s pretty easy to pass legislation in the Missouri Senate if you don’t have to talk about it, and you can just bring it before the body and say, we’re not, we’re not going to have any discussion whatsoever,” Hough said.
The Republican Party, he said, is suppressing every element that doesn’t walk in lockstep with the Trump White House. 
“It seems that if you have any independent thought, or even just raise a question, you have a problem with this Republican Party,” Hough said. “And that is not the Republican Party that, 15 years ago when I first ran for the House, that I was part of.”
His disagreement with the procedures used to pass the legislation didn’t upset the progress of the bills. Shutting off debate requires 18 votes, and the fewest on any motion was 19.
“This is a dark day in the Missouri Senate,” Hough said. “It is a dark day when policy differences lead to the dismantling of the institution and the removal of individuals from chairmanships.”
In his seven years on the appropriations committee, Hough has shown himself as detail-oriented and able to build consensus while taking a tough negotiating position during final budget talks with the House.
With one more legislative session in his term-limited tenure, Hough won’t have to worry about pleasing leadership.
The upcoming budget could prove to be the most difficult to write in many years. When Kehoe vetoed $300 million in spending items in June, the news release accompanying the action said the state budget office was forecasting a general revenue shortfall of nearly $1 billion in the coming fiscal year.
“We’re definitely,” Hough said, “going to have some conversations about the direction of the state’s finances next year.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/010324_hough1-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-09-14 09:56:16.020144

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune was hot under the collar. It wasn’t just because of the August weather, or the crowd at the Dakotafest agricultural trade show in Mitchell, or the pole barn where the crowd was jammed in. Thune was hot because of the way he’s being treated by Senate Democrats.
Those pesky Democrats have thrown up as many roadblocks as they can to delay the filling of more than 1,300 positions in the Trump administration that require Senate confirmation. “We spend two-thirds of our time on personnel in the United States Senate,” Thune said, according to a Dakota Scout story, calling the resistance from the minority party “unprecedented.”
In a recent op-ed, Thune promised that Senate Republicans are working on a rule change that should hurry the process along.
Thune anticipates ‘big fight’ in September over potential government shutdown

Gone are the days of the Senate gentlemen’s club where the prevailing tradition was that a president should be allowed to have the nominees he wanted. Thune said 90% of President Barack Obama’s nominees were approved by unanimous consent, a fast way to approve nominees that skips committee hearings and floor debate. About 60% of President Joe Biden’s appointees were approved that way. In Trump’s first term, about half of his nominees were approved without hearings or debates.
The downward trend in using unanimous consent is a direct result of the ideological split in this country. To date, none of Trump’s appointees during his second term have been approved by unanimous consent.
The irony here is that Trump can’t get approval for the people he wants to serve in his administration while, during his first months in office, he’s been busy firing or furloughing thousands of federal government employees.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sworn to use every weapon in his arsenal to block the Trump agenda. It looks like that includes slowing the Senate confirmation process to a glacial pace.
Senate Democrats may have acted more favorably toward Trump’s nominees if his Cabinet choices to be the leaders in his government weren’t so astoundingly unqualified. In Trump’s first term, he chose high-ranking officials as if casting a movie. They had to have the right look, but with the right look came a reasonable amount of competence. In Trump 2.0, the need for competence has been discarded. This time out, the prevailing quality to serve in the Trump administration is blind loyalty to the president.
There’s no doubting that the likes of Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are loyal to Trump. Their competence at running the Pentagon, intelligence agencies and the nation’s health care are frequently and rightfully questioned. Life probably wouldn’t be so tough for Thune if he and his Senate Republican colleagues had shown some backbone and told the president that competence had to be the standard for Cabinet secretaries rather than just fawning loyalty to the president.

It’s easy to understand Thune’s frustration. However, he and Senate Republicans brought this on themselves by treating Trump’s Cabinet selections as if they were serious choices rather than a presidential power play to show that he could get anyone he wanted approved by the Senate.
This space has been used before to note that Thune may come to regret, if he doesn’t already, his rise to the top Senate leadership post of his party during a Trump administration. As he complains about the long days he has to put in while fulfilling that role, he should remember that he won the office by claiming that Sen. Tom Daschle was paying too much attention to Senate leadership and not enough attention to South Dakota’s needs.
Senate Democrats may be throwing up roadblocks to Trump’s agenda, but for Republicans this is a self-inflicted wound developed by currying favor with the president rather than doing their jobs. Despite Thune’s complaints, the slow pace of approval for Trump’s nominees is likely what’s best for the country. That’s particularly the case if the nominees Trump seeks to work in his government are anything like the clown car he calls a Cabinet.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/e591A0833-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-14 08:56:29.802477

The scooters (about $1,400) can go 30 mph.  The skateboards (about $700) top out at 32 mph).  But following simple instructions on the web, the speed governor can be disabled allowing even faster speeds…up to 60 mph.  That modification is illegal in Connecticut.


Many adults and kids use this new gear responsibly.  Parents love them as it gives their kids mobility (meaning less chauffeuring).  But even at slower speeds these vehicles are dangerous, their riders unprotected in the event of a fall or collision. 
In July a 15-year-old in Trumbull was killed on his e-bike when he was hit by a car.
That’s why new laws are coming in Connecticut October 1 regulating these devices.
If your e-scooter has no pedals (so it’s not a moped) and a motor over 750 watts (allowing speeds over 30 mph), you’ll need a driver’s license. 
E-bikes with motors over 3,500 watts (meaning speeds over 50 mph) must be registered and insured like a motorcycle, and a motorcycle endorsement is required on your license to ride them. 


Unless the scooter is built for two seats, passengers are not allowed.  And e-bikes of all types are not allowed on sidewalks.
It is illegal to operate any motorized vehicle with a seat lower than 26 inches on public roads. That includes many of the smaller scooters and mini-motorbikes that are often marketed toward children.
Everyone on an e-bike or skateboard under the age of 18 must wear a helmet.
E-skateboards are not allowed to drive faster than 20 mph.  Riders must be at least 15 years old but the vehicles do not need to be registered if under that speed limit.  Local laws may be stricter for safety.  Best to ask your Police Department.
If all of these new regulations seem confusing or overly  restrictive, read the recent commentary by State Rep. Tracy Marra which started with the eye-catching headline… “I saw your kid almost die today”.
Increased mobility is great.  But safety must always come first.
If you’re a driver you already know how disconcerting it can be when these e-devices come hurtling along, almost silently and without notice.  But you’re the one driving a ton of steel, so give them their space.
Can law enforcement keep up with all this?  Should they be responsible?
As one First Selectman said the other day:  “It’s not a good thing to have police chasing after 10-, 11- and 12-year olds on bikes and ticketing them.  I’m not anxious to take a police officer away from other enforcement operations.”
What’s the answer, if not enforcement?  Education and parental responsibility.
There’s no way teens can afford these e-bikes on their allowance money.  They’re obviously being purchased by parents, happy to get out of squiring them around from school to dance class to the Y.  Those parents should be responsible for making sure their kids are safe… and legal.
We all love our kids, right?",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Electric_scooters.jpg,,,2025-09-14 07:56:41.156569

It’s no secret that alerts to crime victims in Vermont were full of flaws. This spring, attention from lawmakers put a spotlight on the issue — illuminating that gaps in alerts caused some victims life-altering harm. 
So, lawmakers assembled a task force to make changes to the state notification system called VINE, which stands for Victim Information Notification Everyday. 
Recently, employees at the Department of Corrections quietly made changes to VINE, which they claim will help victims and make the system more trauma-informed. But other task force members think the changes will have the opposite effect — and were left in the dark. 
“I hope that they’re reconsidering it,” said Tim Lueders-Dumont, executive director of the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs. 
Crime victims in Vermont have the legal right to get timely notifications about the movement of those charged with or convicted of harming them. Once someone is behind bars, they’re entered into VINE. And victims can sign up to get VINE alerts on someone’s custody status or whereabouts via call, text or email. 
Although victim advocates in Lueders-Dumont’s department interact with the system regularly, he had no input in the changes to the platform and wasn’t formally notified until after they went into effect. 
That’s because VINE is paid for and managed by the Department of Corrections, which runs the state’s six prisons. The department’s victim specialists, along with state’s attorneys’ advocates, rely on the automated system to notify victims because they typically juggle very high case loads. 
But Vermonters have suffered because of high-stakes errors in the VINE system. 
Sometimes faulty alerts told victims that an offender was being released when they were actually being transferred to a different prison. Other times, an offender was released from prison with no notice to the victim until days later. That perpetrator sometimes came back and harmed the victim again, due to the delayed alert. 
Many victims also resent the automated nature of the notifications — with phone calls containing potentially triggering information coming from a cold, robotic voice. 
In the past, victims would get an alert if their offender was transferred from one prison to another, or if they were going to appear in court in person. 
But this summer, the Department of Corrections decided it would no longer notify victims in those circumstances. The department didn’t consult with Lueders-Dumont about the changes or let him know upfront that it was changing the system, he said. 
Jenn Poehlmann, executive director for the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services and chair of the task force, has long advocated for making the notifications customizable, so each victim can decide what types of info they want to receive. 
“The point was that this task force was going to increase options and choice for victims,” she said. Eliminating more of the platform’s services only decreases those options, she said.
Poehlmann called it “concerning” that everyone else was left in the dark. Lueders-Dumont said he wishes he was clued in earlier, so that his advocates could be aware — and make victims aware — of the change in services. 
The department justified its decision in a later memo, per Lueders-Dumont’s request. 
Jon Murad, interim commissioner of the department, explained the VINE services scratched by his department “often led to unnecessary confusion, distress, or retraumatization.” 
The notifications were “doing more harm than good,” said Ashley Fisk, a corrections Senior Victim Services Specialist, in an interview with VTDigger. “(Victims) would call us immediately and want to know specifics that we didn’t have,” she said. 
But other members on the task force disagree. 
Lueders-Dumont said his advocates are opposed to the change. “It’s not representative of the conversations we’ve had with victims,” he said. 
Victims who enrolled for VINE were told they would get the alerts that have now been discontinued, Lueders-Dumont said. Victims want to receive those updates and should be able to get them, he said. 
If a victim lives in the same town as a prison, they may not want their perpetrator living close by, he said. And he’s seen cases where victims have wanted the comfort of distance, he said. 
In turn, Cassidy Renfrew, field operations manager for the department, said that victims who have that concern could use the department’s publicly accessible offender locator online to see where someone’s imprisoned. 
Lueders-Dumont and Poehlmann also take issue with ending alerts that notify victims when an alleged offender is taken to court.
Many victims base their decision to appear in court on whether their offender will be present, Lueders-Dumont said. Crime suspects who are held in prison can tune into hearings virtually via WebEx. VINE offered a way for victims to find out ahead of time if their offender is appearing in-person in court, he said. 
There’s already been at least one instance in which a victim went to court and was surprised to see their offender in the room, Poehlmann said. 
“That should never happen,” she said. 
Renfrew argued that even without the VINE notification, victims could find out if an alleged offender is appearing in-person or virtually because the court typically decides ahead of time whether an alleged offender will appear in-person, she said. 
In the future, Lueders-Dumont hopes he finds out about any future changes ahead of time, even if he disagrees with them. “I request a formal notification so that I can distribute that information to our whole field so they’re at least not surprised,” he said. 
Lueders-Dumont asked the Corrections Department to send formal memos about any future changes. He, Poehlmann and the Corrections Department are working on a formal memorandum of understanding to keep everyone on the same page. 
True collaboration means transparency and better communication, Poehlmann said. 
“That’s what the Legislature wanted us to do for victims and survivors, and that’s what we need to do,” she said.

Why does Vermont keep choosing an all-payer approach to health care reform, as if bringing in — and regulating — the payers will be the solution?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Miriam Tatum: The current approach to health care reform isn’t working for Vermonters.","This commentary is by Miriam Tatum, of Derby. Tatum is a retired pediatrician in primary care and community hospital care for 30 years in Newport and Derby Line. She is an ally of the Vermont Worker Center.


Almost a year ago, Newport and Northeast Kingdom residents first heard that a consultant to the Green Mountain Care Board recommended converting North Country Hospital’s inpatient, emergency room and surgical services to primary care offices and an urgent care clinic. 
Fortunately, hospital leaders and concerned citizens spoke up immediately to correct the consultant’s data and to remind the Green Mountain Care Board that without a fully staffed emergency room in Newport, a resident from the Northeast Kingdom could face a one- to three-hour ambulance ride to lifesaving care. 
The hospital board rejected the consultant’s recommendation and took quick action to decrease administrative costs, improve billing services, protect recruitment and retention, and begin collaboration with St. Johnsbury’s community hospital for needed specialty care. As reported recently, the hospital’s budget for 2026 leaves inpatient, surgical and emergency room services intact, and has been approved by the Green Mountain Care Board as submitted.
Meanwhile, statewide efforts at health care payment reform, launched in 2017 as the all-payer model have not met their target goal of containing health care costs while improving population health. 
OneCare Vermont, the accountable care organization that administered the all-payer model, will shut down at the end of 2025, and Vermont plans to sign on to a new program named the All Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, with a timeline of 2026 to 2037. It would be supported with funds from Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance companies. Oversight of payers and hospitals by the Green Mountain Care Board and the Vermont Legislature is expected to continue. 
Will this second version of payment reform be any more successful than the first? 
Hopefully it won’t be challenged by another pandemic with the shutdown of hospitals. But it will face funding cuts (no more premium subsidies on Vermont Health Connect) that leave more Vermonters uninsured and inevitably shift the burden of care to hospitals. 
Future funding cuts scheduled for 2027 will threaten successful Vermont programs like Dr. Dynasaur, Blueprint for Health, the Vermont Department of Health with community health workers, Support and Services at Home, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
It will be difficult to improve population health in our community without these proven cost-effective services. 
Why does Vermont keep choosing an all-payer approach to health care reform, as if bringing in — and regulating — the payers will be the solution? 
Perhaps it’s time to boldly shift our focus to insuring all people with universal health care that is state-administered and privately delivered. We are already on that path, which Vermont legislation passed in 2011 to create a single-payer system (though it was never implemented), and with Vermont hospitals already accustomed to operating on pooled funds from Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurances. 
If we’re told the single-payer model is too expensive or won’t work, let’s remember that the current system doesn’t work and costs too much — not just in dollars, but in our own health and our communities’ health.

This story by Tim Calabro was first published in The Herald on Sept. 11, 2025.
Phill Gatenby rolled over the Moxley Bridge in Chelsea with a plastic skeleton riding shotgun in his Jeep, having made the long drive from Brattleboro for an early morning visit. Just a year ago, the Manchester, England native — by way of Florida — had never laid eyes on a covered bridge. Now he’s smitten.
Gatenby recalled seeing a covered bridge while driving around and thinking, “Oh, that’s interesting. I’d never seen a covered bridge in my life before. Never really heard of them,” he said. “A couple days later, I was going to Townshend, and all of a sudden it’s the Dummerston Bridge, and I’m just like, different size, different shape, different color.”
He stopped for directions and as he got lost on the back roads, he saw more and more covered bridges.
What started as casual curiosity has evolved into a quest: visit and film all 100 of Vermont’s authentic, historic covered bridges and share the journey on YouTube in a series titled “Vermont’s 100 Covered Bridges.”
So far he’s been to 50 and cranked out 37 videos of his visits — one every Sunday.
The most recent set of episodes has focused on the covered bridges of Tunbridge, Chelsea, and Randolph.
No two are quite alike. From king and queen trusses to parallelogram-shaped spans built on bends, like some on the First Branch, Gatenby has come to appreciate their variety and character.
And, stepping back from the bridges, the entire scene fascinates Gatenby.
“I mentioned this in the Kingsbury Bridge [episode]. I was at the bridge and I looked, and you’ve got the green mountains in the background and rolling hills. Then you’ve got the farm with the — is it the corn towers? —  the river and a covered bridge. And it just says, like, you can’t get more Vermont!”
Gatenby’s process is rigorous. Each episode takes hours to shoot and edit. He gets different angles — sometimes driving through a bridge three or four times for the right shot. He’s waded into rivers, climbed steep banks, and once filmed inside a long-retired bridge that had been turned into a town shed.
“I try and do something that’s consistent,” he says. “So it’s, you know, the same start, the same middle. I go in the river. I’ve been in every single river so far.”
Gatenby credits community access TV stations — first Okemo Valley TV in Ludlow and now Brattleboro Community TV — for helping him build his skills and loaning him equipment.
“They literally brilliantly sat down and five, six, seven weeks went through how you do it,” he recalled.
Gatenby’s episodes go out via Okemo Valley TV’s YouTube channel and have regular times on the Okemo Valley and Brattleboro TV stations.
Form, Function, History
Vermont once had more than 600 covered bridges, Gatenby noted, but flooding and age have winnowed down the number greatly. Now, 100 remain and many towns hold clusters of them.
Tunbridge, for example, boasts five (Flint, Larkin, Mill, Cilley and Howe), with the Moxley bridge just over the Chelsea line. Randolph has three (Kingsbury, Gifford, and Braley or Johnson), all of them along the Second Branch.
Gatenby pointed out that three of the First Branch bridges were built by the same person, Arthur Adams. That’s a phenomenon common to covered bridges, Gatenby noted. Oftentimes the same person who had the skills to build a bridge would become the area’s go-to expert.
As Gatenby visits each of the 100 covered bridges spread throughout the state, he points out the history and construction techniques used in each, particularly the suspension methods unique to covered bridges. Most covered bridges in the White River Valley make use of modified king trusses, posts fitted into a triangle, which provide strength to the structure. Some, like the Moxley bridge, use both king trusses and square queen trusses around them.
Vermont’s covered bridges aren’t just structural relics, though — they’re cultural icons.
Some have graced the silver screen, including the Kingsbury Bridge in Randolph, used by Alfred Hitchcock as scenery in his 1955 film “The Trouble with Harry.”
“North by Northwest” has its dramatic crop duster strafing Cary Grant, Gatenby jokes in one of his episodes before cutting to a humble, scenic shot featuring the South Randolph bridge. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite as glamorous as that!”
The Chiselville bridge in Sunderland — Gatenby’s favorite so far — featured in “Baby Boom,” Diane Keaton’s 1987 film, and a year later, in the 1988 Chevy Chase and Madolyun Smith Osborne comedy, the Upper Falls bridge in Weathersfield made for a memorable gag (“I wouldn’t go that way if I were you”).
Another memorable stop is East Corinth, where the prop bridge used in “Beetlejuice” was fabricated out of whole cloth for the two weeks of filming. “Thousands of people go there every year,” he said, noting that the set-piece, used now as a shed at a ski area, doesn’t count among the authentic and historic bridges he films.
Nor, he said, does the Quechee Bridge. Though it is often mistaken for a traditional covered bridge, it’s just a facade.
“It’s concrete and steel. There’s very little wood,” Gatenby said. “You see the wood on the outside and the roof.”
Traditional bridges are completely made from wood and use a variety of truss systems to strengthen the span.
Place and Purpose
Gatenby moved to Vermont from Florida in July of last year. He now lives in Brattleboro with his wife and works as a shift supervisor at a home for adults with mental health issues.
“I’m a trained youth worker in England,” he said, having spent years working for the Prince’s Trust, a charity founded by King Charles. His day job might be demanding, but the early hours leave room for exploration.
“Three o’clock to 11:30 at night, so the daytime allows me to spend time in the TV studio,” he says. That flexibility has enabled him to squeeze in long road trips, sometimes filming six or seven bridges in a single day. “I’ve got to do minimum six, seven bridges each trip now,” he added. “To make it worth it.”
This Sunday, the show’s 38th episode will be released.
“I’m doing a little special 50th episode,” he said, noting the halfway point in the 100-bridge journey. “That’s where I’m bringing in stuff like the Quechee bridge. Because people said, ‘Oh, you didn’t go to the Quechee.’”
As the series nears its midpoint, Gatenby’s audience is slowly growing, both online and in the communities he visits.
“It’s just amazing … you know, and I’m just visiting them all,” he said, “places that I wouldn’t have got to see otherwise.”
With 50 more bridges to go, Vermont’s covered bridge guy still has miles to travel and stories to uncover.Gatenby’s series of covered bridge videos can be watched on Okemo Valley and Brattleboro public television stations or found on YouTube.

In its life at Shelburne Museum, the Ticonderoga will be repaired and replaced in parts. It will be preserved in spirit even as many of the original materials waste away.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in the Shelburne News on Sept. 11, 2025.
It was a novel thing in 1955 to move a steamboat across the land. It’s still inexplicable: deciding to sink an 892-ton boat down onto railroad freight cars in the dead of winter, hauling custom-built tracks from behind the boat up to the front as it inched across the landscape, all to make it part of a museum.
Electra Havermeyer Webb, the founder of Shelburne Museum, was big on novel ideas. Before the Ticonderoga, she already had at least eight structures moved onto the museum grounds, including a 19th century lighthouse from Colchester and a historic jail from across the state in Castleton.
It took a little over two months to move the boat, which had been chugging around Lake Champlain since it was built in 1906 at the Shelburne shipyard. It never moved more than 250 feet in a day.
“I think she instilled a lot of pride in the people that worked around her and in the endeavor of what was going on here, what she was creating. I think most of the workmen around building the museum had a great fondness and respect for her, and it takes a special leader to be able to do that,” Chip Stulen, the museum’s director of preservation, said.

Stulen has been in charge of breathing life into the Ticonderoga for almost half the time that it’s been on land. In 1993 when he was first hired, he said the boat had fallen into disrepair, although maybe not in a way that was always obvious to visitors.
“You could open up a room and you could see moss growing on the carpet, and not only that moss on the carpet, but you had ferns growing out of it,” Stulen said.
When the boat had been on water, he noted, it had an entire crew looking after it. But then, once it was a part of the museum, it had to compete with all the other structures that needed care. The project of making sure a boat, never meant to stand forever in the grass, stayed sea-worthy fell behind.
Some of the work that had been done previously had even caused further issues. Stulen said some of the patch jobs to leaks ended up causing even more condensation — when he started, guides were moving an estimated 30 buckets around the boat to catch the drips.
In the mid-1990s, the museum undertook a massive restoration of the Ticonderoga, with Stulen steering the ship (pun intended).
“We were basically taking the boat apart and then putting it back together again. So, we were opening up areas on the Ti that nobody had seen before, except for the workmen that put it together,” Stulen said.
When Havermeyer Webb had the Ticonderoga moved to the museum, it hadn’t come with a blueprint — no index of materials or list of manufacturers.
According to Stulen, preserving the ship has sometimes meant finding inventive ways to mimic its original design.
For example, a significant portion of the interior flooring of the boat is made of rubber puzzle piece-shaped tiles, their red tabs pressed seamlessly together. In contemporary times, the tiles are not just unique, they’re essentially obsolete.

Stulen had to find a company in California that would make them to order. Luckily, the museum ended up with a surplus. The tiles cover the grand staircase and the landing beneath. However, someday, the surplus will run out again.
Preservation is a continual process.
As Stulen sat on the deck of the Ti last week in one of the caned chairs lined up for visitors, a worker nearby braided in a new piece of the diamond-patterned roping that acts as a deck fence and, at one point, carried away one of the many wooden pillars holding up the ceiling for repair.
Even parts of the pillars have needed to be replaced. Stulen has worked to find similar wood, sometimes needing to repair the repairs.
“I’m continually amazed by the old growth material that was on the Ti where the grain is so tight that it has longevity to it,” Stulen said. “And even five years later, we were coming back, having to repair that.”
In its life at Shelburne Museum, the Ticonderoga will be repaired and replaced in parts. It will be preserved in spirit even as many of the original materials waste away. Preservation is about staying as close as possible to the original, but in preserving shape and material and style, Stulen is also preserving stories.
Stories of passengers crisscrossing the lake, of the advent of motor vehicles climbing ramps to board and at least one story of a very cramped elephant seeking passage.
“It’s under my skin,” Stulen said. “I remember early on, I’d stand up on the upper deck by the walking beam, and because you could see the lake at that time from there, you just sort of stood there and kind of imagined the boat moving a little bit.”
The Shelburne Museum will be holding events September 11-14 to celebrate 70 years of the Ticonderoga.

“I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, ‘If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is,’” Kurt Vonnegut entreated us. It’s easy enough to find humor and magic in silver linings as a kid; less so, as we begin reading the news and paying bills. But “silliness-in-spite-of” is a quality this week’s poet, Gretchen Wertlieb of South Burlington, might argue is essential for our wellbeing, and for a life well-lived – might even, by one definition, be translated as “resilience.”

Ode to the simply whimsical and the unnecessarily dramatic
Gretchen Wertlieb, 17, South Burlington
Ode to those who make life into gold,
who bring us some sparkle as we grow old.
Ode to the places, friends, and small things,
for which credit is unequal to the joy that they bring.

Uproariously laughing in a too-quiet room,
or dancing a tango with the red kitchen broom.
The rush of arriving in the nick of time
to catch what is gone in the blink of an eye.

Ode to the fails, the crashes, the burns,
and ode to whomever they might concern.
Ode to friends, old and new, who you’ll never let go,
ode to kindness to all, even ones you don’t know. 

Ode to novels, and stories, and handwritten verses,
long, run-on titles and believing in curses.
Ode to the feelings of heartache and loss,
ode to humanity, with all its faults.

“Cheers!” to the drama, the flair, the hurrahs,
the fainting couches, glitter, and decorative bras.
To all the outrageous, exciting, and new,
and to far too much confidence in the things that you do.

The quest of life viewed with a pair of fresh eyes
brings ambition to act and take to the skies.
Ode to the rhyme, the rhythm, the beat,
for wherever you go, that’s all you will need.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-14 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Rising costs of exchange health insurance could be major issue in 2026 U.S. Senate election,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/14/rising-costs-of-exchange-health-insurance-could-be-major-issue-in-2026-u-s-senate-election/,The rising costs of health insurance on the ACA exchange could be issue in 2026 Senate election between Democrat Scott Colom and  incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith.,"The expected rising costs for health insurance could give Democratic candidate Scott Colom a line of attack in next year’s election against incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith.
It is an issue that will hit tens of thousands of Mississippians right dab in their faces and in their pocketbooks when they go to renew their health insurance policies later this year and see how much their monthly premiums have increased.
Colom, a longtime district attorney from Columbus, can hammer Hyde-Smith for the rising costs. After all, the rising costs could be traced directly to Hyde-Smith and her allies if the Republican-led U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump do not act to prevent the increase in health insurance premium costs for about 285,000 Mississippians who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act exchange or marketplace.
Unless Congress acts before the end of the year, the price of the marketplace’s health insurance policies will increase an estimated $480 annually in Mississippi, according to KFF, a national group that conducts health care research. And based on other factors, such as inflation, the increase could be significantly more.
While the enhanced federal assistance helps primarily lower income people or the working poor, the end of the enhanced federal assistance also could mean more affluent Mississippians who depend on the marketplace policies would no longer be eligible for any federal help.
During the administration of former President Joe Biden, lawmakers passed legislation to enhance the federal aid provided to people who purchase insurance through the ACA marketplace. Lower income people already received some help with the cost of the marketplace policies as an important part of the Affordable Care Act, but the Biden-era legislation increased the amount of help. And under the Biden legislation, wealthier people would be eligible for federal assistance if their health insurance costs more than 8.5% of their total earnings.
Hyde-Smith, like other members of the Mississippi congressional delegation, voted against the enhanced federal assistance for the marketplace policies.
In the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill passed earlier this year, Trump and the Republican Congress were careful to ensure that the cuts to Medicaid and other programs would not go into effect until after the 2026 midterm election, when Colom is challenging Hyde-Smith.
But Congress did not take any action in the One Big Beautiful Bill to ensure that the enhanced federal marketplace assistance did not end before the 2026 elections, leaving rising health care costs as an issue for Colom and others.
Mississippi will be hit particularly hard by the end of the federal aid for the cost of marketplace policies.
Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF. Only Texas has seen a greater increase at 255%.
Unsurprisingly, the states where the participation has increased the most are all red states that in most cases have not expanded Medicaid to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor, with the federal government paying the bulk of the costs. In states where there is no Medicaid expansion, data shows that the working poor flocked to the exchange to garner health insurance.
It should be pointed out that the end of the enhanced federal assistance for marketplace policies will hurt not just those having to pay the higher premiums for the marketplace policies, but the state of Mississippi as a whole. Hospitals and other medical providers, already struggling, will be forced to provide more uncompensated care or pass those costs on to other Mississippians who do have health insurance.
Despite those health care issues, Hyde-Smith will be a heavy favorite to win reelection in Mississippi, where a Democrat has not won a U.S. Senate election since 1982.
But if Colom can connect rising health insurance costs to Hyde-Smith, that could be a powerful issue.
Of course, Hyde-Smith and the Republican Congress have until the end of the year to act and prevent people from having to pay more for marketplace plans.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28164737/3X0A6641.jpg,,,2025-09-14 07:56:41.156569

Kennedy Jr. after Kennedy's confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, 2025. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)As a licensed clinical social worker, a grassroots community organizer and public health advocate in Northeast Louisiana, I eagerly anticipated hearing U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy’s timely insights at a recent event in West Monroe. However, as a concerned voter and mother of two young children, I was not only left with my fears unassuaged, but also a spirit deeply unsettled for our nation’s health and the future my children will inherit.
Cassidy cast the deciding vote to confirm U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy after he promised to uphold vaccine confidence and scientific integrity. He has since broken those commitments, spreading misinformation, undermining public health and endangering lives.
During Cassidy’s visit in West Monroe, I asked him pointedly: “Aside from removing RFK Jr. as HHS Secretary and confirming a more competent appointee, how do you plan to protect Americans’ access to vaccines, especially for our most vulnerable babies aged 0-3 years old?”
I appreciated his initial robust response, likening fighting vaccine-preventable disease to “biological warfare.” Cassidy also said he was upset with the termination of mRNA research. It was evident how passionately he feels about protecting access to lifesaving vaccines.
However, everything fell flat with his non sequitur closing statement
“I don’t know, but I’m working on it,” the senator said.
I’m here to say: we do know, and we have coalitions across the nation who are also “working on it.” Here are a few simple ways we can stand up to the deadly disinformation sweeping our nation.
First, there is an alternative to RFK Jr.’s radical and scientifically unsound “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.
Defending Public Health has put out a report titled “Improving the Health of Americans Together.” The all-volunteer network of doctors, health care professionals, and public health advocates — not incentivized by pharmaceutical or special interest influences – promotes “an evidence-based framework for addressing the root causes of illness in the U.S.”
Thankfully, many courageous patriots are already rising to the occasion. I’m reminded of Mordecai’s words in Esther 4:14: “if you keep quiet at a time like this, deliverance and relief … will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this?”
Today’s “some other place” is the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy’s Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota. This initiative is a direct and credible response to Secretary Kenndy’s dismantling of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee, with the goal of “safeguarding vaccine use in the U.S. so that it remains grounded in the best available science, free from external influence, and focused on optimizing protection of individuals, families, and communities against vaccine-preventable diseases.”
Senator Cassidy, history will remember whether you protected the health of our people or stood silent as Americans suffered. I urge you to consider whether RFK Jr.’s continued leadership is consistent with the oath he took, as well as your oath as a physician to do no harm — and to stand on the side of truth, health and life.
I am doing all I can to give my children the future they deserve. Let’s “work on it” together.

(Photo by Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)U.S. Food and Drug Administration leaders under President Donald Trump are moving to abandon a decades-old policy of asking outside experts to review drug applications, a move critics say would shield the agency’s decisions from public scrutiny.
The agency “would like to get away” from assembling panels of experts to examine and vote on individual drugs, because “I don’t think they’re needed,” said George Tidmarsh, head of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. He relayed the message Tuesday at a meeting of health care product makers and Wednesday to an FDA advocacy group.
In addition to being redundant, Tidmarsh said, advisory meetings on specific drugs were “a tremendous amount of work for the company and for the FDA. We want to use that work and our time to focus on the big questions.”
The FDA’s advisory committees were created in their current form by a 1972 law aimed at expanding and regulating the government’s use of experts in technical decisions. They’re periodically summoned for advice, including to review evidence and vote on whether the FDA should approve drugs, vaccines, and medical devices, often when FDA officials face a difficult decision.
FDA actions have traditionally aligned with committee votes. A departure can provoke controversy and public debate, as was the case with the split 2021 decision on whether to approve the Biogen drug Aduhelm to treat Alzheimer’s disease.
The FDA approved the drug despite a “no” vote from its advisory committee, whose members felt the medicine did little to treat the disease. The conflict over Aduhelm laid bare the FDA’s struggle to reconcile pressure from industry and desperate patients with its rigorous evaluation of drug risks and benefits.

Tidmarsh said the committees would still be consulted on general issues like how to regulate different classes of drugs. But meetings on specific drugs, in which experts plow through piles of studies and hours of testimony from FDA and company officials, were mainly useful, he said, because they allowed the public to see how the FDA worked.
This month the FDA began publishing the “complete response letters” it sends to companies when it declines to approve their products. Releasing the letters, which previously required filing requests under the federal Freedom of Information Act, promotes a level of transparency akin to the advisory meetings’, Tidmarsh said.
Advisory committee meetings on individual drugs “are redundant when you have the complete review letters,” he told KFF Health News in a brief interview after appearing at the health care products conference.
Former FDA officials and academics who study the agency disagree. The meetings help FDA scientists make decisions and increase public understanding of drug regulation, and abandoning them doesn’t make sense, they said.
Tidmarsh’s reasoning is “hard to follow,” former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told KFF Health News. “It’s extremely useful for people inside FDA to find out what other experts think before they make their final decisions. And it’s important to do that in a way that enables the public to understand the points of view.”
“Experts might ask questions of the company or FDA that neither of them thought of on their own,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, an associate professor of bioethics and law at the University of Pennsylvania. “The public has few other opportunities to comment about FDA decisions.”
Spokespeople for FDA and the Health and Human Services Department did not respond to repeated requests for elaboration on Tidmarsh’s comments.

Califf at times disagreed with advisory committees as commissioner of the agency and once floated the idea that it might be better if they deliberated but did not vote on products. Still, while “maybe someone can come up with a better one, I always thought it was an amazing system,” he said.
The FDA is not obliged to ask the outside experts to review drugs and usually hasn’t. It calls on them mainly for important new types of medications or when a decision is especially tricky because of high demand for a product that may have limited value, Aduhelm being a classic example.
The advisory committees are “an important resource” for the FDA, said Sarah Ryan, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. “They can play an important part of the rigorous human drug review process we have in the U.S.”
The committees are often asked to help settle disagreements within the FDA about how to move forward on a regulatory decision, said Reshma Ramachandran, a health services researcher and clinician at the Yale School of Medicine.
She and other researchers and former FDA officials praised FDA Commissioner Marty Makary’s decision to publish the complete response letters.
But the letters don’t obviate the need for committee meetings, said Peter Lurie, a former associate FDA commissioner who heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
“A disclosed complete response letter tells the public that a company’s application was rejected and why,” Lurie said. “An advisory committee meeting says to outside experts and the public, ‘Here’s what we’re thinking of doing and we’d love your input before we decide.’ Plainly, those are not equivalent.”
The changes Tidmarsh described are already playing out on the ground. The FDA has held only seven advisory committee meetings since Trump reentered the White House, compared with 22 over the same time frame last year. Officials say they will now release complete response letters as they are sent, and published a batch of 89 earlier in September.
Makary has to some extent replaced the advisory committees, whose members have traditionally been vetted for expertise and biases and which are required to deliberate in public, with panels of handpicked scientists who support his views on subjects such as hormone replacement therapy and antidepressants.
Diana Zuckerman, a critic of the drug industry, attended the July hormone replacement therapy panel that considered the FDA’s black-box warning listing dangers of the treatment. Makary had wanted the warning removed and packed the panel with like-minded experts.
The event was hastily called with no opportunity for the public to review discussion materials or comment on them, she said.
“All that was transparent was that they didn’t want to hear from anyone who disagreed with them,” said Zuckerman, who leads the National Center for Health Research.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Before becoming commissioner, Makary pushed for more advisory committee meetings. In early 2022, he blasted the FDA’s decision to approve covid boosters for children ages 12 to 15 without consulting its Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Makary posted on the social platform X at the time, “It is a slap in the face to science for @US_FDA to circumvent the standard convening of the expert advisory board.”
But Tidmarsh seems to disagree.
Instead of asking an advisory committee to vote in favor of or against a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, for example, he said the FDA would be better served by a committee studying the best way to evaluate such drugs, such as which outcomes, or end points, to measure. “Is this end point correct for Duchenne muscular dystrophy? That’s an important question that cuts across many different companies,” he told KFF Health News.
FDA official Vinay Prasad canceled a planned July advisory committee meeting to discuss a Duchenne drug made by the biotech company Capricor Therapeutics. The FDA later published its rejection, or “complete response letter,” to Capricor, which then published its own letter of response to the FDA. Prasad was later pushed out and rehired with fewer powers.
An advisory committee meeting could have worked through the drug’s risks and benefits in a calmer, public, less politicized atmosphere, Ramachandran said.
The FDA usually agrees with the votes of its several dozen advisory committees. A 2023 study found that the FDA agreed with 97% of “yes” votes and 67% of “no” votes.
That’s why Tidmarsh’s comments “come as a complete surprise,” said Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, who wrote commentary accompanying the study. The FDA has postponed a lot of meetings this year, but “everyone thought it was temporary, with the transition and all the firings.”
“Another theory is that this decision is strategic,” she said, “in terms of consolidating power in the agencies so that you are no longer accountable to outside experts or the public.”
We’d like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what’s happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) WEST FARGO, N.D. — North Dakota soybean growers rely heavily on exports to China, but with harvest on the horizon, those exports are nowhere in sight. 
“China hasn’t made a single purchase commitment,” John Newton, a longtime ag economist and executive head of Terrain, a farm credit services company, said last week at the Big Iron farm show. “We need to start seeing those commitments come in right now. And I think that’s really what’s weighing on the farm economy.” 
Newton said export commitments for the crop of soybeans that is about to be harvested are at the lowest point since 2018-19, which is keeping prices low. 
Newton, who was previously the Republican chief economist for the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, said he thinks the Trump administration tariff policies have worked to the extent that there have been deals with the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other countries. “But where we haven’t seen anything yet, is with China, and where that hits hard is with soybeans,” Newton said. 
The North Dakota Soybean Council hosted a trade delegation from China in August despite the trade dispute between the two countries.

“I think it’s important to note the fact that the lines of communication are open with the buying and the selling,” German said while representing the association at Big Iron last week. “We’ve just got to get the politics out of it.” 
Farmer Mark Knutson of Fargo was part of the Chinese delegation’s tour of a North Dakota farm and grain elevator. 
“They want to do business with us, but we’re just more expensive than the Brazilian soybean right now,” Knutson said. 
Newton said it is unclear how long the Chinese can rely on Brazil to be its main source of soybeans, which it uses to feed hogs. 
He said China had built up its soybean supplies before President Donald Trump took office.
“It is feasible to think that they can get everything they need by drawing down their stocks and then purchasing from Brazil,” Newton said. “They can’t do that very long, maybe just for this crop season.” 
But China also is good at playing the long game, he said, with the Communist regime not facing the same political forces that are at play in the United States. 
“So their strategy can be a little bit different than what our strategy is here at home,” Newton said. 
Newton said negotiations may be affected by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling after it hears arguments in November on the legality of Trump’s tariff policies. 
If tariffs are ruled illegal, “it takes a lot of the leverage off the table” for the Trump administration, Newton said.

German said that China sitting out of the U.S. market is creating other changes in the soybean market. Southeast Asian countries that may have purchased from Brazil are  buying some U.S. soybeans, he said.
“Unfortunately, a lot of that product is going to be shipped out of the Gulf or the East Coast, so producers in North Dakota might not reap any benefits of it,” German said. 
North Dakota soybeans destined for Asia go through the Pacific Northwest. 
North Dakota farmers are also being affected by storms that obliterated storage bins on farms and elevators, giving some farmers little option but to take low cash prices at harvest instead of waiting for a market rebound. 
There are a couple of good signs for farmers. Newton said corn export commitments are strong and beef prices are at record highs.

The development of soybean crush plants in the region, which can take delivery of soybeans year-round, also helps make that possible. 
North Dakota saw two soybean crush plants open last year at Jamestown and Casselton. South Dakota has added crush plants, too. 
German said they are helping keep poor soybean prices from being even worse.
“They’re a godsend right now,” German said. 
In Trump’s first term, a trade dispute with China led to the federal government paying out $23 billion in relief to farmers who suffered a loss of trade because of lost exports.  
Newton said there is again talk of a similar economic “bridge” for farmers but again with many factors at play. 
Newton said some in Congress see the $66 billion targeted to farmers over the next decade in the so-called “one big, beautiful bill” as giving the ag industry the help it needs. But he said many of the benefits included in the bill, such as improvement to crop insurance and other programs, won’t show up for many farmers until next harvest. 
He said some in Congress don’t understand that those potential payoffs “are a long way away.” 
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., chairs the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee. He said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor that he is working with Sen. John Boozman, R-Mont., chair of the Agriculture Committee, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and the Agriculture Department “to find ways to support our producers while the Trump administration works to put in place better long-term trade agreements.”

“I wish I could say that stress and burnout has started to decline, but burnout continues to be high among doctors, nurses, and allied health staff working in all of our clinical settings, ranging from emergency departments and ICUs to our outpatient clinics and services. I am hopeful that one of the silver linings of COVID is an increasing focus on the men[...]","When COVID arrived, in March of 2020, Dr. Paul Hattis and Dr. Jarone Lee, a critical care and emergency medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, started a series for CommonWealth Beacon of what came to be more than a dozen interviews during the initial years of the pandemic. (You can read more here.) It has been about two and half years since their last Q&A posting. Hattis, a former professor at Tufts University Medical School and currently a fellow at the Lown Institute, decided to have a check-in discussion with Lee to see what his world is like these days and what sort of longer lasting impact Covid has had on it. This conversation has been edited for clarity. 
HATTIS: What has happened to inpatient volumes, including ICU volumes since the Covid era peak? 
LEE: Overall, at MGB [Mass General Brigham], ever since COVID arrived, our emergency department, inpatient, and ICU units continue to run persistently high volumes, both at our academic centers and community hospitals. Previously, on the ICU side, high volume months were often more predictable, with summer bringing higher numbers of trauma patients, and wintertime often with higher respiratory virus cases. However, these days, we continuously have a high volume of high-acuity patients year-round.  I think a key contributing factor is that many of the smaller hospitals have less staffed beds and reduced ability to care for very sick patients.  
I do believe this is worse since the pandemic, and the accompanying era of rising health care supply and labor costs, nursing shortages, and difficulty keeping needed subspecialists on staff. For example, at many hospitals, if a patient arrives at a hospital without a neurosurgeon and has a head injury with blood around the brain, they will need to transfer to a system like ours.  
HATTIS: What would you say has happened with stress and burnout in the last couple of years? Is it better than things were during the height of Covid? 
LEE: I wish I could say that stress and burnout has started to decline, but burnout continues to be high among doctors, nurses, and allied health staff working in all of our clinical settings, ranging from emergency departments and ICUs to our outpatient clinics and services. I am hopeful that one of the silver linings of COVID is an increasing focus on the mental health of health care workers. I do feel like there has been a more concerted effort to figure out how to make things better – despite knowing that there is a need for a wide variety of strategies to address the problem. 
Another good sign is that I recently encountered a new starting group of residents in the ICU who were not yet exposed to intense Covid care situations during their clinical training years. Why I bring this up is that they were all extremely energetic, engaged in learning about medicine [and] the hospital, and in exploring what happened during the initial years of the Covid era. I am excited to follow their journeys, and I believe their high energy and interest will continue to help with the overall environment. 
HATTIS: Of course, people still get Covid infections today and get hospitalized. Some are very ill. Do survival rates of ICU patients with Covid seem any different now than when you had many cases? 
LEE: People continue to get Covid, and we continue to have patients that get admitted to the hospital and the ICU with COVID-related complications, including respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. As a medical community, we learned a ton about how to treat not only Covid, but diseases like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which you can get from COVID. Similarly, we learned an incredible amount about how to use advanced, non-invasive oxygenation devices, such as high-flow nasal cannulas, safely and effectively to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. COVID continues to have lingering effects, including many patients with long COVID, who continue to suffer a wide variety of symptoms.  
HATTIS: Do you have any specific concerns going into this next winter respiratory viral season? 
LEE: Traditionally, flu season occurred near winter, and we saw an uptick of flu cases in the hospital and in our ICUs; however, this last year, we noticed a second peak around February. The reasons are unclear, but we do know that flu, COVID , and other respiratory diseases continue to cause critical illness in patients requiring admission to the ICUs. As strongly suggested by groups such as the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics,  I would reinforce the need to get annual vaccinations as that helps protect our patients from the uncommon – but very real – chance of dying from the flu or other viruses. This is especially true for our elderly, young, and immunosuppressed, such as cancer patients. 
HATTIS: The affordability challenges of US health care are significant and ubiquitous across our country and in our state.   One hope to make some progress here is to reduce the operational expense growth faced by our health care providers.   There is a lot of hype and hope that the uses of artificial intelligence can bring real and meaningful savings to health care operations.  From a bedside clinician’s perspective, are there any tangible examples you can point to right now of how AI is already helping to save money and what sort of hopes do you have for it going forward into the future? 
LEE: AI is everywhere. I cannot go through a day at the hospital without someone, patient or colleague, bringing up AI and how it is changing health care. I fully agree with your sentiment that AI, deployed properly and with the correct guardrails, will lead to much better patient outcomes, improved back-of-house processes, and,  hopefully, greatly reduce much of the busy work that leads to burnout and stress.  
For example, across MGB, we recently deployed an AI-based documentation system that supports one of the most painful parts of my personal workflow – writing patient notes. While I love the HBO TV show “The  Pitt” and how medically accurate it is to our clinical lives, what my colleagues and I joke about is that the clinicians in the show are not seen doing the many hours of documentation required for the vast numbers of patients they see.  Employing AI to help clinicians with their documentation burden by listening to our conversations with patients and then generating a note that we can review and modify after a patient encounter is already starting to be a time game-changer, and only one of many opportunities for AI in the health care space.  
HATTIS: You are also leading on some of MGB’s international partnerships, in particular you’re working to build a hospital in a part of the UAE that lacks health care facilities. You also continue, through your volunteer efforts, to try to support health care workers in Ukraine and other places through telehealth. Any reflections from these efforts that you think would be of interest to a Massachusetts audience?  
LEE: Yes, I lead a project where we are supporting the build of a new hospital in a rural and underserved area of the UAE. It’s an incredible project that I am excited about both in terms of mission and breadth as we are working with an incredible local partner. Similarly, the non-profit that I volunteer with primarily, Health Tech Without Borders, continues to serve and offer support in needed countries, with a good amount of effort in Ukraine. We recently deployed a new telehealth system to Dnipro, in Eastern Ukraine, near the front lines. It has already started helping to reduce the number of children needing to be transported — avoiding more danger for these kids needing to travel between hospitals. 
Interestingly, during a recent check-in with the Dnipro team, they shared that with the recent uptick in attacks in Western Ukraine, they are now supporting traumatically injured kids in Kyiv as they have had much more experience within Dnipro. What is even more interesting is that they have been using the system to support telehealth, outpatient visits for their regular population of patients, across all specialties from pediatrics to cardiology and more. This just shows how telehealth is the future and can scale rapidly even in conflict zones.  
HATTIS: During the height of the pandemic, we also talked about how your family was doing – especially your then-5-year-old son – while you were devoting enormously long days to the frontlines of patient care. How’s your family doing these days? 
LEE: Thank you for asking. My family is doing well. Our son enjoyed his time out of school this summer. He is now his own person with his own personality and knows what gets me. I always know when he is mad at me because he will tell me that my jokes are not funny.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-14 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Drug overdoses in CT prisons raising alarms,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/14/drug-overdoses-in-ct-prisons-raising-alarms/,The number of overdoses reflects the challenge facing the DOC: keeping illegal drugs out of CT prisons and treating addiction within them.,"On July 21, Tracy Ciccone got a call from the warden at Garner Correctional Institution in Newtown. Her son, 32-year-old Tyler Cole, was being held in the facility awaiting trial. She said she expected the call to be about some kind of “little ruckus” that her son had caused at the facility. 
Instead, the warden told her that, hours earlier, Cole had been found dead. 
She said she barely remembers what happened after that. “I must have yelled or something, because I remember [my husband] Jason running down the hall and picking me up off the ground,” she said.
Cole is one of 15 people who have died from overdoses while in custody of the Department of Correction since 2023, according to information from the state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The overdoses were from a range of drugs — prescribed and not — including fentanyl, cocaine, xylazine, synthetic cannabis, methadone and antipsychotic medications. They died in prisons, at hospitals, in halfway houses, and in their own bedrooms while on parole. 
After three fatal accidental overdoses in 2023, there were nine in 2024. In 2025, there had been three through July, according to the OCME data.
Nonfatal overdoses are also on the rise within the DOC. In recent months, the number of emergency calls for overdoses at prison facilities has increased notably — including an increase of about 30% in Somers, home of Osborn Correctional Institute.  
According to DOC data provided to the correction officers’ union and shared with the Connecticut Mirror, the number of ambulance calls to Osborn for “drug-related incidents” jumped from 16 in 2024 to 41 in the first half of 2025. At Cheshire Correctional Institute, there were 18 ambulance calls for drug-related concerns in all of 2024; that rose to 19 in the first half of 2025.
Data from the state Department of Correction obtained through an FOI request shows 74 “suspected overdoses” across 11 facilities from January through July 2025. More than a third took place at Osborn. 
The number of overdoses and overdose deaths reflects the intractable, overlapping challenges facing the Department of Correction: keeping illegal drugs out of state prisons and adequately treating addiction within them. 
Nearly three quarters of the state’s prison population struggles with substance abuse and needs treatment, according to a 2023 report from the Connecticut Sentencing Commission. For incarcerated women, the proportion was even higher. The same report found that a third of incarcerated people have mental health disorders that require treatment. A quarter of incarcerated people have both mental health and substance abuse disorders.
Drugs coming in
A drug known as K2 is the latest substance to vex correctional staff and threaten the lives of individuals in custody. Prisons around the country are struggling to keep it out. The mixture of chemicals, often bug sprays, with other drugs like marijuana and tobacco — which people then smoke — is difficult to track because it can enter prisons on pieces of paper. 
A formerly incarcerated person at Osborn Correctional Institution told CT Mirror he had seen inmates in his cell block smoking K2 by using a battery and a wire to ignite the paper and then inhaling the smoke using a pen cap or pen tube. 
“I have personally witnessed inmates rip their cell apart, hide under their bed while attempting to dig into the concrete floor, vomit uncontrollably, roll around and tossing on their bunk, become agitated and out-of-control and have to be sprayed with Mace and restrained, strip naked and feel hot or overheated, while others have passed out, fainted or became unconscious,” he wrote in a letter. 
The formerly incarcerated individual, who asked not to be named in this story over fear of retaliation, told CT Mirror that he’d seen correction officers ignore the presence of contraband in the facility, walk past inmates who were high and warn incarcerated people when officers would be coming to search their cells. 
But officers told CT Mirror that the presence of K2 is frustrating them, too. Rudy Demiraj, a representative for the correction officers union, said the presence of K2 was causing a “dangerous and volatile environment” inside the prisons. 
“I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Demiraj said, referring to K2. “I would say this is an epidemic.” As yet, no one has died of a K2 overdose in custody in Connecticut.
Joseph McCarley, a corrections officer at Cheshire Correctional Institute, said the overdoses had increased to a point where they were happening multiple times per day. If the incarcerated person was sent to the hospital, that meant officers would have to leave the already short-staffed facility, which could mean a partial or full facility lockdown, leaving incarcerated people unable to participate in activities.
“ It results in, a lot of times, facilities needing to deploy staff to handle these emergencies where they would otherwise be monitoring the inmate population,” Demiraj said. 
Demiraj said claims that officers were ignoring contraband and overdoses were “baseless” but said staff might be so overwhelmed dealing with the drug usage that they were being pulled away from normal inspections and other duties.
The power of the street drugs has dramatically increased over the past, say, 10 years.Former inspector general Robert Devlin
Other drugs, including fentanyl, are also finding their way inside. 
Ashley Morin died last August from an overdose of fentanyl mixed with other strong opioids. Morin, who was 32 years old and had just given birth, had only been in York Correctional Institution in East Lyme a few days after being arrested for violating a protective order. 
According to the Inspector General’s report, Morin said she was offered fentanyl by her cellmates before moving to a different cell. Officers who searched the cell found what they believed to be drugs, but the material later tested negative in a laboratory analysis. 
Former Inspector General Robert Devlin said that since Morin had entered the facility only a few days before her death, it was possible she’d managed to bring the drugs with her into the prison. He said he was aware of other cases where people had died in the custody of police departments after overdosing on drugs they brought into the department with them. 
“I find these cases really sad. It’s a very sad thing,” Devlin said. 
Several hypotheses exist around how the drugs are entering Connecticut’s prisons, but none have been proven. 
In 2023, after six incarcerated people died from fentanyl overdoses the previous year, Devlin said he was “determined to pursue” the causes of the deaths. But Devlin said in an interview with CT Mirror in early August that the department still didn’t get any answers. 
He said it’s difficult to get people to cooperate with law enforcement for investigations. Devlin said his office had tried to piece together connections between individuals in custody and people they knew outside of prison, but ultimately his office was unable to find the source of the drugs. 
“It’s wicked hard with substance abuse. It’s an extremely challenging thing to try and overcome it. I mean, people do. But regrettably, some people don’t. And the power of the street drugs has dramatically increased over the past, say, 10 years,” said Devlin.
And screening isn’t universal. Devlin said many people who regularly visit prison facilities — correction officers, maintenance workers, outside vendors — aren’t screened when they enter, and he suggested that the DOC employ more sophisticated testing processes.
Correctional staff suspect K2 may be entering facilities through the U.S. Mail. Demiraj said the union had spoken with the Department of Correction about either photocopying mail before it goes to incarcerated people or purchasing scanners that could pick up the presence of K2 in mail.
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said the department was working on purchasing mail-scanning machines that could detect any chemicals. 
Earlier this month, the state bond commission approved funding for four body scanners to be placed at York Correctional Institution in Niantic and Manson Youth Institute in Cheshire. But Demiraj told CT Mirror that the union was opposed to any requirement for officers to go through the scanners when they enter the facility, since the officers, he said, were not bringing in the majority of contraband. 
Banevicius said the installation of body scanners would “provide a noninvasive and effective way to detect hidden objects such as drugs.” He said the scanners, which the department plans to install in the lobby area of each of the prisons, would improve safety and decrease the need for strip searches. He added that staff bringing contraband into the facilities is not tolerated and said anyone who did “will be disciplined to the fullest extent possible.”

Treatment on site
While many of the overdose deaths in the last three years in the Department of Correction were the result of overdoses on street drugs, Tyler Cole’s case was different. According to the medical examiner, Cole’s death was from a combination of methadone and antipsychotic drugs he was prescribed, which was being administered while he was at Garner. 
A lawyer for Cole’s family, Ken Krayeske, recently filed a claim with the state’s Claim Commissioner asking for permission to sue the Department of Correction and requesting $25 million in damages. 
Krayeske said Cole told medical staff he’d been taking heroin, but the facility took over a month before prescribing him methadone. On July 19, he was prescribed 30 mg of methadone. The next day, he was given an additional 40 mg. Krayeske called the increase a “pretty outrageous” jump, which wouldn’t have given Cole time to build up tolerance to the drug. Cole died July 21.
Medical doctors with expertise in addiction medicine gave different responses to CT Mirror about the appropriateness of the methadone dosage Cole received. One doctor said the dosage would have been average or low if Cole was still using heroin, but high if he had, in fact, been abstinent. Another doctor said the dosage was appropriate regardless of whether he was actively using heroin. 
Krayeske said he felt it was “highly unlikely” that Cole had been using heroin while in Garner and noted that the medical examiner had not found any heroin in his body at the time of his death.
Krayeske also said that medical staff failed to evaluate Cole for symptoms of opioid withdrawal when he first entered the facility. 
If you are worried about overdoses occurring while people are incarcerated, … offering treatment … is going to be part of the solution.Dr. Ben Howell, Yale-New Haven Hospital
Cole had been arrested on several domestic violence charges, including disorderly conduct and third-degree criminal mischief, according to CT Insider.
To address the pervasiveness of addiction in its facilities, the Department of Correction administers a program known as medication assisted treatment, or MAT. The program launched in 2013, when DOC began a pilot program at the New Haven Correctional Center. 
MAT provides medication like methadone and buprenorphine, which suppresses withdrawal symptoms for people addicted to heroin or opiates. The program has expanded over the years, and as of last year some type of MAT existed in 10 of Connecticut’s 13 correctional facilities. 
Dr. Ben Howell, a doctor of internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital and one of the authors of a report making recommendations for which programs Connecticut should invest in to address the opioid crisis, said that MAT “absolutely” decreases opioid-related deaths. He also noted that the incarcerated population, as well as people who have recently left correctional custody, are at some of the highest risk for overdoses.
“ If you are worried about overdoses occurring while people are incarcerated, absolutely offering treatment, especially for opioid use disorder, is going to be part of the solution,” said Howell. 
According to DOC’s Banevicius, nurses who work for the department are required to complete an annual emergency response training that “reviews how to identify and recognize different medical emergencies including overdose, treatment and interventions for medical emergencies, and competency of emergency medication administration such as Narcan.” 
Correctional officers are trained in how to identify an opioid overdose, how to use Narcan or naloxone, the effects of xylazine, and how to identify, care for and manage someone who has been using synthetic cannabinoids — marijuana-like substances.
Each facility has a supply of the anti-overdose medication naloxone and at least one substance abuse counselor, who offers counseling to people in the facility who are struggling with substance use. 
But incarcerated people in Connecticut prisons are dying from overdoses often from controlled substances they were prescribed.

Just two days before Cole’s death, on July 19, 2024, 30-year-old Ronald Johnson also died of a methadone overdose at Garner. Johnson had been transferred to Garner from Riker’s Island prison in New York. 
Ronald Johnson’s father, Ronald Coleman, told CT Mirror that he knew his son had a substance abuse problem, although he wasn’t sure what drug he was taking. Coleman said Ronald was outgoing and charismatic. He made rap videos that he posted on YouTube, and the two of them enjoyed playing video games together. 
“He wasn’t a bad person. He just had an addiction that he couldn’t overcome,” he said. 
Coleman said his son eventually became homeless in the Bronx. When he was put in prison for probation violations, Coleman said, he felt that Ronald would be safe — off the streets and with food to eat every day. He saw it as a chance for Ronald to get better. 
Coleman said he didn’t understand why no one at the facility had noticed that his son was in medical distress.
Ronald Johnson’s mother, Jamie Johnson, said she couldn’t understand how he could have died from medications that the facility had prescribed.
According to an investigation by the Connecticut State Police, Johnson was found with an inmate request form in his right shirt pocket, on which he’d written that his feet were swelling, and he believed he was having an allergic reaction to methadone. One of the nurses at the facility wrote in the medical report that half of a white medication fell from Johnson’s bunk immediately after they began CPR. According to the state police report, which referred to a medical report by nurse, officials assumed the medication to be Vraylar, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Johnson was not being prescribed this medication, according to the report.
In response to a question about Cole and Johnson’s deaths, Banevicius said the Department of Correction does not comment on current lawsuits. 
“That being said, the medical and correctional staff members of the department are deeply affected and work hard to prevent any untimely death of an individual under our supervision,” Banevicius said.

A strained system
The high prevalence of addiction — and the department’s struggle to keep prescribed and illicit drug use under control — has placed heightened strain not only on officers and facility staff but also on the wider social safety net in surrounding communities.
Ambulance companies that serve the towns of Suffield and Somers, where Osborn and MacDougall-Walker correctional facilities are located, have told CT Mirror that the number of calls they receive for overdoses is on the rise this year. 
Data from the Somers fire department shows that it received 142 calls from Osborn Correctional Institution from January through June 2025. Of those 142, about 65 were listed as possible overdoses or “altered mental states.” A number of other calls, which listed individuals as “unresponsive,” having an “unknown medical emergency” or a seizure, could also be connected to overdoses. 
Somers First Selectman Tim Keeney said the number of ambulance calls Somers received from Osborn has increased by 40% overall compared to last year. He estimates that about 30% of the calls are overdoses.

Keeney said he hasn’t fielded any complaints from residents about delays in service; the town prioritizes serving residents, he said. But town officials did try to set up a meeting with the warden at Osborn. The meeting was cancelled, and the town has had no communication with the Department of Correction since. 
Banevicius said that when an individual is having a medical emergency, the department “has a legal and ethical responsibility to immediately seek appropriate medical attention for the affected individual, which includes contacting emergency medical services without delay.” In the same way, he said, ambulances have the responsibility to “respond promptly” to emergencies. 
John Spencer, chief of the Suffield Volunteer Ambulance Association, said they noticed an uptick in overdose calls to MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institute in Suffield in April. He also said calls to the prison have represented an increasing percentage of the calls they receive. From July 2023 to June 2024, Spencer said, about 10% of their calls were from the prison. The following year, from July 2024 to June 2025, that had increased to 15%. 
Spencer said the ambulance association had no problem responding to calls at the prisons but said that the cost of responding to these calls is often more than the amount they are paid through the state Medicaid program. 
According to data prepared for the correction officers’ union by the state, the cost of emergency medical transports to prison facilities in Connecticut was about $539,000 for the six months from January through June 2025. In comparison, the cost was about $746,000 for all of 2024.

No antidote for grief
Meanwhile, the family members are dealing with their grief. They say they want accountability for what happened to their sons. 
“It was unimaginable and it’s hard,” Ronald Johnson’s mother, Jamie, said. “I’ve been living with this every day. I think of my son every day. How? Why? What really happened?”
She described her son as a “standup person” — someone friendly who would stick up for people who were being bullied.

His father Ronald Coleman said he processed the grief mainly by throwing himself into work. He works in security and started making DoorDash deliveries. He got his commercial driver’s license, something he said he’d talked about doing with his son, so they could go trucking together. 
“No amount of money is going to bring my son back. That’s not my thing. My thing is, how many other young men is this going to happen to before somebody notices that there’s something wrong?” he asked. 
After Ciccone, Cole’s mother, found out the cause of death was methadone and prescription drugs, she started looking for an attorney. She said she couldn’t understand why Cole received methadone a month after he’d already been at the facility. 
Ciccone said her son enjoyed fishing and that he worked for a period of time with a neighbor who did landscaping. She said he also enjoyed spending time with his son, Brantley, who looks just like Cole did when he was young. 
Cole was doing well for a few years after his son was born, Ciccone said, but things would get difficult when he didn’t take his medication for bipolar disorder. Cole ended up back in Garner after violating a restraining order, which was a violation of his probation, Ciccone said. He was still waiting to go to court when he died in Garner. 
Ciccone said she can’t talk about her son’s death; if she does, she’ll burst into tears. She channels her energy into her grandson Brantley, now 9 years old.  
“It was our job to make sure he grew up with everything he ever wanted or needed,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PRISON-OVERDOSES-0830-DE-039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-14 05:56:26.495721

His leadership decisions have come under scrutiny by attorneys inside and outside of the agency. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Conflict raging within the state public defense agency has sidetracked a capital murder case while competing factions wrestle for control.
The internal fight playing out in state district court filings — set against a backdrop of personnel investigations, alleged retaliation, an effort to unionize, secret hirings, disputes about qualifications, a judge’s recusal and the firing of a decorated attorney by voicemail — chilled legal observers who say Brandon Barrett, the agency’s acting director, violated state law by meddling in the case.
“What makes it unusual is that the interim director has struck several disabling blows at his own agency,” said Eric M. Freedman, a distinguished professor at Hofstra University School of Law.
Barrett denied allegations and downplayed concerns about turmoil within the State Board of Indigent Defense Services, known as BIDS, that surfaced after former director Heather Cessna stepped down two months ago. She warned in a Kansas Reflector podcast that a constitutional crisis was inevitable because of systemic underfunding by state lawmakers.
Such a crisis is evident in the case of Kraig Kahler, who was sentenced to death for murdering his estranged wife, two daughters and grandmother-in-law in 2009 in Burlingame. With his conviction and sentence upheld on appeal, the case is at the stage where specialized attorneys examine constitutional issues, such as whether he previously received effective legal assistance.
But the case has been placed in the hands of first-year attorneys at BIDS who blamed their employer in court filings for failing to produce qualification standards for such cases or hire a qualified attorney to lead the case. They also asked the court to block Barrett from interfering with their work.
Even the Kansas Attorney General’s Office told the court that Kahler deserves better representation.
Barrett refused an interview with Kansas Reflector but responded to questions in writing. He asserted that his efforts to reassign attorneys didn’t amount to interference in the case.
“Every administration faces difficulties but I do not view this situation as embarrassing personally or as part of the agency,” Barrett wrote. “The BIDS attorneys believe they are doing the right thing. That’s laudable.”
The Kansas Supreme Court appointed retired Judge Merlin Wheeler to take over the case. Wheeler has summoned attorneys to a Monday hearing to figure out who should represent Kahler.

‘Untenable and retaliatory’
The Attorney General’s Office objected in July to allowing first-year attorneys Alisha Mehdi and Rebecca Halff to represent Kahler in his post-conviction appeals.
The two public defenders, who are part of what’s known as the Capital Habeas Office at BIDS, recognized they lacked the necessary experience to handle the case on their own. The problem, Mehdi told the court, was that BIDS had neglected its obligation to establish qualification standards for such cases and did not employ an attorney who would meet prevailing standards.
At the time, Tricia Rojo Bushnell — best-known for her work with the Midwest Innocence Project — was leading the office on a contract basis. She had the necessary experience with death penalty cases but wasn’t licensed to practice law in Kansas.
Bushnell bristled with frustration when she couldn’t get overtime approved for her overworked and understaffed office, then learned that Barrett had met in secret with a prosecutor — not a defender — in Nebraska to replace her as the office chief.
While Bushnell worked to find an outside attorney willing to work with the younger staff on the Kahler case, Barrett secretly reached a deal with Jason Belveal, of Holton, and Mark Henricksen, of Oklahoma, to take the reins instead.
Belveal’s Aug. 15 appearance in the court record blindsided the team that had been working on the Kahler case. And Henricksen falsely told the court he met with Kahler and received the client’s support. Henricksen would later blame that mistake on a paralegal.
The BIDS attorneys cried foul when they discovered Osage County District Judge Taylor Wine had held conversations with Belveal that were not part of the court record. Wine recused himself on Aug. 22.
Bushnell believed Barrett had created “an untenable and retaliatory work environment” that undermined her abilities to lead the office, as she wrote in a formal complaint on Aug. 17 to the BIDS board chair. The board chair forwarded the complaint to Barrett, who fired Bushnell in an Aug. 20 voicemail.
“The decision has been made to separate you from that employment at this time,” Barrett said in the voicemail, which Kansas Reflector obtained. “Since you don’t have benefits, there are no benefits to continue, and if you have any questions about retrieving any items or returning any information in your possession, please contact (the HR director). This is the final decision of the executive branch. Thank you.”
The feedback loop — where complaints about Barrett and the administrative office go to Barrett, who is also the agency’s chief counsel — is at the center of efforts by rank-and-file public BIDS employees to unionize.
Internal emails obtained by Kansas Reflector show the BIDS board recently authorized multiple investigations into undisclosed personnel matters at the agency.
Lindsie Ford, a senior assistant public defender, said in an interview that a union is necessary to stem widespread fears of retaliation.
“You have to go to the people you have concerns about with your concerns and just hope for the best,” she said. “It’s not creating an environment where people feel safe.”
Ford said she was afraid she would face retaliation for agreeing to be interviewed for this story.
 
Ron Wurtz, a former BIDS board chair, urged board members at their Sept. 5, 2025, meeting in Topeka to “talk to the people in the field, talk to the public defenders and see what’s going on out there.” (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
‘Devastating, chilling effect’
Ron Wurtz, a former BIDS board chair, and Rebecca Woodman — two attorneys with decades of experience in death penalty cases — separately wrote the current board to express concerns with Barrett and the Kahler case.
They believed Barrett’s actions violate a state law that prohibits BIDS administrators from interfering in cases.
“The summary dismissal of Ms. Bushnell for efforts to help her office to represent their client is chilling further zealous efforts on behalf of other clients,” Wurtz wrote. “I have spoken to a number of BIDS lawyers, including chief public defenders, who have expressed this sentiment. Several expressed the fear that, if this interference with representation continues, they will be forced to walk away from the law’s highest calling — defending life and freedom.”
Woodman wrote that Barrett’s actions created the risk of “a devastating, chilling effect on the ability to render the effective assistance of counsel, no matter how qualified.” Because the stakes are highest in a capital case, she wrote, the result “can literally mean the difference between life and death.”
Both were among nine individuals who asked to speak at the Sept. 5 meeting of the BIDS board in Topeka. They waited for hours while the board met in secret to discuss unexplained personnel matters. Then, with no public discussion, the board approved contracts for Belveal and Henricksen to take over the Kahler case.
Those who signed up to talk were granted 90 seconds apiece at the end of the board meeting. Ford wasn’t happy about the time restriction.
“I have to say, I can’t think of anything more appropriate than being given 90 seconds to address the concerns that we have outlined,” Ford told the board.
Four individuals who signed up for public comment were there to voice support for Barrett. They included Sarah McKinnon, who leads the Sedgwick County public defender office.
“I hate to see what’s going on here,” McKinnon said. “This is not what public defenders do. We don’t fight with each other. We are here supposedly for a common purpose, and that’s putting the client first. And I’m really deeply disappointed that that seems to be getting lost here.”
During the meeting, Barrett announced that Bushnell — the office chief he fired by voicemail — had left the agency to take a new job, and he wished her well. After the meeting, Barrett agreed to talk with Kansas Reflector. A few days later, he said he would only have time to respond to questions in writing.
Barrett asserted in his answers that it was appropriate to fire someone by voicemail, and that “reassigning a case is not interference.” He said he reassigned the case because Mehdi indicated in a court filing that she was not qualified to represent Kahler.
Barrett is one of three candidates who have had private interviews with the BIDS board for the director position. Ann Sagan, director of special projects at BIDS, and Clayton Perkins, the chief capital appellate defender, are the other candidates.
The board chair, Washburn University law professor Michelle Ewert, notified BIDS staff in an Aug. 29 email that the decision to hire a new director has been placed on hold “while an investigation involving confidential personnel matters is pending.”

‘Publish your damn story’
Kahler sent a handwritten note to Wheeler, the retired judge who has taken over the case, to “express my frustration” with the situation.
“I have a constitutional right to qualified and effective counsel and there have been many conversations about my representation outside of the courtroom and without informing me or informing my current representation,” Kahler wrote.
Mehdi, one of the young attorneys working the Kahler case, filed an emergency motion Aug. 29 asking the court to stop her employer from interfering. She said in her filing that Barrett had ordered the attorneys to leave the case, even though Kahler wanted them to remain.
Wheeler ordered all of the attorneys involved to attend a Zoom hearing Monday to sort out the mess.
Belveal and Henricksen, meanwhile, tried to meet with Kahler at the El Dorado Correctional Facility, but Kahler refused.
Freedman, the Hofstra University professor, helped inform the American Bar Association guidelines for capital defense work and is considered an expert in post-conviction death penalty cases. He said “we will all listen with interest” to Monday’s hearing to see what Wheeler does.
An experienced judge, Freedman said, could repair the self-inflicted damage to Kahler’s constitutional right to quality legal assistance by appointing a new attorney free from all the BIDS drama.
“It is solvable, but the judge has to be fully aware of the situation and intervene to solve it, which is one reason I wish you’d publish your damn story before that hearing,” Freedman said.
The U.S. Constitution guarantees defendants the right to effective and qualified legal counsel, and 84% of adult felony cases in Kansas require public defenders, according to the most recent BIDS annual report.
Ford said their job is to “protect the constitution, which, first of all, keeps everybody safe.” She rejected the public perception that “maybe there are some people who are less deserving of rights because we have decided that they are not good enough people.”
“It’s not about, necessarily, Kraig Kahler or your individual thoughts on him,” she said. “Every single one of the people in Kansas needs fair and just access to the criminal justice system. You need the protections that exist in the constitution.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9051347-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-14 05:56:26.495721

Politicians and commentators have criticized rhetoric used by those on the left and right. Kirk himself was an ardent debater, which makes his assassination even more chilling for those of us who believe our country depends upon the free and open exchange of ideas.
Some of the reaction to Kirk’s death has been outright scary, with social media calls for vengeance and retaliation (an arrest in the case was made Friday).
In this heated moment, I’d like to step back for our Sunday column space here at Kansas Reflector. Don’t worry, regular columnist Max McCoy will be back. We’re going to run a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial written back in 1922.
At the time, railroad strikes threatened commerce across the United States. Striking workers faced violence, with at least 10 slain, and officials tried desperately to restore order. In Kansas, Gov. Henry Allen urged officials to criminally charge anyone who picketed in support. Emporia Gazette editor William Allen White promptly put up a small sign in his newspaper’s front window backing the strikers. He was arrested on June, making national news. While charges against him were dropped in December, the short piece he wrote about the situation on July 27, 1922, has endured.
Throughout the editorial, White deals with the most fundamental tensions in our democratic society: the freedom of speech, the fear of disorder and the worry that misguided ideas will triumph. The situation he faced differs from today, but his words struck me as worth a read.

To an anxious friend
You tell me that law is above freedom of utterance. And I reply that you can have no wise laws nor free entertainment of wise laws unless there is free expression of the wisdom of the people — and, alas, their folly with it. But if there is freedom, folly will die of its own poison, and the wisdom will survive. That is the history of the race. It is proof of man’s kinship with God. You say that freedom of utterance is not for time of stress, and I reply with the sad truth that only in time of stress is freedom of utterance in danger. No one questions it in calm days, because it is not needed. And the reverse is true also; only when free utterance is suppressed is it needed, and when it is needed, it is most vital to justice.
Peace is good. But if you are interested in peace through force and without free discussion — that is to say, free utterance decently and in order — your interest in justice is slight. And peace without justice is tyranny, no matter how you may sugarcoat it with expedience. This state today is in more danger from suppression than from violence, because, in the end, suppression leads to violence. Violence, indeed, is the child of suppression. Whoever pleads for justice helps to keep the peace; and whoever tramples on the plea for justice temperately made in the name of peace only outrages peace and kills something fine in the heart of man which God put there when we got our manhood. When that is killed, brute meets brute on each side of the line.
So, dear friend, put fear out of your heart. This nation will survive, this state will prosper, the orderly business of life will go forward if only men can speak in whatever way given them to utter what their hearts hold — by voice, by posted card, by letter, or by press. Reason has never failed men. Only force and repression have made the wrecks in the world.

Read More,"By Ryan Colasanti   NEWARK — The Fightin’ Blue Hens offense started at their own 22 yard line with just over two minutes to play and one timeout remaining. UConn led UD by three in the twilight of the back-and-forth game. Junior quarterback Nick Manicucci and the Blue Hen offense traversed the field to the Huskies 26 yard line setting the stage for graduate kicker Nate Reed.
Earlier in the quarter, Reed missed a 47 yard attempt that would’ve tied the score. This kick was four yards closer, but with even more pressure attached. With two seconds remaining, the ball was snapped, the holder placed it and Reed sneaked it barely above the crossbar. Reed completed his chance at redemption.
Reed’s kick sent the game to overtime where Manicucci capitalized on the opportunity scoring the game winning touchdown in the Blue Hens 44-41 win over the UConn Huskies, Saturday evening.
“Everything that we believe in, we went back to those fundamentals and the foundational aspects of our program and we played harder than that team today and we finished today. And that’s just so special to be a part of,” head coach Ryan Carty said postgame.
UD’s fight was on display all game. The Blue Hens answered almost every scoring drive the Huskies mustered with one of their own. There were only two drives in which the Blue Hens failed to answer a UConn score, one of them Reed’s missed field goal.
The first career FBS game between the Huskies and Blue Hens was an offensive shootout.
The two teams combined for 52 points through the first half and over 600 yards of offense. The two offenses finished with over a thousand yards of offense combined in the programs’ first meeting since 1998.
Both offenses featured a balanced offensive repertoire amassing over 150 yards on the ground and through the air. The Blue Hens had the advantage in the running game with a game high 247 rushing yards. 179 of those yards came from senior running back Jo Silver.
Silver ran for a career high 70 yard touchdown in the first quarter after UConn tied the game with its own long touchdown run courtesy of redshirt junior Cam Edwards.
“As I was trying to reverse, they kind of like almost got a hand on me, but I was able to beat it obviously,” said Silver about his touchdown run. “And then when I was down the field, I turned around at the perfect time and saw him diving and I got my feet up.”
That run was just one of a couple career firsts for the New Jersey product. Silver finished the game with a career high in rushing yards and his first career game with multiple rushing touchdowns.
Silver’s teammate, Kyre Duplessis, put together a similar career defining outing.
In the absence of leading receiver Jake Thaw, Duplessis caught nine of his 11 targets for a career high 161 yards and a touchdown. Duplessis’ second touchdown of the season came on a 68 yard pass and catch down the left sideline. The Coastal Carolina transfer leaped above his defender on third down to come away with the contested catch and scurried down the left sideline into the endzone for the longest touchdown reception of his career. The play gave UD a 28-24 halftime lead.
“I knew I was very close to the sideline. I knew once I caught the ball I wanted to try and stay in and I did my best. I didn’t hear a whistle so I said ‘alright sweet’,” Duplessis said.
Despite the career day, UConn paced the passing game with 346 yards through the air. The Huskies threw 39 times completing 28 of them to 10 different pass catchers.
The defenses weren’t much of a factor in the contest, but when they needed to make a play the Blue Hen defense came up with their first sack of the game holding UConn to a field goal on the first possession of overtime. The stop meant a UD touchdown would win the game and the Blue Hens ran a quarterback run option play that worked all game long — Manicucci scored all three of his rushing touchdowns on the play — to win the game.
The Blue Hens will try and carry the momentum from their first home overtime win since 2017 into their first Conference USA game against Florida International University next Saturday.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4186v2-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-13 23:56:23.810120

California leaders wrapped this year’s legislative session Saturday afternoon, prolonged by last-minute backroom deals on climate and energy, sparking deep frustration among some lawmakers.


Three days before the scheduled end of the legislative session this week, Sen. Lena Gonzalez introduced legislation to limit Los Angeles’ controversial recent “mansion tax” on high-value real estate deals. She backed down just a day later. 
“We wanted more time,” she said. “We wanted to do more due diligence … There were so many other issues on the docket.”
The California Legislature slogged through a marathon final week this week, extending its session into Saturday to push through a major package of climate and energy policies. The Saturday vote was needed because Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire didn’t finalize their privately negotiated deal on how to extend the state’s cap-and-trade greenhouse gas emissions program until early Wednesday, past the normal legislative deadline for introducing bills. 
Lobbied heavily by interest groups across the state, the package took up significant energy in the final days of the session. 
Leaders also rushed through several Newsom administration budget measures that shield construction for the Los Angeles Olympics from environmental review, prop up struggling child care centers, bolster the state’s ability to recommend immunizations and allocate $70 million in new state general fund spending. 
The result? Other measures ran out of time. And, many Democrats were left grumbling about how business gets done on consequential measures — but they still overwhelmingly approved them. 
Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat who has served in the Legislature for a combined 11 years, said the week seemed to contain “the most number of issues that are big issues that have been addressed in the last days of session.”
“To the extent any of them had already been through the policy committees, that’s great,” he said. “To the extent they’re seeing sunshine for the first time, then not so great.”
Assembly Budget Chair Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat, attributed the time crunch partly to Democrats’ whirlwind weeklong efforts last month to place a congressional redistricting plan on the November ballot. 
Gabriel said he shares the frustration with the lengthy session. “It’s a very clear negotiating strategy to drag things out to try to create leverage at the last minute,” he said.
Speaking to reporters afterward, Rivas said the January wildfires, President Donald Trump’s policies and the state’s structural budget deficit also added to the Legislature’s work this year. But he deemed it“the most productive year over the past decade,” celebrating the energy and climate deals as well as a historic rollback of the state’s environmental law to clear the way for development. 
“With unity, with urgency and focus, this Assembly delivered,” he said in a floor speech. 
Disputed antisemitism measure goes to governor
Lawmakers did approve a series of high-profile measures to fight federal immigration crackdowns, boost transit-oriented housing, rein in the tech industry and expand labor’s reach. 
This week, the Legislature OK’d a pair of proposals to ban local, out-of-state and federal law enforcement from wearing masks on duty, a reaction to sweeping immigration raids by unidentified agents. They passed a labor-championed measure to allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize, tying it to an industry-friendly measure to lower companies’ insurance costs. They also gave the final greenlight to Senate Bill 79, a controversial measure allowing developers to build denser housing near transit regardless of local zoning regulations. 
In the wee hours of Saturday morning, lawmakers agreed to appropriate $10 million per year toward funding local news. Google has agreed to commit $10 million toward the effort as well.
Also heading to Newsom’s desk is a controversial measure that aims to prevent antisemitism in schools. The bill, supported by the legislative Jewish Caucus, was passed following emotional hearings and animated debates. Following the bill’s passage, a few pro-Palestinian protesters began shouting from the Assembly gallery, yelling, “You will all have blood on your hands” as lawmakers continued their business.
While supporters argue the legislation is necessary to protect Jewish students from discrimination, opponents, including major education associations and the American Civil Liberties Union’s political action arm, argued for months that the proposal risked “weaponizing” public education and censoring Palestinian-related instruction in K-12 schools.

Another bill awaiting Newsom’s signature would require human oversight when an employer primarily uses artificial intelligence for disciplinary purposes.
But lawmakers punted multiple tech measures to next year, including a proposal to require tests of automated decision systems before they can be used in important personnel decisions. This is at least the second time such efforts have stalled, amid strong opposition from business associations and health care providers. 
They also shelved a measure that would have restricted workplace surveillance by public and private employers, a victory for the California Chamber of Commerce. 
A controversial criminal justice bill that drew strong opposition from moderate Democrats failed to advance. The measure would have made low-level felony offenders eligible for diversion programs, allowing them to avoid jail time. 
Some Democrats including Stephanie Nguyen of Elk Grove, Maggy Krell of Sacramento and Anamarie Avila Farias of Concord joined Republicans in opposing the bill. 
Property tax limit, environmental rules fall short
The pileup of priorities caused some issues to fall by the wayside.
Gonzalez’s bill would cap the Los Angeles voter-approved tax on high-value real estate deals, currently 4 to 5.5% of the property’s value, over concerns it’s dampening construction.
The measure sparked opposition from tenants’ advocates, who campaigned for the tax to raise affordable housing funds, and from the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which opposes the tax. The bill is written to kneecap an anti-tax ballot initiative the association filed for next fall’s election.
The Long Beach Democrat said she’ll pick up the issue next year, and said she couldn’t meet with all sides this year in part because of the volume of priorities this session. 
Another issue that remains unresolved: How to restore environmental review requirements for the construction of certain manufacturing plants — a priority for environmental justice advocates. Newsom earlier this year strong-armed lawmakers into loosening those reviews, but McGuire and other Democratic leaders promised in June to revisit it this fall. 
But top Democrats failed to agree, angering colleagues. In a mad dash to show their efforts, lawmakers rolled out three last-minute proposals, but the only one to pass does little to address environmental concerns.

Rivas called the lack of progress “unfortunate,” and promised to convene a working group next year. 
“Certainly it is unacceptable that that work was not completed by the end of session,” he told reporters.
Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who chairs the budget committee, attributed the lack of a deal to a disagreement with the Assembly, and said redistricting took up negotiating time
“We had a lot on our plate, and it delayed resolution of some issues,” he said. “That being said, it’s all happening … I don’t want to be here on a Saturday, but so be it.”
Frustration permeates California Senate
As the session dragged to its conclusion, some lawmakers were ready for new leadership.
Frustrations spilled over Wednesday night in the Senate Budget Committee, when several lawmakers of both parties criticized Newsom’s administration and legislative leaders for asking them to approve millions of dollars of state spending with little notice. The bills had been unveiled the day before, with no time left to amend them. 
Several Democrats took issue with how leaders steered some funds to local projects without their input.
Sen. Chris Cabaldon, a Napa Democrat, singled out projects in the North Coast that would get funding and said he found “no basis” for why Californians and lawmakers statewide weren’t consulted.
“There are more than just a handful of disadvantaged communities, plus the North Coast, in California,” he said.
McGuire happens to represent that region. Altogether, his district would get upwards of $85  million through the bill for environmental, housing, transportation and fire protection projects. That includes about $50 million from the climate bond for the Great Redwood Trail, a plan McGuire has championed to convert 231 miles of old railway into a trail in Mendocino, Trinity and Humboldt counties. 
Cabaldon slammed the “concentration of decision-making power that has emerged through this process this year.” In an interview, he said he wasn’t blaming anyone specifically, but“everyone is frustrated” by how the week played out.
Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, was more frank.
“The buck stops with the people in charge,” Menjivar said. “How everything transpired this week left a sour taste in people’s mouths. I don’t think a majority of us would want us to repeat this next year.”
After being told in the spring that lawmakers needed to cut funding for undocumented immigrants’ health coverage, she was angered not to have gotten the chance to weigh in on new spending, and complained to Senate leadership.
Following all the griping, McGuire announced this week that the Senate was moving up the date that incoming Senate leader Sen. Monique Limón of Santa Barbara would take over, to Nov. 17 instead of in January.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Iowa congressional candidates took time Saturday at the Polk County Democrats’ Steak Fry to condemn political violence in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing in Utah.
The Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, an annual fundraiser, featured speeches from Democratic candidates for Iowa’s U.S. Senate race, as well as from the 3rd and 4th congressional district races. Van Hollen, who gave a keynote address at the event, spoke about Kirk’s death, saying the shooting is a reminder of “how fragile our democracy can feel,” while criticizing Trump’s response to the issue.
On Wednesday, Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot while answering a question at an event at Utah Valley University. The suspected gunman was identified and taken into custody Friday. Politicians and leaders mourned Kirk’s death and called for a change to prevent future politically motivated violence.

“The answer cannot be more violence,” Van Hollen said. “The answer cannot be vengeance. And sadly, the president is using this moment not to unite America against political violence, but to engage in finger pointing. But we will not be silenced. We will speak out for what we believe vigorously, courageously and peacefully.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said it has been a “really hard week” in light of Kirk’s death, and that Democrats, and all Americans, need to take steps to ensure these threats are eliminated.
“We don’t have to look very far to see other examples of violence that has occurred because of political leanings,” Hart said, in part referring to the fatal shooting of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman in June. “And none of us find that to be acceptable, because it simply isn’t. We live in a country that was founded on the principle that we could stand up in a place like this and express our feelings, our thoughts, our attitudes, our beliefs and our political leanings, and not get shot because we have an opinion or a thought that’s different than somebody else’s.”
In Iowa, there has been an outpouring of sympathy for Kirk’s family and calls to stop political violence. Speaking with reporters, Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate called for an end to political violence.
In recent days, there has been some criticism from Republicans and others of Iowans, including some teachers, who have made controversial social media posts about Kirk’s death.
Democratic Senate candidate Jackie Norris, the school board president for the Des Moines Public Schools, said political violence was unacceptable, and that teachers — alongside most people — should be more cognizant of what their are publicly posting on social media. However, Norris added, “we have to respect that people have different views,” including teachers.
“It is important that we tone down the rhetoric, but we also have to respect that (teachers) have strong feelings too,” Norris said. “It’s a balance.”
Van Hollen calls Democrats ‘spineless’ for not backing Mamdani
Van Hollen also told Iowans at the event winning in 2026 elections will mean Democrats must be outspokenly in support of Democratic candidates running in 2025 races — including New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.
The Maryland Democrat said Iowa would play an important role in the 2026 midterms — but that supporting Democrats in 2025 races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as for New York City mayor, will help build “momentum” for 2026.
Van Hollen criticized New York Democrats for not supporting Mamdani, who is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. He said many Democrats representing New York in the U.S. House and Senate have “stayed on the sidelines” as President Donald Trump and others have mobilized to defeat the Democratic candidate.
“That kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of,” Van Hollen said. “They need to get behind him and get behind him now.”
Van Hollen criticized other aspects of the Democratic Party, saying the Biden administration was “feckless” in holding the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accountable to U.S. and international law. But he largely focused his remarks on Trump and Republicans in control of Congress.
In addition to talking about Medicaid cuts and criticizing Trump’s foreign policy decisions, Van Hollen said the Trump administration was violating people’s constitutional rights by pursuing mass deportations. The Maryland Democrat gained a significant national platform earlier in 2025 for his work involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador erroneously and held in the country’s megaprison.
Van Hollen was one of the major advocates for returning Abrego Garcia to the country and allowing his case to go through the U.S. court system. At the Saturday event, Van Hollen told Iowans he was advised not to pursue the issue as immigration was not a winning topic for Democrats — but he said he continued to fight for Abrego Garcia’s due process rights because “our democracy cannot survive on silence or equivocation.”
“And lo and behold, Americans across the political spectrum do believe in the red, white and blue essential right to due process in the United States of America,” he said. “They do believe in the principle that no one in America — I mean, no one — should be disappeared by the state without having a chance before a court of law. And Americans understand this is not about one man. It’s about all of us. Because when you strip away the rights from one person, you threaten the rights of all, of all of us.”
Abrego Garcia has been returned to the U.S., though the Trump administration has stated they intend to deport him again, potentially to the country of Eswatini.
Van Hollen said he would “never, ever apologize for standing up for anybody’s constitutional rights,” and said Democrats need to do more to speak out on issues they believe are important, even if polls or pundits say the topics are not politically advantageous. This will be especially important in states like Iowa, he said.
“We can and we will win here again, if — if — we speak to our core values, if we show people what we will stand up for and we will fight for,” Van Hollen said. “That’s why it’s great to be here to flip steaks and flip seats.”

(File photo provided by Clemson University)Clemson University suspended an employee Saturday following social media posts that mocked the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as the Legislature’s GOP leaders called for an emergency meeting of the school’s governing board.
The suspension came two days after Clemson College Republicans began flagging social media posts of employees’ reactions to Kirk’s death Wednesday. Of the three people the college chapter called out — including two assistant professors — it is unclear who is suspended.
The public Upstate university declined to provide any further information on the “personnel matter.”
The suspension announcement followed outcry online from state politicians, Clemson students and alumni and Republican members of South Carolina’s congressional delegation.
“This action reflects the seriousness with which Clemson approaches violations of its standards and values,” reads the statement posted about noon Saturday. “We understand the frustration, and we share the deep concern over the nature of these posts.”
Also on Saturday, GOP leaders of both Statehouse chambers called on Clemson’s Board of Trustees to meet and “take immediate and appropriate action.” The three-paragraph letter did not specify what they wanted the board to do.
“We were shocked and saddened this week by the murder of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. It leaves a dark stain on our nation’s history,” reads the letter signed by the Senate president, House speaker and chief budget writers of each chamber.
“In its aftermath, several Clemson University faculty made vile and troubling comments,” it continued. “While the University has issued a statement, it fails to address the gravity of the matter.”
The letter, dated Saturday, was posted on social media shortly after Clemson’s announcement.
House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, one of the four signers, said the leaders wanted to make clear that the college’s first statement was not enough.
That four-paragraph statement, posted Friday afternoon, said “Clemson University unequivocally condemns any and all expressions that endorse, glorify or celebrate political violence. … This is an opportunity for each of us to stop and consider our core values of mutual respect, integrity and personal responsibility.”
Bannister told the SC Daily Gazette the trustees need to meet and take “fairly significant action” but did not say whether that should mean firing the employees.
“I think they need to talk to the professors, look at what was posted,” said the Greenville Republican. “The professors should be given an opportunity to explain their position, and then they should make a decision based on what’s the right path forward for Clemson.”
Also signing the letter were Senate President Thomas Alexander and Senate Finance Chairman Harvey — both Clemson graduates — and House Speaker Murrell Smith. They did not immediately return messages from the Gazette.
It’s unclear whether firing is an option.
The university’s latest statement said an investigation into the posts continues and the school would “act within the bounds of the law” and university policies.
A state law dating to 1950 makes it illegal to “discharge a citizen from employment or occupation” because of their “political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen.” But South Carolina is also an at-will employment state, meaning employers generally can fire an employee for any or no reason.
Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 to combat progressive politics on college campuses, was shot in the neck about 12:20 p.m. Wednesday as he debated with students at Utah Valley University. About 3,000 people gathered outside for one of Kirk’s signature “prove me wrong” events.
He was answering a question about mass shootings when he was hit by a single bullet. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital. On Friday morning, officials announced the arrest of a 22-year-old Utah man, who was not a student of that college.
“In my opinion any post that indicates this was acceptable behavior is out of line,” Bannister said.
The social media posts flagged by the college GOP chapter came from two assistant professors and an employee who appears to work in operations. None of the employees responded to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.

California lawmakers passed a six-bill climate and energy package extending cap and trade to 2045, expanding the state’s wildfire fund, approving new oil drilling, and opening the door to a regional power market.


Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.
The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.
Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.
The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature. 
Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.
Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.
Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.
“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”
The future of cap and trade reinforced
At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.
The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.
The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”
The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.
The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”
“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.
Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.
Questioning the affordability premise
The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.
At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.
“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”
Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.
“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”
Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”
Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.
A ‘giveaway to big oil’?
At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there. 
The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”
Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”
“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.
Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.
Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.
Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern. 
The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.

Mitch Rosenwald, and Rep. Michele Rayner, all Democrats. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — During his time in office, Gov. Ron DeSantis has been aggressive in vetoing appropriations in the state budget for LGBTQ programs.
Cognizant of that fact, some Democratic legislators, say, they’ve been able to continue support for those programs by omitting any direct references to the LGBTQ community in their appropriation proposals.
But that gambit may be coming to an end, one lawmaker suggested on Saturday.
“I think you need to be prepared for what is coming,” warned state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-Orlando) on Saturday, speaking during the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus summer meeting in Tampa. “Yes, we should continue to urge our senators and our representatives in the Legislature to fund these programs. We should not stop. “
But Smith fears the state’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives led by Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia are taking aim at local governments for funding anything associated with DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). And he’s concerned that could lead to legislation barring municipalities or counties from funding such efforts in the future.
Last month, 16 Orange County employees were served with investigative subpoenas regarding the county’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; climate initiatives; procurement; and contracts or grants. They were issued after Ingoglia said it was “probable” that Orange County employees tried to hide information when his DOGE team began examining spending practices within the county government.
Among the agencies caught up in the search are the Zebra Coalition Inc. and Zebra Youth Inc., plus the Orlando Youth Alliance Inc., according to the Orlando Sentinel. The paper reported that while those groups support LGBTQ communities, the county argued the programs were open to all.
“While we will fight the proposal if it comes, I believe a proposal may come that will basically now finally prohibit our local governments from being able to fund these organizations through grants, because they’re gonna say putting a roof over a young person’s head who is queer or is LGBTQ is diversity and inclusion and now prohibited under Florida law,” Smith said.
No such legislation has been introduced to date, Smith acknowledge, but “if rainbow crosswalks attached to the interim memorial of Pulse nightclub are fair game for this depraved administration, they will come for other things, too, and we have to be prepared to fight back against it,” he said.
Banning the transgendered from owing guns?
Joining Smith in an hourlong discussion at the Westshore Grand Hotel in South Tampa were three other Democratic LGBTQ members of the Legislature: Sen. Shevrin Jones (D-Miami Gardens), Rep. Michele Rayner (D-St. Petersburg), and Rep. Mitch Rosenwald (D-Oakland Park).
The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was never explicitly mentioned during the discussion, although his death was indirectly referenced when the lawmakers were asked to opine about a news report referencing the transgender community published last week.
CNN reported that in the aftermath of the Minneapolis Catholic Church shooting that took place late last month, senior U.S. Justice Department officials are reportedly weighing proposals to limit transgender people’s right to possess firearms.
Smith called it “a bigoted and transphobic attack,” and then asked the audience to think about how conservatives had responded to mass shootings in the immediate past.
“If it is a Hispanic person that has committed a violent crime, they want to build a wall,” he said. “If it is a Black or African-American person who has committed a violent crime, it is that we need to target Black Lives Matter and we need to erase honest history. If it is a trans or an LGBTQ person who commits a violent crime, we have proposals like this.
“But if it’s a white male American, the response in the last 24 hours has now been, ‘We need to understand what we’re doing to young men and stop giving them access to video games and understand what they’re going through,'” he said. “I think we should have empathy for all people regardless of what their background is. And we have to call out bigoted, discriminatory policies for what they are.”
Rayner called the report “a distraction” and a way to paralyze members of the LGBTQ community to not commit to any positive actions.
“These are very unserious people,” she said. “These are people who are not rigorous in their actual thinking capacity. They’re just not, and so ultimately we have to see it for what it is.”
If Republicans were serious about addressing mental health, “they would just fund mental health. Period,” Jones said to cheers. “The only reason why Republicans continue to beat up on our transgender community is because they believe that’s their easy target.”
He added that it is incumbent upon LGBTQ lawmakers to fight as hard for their constituents as they ever have.
“Too often, the LGBTQIA+ community, we feel that sometimes we have to kowtow to individuals who wouldn’t spit on us if we were on fire. And so, because of that, I want to make clear that those of us who run for office … don’t allow this moment to allow us to be scared to speak up. Because there are young people and there are people dependent on our mouth, and if we have a seat at the table, dammit, we better use every ounce of our being to pushback on the BS that the Republicans are doing.”

“I see people from all walks of life here today, and that’s truly, truly beautiful,” said Julian Camera, an organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado. “We’re going to overcome this. We’re going to keep fighting.”
The dormant Hudson Correctional Facility is owned by a real estate investment trust and was formerly leased to private-prison company The GEO Group, which operated the prison for a span of just five years after its 2009 opening, during which the facility housed inmates from Alaska. The prison has a capacity of about 1,200 beds — only slightly less than the population of the town of Hudson, about 30 miles northeast of Denver on Interstate 76.

The facility is one of six potential new ICE detention centers in Colorado revealed by the ACLU as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit earlier this year. Internal documents obtained by The Washington Post last month again indicated that the facility, along with another dormant prison in Walsenburg, is under consideration by the agency, but no formal announcement has yet been made. Representatives for ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
Colorado is currently home to only one ICE detention center, an Aurora facility also operated by The GEO Group. The potential expansions, which could triple the state’s immigrant detention capacity, are part of the Trump administration’s plans for a sweeping mass deportation program, bolstered by $45 billion in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved in July.
“That money doesn’t just come from Hudson or Walsenburg — that’s everyone’s money,” Camera told the crowd. “That comes from Hudson, that comes from Denver, that comes from the state of Colorado, and the people of Hudson should be concerned. Why? Because now their city becomes dependent on tearing families apart.”










I see people from all walks of life here today, and that’s truly, truly beautiful ... We’re going to overcome this. We’re going to keep fighting.


– Julian Camera, organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado


In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Protesters at Saturday’s demonstration carried signs that likened ICE detention centers to concentration camps. Speakers especially objected to the opening of a new facility in a remote rural area, where detainees’ families and legal aid groups would find it more difficult to visit.

Hudson Mayor Joe Hammock told Denver7 last month that he would support the facility reopening “like any business that wants to open up in Hudson.” While operational, the facility supported about 200 jobs.
But Gina McAfee, statewide coordinator of Colorado Immigrant Protection Teams, pointed to studies showing that prisons don’t provide the economic benefits that local boosters often promise.
“The bottom line — I would ask, did Hudson’s economy improve when this facility was operational? We think not,” she told the crowd at Saturday’s protest.
“We urge you to push back on any local or state entity who needs to approve of the plan to reopen this facility,” McAfee added. “Let’s all just say no.”

,California,2025-09-13 18:15:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why California backed off again from ambitious AI regulation,Khari Johnson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/09/ai-regulation-on-hold-again/,A bill mandating disclosure and appeals for a wide range of AI decisions was delayed until next year for the third legislative session in a row. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to consult on the measure.,"In summary
A bill mandating disclosure and appeals for a wide range of AI decisions was delayed until next year for the third legislative session in a row. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to consult on the measure.




After three years of trying to give Californians the right to know when AI is making a consequential decision about their lives and to appeal when things go wrong, Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said she and her supporters will have to wait again, until next year.
The San Ramon Democrat announced Friday that Assembly Bill 1018, which cleared the Assembly and two Senate committees, has been designated a two-year bill, meaning it can return as part of the legislative session next year. That move will allow more time for conversations with Gov. Gavin Newsom and more than 70 opponents. The decision came in the final hours of the California Legislative session, which ends today. 
Her bill would require businesses and government agencies to alert individuals when automated  systems are used to make important decisions about them, including for apartment leases, school admissions, and, in the workplace, hiring, firing, promotions, and disciplinary actions. The bill also covers decisions made in education, health care, criminal justice, government benefits, financial services, and insurance.
Automated systems that assign people scores or make recommendations can stop Californians from receiving unemployment benefits they’re entitled to, declare job applicants less qualified for arbitrary reasons that have nothing to do with job performance, or deny people health care or a mortgage because of their race.
“This pause reflects our commitment to getting this critical legislation right, not a retreat from our responsibility to protect Californians,” Bauer-Kahan said in a statement shared with CalMatters.
Bauer-Kahan adopted the principles enshrined in the legislation from the Biden administration’s AI Bill of Rights. California has passed more AI regulation than any other state, but has yet to adopt a law like Bauer-Kahan’s or like other laws requiring disclosure of consequential AI decisions like the Colorado AI Act or European Union’s AI Act. 
The pause comes at a time when politicians in Washington D.C. continue to oppose AI regulation that they say could stand in the way of progress. Last week, leaders of the nation’s largest tech companies joined President Trump at a White House dinner to further discuss a recent executive order and other initiatives to  prevent AI regulation. Earlier this year, Congress tried and failed to pass a moratorium on AI regulation by state governments.
When an automated system makes an error, AB 1018 gives people the right to have that mistake rectified within 60 days. It also reiterates that algorithms must give “full and equal” accommodations to everyone, and cannot discriminate against people based on characteristics like age, race, gender, disability, or immigration status. Developers must carry out impact assessments to, among other things, test for bias embedded in their systems. If an impact assessment is not conducted on an AI system, and that system is used to make consequential decisions about people’s lives, the developer faces fines of up to $25,000 per violation, or legal action by the attorney general, public prosecutors, or the Civil Rights Department.
Amendments made to the bill in recent weeks exempted generative AI models from coverage under the bill, which could prevent it from impacting major AI companies or ongoing generative AI pilot projects carried out by state agencies. The bill was also amended to delay a developer auditing requirement to 2030, and to clarify that the bill intends to address evaluating a person and making predictions or recommendations about them.
An intense legislative fight
Samantha Gordon, a chief program officer at TechEquity, a sponsor of the bill, said she’s seen more lobbyists attempt to kill AB 1018 this week in the California Senate than for any other AI bill ever. She said she thinks AB 1018 had a pathway to passage but the decision was made to pause in order to work with the governor, who ends his second and final term next year.
“There’s a fundamental disagreement about whether or not these tools should face basic scrutiny of testing and informing the public that they’re being used,” Gordon said.
Gordon thinks it’s possible tech companies will use their “unlimited amount of money” to fight the bill next year.. 
“But it’s clear,” she added, “that Americans want these protections — poll after poll shows Americans want strong laws on AI and that voluntary protections are insufficient.”
AB 1018 faced opposition from industry groups, big tech companies, the state’s largest health care provider, venture capital firms, and the Judicial Council of California, a policymaking body for state courts.
A coalition of hospitals, Kaiser Permanente, and health care software and AI company Epic Systems urged lawmakers to vote no on 1018 because they argued the bill would negatively influence patient care, increase costs, and require developers to contract with third-party auditors to assess compliance by 2030.
A coalition of business groups opposed the bill because of generalizing language and concern that compliance could be expensive for businesses and taxpayers. The group Technet, which seeks to shape policy nationwide and whose members include companies like Apple, Google, Nvidia, and OpenIAI, argued that AB 1018 would stifle job growth, raise costs, and punish the fastest growing industries in the state in a video ad campaign.
Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, whose founder Marc Andreessen supported the re-election of President Trump, oppose the bill due to costs and due to the fact that the bill seeks to regulate AI in California and beyond.
A policy leader in the state judiciary said in an alert sent to lawmakers urging a no vote this week that the burden of compliance with the bill is so great that the judicial branch is at risk of losing the ability to use pretrial risk assessment tools like the kind that assign recidivism scores to sex offenders and violent felons. The state Judicial Council, which makes policy for California courts, estimates that AB 1018 passage will cost the state up to $300 million a year. Similar points were made in a letter to lawmakers last month.
Why backers keep fighting
Exactly how much AB 1018 could cost taxpayers is still a big unknown, due to contradictory information from state government agencies. An analysis by California legislative staff found that if the bill passes it could cost local agencies, state agencies, and the state judicial branch hundreds of millions of dollars. But a California Department of Technology report covered exclusively by CalMatters concluded in May that no state agencies use high risk automated systems, despite historical evidence to the contrary. Bauer-Kahan said last month that she was surprised by the financial impact estimates because CalMatters reporting found that automated decisionmaking system use was not widespread at the state level.
Support for the bill has come from unions who pledged to discuss AI in bargaining agreements, including the California Nurses Association and the Service Employees International Union, and from groups like the Citizen’s Privacy Coalition, Consumer Reports, and the Consumer Federation of California.
Coauthors of AB 1018 include major Democratic proponents of AI regulation in the California Legislature, including Assembly majority leader Cecilia Aguilar-Curry of Davis, author of a bill passed and on the governor’s desk that seeks to stop algorithms from raising prices on consumer goods; Chula Vista Senator Steve Padilla, whose bill to protect kids from companion chatbots awaits the governor’s decision; and San Diego Assemblymember Chris Ward, who previously helped pass a law requiring state agencies to disclose use of high-risk automated systems and this year sought to pass a bill to prevent pricing based on your personal information.
The anti-discrimination language in AB 1018 is important because tech companies and their customers often see themselves as exempt from discrimination law if the discrimination is done by automated systems, said Inioluwa Deborah Raji, an AI researcher at UC Berkeley who has audited algorithms for discrimination and advised government officials in Sacramento and Washington D.C. about how AI can harm people. She questions whether state agencies have the resources to enforce AB 1018, but also likes the disclosure requirement in the bill because “I think people deserve to know, and there’s no way that they can appeal or contest without it.”
“I need to know that an AI system was the reason I wasn’t able to rent this house. Then I can at an individual level appeal and contest. There’s something very valuable about that.”
Raji said she witnessed corporate influence and pushback when she helped shape a report about how California can balance guardrails and innovation for generative AI development, and she sees similar forces at play in the delay of AB 1018.
“It’s disappointing this [AB 1018] isn’t the priority for AI policy folks at this time,” she told CalMatters. “I truly hope the fourth time is the charm.”
A number of other bills with union backing were also considered by lawmakers this session that sought to protect workers from artificial intelligence. For the third year in a row, a bill to require a human driver in commercial delivery trucks in autonomous vehicles failed to become law. Assembly Bill 1331, which sought to prevent surveillance of workers with AI-powered tools in private spaces like locker or lactation rooms and placed limitations on surveillance in breakrooms, also failed to pass.
But another measure, Senate Bill 7 passed the legislature and is headed to the governor. It requires employers to disclose plans to use an automated system 30 days prior to  doing so  and make annual requests data used by an employer for discipline or firing. In recent days, author Senator Jerry McNerney amended the law to remove the right to appeal decisions made by AI and eliminate a prohibition against employers making predictions about a worker’s political beliefs, emotional state, or neural data. The California Labor Federation supported similar bills in Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, and Washington.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/042324_Sacramento-Works-Job-Center_MG_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-13 14:57:07.569892

A strong breeze cools the shade under large oak trees, and makes lounging and visiting with friends a more pleasant time as the heat of the day rises.
Wade makes the rounds, chatting with friends old and new. He stops kids riding horses to ask how they’re doing. He asks about the horses. He smiles and waves, laughing and telling stories before heading towards the fencing of the oval track where drivers train and race harness horses called Standardbreds.

Along the way, Wade spots a mechanical bull, promptly pulls off his boots and hops on. He rides with glee and to the amusement of the small crowd gathered to cheer him on. The crowd records his joy on cell phones held high. Eventually, he’s thrown off, but is all smiles. He accepts a few hugs as his reward, puts on his boots, then encourages the children to try their hand at bull riding.

“I love this,” he said, waving an arm to indicate the festivities around him. “I especially love seeing these kids out here riding. There’s a lot of our youth that come to shows like this and the horse races that are interested in horses, but they don’t even have a horse. Their parents and not any of their family members have horses.”

Wade wants to help kids in his community – especially those of color – learn equestrian skills as another way for them to get into college. He has made it his mission.

“Here I am, a cowboy, rancher, horse trainer, horse racer and a licensed official for the United States Trotting Association. I’m an equestrian consultant, calf roper, steer wrestler and do workshops to train our youth. If I could put all that on a business card, know what would be in the boldest print? 
“I’m a mentor,” Wade said.

“So I thought, you know what. I’m going to try and do everything I can to change that,” Wade said, before waving down two young men galloping across the green sward to chat them up. He asks if they’re enjoying themselves, about the horses they ride.

“What I do is try and pair these kids with someone that has horses. They get an opportunity to learn how to train, ride and care for them. If they’re really serious about what they’re doing, I make it possible for them to get their driver or jockey license, compete on a professional level. And for the ones not interested in that, we find activities for them too.” 
Wade walks back to the fence at the oval track, hitching up a booted foot to resume sharing his mission.

“Kids can also get involved in sports clubs like 4-H, learn a respectable trade like being a farrier, earning them a good living. It’s really about equestrian and agricultural activities, because it can get them a college scholarship. My own son is going to college on a rodeo scholarship, getting a full ride, if you know what I mean,” he said, smiling broadly.

Wade mentions a program for youth he’s starting with Rep. Rickey Thompson, a Democrat from Shannon. He hopes to help them “get started on the right path.”
“My path was out of love and necessity. Necessity as in making a living. I want to be a model of success to these kids so that they not just dream of success, but to have success,” he said. “I want to be for them what Lane Frost was for me. He was my bull riding idol. I loved that guy. He was awesome. Not only was he a great cowboy, he was a great person. He always took the time to stop and talk with kids. That made a big impression on me. I never forgot it.”

(Photo by Caroline Donovan/Integration and Application Network,UMCES)The reviews are in, and they’re not good: Commenters had stern words in the just-closed public comment period for the newly revised Chesapeake Bay agreement, a voluntary clean-up pact between the states that surround the nation’s largest estuary.
In more than 1,000 comments from scientists, advocates, regular residents, current and former legislators and even a former Maryland governor, the Chesapeake Bay Program was told that the proposed terms of the plan are too weak, especially considering that the bay states failed to achieve all the goals in the previous agreement .
Commenters, including leading environmental nonprofits, have largely panned the revisions to the expiring 2014 plan. They note that a critical pledge has not been met from that plan, to curb the damaging nutrient and sediment runoff that comes from agricultural fertilizers, human and animal waste and even vehicle emissions.
They took issue with lowered goals for underwater grass acreage and forest buffers, and for failing to mention the legally binding “Total Maximum Daily Load,” a restricted “pollution diet” for the bay set during the Obama administration. The document gives the bay states five more years before new pollution goals must be developed using an upgraded computer model.
And opponents noted the aversion in the new plan to climate change, referring only to “changing environmental conditions.” They faulted Bay Program leaders for not immediately granting a request from seven federally recognized Native American tribes to join as signatories.

“They’re unacceptable,” Patuxent Riverkeeper and longtime environmentalist Fred Tutman said of the revisions. “They’re not going to have the desired effect. How could they? They’re weaker. We’ve been failing with the other measures, and now we’re going to weaken those measures further.”
The new agreement comes as billions have been spent over the years for Bay restoration, which has reduced projected pollution loads into the bay, chiefly through major upgrades at sewage plants. But stemming the flow of pollution from farms — and an ever-increasing amount of developed lands — has proved much more vexing.
Despite those millions, 70.6% of the bay and its tributaries have not attained water quality standards, according to the latest metrics from the Bay Program. That’s compared to 73.5% of the bay in the late 1980s, when the restoration effort got off the ground.
The architects of the new plan face a delicate political situation. States with varying political leanings — not only Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia but West Virginia, Delaware, New York and Washington, D.C. — are all signatories and must agree on the changes. And then there’s the federal government, which signed the 2014 pact, but is also the legal enforcer of the Bay’s pollution diet.
President Donald Trump’s (R) return to the Oval Office has placed the bay restoration effort on a somewhat shaky footing. Trump has slimmed down federal environmental agencies, from the Environmental Protection Agency to the U.S. Geological Survey, amid a broader effort to slash bureaucracy. Trump’s administration has targeted environmental regulations for rollback and attacked renewable energy projects and associated tax incentives.
Unlike his first term, however, Trump first budget proposal this time did not cut funding for the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program, which administers the multistate partnership. Bay Program officials say that federal agencies have remained at the table helping to shape the revised agreement.
But Bay advocates see Trump administration fingerprints on the revisions, including deleted references to diversity initiatives and climate change.
“I would be stunned if that [Trump administration policy] was not at least a significant part of the reason that this is so milquetoast,” said former Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening of the revisions.
But other observers have faulted the bay states just as much as Trump’s EPA.
“Maryland lacks the leadership — the bold leadership — that is necessary in this area,” said Gerald Winegrad, who served in the Maryland General Assembly from 1978 to 1994. “That’s the linchpin of what’s happening here.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) was elected chairperson of the Executive Council of state leaders overseeing by restoration, but Winegrad said he worries that Moore’s alleged aspirations for higher office — Moore has repeatedly denied he is running for president — make him less likely to challenge key industries, including agriculture.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a statement, representatives from the EPA’s Region 3, which includes all of the bay states, emphasized that the revisions “are being made jointly” by all members of the bay partnership, “informed by the public and stakeholders … These are not unilateral EPA actions or decisions.”
“EPA wears multiple hats when it comes to the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) Partnership. Specifically, EPA acts as a funder, regulator, and co-equal partner,” read the statement. “In these roles, EPA does not act alone.”
One particular portion of the agreement caught the attention of
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) led a letter of 23 bay-state members of Congress who argued that the document was not as ambitious as they had hoped. One thing that caught Van Hollen’s attention in particular was the section focused on nutrients, which called for the states to “continue to implement and maintain practices and controls to reduce excess nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment” through 2030.
By December 2030 — when a new computer model that estimates pollution in the Bay region will be completed — the goal would be updated with “revised targets.”
“T​​hey are giving themselves this long lead time — 2030 — to establish some of the goals when it comes to pollution reduction,” Van Hollen said. “I understand the need to gather the data, but it’s also important that between now and then, we continue to work hard to achieve the targets in the current agreement.”
Longtime Chesapeake Bay scientist Don Boesch, a former professor and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, argued that there is no reason to wait for the computer model to take action.
“The model is not going to lower the bar. It’s not going to say you need to do less. It’ll probably say you need to do more,” Boesch said. “So, let’s just do what we said we’re going to do.”

He joined with several other bay scientists from UMCES, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and Cornell in penning comments urging a renewed focus on nutrient reduction, and on new strategies to slow runoff — including by rewarding conservation practices based mainly on how successful they are.
Bay Program officials defended the agreement but indicated that changes could be coming in response to the public’s concerns. That could include a reference to the bay’s TMDL, said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which includes legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia — and is a signatory on the Bay agreement.
“We tried to avoid what we thought were kind of unapproachable terms, like TMDL,” Killius said. “The stakeholders that really pay attention to those things took that as a sign that we are walking away. We can’t walk away.”
Killius said the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Management Board is now taking the comments under advisement. The group will likely adapt the agreement during a retreat at the end of September.
The revised agreement must be finalized by December, when the governors of the bay states will convene for an annual meeting, along with the other signatories of the agreement.
Killius noted that the agreement does call for a 0.2% improvement in water quality each year. And though it may sound “absolutely ludicrous” on its face, it reflects experts’ careful consideration of what is possible, given the bay’s current trajectory, she said.
“You want to stretch beyond what’s comfortable, because that’s how you build muscle,” she said. “We also want to set our managers and our teams up for success.”
Killius added that it is the first time that a Bay agreement has called for measurable improvements in water quality, rather than basing the goal on estimated reductions in nutrient pollution.
In its statement, the EPA’s Region 3 office also defended the way the revisions were written with regard to the TMDL, arguing that the document “provides specific targets that will be developed and a timeline to achieve the new targets,” and further information will come from the new computer model.
Killius said that the team reviewing the comments also heard “loud and clear,” the numerous requests for a consistent timeline, instead of myriad target dates, including 2030, 2035 and 2040.

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, among the largest bay nonprofits, is pushing for the entire agreement to have a deadline of 2035, said Keisha Sedlacek, federal director for the foundation.
The document released for public comment also included a number of blanks, in the place of more specific numerical goals for forest and wetland conservation, among other subjects.
“That’s unacceptable. We can’t ask our governors, the mayor of D.C. and the executive director of the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], to sign a document not knowing what exactly they’re committing to. That’s not fair to the states and jurisdictions. It’s not fair to the public,” Sedlacek said.
In its comment letter, the EPA targeted those passages for removal, writing: “It is EPA’s position that these outcomes/targets lack sufficient detail, are not ready for inclusion in the Agreement at this time, and that the targets should be removed,” read the letter from Lee McDonnell, acting director of the Chesapeake Bay Program office.
The Bay Program also has some soul-searching to do about how low — or high — to set its aspirations, environmental advocates say.
“It just seemed like [they were] trying to set these targets in a way that 10,15, years from now, we can say: ‘Oh, look, we achieved this goal,’” said Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which represents more than 300 environmental organizations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
“We don’t want to lower the bar just to have success,” Reilly said.



Tribes rebuffed in their effort to get a seat at the table
It isn’t just the terms of the new Bay agreement that are stirring debate — it’s the people who have a seat at the table.
The Indigenous Conservation Council, a group formed in 2022 that includes the seven federally recognized Native American tribes in Virginia, says tribal governments should also be signatories to the agreement. But their request was rebuffed by the Bay Program, said Melissa Ann Ehrenreich, the council’s executive director.
In a June 27 letter, the Bay Program principal’s staff committee said it respected the tribes’ role as sovereign entities, but it was only tasked with revising the Bay agreement, and that adding a signatory would be “outside of our current charge.” It pledged to take the issue to the governors of the Bay states, via the Bay Program’s executive council, for consideration.
“We felt like it was an unnecessary barrier,” Ehrenreich said.
Several groups, including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Choose Clean Water Coalition, supported the ICC’s request.
Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission and a member of the principal’s staff committee, said the committee’s hands were tied. But they fully expect to recommend that the tribes are considered for potential inclusion in the future.
“It’s not a ‘no.’ And it’s not like if you miss this boat, we move on,” said Killius, who noted that signatories can be added at any time — not just during the revisions process.
But the delay is still frustrating for the tribes, who say their inclusion should be a no-brainer, and would bring increased knowledge of Native conservation practices to the bay restoration effort.
“The Chesapeake Bay Program is sort of trying to figure out how to keep people at the table,” Ehrenreich said. “And it’s ironic, because tribes want to be at the table.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/river-sunset-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-13 09:56:12.344947

(Courtesy of the University of South Dakota)A program supporting rural and first-generation college students pursuing graduate degrees in biomedical research at the University of South Dakota is among the victims of Trump administration grant cancellations upheld recently by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The court ruled last month that $783 million in nationwide research grants related to health disparities, LGBTQ+ health and vaccines could be terminated by the National Institutes of Health. The Trump administration canceled the grants as part of a crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion-related studies.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The federal government awarded USD $1.1 million over the last five years to start a Graduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement, or G-RISE, program. The university had spent all but $174,661 of the money when the grant was terminated.
University officials had hoped to get a “no-cost extension” to spend the remaining funds for a year beyond the grant deadline, said USD spokesperson Alissa Matt.
The program focused on recruiting and retaining underrepresented students to pursue graduate degrees through the USD Division of Biomedical and Translational Science, Matt added. Associate Professor Lisa McFadden said the program looked for students “eager” to become researchers and enrolled applicants based on academic performance, research potential and commitment to the field.
Several other universities throughout the country have G-RISE programs.
“We were also excited about the chance to use this funding to support first-generation and rural students — two of the groups NIH identified as underrepresented in its initial request for proposals,” Matt said in an emailed statement.
Since 2020, the program financially supported 11 graduate students with stipends. Most of the program’s professional development, mentoring and research activities were open to all USD graduate students.
U.S. Supreme Court gives go-ahead for Trump to cancel $783M in NIH research grants

McFadden said in an emailed statement that students in the program are resilient, creative and determined, “often coming from rural communities where resources are limited, yet proving they can thrive in biomedical research.”
“Their success reflects the values of South Dakota: resilience, resourcefulness, and the ability to do more with fewer NIH resources,” McFadden said.
The program was a “strong fit” for USD, Matt said, because it connected students with meaningful training experiences and improved student outcomes. That included increasing the number of fellowships Biomedical and Translational Science graduates received and an increase in publications per student. The program improved retention, with 100% of G-RISE fellows completing the program, and decreased the time it took an average student to graduate.
The university wants to continue the program, so officials are “exploring other grant programs” to support graduate students, Matt said, including applying for other National Institutes of Health grants.
Programs like G-RISE and other projects committed to supporting South Dakota students, McFadden said, “can help South Dakota retain and grow the biomedical workforce our state needs.”

(File Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)With North Carolina lawmakers still negotiating the state budget, a public forum on Thursday highlighted the state’s long-running Leandro case, a nearly three-decade legal battle over equitable education funding.
Speaking at the forum organized by the advocacy group Public Schools First NC, state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls discussed the history of the case, which began in 1994 when parents and school districts in low-wealth counties sued the state. They argued their students were being denied the state constitution’s guarantee of a “sound basic education.”
The state Supreme Court affirmed that right in 1997 and found that North Carolina had failed to meet its obligation, particularly for at-risk students. Since then, the case has moved through years of court rulings, compliance hearings, and disputes over funding plans.
Earls, who was elected to the state’s highest court in 2018, told the audience she could only discuss the case’s public record, not ongoing proceedings. She read directly from her dissent in a 2022 decision, where she criticized the court’s majority for stepping back from ordering the state to fund a comprehensive remedial plan.
“Not only is it true that justice delayed is justice denied, but denying adequate educational opportunities entails enormous losses, both in dollars and in human potential to the state and its citizens,” Earls read from her dissent. “If our court cannot or will not enforce state constitutional rights, those rights do not exist. The constitution is not worth the paper it is written on, and our oath as judicial officers to uphold the Constitution is a meaningless charade.”
The General Assembly adjourned in late July with no comprehensive deal on the two-year spending plan, passing a resolution to meet only one day a month until the 2026 short session begins in April. Lawmakers have been deadlocked since early summer over tax cuts and spending priorities. That  means months could pass before school districts have clarity on the state’s spending priorities for education.   
Democratic leaders in the legislature and education groups have called on lawmakers to return to Raleigh to pass a full budget. They argue the state needs more than incremental fixes to address increasing enrollment, aging school facilities, and teacher workforce challenges. 
The audience on Thursday also heard from education advocates who connected the case to current classroom struggles. Public Schools First NC have highlighted how Leandro funding could expand pre-K programs, hire more teachers and reduce class sizes.
The Leandro case remains pending before the state Supreme Court, which last heard arguments in February 2024.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P7262843-1536x1152-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-13 07:56:51.903823

Ford",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/09/13/harris-says-fema-should-not-be-states-first-resort-deadlines-are-different-for-senators-more-notes/,"Andy Harris thinks the state should take care of its own before going to FEMA for disaster aid for Western Maryland, deadlines are different for members of Congress, judicial appointments, more in political notes.","Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, speaking this week outside the Maryland State House. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) has appealed the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s denial of nearly $34 million in disaster relief to help Western Maryland areas recovering from a devastating flood earlier this year. Maryland’s sole Republican member of Congress said Moore should look to his own budget before appealing to the federal government for help.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) told Maryland Matters that the flooding is “a tragedy,” but said federal aid was not warranted in this instance.
“Federal emergency aid really should be for very, very large disasters that states can’t afford to cover on their own,” Harris, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, said this week. “The governor just raised taxes $1.6 billion. He probably could find $30 million to send out to Western Maryland.”
“Extreme rainfall” from May 12-14 led to flooding that inundated parts of Allegany and Garrett counties. Midland, Lonaconing and Westernport in Allegany County were among the hardest-hit communities, with floodwaters inundating homes, schools and businesses, washing out roads and damaging pipelines.
The affected counties are all rural, majority Republican and economically challenged areas of the state. The 17.2% poverty rate in Allegany County trails only Baltimore City and Somerset County, both at 20.1%, according to 2023 estimates in the Maryland Manual online. Maryland’s overall poverty rate is 11.1%.
President Donald Trump (R) has called FEMA “a disaster” and said states should handle disaster recovery with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs.
The comments made Monday appear to represent a reversal for Harris, who three weeks ago joined the other nine members of the state’s congressional delegation, all Democrats, asking Trump to approve the aid request.
Cost of Western Maryland flood damage more than doubles; state to appeal FEMA aid denial

“We appreciate the congressman’s stated support for getting the FEMA funding that Western Maryland deserves,” Maureen Regan, a Moore spokesperson, said in a statement responding to Harris’ latest comments. “FEMA funding will be a critical boost to the nearly $1.5 million in disaster recovery and energy assistance that the state has already provided. We just hope the president will listen to the pleas of Mountain Marylanders to help rebuild their towns.”
Deadline? What’s that?
There are many words to describe the letter from 23 members of Congress to the Executive Council of the Chesapeake Bay Program regarding the latest multiyear proposal to clean up the bay: Thoughtful; bipartisan; forceful; forward-looking; thorough.
Late.
The letter is dated Sept. 11, even though the official public comment period for the “Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement Beyond 2025 Revision Draft” closed on Sept. 1, ending a 90-day comment period. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said “our goal was to get it in” by the deadline, but apparently it takes awhile to get 23 House and Senate members in line.
The letter is generally appreciative of the work the Bay Program has done to prepare the document, but says it needs more specifics, and it needs to be written in plain language that regular folks understand. And it says the plan needs to be both broad-based to cover all the challenges the bay currently faces, but also flexible enough to meet challenges that can’t be predicted yet, as new environmental problems crop up.
The letter is signed by eight senators including Van Hollen, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and 15 House members, including six Maryland Democrats: Reps. Kweisi Mfume, Steny Hoyer, Glenn Ivey, Sarah Elfreth, Johnny Olszewski, and April McClain Delaney. All 23 signers are from states in the bay watershed.
Despite the date, Van Hollen’s not too worried about the work behind the letter going to waste.
“From our perspective, we believe that when you’ve got this many members of Congress on a bipartisan basis weighing in that, you know, we expect these views to be taken into account,” he said.
Leave her alone
That was the thrust of an open letter from Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown and 20 other Democratic attorneys general to the U.S. Justice Department recently over its investigation of New York Attorney General Letitia James (D).
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter accuses the department of “pursuing a pattern of harassment and intimidation” after James won financial fraud lawsuit against President Donald Trump (R), then a private citizen. Trump has appealed the ruling that ordered him to pay about a half-billion dollars against him. That award has since been rejected as excessive by a New York state appellate court, which otherwise upheld the ruling against him.
In February 2025, just weeks after Trump was sworn in to his second term in office, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed a “weaponization working group” to investigate “all departments or agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States over the last four years.” Specifically it was directed to investigate James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Special Counsel Jack Smith, all of whom investigated Trump, prosecution of Jan. 6 riot defendants and prosecution of people for blocking access to abortion clinics, among other targets.
“Every aspect of the Department’s campaign against AG James makes plain that it is not rooted in any legitimate suspicion of wrongdoing: President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi are both on record having made public threats against AG James,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote.
The letter also criticizes Edward Martin Jr., a Trump loyalist heading the Justice Department’s working group, pointing to a “crude letter” Martin wrote to James’ personal attorney, caling for her to resign, and later showing up at James’ home to pose for press photographs, according to video obtained by CNN.
“Mr. Martin’s antics and actions amount more to those of a showman than to those of a representative of the United States government charged with ensuring that impartiality, integrity, and fairness are the cornerstones of criminal investigation and enforcement,” the attorneys general wrote.
A representative with the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other attorneys general who signed the letter are from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
When being called bench-warmer is a good thing
Gov. Wes Moore this week tapped “two remarkable servants of the law” to fill vacancies on two circuit court benches, with James J. Dietrich appointed in Montgomery County and Kristina L. Watkowski in Worcester County.
“Throughout their legal careers, James Dietrich and Kristina Watkowski have demonstrated an unwavering dedication to integrity and justice that will serve the people of Maryland well for years to come,” Moore said in a statement Wednesday announcing the appointments.
Dietrich has spent close to 30 years as a prosecutor, beginning his career in the Howard County State’s Attorney’s office, where he served for 21 years and was part of the circuit court trial team for 10 years, and for the last seven years he has been a prosecutor with the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office, serving on the major crimes and post-conviction units.
Dietrich teaches coursed on evidence, criminal procedure and trial practice as an adjunct professor at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law, where he received his law degree. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Lemoyne College.
Watkowski began her legal career clerking for Judges Theodore R. Eschenburg Sr. and Thomas C. Groton III in Worcester County Circuit Court, before moving to the Maryland Office of the Public Defender where she eventually became supervising attorney for the Worcester County office. Since 2022, she has worked as an attorney with Booth, Cropper & Marriner since 2022, with a practice primarily focused on civil litigation with a concentration in land use and zoning.
Watkowski earned an associate’s degree from Howard Community College and her bachelor’s degree from Salisbury University, before getting her law degree at Widener University’s Delaware Law School.

Steny Hoyer's (D-5th) Women's Equality Day Luncheon in College Park. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Whenever Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) walks into a room, he’s usually greeted with hugs, handshakes, kisses on the cheek and gratitude for his more than 40 years in Congress.
But one longtime colleague stood out when she offered those same accolades Friday during the congressman’s 23rd annual Women’s Equality Day Luncheon in College Park attended by a few hundred people.
“Thank all of you for being here and supporting Steny Hoyer over the years,” said former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-Calif.), who served as keynote speaker at the event. “When I talk about things that relate to women in the world … [and] having fairness in our society, we can be sure that Steny will be on the forefront.”
Without mentioning President Donald Trump (R) and other Republican leaders by name, Pelosi said there’s been efforts to restrict the women’s right to choose and to appoint women to leadership positions.
“Know that there’s nothing more wholesome for our country, whether it’s in politics and government, whether it’s in the academic world, whether it’s in the military, nothing is more enhanced than by the increased leadership and participation of women,” Pelosi said. “When women succeed, America succeeds.”
Women’s Equality Day is celebrated Aug. 26, to commemorate the 19th Amendment that granted women the right to vote and was ratified in 1920.

Hoyer has three daughters and two of his three grandchildren and three of his four great grandchildren are females. After the death of his first wife, Judy Pickett Hoyer, he remarried two years ago to Elaine Kamarck.
“I have been blessed with a lot of women in my life,” Hoyer said to some laughs and applause in the audience.
Hoyer, who turned 86 on June 14, and Pelosi, 85, have served in Congress together since the 1980s, but have known each other even longer, briefly working together in the early 1960s for U.S. Sen. Daniel Brewster (D-Md.). So when Hoyer makes an appearance these days, he is inevitably asked whether he plans to seek a to 24th term in Congress next year.
“We’re thinking about it,” Hoyer said in a brief interview after the luncheon. “I’m in this fight. This is a fight that is worth having. What is being done in Washington is making America less fair, [there’s] less investment in our future. I’m very concerned about it.”
But those concerns stop at violence, said Hoyer, reflecting on Wednesday’s shooting death of 31-year-old conservative activist, Charlie Kirk during an event at Utah Valley State University.
“We know that there are people who think violence is an alternative — violence is an alternative that will cause chaos and death and diminish our democracy,” Hoyer said. “We need every one of us [to] reject the use of violence, particularly when it comes to political speech. Our democracy believes that debate resolves our differences, not violence.”
In the wake of Kirk’s death, bomb threats were made Thursday to Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and several historically Black colleges and universities. On the same day, the U.S. Naval Academy was locked down after false reports of a gunman on campus led to the accidental shooting of a midshipman. Morgan State University said Friday that it received a bomb threat, that it determined was not credible, but still informed the FBI “out of abundant caution.”
Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) — who once. interned for Hoyer — attended Friday’s luncheon and also reflected on the recent events, including a school shooting Wednesday in Colorado.
“I don’t want to keep going down this course, and I just ask everybody to reflect on this moment and the choice that we have here,” said Elfreth, who plans to go forward with an open telephone town hall Monday that was scheduled before the Kirk shooting. “The only way to get through this is to recognize that we all have a part to play in fixing this.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nancy-Pelosi-9-12-2025-1024x927.jpg,,,2025-09-13 08:57:42.175474

It's considered the oldest Jewish synagogue, in continuous usage, west of the Mississippi River. (Marty Nelson/Getty Images)In May 1949, more than 150 people crowded into a modest new synagogue on Bannock Street in Boise. They came not only from the small Jewish community, but also from churches across the city. 
Leaders in attendance included the Rev. Hartzell Cobbs of First Christian Church, the Rev. Herald Gardner of St. Michael’s Episcopal, the Rev. Ray Dunn of First Methodist, the Rev. Robert Ray of First Baptist, Jesse McQueen representing the Latter-day Saints, and Chaplain L. W. Backman of the Idaho State Prison.
The Rev. Cobbs, then president of the Boise Ministerial Association, prayed that the new temple would receive “the highest blessing of the Lord” as its members worked in the “service of God.” It was, as the Idaho Statesman reported at the time, “a milestone in the adventure in faith.”
That milestone is worth remembering. It reminds us that interfaith solidarity is not new to Idaho — it is part of the state’s history.
The Jewish community that built Temple Ahavath Israel in 1949 was small, just twenty members. Yet with donations of money, materials, and labor — from Jews and non-Jews alike — they raised $10,000 to complete Boise’s second synagogue. The achievement earned national recognition in the United Synagogue Review in New York, which praised Boise’s example.
This was not the first time Jewish life in Idaho was publicly noted. As early as 1892, the Statesman reported that Jewish-owned businesses across Boise closed for Yom Kippur, and seventy-five Jews gathered in the Odd Fellows Hall to pray. Three years later, when Congregation Beth Israel incorporated, one of its leaders was Moses Alexander, who would later become governor of Idaho and the first practicing Jewish governor in the United States. That same year, a rabbi addressed the Methodist Episcopal Church in Boise — a conversation grounded in fellowship across traditions.
On Aug. 30, 1896, Beth Israel, Idaho’s first synagogue, was dedicated at State and Eleventh. Shortly after, the Statesman advertised the High Holiday services, treating Jewish observance as part of the city’s public fabric.
During World War II, when Ahavath Israel began holding services for Jewish servicemen stationed at Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Base, space quickly grew tight. The congregation turned to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which hosted Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services in its downtown chapel.
The pattern repeated again in 1961 in Pocatello, where the whole community laid the cornerstone for Temple Emanuel. City officials, the chairman of the Pocatello Ministerial Association, and the mayor of Alameda all attended. One speaker urged that instead of “bigger armies and more destructive weapons,” humanity would be better served by building houses of worship.
These stories show something consistent about Idaho. Time and again, small Jewish communities were met with open doors. Protestant clergy, LDS leaders, and elected officials alike showed up not only in times of crisis but in moments of celebration.
Today, when headlines about antisemitism, civil division, and xenophobia dominate national news, it is easy to forget that pluralism is not new. Idaho’s history offers powerful lessons for our country now. For generations, Idahoans have known something that still matters: showing up for others across difference, working together even while disagreeing about important questions, doesn’t weaken a community’s identity — it strengthens it.
The dedication of a synagogue was not only a Jewish event, but an Idaho event.
Seventy-six years after that day in 1949, it is worth asking: What would it look like to show up for one another across lines of difference today? What can we still learn from the spirit that led Protestants, Latter-day Saints and Jews to stand together on Bannock Street, offering shared blessings for a new sacred space?
It’s not nostalgia — it’s a legacy worth carrying forward.

Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska-Lincoln administrators mapped out $27.5 million in proposed cuts that faculty say will be “devastating” to a campus that has already endured $75 million in cuts over the past six years.
UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett detailed the cuts Friday, including $7.7 million from eliminating six degree programs, $5.5 million expected from buyouts for long-term tenured faculty, $4.6 million from a 1% reduction in state-aided budgets, $3.8 million in “efficiencies” from top administrative offices and four colleges, $2 million from merging four academic departments into two schools and $550,000 less for graduate assistantships.
The plan also seeks “targeted philanthropy” to backfill $2.5 million in mandated tuition remissions, a goal the university hopes to address over the long-term with state lawmakers.
‘An awful day’
John Shrader, president of UNL’s Faculty Senate, said the timeline to offer feedback on the cuts, by Oct. 10, is tight, and he said the damage could take years for the university to repair, “if ever.”
“The professors and the Extension and staff and students have not caused a $27.5 million deficit, but we’re paying for it,” Shrader told the Nebraska Examiner. “We’re the ones who are going to be deeply impacted.”
He added: “It’s just an awful day for the University of Nebraska, no matter how you look at it.”

Jessie Brophy, president of the UNL Staff Senate and director of external engagement and partnerships at the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said that while the Staff Senate recognizes the need for the reductions, staff are deeply concerned about the impact.
“We are committed to representing staff perspectives, supporting our colleagues, and maintaining open communication as the process moves forward,” Brophy said in a statement.
Student leaders for the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska and Graduate Student Assembly did not immediately respond to requests Friday for comment.
Proposed cuts
The academic programs proposed for elimination are:

Department of Educational Administration ($1.95 million, 17 positions)
Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ($1.85 million, 12 positions)
Department of Statistics ($1.75 million, 12 positions)
Department of Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design ($1.45 million, 11 positions)
Community and Regional Planning degree programs ($475,000, four positions)
Landscape Architecture degree programs ($225,000, two positions)

In the case of the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, which includes geology and meteorology and climatology, “high-performing faculty” may qualify for rehire in other UNL units “to preserve educational pathways and research expertise.”
The Department of Statistics is a stand-alone department. Undergraduate data science degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences and College of Engineering would be retained.
The Departments of Entomology and Plant Pathology would be merged under the proposal, as would the Departments of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication (ALEC). If approved, faculty from the two units would devise a combined name and plan in the spring.
Additionally, there would be fewer graduate assistantships available in the College of Arts and Sciences ($325,000) and College of Engineering ($225,000).

University officials, keeping in line with a promise by NU President Jeffrey Gold, vowed that any students in eliminated programs — freshman or otherwise — would be able to complete their degrees, though making it happen might require compressed timelines or program modifications.
The cuts also would eliminate the remaining $850,000 in state-aided funding for UNL’s Office of Student Life, which a UNL spokesperson said would likely include a mix of programmatic reductions, operational efficiencies and salary impacts. That total is less than 1% of the office’s total budget, which includes student fees, housing and dining.
The Colleges of Business, Engineering, Fine and Performing Arts and Journalism and Mass Communications would need to find a combined $1.1 million in administrative and staff “efficiencies.” 
Bennett’s office, as well as the top academic office and business and finance division, would need to find $2.69 million in unidentified “efficiencies.”
An eye toward ‘efficiencies’
While it’s unclear what these “efficiencies” might look like, some deans have previewed the efforts.


UNL budget reduction proposal
$7.7 million, academic program eliminations
$5.5 million, buyout program for tenured faculty (anticipated savings)
$4.61 million, reducing all state-aided budgets by about 1%
$2.69 million, executive administrative and staff “efficiencies”
$2.5 million, unfunded tuition waivers covered with “targeted philanthropy”
$2 million, department realignments/mergers
$1.1 million, administrative and staff “efficiencies” across four colleges
$850,000, reductions to the Student Life division
$550,000, fewer graduate assistantships in College of Arts and Sciences and College of Engineering


Dean Shari Veil of the College of Journalism told her college that the “efficiencies” will mean fewer electives, some larger class sizes and additional course sections more dependent on demand and waitlists that might determine whether to offer more sections of courses.
While the journalism college faced no proposals to eliminate majors, Veil said the college will still look at revising its curriculum for “stronger connections” across majors and new courses.
“None of these changes will alter our core mission: to nurture curious and creative minds to thrive in the ever-changing media and communication professions,” Veil said in an email Friday.
Dean Andrew Belser of the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts told faculty and staff something Bennett’s announcement did not: that his college will look at combining its two performing arts schools — the Glenn Korff School of Music and Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film — to work more collaboratively under a shared director.
Belser said the reorganization brings new opportunities and the ability to “open the door to exciting new collaborations,” such as joint projects, shared production support and faster integration of emerging media arts.
“While this reorganization is, in part, a necessary response to budgetary realities, it is designed to make our college stronger and help us better prepare students for the 21st-century creative workforce they are entering,” Belser wrote.
Long-term fix sought
Bennett, in a video message Friday to the campus, said that while UNL and the broader NU system offer a significant return on investment — estimated at $10 for every $1 — UNL has faced declining revenues. That includes net tuition, fewer state funds than anticipated and sharply rising costs for utilities, health care, property and liability insurance.
He said UNL’s structural deficit has “compounded over time” with the latest plan meant to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles” by eliminating the $21 million deficit but also finding $6.5 million more to trim.

Leslie Reed, UNL’s public affairs director, described the additional cuts as “proactive reductions to better position UNL for the future, so it can break out of this cycle of budget cutting.”
“I am hopeful this work will allow UNL more time to implement long-term strategies for financial sustainability,” Bennett said.
Reed said she was unaware how much of UNL’s cuts are meant to help NU with a systemwide $20 million deficit, which Gold has acknowledged would prove “incredibly painful.”
Since late June 2020, UNL has weathered $75 million in cuts. Bennett joined UNL in July 2023.
Bennett said he appreciates the “sacrifices” many UNL community members have made, including repeatedly being asked to do more with less, which he acknowledged is unsustainable. But the chancellor, whose contract is currently slated to expire at the end of this fiscal year, said now is the time “to boldly reimagine our future.”
Future investment
Top campus leaders evaluated programs and campus areas on quantitative and qualitative data, Bennett said. A university website says the data included program strengths, state needs and workforce alignment.

The metrics also had an eye toward a long-term goal to have UNL rejoin the prestigious Association of American Universities, Shrader said. UNL was voted out in 2011 after 100 years as a member.
The AAU particularly praises research and research funding, with campus leaders looking at awards, book publications, citations, unit growth and more.
Shrader, an associate professor in broadcasting and sports media and communications who joined UNL in 2017 said he worries for students and noted that while state leaders repeatedly say they want a Big Ten, Research 1 (R1), first-class university, investments have lagged behind, sometimes at the level of “uninvestment” or disinvestment, he explained.
“We need investment to make this a first-class university, and every year we don’t do that, we slip a little farther behind,” Shrader said.
Executive, legislative fights
Part of the budget deficit for NU as a whole also comes as state appropriations have slowed under Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, who took office in 2023 after serving as an NU regent for a decade.
Pillen has been harder on his alma mater, proposing this January to cut NU’s budget by 2% in the first year of a two-year budget cycle. The NU Board of Regents had requested a 3.5% budget increase in each of the two fiscal years.

In the end, negotiations between Gold and Pillen and legislative will landed at a smaller 0.625% increase this current fiscal year and a 1.25% increase on top of that slower-growing total the following year.
Reed did not answer a reporter’s question on what steps Bennett has taken to engage with state leaders or philanthropic donors, endeavors Gold has been more public about. 
Bennett told the Examiner in 2023 he had been accustomed to being at the Mississippi Capitol about three days a week during its legislative session while he led the University of Southern Mississippi. He had suggested he would do the same in Lincoln.
Reed did not directly answer the Examiner’s question of whether Bennett would seek a contract extension before his contract expires June 30. She said Bennett is committed to leading UNL “toward new levels of excellence well into the future.”
“He expects to continue to serve as long as he is called upon,” Reed said.
‘Long-term consequences’
Sarah Zuckerman, an associate professor of education administration and president of the UNL chapter of the American Association of University Professors, urged campus leaders and regents to reject Bennett’s plan, which she called “extremely short-sighted.”
“They don’t take into account the long-term consequences of closing programs and letting faculty go who are uniquely valuable to the state of Nebraska,” Zuckerman said.

Many faculty speaking to the Examiner also questioned what happens if fewer than expected tenured faculty take the voluntary separation package. Faculty aged 62 or older who have been with NU for at least 10 are eligible. The deadline to apply is Sept. 30.
Most faculty and staff received no pay increases this year due to budget cuts and because UNL has no employee unions, unlike faculty in Omaha and Kearney.
‘Set the stage’
Bennett encouraged the UNL community to offer feedback on the budget reduction plan to UNL’s Academic Planning Committee, an internal working group that includes faculty, staff and students. Feedback is due Oct. 10 and is expected to include public hearings.
The chair of that committee declined to comment Friday and directed questions to Reed.
“We have the opportunity to set the stage for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s next 155 years, and your voice in shaping our future matters,” Bennett said.
Shrader said that while UNL is not a big university, it has a “nice, hard-working community here that impacts the State of Nebraska as much as or more than any other institution in the state.”
“When you do things like this, it can be nothing but detrimental to all of us,” Shrader said. “It can be nothing but a negative impact on every single one of us.”

(Vinegar Syndrome/Roe Bressan/Frameline Distribution)First it was referred to as a “mysterious illness.” Later it was called “gay cancer,” “gay plague” and “GRID,” an acronym for gay-related immune deficiency. Most egregiously, some called it “4H disease” — shorthand for “homosexuals, heroin addicts, hemophiliacs and Haitians,” the populations most afflicted in the early days.
While these names were ultimately replaced by AIDS — and later, after the virus was identified, by HIV — they reflected two key realities about AIDS at the time: a lack of understanding about the disease and its strong association with gay men.
Although the first report in the mainstream press about AIDS appeared in 1981, the first movies to explore the disease wouldn’t come for four more years.
When the feature film “Buddies” and the television film “An Early Frost” premiered 40 years ago, in the fall of 1985, AIDS had belatedly been breaking into the public consciousness.
Earlier that year, the first off-Broadway plays about AIDS opened: “As Is” by William Hoffman and “The Normal Heart” by writer and activist Larry Kramer. That summer, actor Rock Hudson disclosed that he had AIDS, becoming the first major celebrity to do so. Hudson, who died in October 1985, was a friend of President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan. Reagan, who had been noticeably silent on the subject of the disease, would go on to make his first — albeit brief — public remarks about AIDS in September 1985.
Five days before Reagan’s speech, “Buddies,” an independent film made for US$27,000 and shot in nine days, premiered at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco on Sept. 12, 1985.
 
A film on the front lines
If you haven’t heard of “Buddies,” that’s not surprising; the film mostly played art houses and festivals before disappearing.
Its filmmaker, Arthur J. Bressan Jr., was best known for his gay pornographic films, although he’d also made documentaries such as “Gay USA.” “Buddies” would go on to reach a wider audience thanks to a 2018 video release by Vinegar Syndrome, a distribution company that focuses on restoring cult cinema, exploitation films and other obscure titles.
It was inspired by the real-life buddies program at the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, an organization Kramer co-founded. At the time, many people dying of the disease had been rejected by family and friends, so a buddy might be the only person who visited a terminal AIDS patient.
The film feels like a play, in that most of the movie takes place in a single room and features just two characters: a naive young gay man named David and a young AIDS patient named Robert. Over the course of the film, the characters open up about their lives and their fears about the growing epidemic. It also includes a sex scene — something other early AIDS films completely avoided — in which David and Robert engage in safer sex.
 
AIDS packaged for the masses
The remarkably frank and intimate approach to the epidemic in “Buddies” contrasts sharply to the television film “An Early Frost,” which premiered on NBC on Nov. 11, 1985.
The film’s protagonist is a successful Chicago lawyer named Michael who hasn’t come out to his family, much to the distress of his long-term partner, Peter. When Michael finds out he has AIDS, he’s forced to come out to his parents, both as gay and as having AIDS.
Much of the film deals with Michael’s self-acceptance and his attempts to mend his relationships. Yet the production of “An Early Frost” was fraught with concerns about depicting both homosexuality and AIDS. Unlike David and Robert, Michael and Peter show no physical affection — they barely touch each other.


Knowledge of AIDS was still evolving — a test for HIV was approved in March 1985 — so screenwriters and life partners Daniel Lipman and Ron Cowen went through 13 revisions of the script. The real-life fears and misconceptions about how AIDS could and could not be transmitted were central to the storyline, adding extra pressure to be accurate in the face of evolving understanding of the virus.
Despite losing NBC $500,000 in advertisers, “An Early Frost” drew 34 million viewers and was showered with Emmy nominations the following year.
 
A quilt of stories emerges
“Buddies” and “An Early Frost” opened up AIDS and HIV as subject matters for film and television.
They begat two lanes of HIV storytelling that continue to this day.
The first is an approach geared to mainstream audiences that tends to avoid controversial issues such as sex or religion and instead focuses on characters who grapple with both the illness and the stigma of the virus.
The second is an indie approach that’s often more confrontational, irreverent and angry at the injustice and indifference AIDS patients faced.
The former approach is seen in 1993’s “Philadelphia,” which earned Tom Hanks his first Oscar. The critically and commercially successful film shares a number of story points with “An Early Frost”: Hanks’ character, a big-city lawyer, finds out he is HIV positive and must confront bias head-on. HIV also features prominently in later films such as “Precious” (2009) and “Dallas Buyers Club” (2013), both of which, like “Philadelphia,” became awards darlings.
The edgier, more critical approach can be seen in the New Queer Cinema movement of the 1990s, a film movement that developed as a response to the epidemic. Gregg Araki’s “The Living End” (1992) is a key film in the movement: It tells the story of two HIV-positive men who become pseudo-vigilantes in the wake of their diagnoses.

Somewhere in between is “Longtime Companion” (1990), which was the first film about AIDS to receive a wide release and tracks the impact of the epidemic on a fictional group of gay men throughout the 1980s. The film was written by gay playwright and screenwriter Craig Lucas and directed by Norman Rene, who died of AIDS six years after the film’s release.
 
Studios still leery
In many ways, television is where the real breakthroughs have happened and continue to happen.
The first television episode to deal with AIDS appeared on the medical drama “St. Elsewhere” in 1983; AIDS was also the subject of episodes in the sitcoms “Mr. Belvedere,” “The Golden Girls” and “Designing Women.” “Killing All the Right People” was the title of the latter’s special episode — a phrase the show’s writer and co-creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason heard while her mother was being treated for AIDS.
More recently, producer Ryan Murphy has made a cottage industry of representations of queer people, particularly those with HIV. His stage revivals of “The Normal Heart” and Mart Crowley’s 1968 play “The Boys in the Band” were later adapted into films for television and streaming. He also produced “Pose,” a three-season series about drag ball culture in the 1980s that stars queer characters of color, several of whom are HIV positive.
Yet for all of these strides, representations of HIV in film are still hard to come by. In fact, out of the 256 films released by major distributors in 2024, the number of HIV-positive characters amounted to … zero.
Perhaps movie studios are less willing to risk even a character with HIV given the drop in movie theater attendance in the age of streaming.
If you think it’s an exaggeration to suggest that people might not want to be seen going to the theater to watch a film about characters with HIV, the results of a 2021 GLAAD survey may surprise you.
It found that the stigma around HIV is still very high, particularly for HIV-positive people working in schools and hospitals. One-third of respondents were unaware that medication is available to prevent the transmission of HIV. More than half didn’t know that HIV-positive people can reach undetectable status and not transmit the virus to others.
Another important finding from the survey: Only about half of the nonqueer respondents had seen a TV show or film about someone with HIV.
This reflects both the progress made since “Buddies” and “An Early Frost” and also why these films still matter today. They were released at a time when there was almost no cultural representation of HIV, and misinformation and disinformation were rampant. There have been so many advances, in both the treatment of HIV and its visibility in popular culture. That visibility still matters, because there’s still much more than can be done to end the stigma.

(Getty Images)Health insurance rates will increase sharply for the 4 million-plus Floridians who rely on so-called Obamacare plans or small employer health insurance coverage in the coming weeks, according to data released by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.
The OIR reported late last month that, beginning Jan. 1, 2026,  Florida health plans had been approved for double-digit increases in monthly premiums people pay for the individual policies sold on the federal health insurance exchange (healthcare.gov). Florida leads the nation in the number of people enrolled in the exchange.

A 28-year old adult living in Duval County earning $35,000 annually and enrolled in a silver-level individual health insurance plan may pay $281 a month starting Jan. 1, up from $149 now.
Premiums for a family of four earning $85,000 in Duval County will increase to $864 a month after tax credits in 2026, up from $558.
A 28-year-old- living in Miami-Dade County could pay a $322 monthly premium; premiums for such a person in Hillsborough County could total $298 a month. Family premiums in those counties will be $1,019 a month and $932 a month, respectively.
Rates in rural counties will be even higher. Okeechobee County has the dubious distinction of facing the highest premiums in the state: A family of four could pay $1,630 a month and an individual $484 a month.

The OIR posted the information “for illustrative purposes only” on Aug. 25 but did not otherwise publicly announce that it was available online for people to review in advance of open enrollment for 2026 coverage, which starts Nov. 1.
“Posting them on our website is making them public,” OIR spokesperson Kylie Mason told the Florida Phoenix in an email.
The increases in the costs of coverage — coupled with reductions to Medicaid in the 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act (also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill) and programmatic changes to the ACA  — could increase the number of uninsured residents in the state by as many as 730,000 in the next 10 years, a KFF analysis shows. 
Most of those people, 500,000, could become uninsured because of changes to Obamacare — formally the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — and the elimination of enhanced advanced premiums tax credits first made available in 2021 to further lower out-of-pocket costs for people in “silver” level plans.
If the enhanced advance premium tax credits expire, the number of uninsured residents in Florida could increase by another 1.2 million people, the same KFF analysis indicates. Those additional tax payments for co-payments and deductibles are set to expire at the end of the year. The Florida Hospital Association and other organizations want Congress to extend them.
“We’re approaching a healthcare cliff right now,” Florida Decides Healthcare spokesperson Karol Molinares told the Florida Phoenix. The organization is pushing a ballot initiative to place Medicaid expansion before the voters.
“That means ERs being clogged up, people not being able to see their primary-care doctors, uncompensated care. Costs for hospitals are going to skyrocket, which the state is going to be on the hook for. You’re also going to have 50,000 medical jobs that are going to be lost. It’s a whole chain reaction.”
More details
The rate increases affect small-employer coverage, too, because the ACA requires certain benefits and coverage to be included in the health plans small employers offer their staffs.
The rate increases for small businesses aren’t as great as those for individuals and therefore the premium increases aren’t as severe, but remain substantive. The OIR data show costs rising from an average $728 per individual in 2025 to $821 in 2026.
Although Republicans in Florida have not expanded Medicaid to lower-income childless adults, as the ACA allows, the federal health law is popular with residents who annually have flocked to the marketplace for health coverage.
The health exchanges represent a key component of the law, which changed how health insurance can be priced. The law bans insurance companies from medically underwriting the policies and allows rates to be based on four factors only: age, tobacco use, geographic location, and family size. 
Eighteen companies write in the state’s individual health insurance market, including the Community Care Network, a Department of Veterans Affairs health plan providing care outside of VA facilities that operates in Broward County only.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, operating under the Florida Blue moniker, offer policies across Florida’s 67 counties. Its affiliate, Health Options, provides HMO coverage in  64 counties. Centene Venture Co. Florida, meanwhile, is offered in 63 counties.
The OIR released 2026 county breakdowns of potential premiums for a 28-year-old individual earning $35,000 annually and potential premiums for a family of four earning $85,000. (Note: The 2025 county breakdowns showed premiums for individuals earning $34,000 and families of four earning $84,000.)
The OIR examples illustrate the costs of plans as well as costs after the advanced premium tax credits that reduce premiums. The numbers are based on the silver-level health insurance policy, the only plan that qualifies enrollees for additional credits to lower out-of-pocket costs. 
Florida is not alone in these rate hikes — insurers nationwide are filing double-digit increases. A KFF review of marketplace plans submitted by 312 insurers in 50 states and the District of Columbia shows that the median proposed increase for 2026 is 18%, more than double last year’s 7% median proposed increase.
Insurers cited rising costs, utilization of services, and the loss of enhanced advanced premium tax benefits as reasons behind the rate increases, according to KFF.
Medicaid expansion needed
According to the most recent OIR data, most people in Florida who purchased health insurance policies in 2023 bought individual coverage on the federal health insurance exchange.The 2023 data show that more than 5.8 million people maintained commercial health insurance policies, and most of those people, 3.6 million-plus, had individual health insurance. 
Nearly 1.8 million people had large-group plans — those sold to businesses with more than 51 employees. Small group policies insured another 400,164 lives in 2023. 
The soaring rates, Molinares said, underscore the need for Florida to expand Medicaid to low-income, childless adults, Molinares said.
“I think Medicaid expansion is the last tool in the tool box to avoid a healthcare cliff that we are barrelling toward if the ACA tax credits don’t get renewed,” she said.

Ned Lamont’s decision to order flags flown at half-staff in honor of Charlie Kirk is not only baffling —it is a disgrace.
In bestowing one of our state’s most solemn honors on a man whose public life was defined by cruelty, bigotry, and division, Lamont has insulted vast numbers of his own constituents—particularly people of color, women, LGBTQ+ folks, and immigrants—whom Kirk worked tirelessly to marginalize and silence.
Let’s be clear: flying the flag at half-staff is not a trivial gesture. It is a civic ritual meant to honor individuals who have served their country or community with distinction, who have elevated public life, who have helped us move closer to our ideals. It is a symbol of collective mourning for someone we believe made us better.
Charlie Kirk did the opposite. He built a career by inflaming our divisions, trafficking in racist and misogynistic rhetoric, and mocking the very people Connecticut claims to protect. As the founder of Turning Point USA, he led a campaign to harass educators, undermine public institutions, and spread conspiracy theories that corrode democratic trust. He did not serve this nation—he desecrated its promise.
While Lamont referenced President Trump’s proclamation that federal buildings fly flags at half staff in his order to do the same at state buildings, Trump’s proclamation is in no way binding on the state of Connecticut. At least two states, including near neighbors New York and New Jersey, appeared to be flying at full staff on Friday. Others simply extended, without comment, their order to lower flags in honor of the victims of the 9/11 attacks. Others mentioned “victims of political violence,” including  Mellisa Hortman, the Minnesota lawmaker assassinated earlier this year. Lamont’s appears to be a deliberate decision to join Trump in honoring a person at odds with the values of the majority of the people of Connecticut, with no connection to the state.
There is no shortage of community heroes in Connecticut who have spent their lives in service who never received such a gesture. Even just under  Lamont’s tenure, we have lost so many organizers, advocates, legislators, and others who all worked toward building solidarity and improving the lives of the people around them, and they were denied the honor that Lamont is now bestowing on a professional bigot.
Connecticut dignitaries like Martin Luther King Jr. associates Thirman L. Milner and Rev. Robert W. Perry, labor organizer and Connecticut House Minority Leader David Puldin, Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn, senior and care workers’ advocate and State Senator Edith Prague, and more have all died in the last several years with no such state honors.
Yet a man who compared the LGBTQ+ community to “a threat to civilization,” who cheered the rollback of women’s rights, who planned a dedicated campaign to chip away at the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., and who applauded political violence now receives state-sanctioned mourning? Why does Kirk, a provocateur with no ties to our state and a legacy of division, deserve more?
Even if Governor Lamont intended this as a gesture of political neutrality, he cannot hide behind decorum when the symbolism is so profoundly wrong. Neutrality in the face of hate is complicity. Mourning Charlie Kirk as a public servant worthy of reverence sends a clear message: that the pain he inflicted is less important than the political convenience of honoring a well-connected figure on the national stage.
This isn’t about partisan politics. It’s about values. It’s about deciding who we lift up, and who we mourn. Should Charlie Kirk have been murdered? No. Should we pretend that he was anything more than the shit-stirrer than he was? Also no. 
Honoring a man like Charlie Kirk with a public display of reverence is a deep betrayal of the communities he harmed —and a troubling sign of whose pain matters to this administration.
Governor Lamont must answer for this choice. And Connecticut residents should demand that our symbols of honor reflect the best of who we are —not the worst of what we’ve allowed.

(Al Persicke / The Reveille) U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Gov. Jeff Landry were among the participants at a vigil LSU held Friday evening for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. 
The event was organized by the LSU chapter of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization Kirk founded and built into an immense political force. 
Kirk, 31, was known for holding events at universities across the country where he engaged in debate with students. Though he was successful in mobilizing young people to support conservative causes, Kirk was a controversial figure for his often inflammatory comments about race, sexuality and religion. His events often sparked outrage from students. 
“I think Charlie Kirk contributed more positive contributions to the free marketplace of ideas than anyone in his generation, and probably in many generations,” Johnson said about Kirk, who he described as a close friend. 
Utah Valley University was Kirk’s first stop on what was meant to be a multi-state debating tour that included a stop at LSU on Oct. 27. 
Kirk was shot within minutes of the event starting. His death sparked immediate condemnations of political violence from across the political spectrum, as well as some further polarizing statements from both far-right and far-left corners. 
“It is important to recognize that the very idea of a representative republic is to allow for the free exchange of ideas that can be debated in a peaceful setting, so that we don’t have to fight it out in the street,” Landry said in a post on X in the aftermath of Kirk’s shooting. 
Kirk’s killing also prompted political figures and universities to rethink security measures for public events. LSU’s vigil required security screenings and was staffed by dozens of law enforcement officers from Louisiana State Police, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office, the Baton Rouge Police Department and the LSU Police Department. 
A suspect in Kirk’s death was arrested Friday and charged with aggravated murder, a capital offense in Utah. Authorities say they intend to pursue the death penalty for 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Little is known about his motivations. 
Savannah Harrison, a Landry aide and former president of LSU’s Turning Point chapter, held back tears while speaking about the impact Kirk had on her life. 
“I was the girl ripping Trump hats off of my classmates’ heads. But through Charlie’s influence, I went from doing that to proudly wearing my own,” Harrison said. “I … embraced the values that still ground me today – God, family, country, and, as Charlie would say, in that order.” 
LSU announced Friday it would launch a lecture series promoting civil engagement and diverse viewpoints in Kirk’s memory. The LSU Foundation is seeking donations to support the series. 
“In the wake of the assassination of American political activist and media personality Charlie Kirk, LSU seeks to be the first university in the country to tangibly re-assert its commitment to civil discourse and freedom of speech,” LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard and interim President Matt Lee said in a joint statement. “LSU has a long history of visible support for free speech … We are therefore well-positioned to take leadership on this front.” 
Lee said he hoped donations would soon come in to support the lecture series but did not know when it would start. 
Some conservatives have sought retribution against those who celebrated Kirk’s death. The Louisiana Republican Party issued a news release highlighting an LSU student who allegedly posted on social media “World famous fascist Charlie Kirk is dead. Rejoice,” and called on the university to take action against the student.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Ahead of an expected run for governor, former Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor is asking the state’s campaign finance regulator to exempt him from a law that requires he disclose who is renting apartments in several Anchorage buildings he owns.
Treg Taylor and his wife Jodi Taylor own the Inlet View Tower in Anchorage as well as two other apartment complexes in South Anchorage and near Midtown.
Under state law, public officials must file an annual financial disclosure form that lists the sources of their income, including rental income, if it is above $1,000. The Alaska Public Offices Commission, which collects and publishes that information, can waive the requirement that a public official provide the identities of his or her renters.
Taylor filed a request for an exemption in March, but that request came after the deadline to submit his 2024 disclosure form.
The Public Offices Commission is perennially underfunded and understaffed, and its electronic submission process doesn’t work properly with rental income, according to a staff report. 
Only 15 out of roughly 1,200 filers have rental income, commission staff said in a written report, and of those 15, only four have more than 20 tenants. The Taylors claim to have 234 renters. 
In a Wednesday hearing, Jodi Taylor asked commissioners to grant the Taylors the waiver, saying that people have tried to talk to their tenants about them.
“I felt like, in this case, people are trolling,” Jodi Taylor said.
She said one of her employees had been threatened with a gun, and that she believed disclosure could pose a safety risk.
Treg Taylor did not participate in the hearing on Wednesday.
Commissioners, who have not yet ruled on the request for a waiver, appeared skeptical of Jodi Taylor’s arguments.
Heather Hebdon, director of the commission, said there was “no legal justification” to exempt disclosure and that there was a substantial public interest in the information.
“The purposes of public official financial disclosures in part are to assure that public officials and their official acts are free from the influence of undisclosed business interests and to allow the public to have access to the information necessary to judge the public officials’ credentials or performance in office,” she said.
Taylor resigned as Alaska Attorney General last month, a position he held since 2021. His last day in office was Aug. 29, and his public appearances both before and after his resignation resemble those of currently registered candidates for the 2026 governor’s race.

Sfraga announced the federal decision in a campus-wide email on Thursday.

Sfraga said the funding cut for UAF is estimated at $2.9 million, and the full effects are still under review. More than 20%, or an estimated 1,450 students at UAF are Indigenous, Sfraga noted. 
The full extent of the grant funding freeze across the University of Alaska system is still being analyzed, said Jonathon Taylor, UA director of public affairs, by email on Friday.
UA President Pat Pitney said in an emailed statement on Friday that the university will continue to create a welcoming environment for all students. 
“We are evaluating the impact these changes will have on our services to Alaska Native students, and are communicating directly with students, staff, and faculty who may be affected,” Pitney said. “A significant part of UA’s identity is our commitment to Alaska Native culture, language, art, heritage, business, and tribal management and governance; that remains unchanged. We proudly embrace our global leadership in Alaska Native and Indigenous studies, and will continue to sustain a welcoming environment where all – including our Alaska Native and Indigenous students – can thrive and succeed.”
Taylor said the University of Alaska Southeast has at least one grant-funded program on the Sitka campus aimed at improving student services, and university officials are waiting to hear whether it will be eliminated. Taylor said the University of Alaska Anchorage does not have any programs funded by this federal grant.
As of fall 2024, there were 3,254 students enrolled at the University of Alaska that identified as Alaska Native or American Indian, and 266 that identified as Hawaiian Native or Pacific Islander, according to the university, and 19,629 students total across the UA system. 
The University of Alaska announcements came after the Trump administration said Wednesday it will withhold an estimated $350 million of congressionally-approved funding for minority serving colleges and universities, saying the money will be allocated elsewhere. The measure continues President Donald Trump’s initiative to eliminate programs that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Sfraga said the federal government is allowing up to a year to close out the programs. UAF has multiple grants which fall under the program, Sfraga said, and most are under the College of Indigenous Studies and the UAF Community and Technical College.
Sfraga said the grant program does not fund student aid, but it does support degree programs and support services like student advising and recruiting, workforce development and student success initiatives across campuses. 
University officials report that to date, the Trump administration has cancelled $6.6 million in research grants and almost $45 million has been frozen.
Each year, the university receives an estimated $250 million in federal research funds, Taylor said, adding that “95% of the university’s broad research portfolio remains intact. UA has experienced only minor disruptions as a result of the rapidly shifting policy picture in Washington, D.C., and we are closely monitoring developments as they evolve.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DSC09160-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 20:56:50.709425

Jim Pillen’s announcement last month that Nebraska is bringing a federal immigration detention facility to town.

Miguel and Mayra Camacho said they’ve heard other other area merchants describe similar commercial declines. Some Latinos they know have uprooted from southwest Nebraska, spurred by what the couple believes is fear and uneasiness over an increased ICE presence.
“And it’s not even open yet,” said Miguel Camacho, of the facility branded the “Cornhusker Clink” by federal officials. “Of all the 50 states, why here?”
‘People want to know’
Comments the Camachos made this week from their Carniceria — a few miles from where a state prison that holds up to 200 beds is being converted into a 300-bed ICE jail — reflected the sentiment of dozens who spoke against the project during a Friday hearing at the Capitol so full it required an overflow area.
The meeting was hosted by the Legislature’s Urban Affairs Committee. Chairman Terrell McKinney of Omaha offered the space after the chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee declined to hold a public hearing, calling the request premature.
McKinney, a member of both committees, said that while he had been offered a private briefing by the Pillen administration, he opted for a broader discussion open to the public.

He and other committee members said they were concerned about scant information shared about the state-federal plan to repurpose the McCook-based Work Ethic Camp into an ICE detention center for migrants. The state is still trying to relocate the camp’s remaining 155 inmates to different state prisons. Officials said they expect to start housing federal detainees in October.
“Our people want to know, and they’re asking,” said State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, who also sits on both committees. 
“What happens is that when there’s no information provided, negativity and misinformation run rampant,” said State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney, the lone Republican committee member who attended the hearing.
On Friday afternoon, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services issued a statement saying that Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys had spoken Thursday with McCook Mayor Linda Taylor and City Manager Nate Schneider about public safety and community impact.
Among the answers Corrections said it provided:

The converted ICE detention center will house an adult population with minor criminal records and nonviolent felonies. 
Up to 65 staff positions will be added, all state positions, including additional medical personnel.
The state is exploring options for electronic translation services to assist non-English speaking detainees.
A perimeter fence and intruder petition system will be added, as well as armed patrols around the perimeter.

A formal contract between Nebraska and the federal government is still being hammered out, Correctional Services officials said. 
 Four hours of testimony 

At the four-hour Urban Affairs hearing, about 40 people testified, none in support of the prison conversion that many worry could exacerbate state prison crowding elsewhere to accommodate the feds’ deportation push. 
Many said they were embarrassed. Some choked back tears. Others said they were angry to learn in news reports that the state had invited the Trump administration to consider Nebraska for such a facility.
Nebraskans packed a hearing on a plan to convert a Nebraska prison into an ICE jail. More than three dozen Nebraskans who could not fit into the room waited outside. The front row was reserved for Gov. Jim Pillen staff, which declined to attend, saying the committee lacked jurisdiction to examine the topic. Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Not present were members of the Pillen administration, which told the committee in a Thursday letter it would not participate, arguing that the the Judiciary Committee and not the Urban Affairs Committee had the legal jurisdiction and oversight authority to examine the issues at hand. Pillen’s staff did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
McKinney said he plans to ask the Judiciary Committee chair once again to hold a public hearing that he hopes Pillen’s staff would attend. 
Kenny Zoeller, Pillen’s policy research director, wrote in the Thursday’s letter that McKinney had wrongly suggested that the future migrant population at the center would trigger an overcrowding of the correctional system. Zoeller wrote that an emergency declaration is required when the prison population systemwide is over 140% of operational capacity. He said the average now is about 115%.
“We have flexibility within our current corrections facilities to accommodate this new mission,” Zoeller wrote.
Spike Eickholt, representing ACLU Nebraska, said Nebraska leaders for a decade have debated what to do about state prison crowding. Currently, Nebraska is building a new $310 million-plus prison in Lincoln.
“Why are we committing to an investment of a new prison while giving up a current one?” he asked.
Other speakers lamented the loss of the Work Ethic Camp’s rehabilitative focus and programming aimed at transitioning criminal offenders for successful re-entry into society.
 Nebraska’s role in deportation

But most of Friday’s testimony centered on Nebraska’s role in Trump’s push for mass deportations. Pillen has said he is proud to be part of the president’s effort to “make sure we keep our community safe.”
“This stuff hits close to home and hits every corner of this state an country,” the governor has said.

“Are we willing to risk that and be made a joke nationally as the ‘Cornhusker Clink’ — for money that we may or may not get — and that breaks all values of Nebraska?” she asked.
Guillermo Enrique Peña Valladares of Grand Island said he comes from a family of immigrants and that federal enforcement tactics have created anxiety and intimidation even among those legally in the country for generations.
“Should I fear saying my name?” he asked, voice cracking. He said his family works in meatpacking plants and his mom speaks broken English. “Every day we have to ask ourselves, ‘Are we going to be alright?’”
As his family’s first college graduate, Peña said, he felt a responsibility to speak out.
“You are trying to imprison the agricultural hands of Nebraska. They are already battered and bruised,” he said.
Anne Wurth, associate legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said a worry is the “lack of planning” and demeaning behavior by ICE toward migrants.
She said her nonprofit saw it first hand, representing several of the 78 workers detained in the June 10 immigration raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods. Wurth described, for example, the early 48 hours when some families did not know where relatives were being held and said some wounds went untreated.
“Their goal is to terrorize immigrants,” she said of the federal government. “They continue to demean and dehumanize a population that is integral to the state of Nebraska … We must not do this for them.”
 ‘Pissed off grandmas’ 

Don Hooper, a retired educator, was among several who decried the politics. He said he does not want “Cornhusker Clink” to join Nebraska’s “good life” and “home of Arbor Day” signs on the highway.

If the facility comes, he said: “It should be named … ‘Pillen’s prison’ in honor of the individual who wants this in Nebraska.”
McKinney said he appreciated a petition opposing the immigration detention center coordinated by Nebraska Appleseed, as it reflected statewide opinions. Appleseed’s Ruby Mendez said the effort collected more than 18,000 signatures from people in nearly 400 Nebraska communities.
Faith Colburn said she drove in from North Platte with concerns about legal and other services that migrants would have available in McCook. 
“I’m here representing 50 people,” she said. “Many of them are furious, pissed off grandmas.”
About 650 people also submitted written testimony to the Urban Affairs committee. Because it was for an interim hearing, McKinney said, the correspondence had not been categorized into opponents, proponents or neutral.
 Carniceria survival plan  

In McCook, Miguel and Mayra Camacho said they would not close shop, and hope that business picks up.

The family’s move six years ago from Kansas to the Nebraska community of about 7,200 people was calculated, they said. The area has a Walmart and other key stores that draw residents of surrounding towns.
Their two kids attend local schools, and have felt a sting from the proposed ICE facility. A classmate asked their daughter if she had seen her “new house,” said Camacho.
The small business owners said they are trying to form a group to provide information and support to Latinos in the community. They said they’ve enjoyed the McCook area and their patrons. 
The couple rode out the COVID-19 slump, opening the Carniceria’s doors every day. Gesturing toward the empty store and restaurant, Camacho said the plan now is to do the same: “Stay here, protect it, survive.”
He added, ‘If the community tells me I’m not welcome, we’ll move.”

The Nature Conservancy conducted a three-year pilot project on the technology. (Photo by Dale Maxson/The Nature Conservancy)Cattle at a nature preserve in eastern Iowa appear to roam the land freely — no fences or cowboys on horseback patrol their movement. 
Instead, these cows wear special collars that keep them from grazing beyond the boundaries their owners designate via a phone or computer. 
The Nature Conservancy has studied this form of virtual fencing with cattle at its Land of the Swamp White Oak Preserve for the past three years with the hope that the technology can be integrated into other ranchers’ operations. 
Amy Crouch, The Nature Conservancy’s Little Sioux project director who headed the virtual fencing project, said the collars can give ranchers peace of mind, reduce labor on managed grazing operations and help put cattle onto more land.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With the collars, producers can do things like easily keep cattle from grazing — and therefore defecating — in vegetation near a stream, which protects water quality. They also know where a cow is if it gets out of bounds, and they are alerted if a cow has not moved for a certain period of time. 
Crouch said she grew up with milk cows and remembers the feeling of being tethered to the farm to take care of the cows. 
“I imagine it’s the same for a lot of these producers who do the intensely managed grazing, where they’re moving them all the time,” Crouch said. “If they could have this labor-saving device, so they can concentrate on doing other things too, how tremendous.”
But, the technology is still relatively new to the country, which is why Crouch said The Nature Conservancy decided to run a pilot project. Now, interested Iowans have somewhere to learn about the technology and how it might work on an Iowa landscape. 
How does the virtual fence work? 
Crouch said The Nature Conservancy project started around 2021 when a company from Norway appeared at a Practical Farmers of Iowa event and told her about the virtual fence technology. 
“Think of it like an invisible dog fence,” Crouch said, explaining how the virtual fencing works. “But a little more sophisticated and complicated.” 
Cows are suited up with a GPS-enabled collar that sits on their necks like a stereotypical cow bell.
Then, cattle are moved into a traditionally fenced paddock, but with one open side. Operators use a computer or smart phone to set the virtual fence around the open side so the cows can learn how the fence works.

When cattle get a certain distance from the virtual fence line, they’re sent an auditory tone, then another louder tone as they get closer and finally if they get too close the collar gives a vibration. Crouch said the collar doesn’t give a shock, but the vibration is unpleasant to the cow. 
“They catch on so fast,” Crouch said. “They hear that tone, and they don’t even stop grazing, they just change direction and go a different way. So it’s really, really easy on them, and it’s easy on the farmer too.” 
Once the cows are trained on the collars, farmers can move the cows to a fully virtual-fenced paddock and use the technology to move the cattle, gradually through different grazing areas. 
The collars are solar charged, so once they’re on the cows, farmers don’t have to worry about trying to wrestle with a cow to switch out a battery. 
Crouch said occasionally they have had issues with cattle sitting under tree shade most of the day and losing charge on their collars, but she said ranchers in more open spaces might not have to worry about that as much.
Benefits of virtual fencing
Producers who use highly managed grazing techniques, or grazing that strategically moves the cattle through different pastures to balance manure and plant regrowth, typically move their cattle every day or every couple of days. Crouch said the virtual fence would save hours of labor for these types of operations, which are believed to improve soil and water quality. 
At the Land of the Swamp White Oak Preserve, Crouch said staff used the virtual fence to encourage cattle to chomp down on areas with an invasive species and then to stay out of sensitive areas like a wetland. 
But even for producers who don’t move their cattle as frequently, Crouch said the virtual fence alleviates a lot of time and a lot of worry, because farmers can see exactly where each head of their herd is with one glance at the application. 
It also saves time on fence management. With a virtual fence, farmers no longer have to spend time setting up and repairing fence lines.
Research into virtual fencing from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Northwest Climate Hub found the technology could even be beneficial to ranchers who operate in areas susceptible to wildfires. While traditional fencing would burn, farmers could quickly adjust their virtual fence boundaries to keep cattle away from burned areas, or areas susceptible to fire. 
“Theoretically, you could have a cornfield in the middle of your pasture and they’d stay out — well, you know, as much as cattle can resist that,” Crouch said with a laugh. “The push and pull of the unpleasantness (from the collar deterrents) or corn.” 
A herd equipped with a virtual fence system could also graze the cover crop on a neighboring field, or the back corners of a field that would otherwise be too hard to put cattle on with traditional fencing. 
“The potential for all of that is just huge,” Crouch said. “…that’s one of the huge things, getting cattle back on the land.”
Implementing
Crouch said the collars and technology are slightly more expensive than the cost of installing a new fence. But, she said the year-to-year cost of fence maintenance and labor, give the virtual fencing an advantage over traditional fencing. 
Crouch said she has been “very impressed” by the durability of the collars even though they’re outside and on a cow 24/7. 
“They’re dunked in water tanks and rolled on the ground and smacked on trees and they’re fine,” Crouch said. 
The hardest part, she said, is learning to put the collars on. 
That’s why The Nature Conservancy wanted to launch a pilot project. Now, farmers who are interested in implementing the technology have someone local to turn to with questions. 
Each August, the conservancy has led a field day for interested parties to learn about the collars and how they have worked on an Iowa landscape, though this year’s field day was canceled due to flooding. 
The field days give farmers the opportunity to see how the technology works, before they decide to invest thousands of dollars to implement the system in their operation. 
“They’re able to see it practically before deciding whether they want to implement it on their own place,” Crouch said.

(Photo courtesy of Public School Employees of Washington.) School is finally back in session following a three-week delay at Evergreen Public Schools in southwest Washington, after unionized staff approved a deal with district administrators. 
Members of  Public School Employees of Washington  SEIU Local 1948 initiated the first strike in the union’s 57-year history on Aug. 26 following months of failed contract negotiations. 
The union represents 1,400 paraeducators, bus drivers, security officers, maintenance workers and other “classified” non-teacher staff at Evergreen Public Schools. They demanded that the district adequately compensate paraeducators, who assist teachers with classroom instruction, and address what the union described as critical understaffing.
“This agreement is the product of incredible strength and unity from Evergreen’s classified staff,” said Mindy Troffer-Cooper, president of the Evergreen chapter of Public School Employees of Washington.
The  Evergreen Public Schools board last week authorized its legal team to take “all lawful steps necessary” to end the strike, including filing a request in Clark County Superior Court for an injunction to force striking employees back to work. 
The district and union negotiators reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday, with union members voting to approve the agreement Thursday night. 
Class resumed on Friday, Sept. 12. The district has about 22,000 students.  
“Our members stood strong in the face of legal threats and misleading tactics because they knew what was at stake: stability for students, livable wages for staff, and respect for the work that keeps schools running,” Troffer-Cooper said. 
She attributed the success of the strike to solidarity across the labor community, thanking teachers, parents, students, community allies and other labor partners for supporting Evergreen’s classified staff.

Members of the teacher’s union began striking Sept. 3. They sought higher wages to retain and attract quality staff and compete with neighboring districts.   
Union members planned to vote on the agreement on Friday. If approved, school will reopen on Monday, Sept. 15. Classes started in La Center on Aug. 27 and paused on Sept. 3. 
“We are looking forward to welcoming students back to their classrooms,” said Superintendent Peter Rosenkranz. 
Meanwhile, classified staff at Vancouver Public Schools voted Thursday to authorize a strike. 
A start date for the strike had not been announced as of Friday afternoon. 
Members of the Vancouver Association of Educational Support Professionals failed to reach an agreement after months of negotiations and have been without a contract since Aug. 31. 
The union represents over 800 paraeducators, clerks, secretaries, tech support specialists, maintenance workers and other staff. 
Union members are asking for additional training, increased staffing, shortened time between salary increases, and pay hikes for inclement weather and work-related injuries. 
“We deeply respect our VAESP labor partners and appreciate schools cannot run without these staff,” Vancouver Public Schools says on its website, adding that bargaining is “especially difficult right now” due to funding not matching the actual costs of operations. 
 
“We are all left trying to find a way to make sure our students and staff get what they need, and deserve, even with our very limited resources,” Vancouver Public Schools adds in its statement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/535236158_1176010081225818_3430053679891650139_n-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634
,California,2025-09-12 23:36:44+00:00,CalMatters,California Legislature overrides local zoning to boost transit-oriented development,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/09/neighborhood-transit-upzoning/,"The bill, among the most controversial housing proposals in recent memory, overcame opposition from local governments, organized labor unions and many legislative Democrats.","In summary
The bill, among the most controversial housing proposals in recent memory, overcame opposition from local governments, organized labor unions and many legislative Democrats.


California lawmakers just laid the groundwork for a highly targeted building boom.
Senate Bill 79, authored by San Francisco Democrat Sen. Scott Wiener, would “upzone” neighborhoods immediately surrounding train, light rail and subway stations in many of the state’s most populous metro areas. That means apartment developers will be able to construct residential buildings — some as tall as 75 feet — regardless of what local zoning maps, elected officials or density-averse neighbors say. 
In a legislative year teeming with controversial housing bills designed to kick-start more construction in California, SB 79 has been among the most controversial. Because it would override the planning decisions of local governments, the bill had to overcome opposition from a host of city governments and their defenders in the Legislature, while fracturing the Capitol’s reigning Democratic Party over questions of affordability, labor standards and who ultimately has the final say over what gets built where.
The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom who supporters expect will sign it.
Wiener’s bill is meant to address two crises at once: The state’s long-term housing shortage and the financial precarity of its public transit agencies. By allowing taller and denser development, the legislation is meant to pave the way for more apartment developments in areas closest to jobs and services. By centering that development around public transit stations, it’s meant to steer more people away from cars and towards buses and trains. 
“Decades of overly restrictive policies have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people away from jobs and transit and into long commutes from the suburbs,” Wiener said in a statement after Friday’s vote. “Today’s vote is a dramatic step forward to undo these decades of harm, reduce our most severe costs, and slash traffic congestion and air pollution in our state.”
SB 79 would also give transit agencies the ability to develop their own land, giving them another potential revenue source — a financial model common across East Asian metros.
Making it easier to build on and around public transit stops has been a career-spanning effort for Wiener, who first introduced a version of the idea in 2018. That measure died in its first committee hearing. Wiener tried again in 2019 and 2020, but was never able to push the idea out of the Senate. 
That’s all helped to bestow the proposal with a kind of mythic status in California’s legislative housing wars. Its success at last slaps a symbolic bow on a year marked by the state Legislature’s unprecedented appetite for pro-development bills. Earlier this year lawmakers made national news in exempting most urban apartment projects from the state’s premier environmental review law.
California YIMBY, one of the sponsors of the bill and a vocal force in the Capitol for pro-construction legislation, was quick to take a victory lap after the final vote in the Senate this afternoon.
“Today, California YIMBY achieved one of its founding goals — legalizing apartments and condos near train stations,” said the organization’s CEO Brian Hanlon in a written statement. “We won many victories over the past eight years, but the dream of passing a robust, transit-oriented development program has long eluded us, until now.”
For opponents of state-imposed density measures, the vote marks an equally weighty defeat. 
Susan Kirsch, founder of Catalysts for Local Control, a nonprofit that advocates for the preservation of municipal authority over housing policy, predicted that the legislation would have a “devastating impact” on California’s low-rise neighborhoods, describing “extreme seven-story buildings next to single-family homes with nothing that the community can do about it.”
Amended to victory
The secret to Wiener’s success this year after so many past failures may be his willingness to whittle the bill down.
Over the course of the year, the proposal underwent 13 rounds of amendments — more than any other policy bill. Many of those changes were made to convince powerful interest groups to drop their opposition. That often meant reducing the bill’s scope.
The legislation would only apply to  counties with at least 15 passenger rail stations. According to its sponsors, just eight counties fit the bill: Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Santa Clara, Alameda, Sacramento, San Francisco and San Mateo. 
That’s a concession that likely softened opposition from rural and suburban legislators. 
Rather than applying to every major bus line in the state, as the 2018 iteration did, SB 79 only targets homes within a half mile of train stations, subway stops and “high-frequency” light rail and commuter rail stops. Buildings within the nearest quarter mile of Amtrak stations, Bay Area Rapid Transit stops and Los Angeles subway stations can top out at roughly seven stories. But parcels further out or surrounding less-trafficked light rail stations would be capped at more modest heights.

The legislation also comes with asterisks about the kinds of projects that can make use of its provisions. Developers, in select cases, must hire unionized construction workers — a provision that convinced the powerful State Building and Construction Trades Council to drop its opposition. 
Projects must also set aside a modest share of homes for lower-income residents (at least 7%) and replace any rent-controlled units that are destroyed during construction. Lower-income neighborhoods also have more time to plan for the rezoning with the new rules not taking effect until at least 2032. That compromise led a number of tenant rights,“housing justice” advocacy groups and other affordability advocates to stand down earlier this week.
Case in point: Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat who, as chair of the Senate’s Housing committee, nearly killed the bill earlier this year, was the second to speak in favor of it on Friday. 
In a fig leaf to ticked off local governments, the bill also allows cities that are already planning for transit-oriented apartment buildings at a significant scale, such as San Francisco and Sacramento, to stick with those plans rather than abide by the full scope of the new law. 
“If you look at the bill and you read the bill, I actually view it as a thoughtful, relatively narrow-in-scope bill,” Oakland Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland and frequent political ally of Wiener’s on housing matters, said on the Assembly floor Thursday. 
Reshaping the American Dream
Many of her fellow legislators, Democratic and Republican alike, disagreed.
The Senate ultimately passed the bill by the narrowest possible margin, with Wiener only claiming his final vote from Bakersfield GOP Sen. Shannon Grove after a few tense minutes. The Assembly vote was equally close, with just 43 of the chamber’s 80 members supporting it. 
“This blunt, one-size-fits-all bill will not work for a district like mine,” said Assemblymember Rick Chavez-Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat who represents portions of Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and Hollywood. “For many Californians, living in a single-family neighborhood fulfills a lifelong dream — the American Dream.”  
Placing apartment blocks in those neighborhoods “has the potential to fundamentally reshape my district without the benefit of careful land-use planning,’ he said.
Zbur was partially channeling opposition from his counterparts in local government. Last month, a narrow majority on the Los Angeles City Council voted to oppose SB 79, which members characterized as a Sacramento power grab and a giveaway to real estate developers. The city is one of dozens of municipalities that came out against the measure.

Supporters counter that deferring to local governments on land use decisions has resulted in a chronic undersupply of new housing, as local elected officials have historically catered to the interests of change-averse homeowners. 
Marc Vukcevich, a policy director for the LA-based transit and pedestrian advocacy group Streets For All, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he didn’t think the city of Los Angeles’ opposition to the measure carried much weight.
“The Legislature knows that LA is a deeply unserious actor when it comes to housing,” he said.
Most significant housing bill ever?
For all the concessions Wiener made along the way, backers of the bill are still calling the proposal historic.
“It’s by far the biggest housing bill the California Legislature has passed,” said Matthew Lewis, a spokesperson for California YIMBY. “There’s more to do, but it’s a major, major step. And honestly, I feel like as people start to see what is actually going to happen, the politics will start to change too.”
“The fear is Hong Kong. I think the reality is going to be something closer to Copenhagen — not everyone is going to build the maximum demand,” he said.
Whether homeowners in Palo Alto, mid-city San Diego and the San Fernando Valley ultimately come to appreciate the new apartment developments in their communities will depend on whether any get built in the first place. 
Past upzoning efforts in California have proven to be more ambitious on paper than in practice. In 2021, state lawmakers passed Senate Bill 9, a measure that both supporters and opponents said would end single-family zoning in California by allowing homeowners to build up to four units on their property. Four years in, the law has resulted in precious few units. Housing advocates point to costly requirements and loopholes that made the law difficult for property owners to actually use.
Simon Büchler, an economist at the Miami University in Ohio who has studied the results of different upzoning policies, said developers are generally keen to build around public transportation stations, making SB 79 a promising approach.
“The success of upzoning depends crucially on where it happens,” he said in an email. “Ideally, you want to upzone in high-demand areas with strong transit connections, since those are the places where added density will translate into meaningful increases in supply.”
In any case, the changes will be gradual. “Supply increases take time (often many years) to materialize, even in the right places, so these policies are far from an overnight solution,” he said.
Cobbling together enough single-family homes in a desirable transit-adjacent neighborhood is easier said than done, said Mott Smith, a developer and board member of the California Infill Builders Association. Land values are steep. Finding enough sufficiently large land all in one place requires a fair bit of luck. Both make it hard to profitably build a six-story apartment building. 
“We will probably see in the next five years 20 to 30 SB 79 projects around the state, that’s my wild guess,” he said. “Both the opponents and the proponents of the bill are probably overstating how much this is going to change the built environment in California.”
That could be especially true in the current economic climate. Tariffs on building goods, immigration crackdowns targeting construction workers and high interest rates show no sign of abating, factors that make it hard to build — close to a train station or not.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_Oakland-Housing_AW_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers decided Friday to release withheld funding to 40 cities and towns and give them extra time to update the state on required water and sewer system audits.
The decision came after the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee spent two hours debating whether to give the municipalities further grace for their unfiled 2022 audit reports, which were due to the state July 1, 2024. Each municipality must provide the delinquent report to Arkansas Legislative Audit by Dec. 31 or an engagement letter with a certified public accountant promising the report will be submitted by that date. Lack of compliance will result in the state withholding funds again.
Local governments receive two types of “turnback funds” from the state. General revenue turnback funds support basic local services such as emergency response. Turnback funds from state highway revenue go to municipalities and are required to be spent on maintaining roads that are continuations of state highways or former state highways.
In order to receive turnback funds, municipalities must file audits of their water and sewer systems with Arkansas Legislative Audit no later than 18 months after the end of the audit’s fiscal year. Act 453 of 2023 states that lawmakers can ask the state treasurer to withhold the funds if a municipality misses the 18-month deadline, and the funds can only be restored if the municipality submits all its reports through the most recent fiscal year.
The Counties and Municipalities subcommittee of the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee voted in July to authorize the treasurer’s office to withhold these funds from 43 cities and towns whose 2022 water and sewer audits were outstanding at the time.
Since July, the municipalities of Delight, Horseshoe Lake and Pollard had their funding restored after submitting their reports for fiscal years 2022 through 2024, according to a list of delinquent municipalities Deputy Legislative Auditor Joe Archer provided the Advocate.
Of the remaining 40 municipalities, 14 have submitted their 2022 audit reports, according to the list, and nine have also submitted their 2023 audit reports. The remaining 26 municipalities have yet to submit any water and sewer audit reports for the past three fiscal years.
Turnback funds are disbursed on the 10th of every month, meaning the 40 municipalities did not receive their usual September disbursement. The two months of withheld funds from the municipalities total $477,797.71, according to data treasurer’s office fiscal director Kathie Williams provided the Advocate.

 
 Committee debate

Sen. David Wallace, R-Leachville, was one of Act 453’s sponsors. He proposed the grace period until Dec. 31 and the release of the 40 municipalities’ turnback funds at Thursday’s Counties and Municipalities subcommittee meeting.
Wallace’s motion passed the subcommittee, but members of the full committee balked Friday when asked to approve the subcommittee’s actions.
Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, proposed that the committee vote separately on the turnback funds issue because the subcommittee’s decision might be “in direct conflict with state law.” Womack’s motion failed on a roll call vote.
There were no representatives present from the Attorney General’s office to comment on the legality of Wallace’s proposal. Legislative Audit Legal Counsel Emily White said the proposal implied that the 40 municipalities were “in compliance” with Act 453 “when based on our interpretation of the law, they might not be.”
White pointed out that Act 453 does not give the state treasurer’s office any discretion not to withhold turnback funds if lawmakers notify the office that a municipality’s audit reports are late.
Wallace said lawmakers’ responsibilities include making decisions outside of regular legislative sessions and “not to hide behind the bureaucracy.”
“If we can’t come down here and make decisions that affect our state, we might as well go ahead and stay home and play dominoes,” Wallace said.
The committee accepted the subcommittee’s report, including the release of the turnback funds, on a roll call vote with 16 members voting yes. The decision authorized the Republican co-chairs, Rep. Robin Lundstrum of Elm Springs and Sen. Jim Petty of Van Buren, to notify the treasurer’s office that the body rescinded its July referral of the delinquent municipalities.
Lundstrum was among the 12 lawmakers to vote against the motion, calling it “dangerous uncharted territory” for the committee to effectively change a provision of a law.

Rep. Julie Mayberry, R-Hensley, also opposed the motion. She said she disagreed with Wallace that lawmakers can make decisions about how to apply laws outside legislative sessions.
“Whether you like the law or not, that’s what we voted on as legislators,” Mayberry said. “If it needs to be changed, then we need to do something to do it the right way. This is not the right way to do it. This is allowing a small, little group of people the power to override the rest of the members here.”
 Local impact

Lawmakers who supported releasing the turnback funds said cities and towns in their districts were struggling and would continue to struggle if they lost more monthly income.
Rep. Mark McElroy, R-Tillar, said “small towns in the Delta” have few accountants at their disposal. He also said local governments have higher priorities than completing audits, such as providing safe water and sewer services.
Rep. Howard Beaty and Sen. Ben Gilmore, both Crossett Republicans, also said the withheld funds directly impact their constituents. 
“We’re not changing law by taking this action,” Beaty said. “We’re giving grace to some communities that need it, some of the most impoverished communities that we have in the state.”
Beaty and Gilmore represent Lake Village, a city of about 2,000 people that had nearly $34,000 withheld in August and September.
The city froze its spending and hiring in response to the funding shortage, Lake Village Mayor Eddy Bush told the Advocate. He said the city has already provided the state a letter of engagement with an accountant promising the completion of the required audits by Dec. 31.
Bush and Elaine Mayor Lisa Hicks-Gilbert both said they were relieved to learn that their cities will receive their regularly scheduled turnback funds for the rest of the year.
The roughly $4,000 per month in turnback funds makes up the largest revenue source for Elaine, Hicks-Gilbert said. The city of just over 500 people is in McElroy’s district and has no local sales tax to bring in additional revenue.
Elaine residents rejected a ballot measure to create a local sales tax last year. Hicks-Gilbert said she urged citizens to support the measure in case the city’s state funding stopped or became precarious.

The funding shortage forced the city not to make some purchases, and it would have had to make budget cuts if lawmakers hadn’t decided to restore the funding, Hicks-Gilbert said.
“$4,000 or $5,000 is not a lot of money, but it is when it’s all you have to fall on,” she said.
Like Lake Village, Elaine has obtained letters of engagement from accountants who should complete the audits by year’s end, Hicks-Gilbert said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wallace_MJohnson-scaled-e1757717723194-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)BELLEVUE — Top U.S. House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries traveled here Friday to decry rising health insurance costs he says are driven by recent actions from congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.
Low-income Americans face the combination of steep cuts to Medicaid in the years to come and the looming expiration of federal tax credits that help them afford insurance coverage. 
Premiums for individual insurance bought on the Washington Health Benefit Exchange through the Affordable Care Act are set to rise an average of 21% next year, state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer announced this week. 
This hike is in line with similar jumps across the country. Last year’s average rate increase was 10.7%. The state has to approve the rate increases if they’re actuarially justified. 
Jeffries said he’s willing to risk a government shutdown if Republicans don’t reverse what he sees as an assault on health care. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government.
“Democrats will support a bipartisan spending agreement that is negotiated between the House and the Senate, if it lifts up the quality of life of the American people, with a focus on three areas, their health, their safety and their economic wellbeing,” said Jeffries, a New York congressman. “We will not support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people.”
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday he and Jeffries are united in opposing any funding plan that doesn’t include their health care demands.
Jeffries appeared at a press conference at Overlake Medical Center, alongside Gov. Bob Ferguson, state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer and U.S. Reps. Suzan DelBene and Kim Schrier.
“It’s great to be with folks who are smart and strategic and substantive and be able to say I’m in Washington at the same period of time,” Jeffries quipped.
He was set to participate in a Seattle-area fundraiser Friday evening for DelBene hosted by state Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove. DelBene chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Subsidies set to expire
Nearly 300,000 residents buy health plans through the exchange, which serves people who don’t get coverage from their work or don’t qualify for public programs like Medicaid, known in Washington as Apple Health, or Medicare. Three-quarters of those Washingtonians qualified for federal premium tax credits that helped drop annual premiums an average of $1,330. For seniors, those savings jump to more than $1,900 annually, according to Ferguson’s office.
But those subsidies, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic, will expire at the end of the year without congressional action. In July, the exchange reported the expiration would lead to 80,000 people in Washington choosing to forego coverage. 
Those who choose to go without insurance are more likely to be healthy, likely fueling further premium hikes for those who remain insured, as the insurance pool would be less healthy overall and more risky for insurers. Nationwide, costs for insurance on the marketplace are estimated to rise more than 75%, with more than 4 million people going uninsured, according to the nonpartisan health research group KFF.
Some Republicans have expressed an openness to extending the tax credits, even if just for one year.
The uninsured rate in Washington was 4.8% as of 2023. For years, the state made progress getting more people health insurance, but officials say that headway is now threatened.
“We’ve come far in making healthcare more accessible and affordable, but we still have much more work to do,” said DelBene, D-Medina. “We should be talking about what we do to go forward, not going backward.”
Overlake CEO and President Jon Duarte anticipates hospitals will have to deal with providing more uncompensated care, straining their finances, if the subsidies are allowed to expire.
Kuderer said Congress needs to act quickly if lawmakers are going to extend tax credits, as her office would need to approve revised rates in time for open enrollment, which begins Nov. 1 and lasts until Jan. 15.
The Washington Health Benefit Exchange Board plans to ask the state Legislature for tens of millions of dollars in funding to mitigate the loss of the tax credits.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Meanwhile, the state is also bracing for drastic cuts to Medicaid that Congress passed in the so-called “big, beautiful bill.” 
The stated goal is rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the insurance program for low-income Americans. 
Critics here in Washington say new work requirements to qualify for Medicaid and other changes in the law could cost the state billions per year in federal funding, force hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians to lose coverage and strain hospitals. 
The work requirements don’t take effect until January 2027, so it will take a while to know the effects of the law, a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy agenda.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4463-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 19:58:28.237634

Sept. 11, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz/Michigan AdvanceANN ARBOR – At the intersection of Fuller Road and Medical Center Drive outside the University of Michigan hospital in Ann Arbor, a wave of chants criticizing the health care institution echoed alongside shouts and honking of drivers.
The scene was a show of frustration and anger, all in support of transgender youth who will now be denied gender affirming care due to the hospital system’s decision to end that care.
At least one hundred demonstrators, carrying signs and waving transgender flags, were there among students and community members who gathered Thursday afternoon to protest the decision following federal pressure.
The statewide hospital network in August said that it would stop providing medically necessary gender affirming health care services – such as prescribing puberty blockers and gender affirming hormones – for patients under age 19. University of Michigan Health and its Michigan Medicine brand argued the decision was made due to an ongoing federal “criminal and civil investigation into gender-affirming care for minors.”
“The [system] is one of multiple institutions across the country that have received a federal subpoena as part of a criminal and civil investigation into gender-affirming care for minors,” said Mary Masson, senior director of public relations at Michigan Medicine, in a statement in response to the rally. “In light of that investigation, and given escalating external threats and risks, we will no longer provide gender affirming hormonal therapies and puberty blocker medications for minors.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In mid-July, the U.S. Department of Justice issued several subpoenas to dozens of health care institutions and doctors across the country “involved in performing transgender medical procedures on children.”. The action by the federal government under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, seeking to limit funding for hospitals and providers offering gender-affirming care to minors, are aimed at what the administration has called “gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth.”
At the rally Thursday, demonstrators were joined by a series of speakers, including community leaders, local politicians, and hospital officials, all focused on the vital importance of these services for many transgender youths. They also touched on the threat posed by the decision and the ripple effect for other Michigan health institutions, bolstered by anonymous testimonies from affected transgender minors.

Washtenaw County Commissioner Yousef Rabhi, a former state representative and the legislative director for the Michigan Nurses Association, said transgender youth in his community deserve necessary and life-sustaining care. Taking that away from them was “a crime.” 
“And at the end of the day, I want to remind us all of the people who make the decisions at this university,” Rabhi said. “They’re elected by all of us. Every two years, you have an opportunity to elect regents. Use that opportunity to hold them accountable.”
Christina Helou, a doctor of physical therapy at University of Michigan Health, told Michigan Advance that restricting access to gender-affirming care was irresponsible. 
“This decision is not based on fact, Helou said. “It is not based on science. It is not based on medical health care evidence. It is strictly based on political pressure from this administration because they’re transphobic.”
Although the university didn’t specify details of the federal subpoena it received, a report from Talking Points Memo showed that the justice department’s  requests received on July 14 was similar to those sent to Philadelphia’s Children’s Hospital, where “individual doctors received a hold order not to destroy documents” and the DOJ was “pursuing a civil and criminal investigation.” 
Doctors are now worried they could face heavy legal fees and potentially lose their medical licenses.
The report, published on Aug. 25, also explains that U of M members were already aware that they would receive new federal requirements a few weeks in advance, and DOJ lawyers were investigating doctors suspected of misusing their authority to prescribe medication, among other potential charges.
Within these federal requests, the New York Times reported that, based on the subpoena sent to The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the justice department requested detailed personal information of minor patients, including their names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and parents’ information. Additionally, information about hospital staff, contractors, and affiliates involved in gender-affirming health services, as well as communications between the hospital and providers, was also required.
On Wednesday, Corewell Health released a statement to its patients announcing it, too,would no longer provide gender-affirming hormonal therapies and puberty blockers to minors, arguing a “serious risk of legal and regulatory action.” Corewell is now the latest Michigan health care system to discontinue gender-affirming care for minors under federal pressure.

On Friday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said she was deeply disappointed in Corewell’s decision.
“They have chosen to capitulate to the federal administration’s discriminatory campaign against the trans community, despite Corewell not being a target of any federal action in this realm,” Nessel said in a statement. “Corewell’s shortsighted approach to conform their treatment options and ‘obey in advance’ fails to adequately consider the long-term consequences to the health, safety and well-being of their patients. Michigan law has not changed; gender affirming care remains legal and is approved healthcare by leading healthcare associations.”
Nessel also said the hospitals have chosen to disregard science, best practices, and the recommendations of every major medical society in the nation. She said that created a dangerous precedent that could long-lasting implications on all patients, not just transgender youth.
“We have seen virtue signaling from the federal administration that they intend to detrimentally attack many other areas of public health and medical treatment,” Nessel said. “We must ask ourselves: what other medical practices or care will this Administration target next – reproductive care, vaccines, scientific studies – and will our healthcare institutions quickly succumb to such pressure each and every time?
Parents of transgender children have been left in a state of uncertainty and frustration.
“She had her exit appointment last Thursday, and after that, she became aware that the world is coming to get her. She is devastated,” said Kami Michels, 46, a board member of the Jim Toy Community Center, who told the Advance about hardships her 16-year-old transgender daughter has felt since U of M stopped her gender-affirming care after five years.

Even though Masson specified that U of M is working closely with all impacted patients, and that they “will continuously support the well-being of our patients, their families, and our teams,” for Michels, the reality looks different. 
Although her daughter was able to secure a prescription that will last for years, Michels feels guilty because not everyone has been as fortunate. 
“I have already secured her ongoing care, which not everyone is going to be able to do,” she said.
Michels also criticized the university for abandoning transgender children, claiming that the university’s words of support for the community do not reflect actions in line with federal guidance. 
“Don’t send us another email about how much you care about civil rights,” Michels said. “You say you won’t tolerate totalitarianism; then why are you letting it run your hospital? We are coming for your pocketbook. … Not a single cent of our money will go to you because we know that’s all you really care about. We will not stand by while you abandon the kids who need you most.”

The federal program, which funds nutrition and exercise education for eligible recipients, will end Sept. 30, eliciting worry from officials and providers.

The SNAP-Ed program — which focuses on nutrition education and overall wellness for people on food stamps — will end Sept. 30, cutting off hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual grants that supported programming across all Vermont counties, including recipe demonstrations, meal kits and active-living guides.
The program’s elimination was part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget adjustments that passed on July 4 in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. As the state’s food assistance network finds its way through a new landscape of shortfalls, officials worry more residents will fall through the cracks.
SNAP-Ed is an extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which has experienced a number of cuts across the board. Instead of providing funds for individuals to purchase food, SNAP-Ed’s much smaller grants focus on community education and initiatives to improve eligible households’ engagement with 3SquaresVT — Vermont’s name for the larger body of resources under SNAP. 
“Just providing food for people is not the whole answer to food security,” said Suzanne Kelly, who was the SNAP-Ed coordinator at the Vermont Department of Health for a decade until last month. Her former position, and another related role, will soon be discontinued.
“SNAP-Ed is sort of that extra bit of information to really make sure that people can access the food, can use the food, and can enjoy it over time,” Kelly said.
The program is deeply focused on health outcomes, she said, including prevention of chronic conditions and disease, and promoting wellness through nutrition and exercise.
Kelly is concerned about the immediate impact on Vermonters. 
“These are decisions that trickle down to the most vulnerable people in our communities,” she said.
Kelly referenced a SNAP-Ed needs assessment earlier this year that identified certain populations in the state with a disproportionately high need for food assistance, including rural Vermonters and people with disabilities. Outreach programs that meet people where they are geographically will be an especially big loss, Kelly said.
The end of SNAP-Ed has already had tangible effects in recent weeks, causing the imminent shutdown of a food pantry in Holland and contributing to the Vermont Foodbank’s recent staff cuts. Of the seven employees the food bank let go, three were specifically operating SNAP-Ed programs, according to Chris Meehan, the company’s chief impact officer.
Vermont residents received over $147 million in SNAP aid last year. The projected allocation for Vermont’s SNAP-Ed budget in 2026, which the Department of Health received May 30, was less than half a million. Five weeks later, Kelly learned that the program was canceled.
‘We’ll have to be really creative’
Meehan said the SNAP-Ed cuts will effectively end the Vermont Foodbank’s VTFresh program, which has reached every county in the state with initiatives to increase access and understanding around nutrition. The program provided a space for people to exchange knowledge about cooking, recipes and budgeting, and was often particularly useful for families, she said.
While the food bank employees who ran the initiative are no longer with the organization, the program’s existing resources will remain on the Vermont Foodbank website. VTFresh’s continuing presence, Meehan said, will be “more passive than active.”
Meehan is grateful for the infrastructure that VTFresh has left behind — it has been “transformational” for the food assistance network in the state, she said. 
Denise Walton, a Concord resident who is a lead volunteer at Sid’s Pantry in town, said VTFresh recipe materials had been invaluable in allowing her community to make better use of fresh foods. It’s common, she said, for people to ask questions about how to prepare food as they’re taking it.
“I think people want to cook,” said Walton, who herself is on food stamps. “They may not have learned, or been taught, or had the time.”
Walton said she would keep trying to provide resources to help people fully use the food they’re receiving — but that it will be more challenging going forward. 
“We’ll have to be really creative,” Walton said.
Vermont Foodbank’s situation is par for the course statewide at smaller food assistance providers.
The Vermont Garden Network will lose its dedicated nutrition educator, according to executive director T Hanson, one of only five staff at the organization. Come Alive Outside, a nonprofit which used SNAP-Ed funds to reach thousands of school-age kids in Rutland County with tips on how to stay active, has told its staff it may not have sufficient funds to pay everyone in six months, according to Executive Director Arwen Turner. 
Meanwhile, in Burlington, the People’s Farmstand will continue as a purely volunteer effort, according to founding Director Nour El-Naboulsi. There hadn’t been salaried roles, he clarified, but they had previously been able to offer staff — primarily farmers — a stipend for their time. The organization offers free fresh produce (both self-grown and donated) at weekly open events but has also been conducting educational outreach through its Veggie of the Month program. 
El-Naboulsi said the initiative features a combination of staple Vermont crops and “culturally relevant produce — things from Nepal, Somalia, Iraq (and) other places in the Middle East and East Africa.” The organization serves a relatively large proportion of immigrant and refugee populations, he said, and the program is designed to combine familiar food with information about how to prepare local produce.
With the loss of SNAP-Ed funding to the People’s Farmstand and sister organization Village Hydroponics, El-Naboulsi said he has had to reprioritize.
“We kind of lose the capacity to do supplementary education, recipe preparation, outreach,” he said.
‘A great return on investment’
Keith Robinson, a pediatric pulmonologist at UVM Children’s Hospital, emphasized a connection between SNAP-Ed and health outcomes for families. He’s the hospital’s vice chair for Quality Improvement and Population Health and built the provider’s screening platform for food insecurity.
“We are trying to go deeper and further upstream to make sure that we’re solving the root causes of food insecurity in Vermont,” Robinson said.
For him, nutrition education has been a big part of that work — that’s why the end of SNAP-Ed is such a blow, despite the small scale of previous funding.
“It’s gonna make communities potentially less healthy, and it’s also gonna create gaps in the systems that we need to have around families,” he said. “While the dollar value may not be great, the impact of those dollars is extraordinary.”
Robinson referenced a state report on SNAP-Ed last year, calling survey data that indicated diet and exercise changes for participants “a big deal.” Roughly a third of people who received direct nutrition education reported they ate more fruits and vegetables each day, and 20% said they exercised more, according to the report.
“That’s a great return on investment,” Robinson said.
Modifications and cuts to the SNAP program at large have been made in the name of eliminating “waste, fraud, and abuse” — a narrative that Kelly disputed. 
“The strategies that are used (in SNAP-Ed) have shown outcomes — real outcomes,” she said.
A page addressing cost concerns on the USDA website references studies showing that for every dollar spent on SNAP-Ed and similar programs, 10 times that can be saved in future health care costs. The total nationwide cost of the program would have been $550 million in the 2026 fiscal year.
“It’s probably not the best idea to be cutting programs that are going to eventually help reduce costs way further down the line,” Kelly said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to requests for comment.
A document briefly detailing SNAP overhaul from the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture called SNAP-Ed a program that has wrought “no meaningful change” for its target population. The committee cited a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office that appears to primarily conclude that the effectiveness of the program is difficult to properly evaluate due to uneven standards of reporting from state agencies and a lack of coordination at the federal level. 
“When federal benefits get cut like this, we need to think about how to bolster connections in our community, and think differently about how to fill those gaps,” Robinson said. 
Jeanne Montross, executive director of Helping Overcome Poverty’s Effects, or HOPE, in Middlebury, said her organization has been seeing the effects of staff and program cuts elsewhere in the state’s assistance networks. Montross’ nonprofit is primarily funded by private contributions.
“It always ends up flowing down to HOPE,” she said of increased need in her local community.
Anore Horton, executive director at Hunger Free Vermont, said the state’s food assistance network “cannot in any way mitigate the loss of all of these different sources of funding.”
Any solution to a problem of this scale must be “collective,” Horton said, but must also involve significant new assistance from the state government. But in a situation this urgent, Horton said it wouldn’t necessarily make sense for the state to replace nutrition education funding.
Walton said Sid’s Pantry has also been increasingly relying on community support and donations.
“We’re very fortunate to have a little buffering like that,” she said, “especially for an aging community that needs healthy food and needs access to things out in the rural areas.”

The decision issued earlier this month comes in a lawsuit filed more than four years ago challenging delays in the state’s court system associated with obtaining civil complaints.

A federal judge has granted an injunction against the Vermont judiciary in a legal action brought by news outlets aimed at curbing delays when seeking newly filed civil lawsuits.
The ruling issued this month by Judge Christina Reiss is the latest turn in the lawsuit brought by news outlets and other First Amendment advocates more than four years ago.
The judge added in the ruling that she would now consider whether to grant attorneys fees to cover the expenses of the lawyers who argued the case on behalf of the organizations, a figure that is expected to total more than $1 million.

Reiss, in the four-page order, wrote that the process the judiciary had used to screen lawsuits for potential confidential materials before making them publicly available delayed the release of the records and violated the First Amendment rights of the news outlets. 
According to the legal action, the timely access to the filings allows for the public to understand what’s happening in the court system, provides for accountability and informs people about matters of public concern.
“Plaintiffs have a presumptive right First Amendment right of access to newly filed complaints, which attaches upon the court’s receipt of such complaints,” Reiss wrote in the ruling.
Courthouse News Service, a Pasadena, California-based company, was joined by news outlets across Vermont in its lawsuit filed in May 2021 in federal court in Burlington. 
Courthouse News Service, according to its website, “covers news, both national and international, that moves society and its many elements in one direction or another.”
Jonathan G. Fetterly, a California attorney who argued the case on behalf of parties bringing the action, said in a statement this week that Reiss’ ruling was a “great victory for public access” following years of “hard fought litigation.” 
The parties joining in the legal action were the Vermont Press Association and the New England First Amendment Coalition, as well as the parent entities of VTDigger.org, Seven Days, the Burlington Free Press and WCAX-TV. 
Other participants signing onto the case were the Vermont Community Newspaper Group, which operates weekly newspapers in several communities including Stowe, Morristown, Shelburne, South Burlington and Charlotte, and the parent company of the Rutland Herald/Barre-Montpelier Times Argus.
“This is another important victory for the public when it comes to transparency at the courts all across Vermont,” Mike Donoghue, executive director of the Vermont Press Association, said Friday of the ruling.
Teri Corsones, Vermont’s state court administrator, said in a text message Friday, “The Judiciary certainly values the public’s right to access to court filings, while also taking important steps to protect sensitive information.”
Corsones referred specific questions related to the ruling to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which represented the judiciary in the lawsuit. In turn, the Attorney General’s Office, later Friday, referred specific questions about the ruling to judiciary officials. Leda Moloff, general counsel for the Vermont judiciary, wrote in a text late Friday that judiciary officials had no further comment.
The lawsuit has been working its way through the court system for years, including a stop at the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals before landing back in federal district court in Vermont earlier this year. 
Courthouse News Service, in a filing more than two years ago, stated that the attorneys’ fees and costs associated with bringing the action already totaled more than $1 million. 
Reiss, the judge, asked the parties to submit a briefing schedule related to attorneys’ fees by later this month regarding the issue.

(Caspar Benson / Getty Images)A 19-year-old New Mexico man is facing federal charges after admitting to the FBI that he posted violent threats online in the wake of the recent shooting death of Charlie Kirk, including a threat toward an Ohio City Councilor, federal prosecutors announced Friday afternoon.
Jace Allen, of Jamestown, N.M., began making threatening posts on X, shortly after Kirk’s assassination at an event at Utah Valley in Orem, Utah on Sept. 10. Some of the exchanges mentioned Kirk’s death, including one from Allen, in which he said: “I will harm anyone who has something bad to say about Charlie.”
In more than a dozen posts, Allen said he was going to “commit mass murder” targeting Black, Jewish and liberal people, as well as other individual people on line he said he was “coming for,” according to the criminal complaint. Many of the posts are still online. The account has 0 followers.
Bomb threats to New Mexico lawmakers sent via email, police say

An FBI agent in Toledo, Ohio, received a tip about the posts Thursday, including one against an Ohio City Council member that said, “You’re going to be one of the first to die. I’ll be seeing you soon,” according to the criminal complaint.
The Ohio FBI agent tracked the account to a home in Jamestown and notified an FBI agent in Gallup, according to the complaint. Around 6 p.m. yesterday, the agent interviewed Allen at his home, where Allen said he identifies as a Neo-Nazi, according to the complaint. 
“Allen believes a civil war is inevitable in the United States and wants to help spark the civil war by terrorizing people online,” FBI agent Michael Dalpini wrote in the complaint filed Friday.
Allen allegedly told the agent that, while he does not own a gun, he wanted to buy a rifle with a scope that is the same make, model and style of the kind police say was used to assassinate Kirk, according to the complaint. 
However, when Allen gave the FBI agent consent to search his phone, police found two videos from mid-August of him shooting a rifle and handgun at an unknown location, according to the complaint.

The awards honor excellence in digital journalism around the world.


CalMatters was named the best medium-sized newsroom in the 2025 Online Journalism Awards. CalMatters’ new Director of Product Andrew Losowsky won the association’s Impact Award. The honors were announced Friday at the Online News Association awards ceremony in New Orleans.
In addition, one of CalMatters’ board members, Robert Hernandez, was honored with the Rich Jaroslovsky Founder’s Award.
First Place, General Excellence
CalMatters won first place for general excellence among medium-sized newsrooms. 
Judges said they “chose to honor the innovative Digital Democracy project and the comprehensive multi-platform Voter Guide, recognizing a winner that fully meets the criteria for general excellence. These useful, hands-on tools and their stories that led to real-world impact stood out as fulfilling their mission to demystify California government.”
Neil Chase, CEO, accepted the award for CalMatters and said, “It is deeply meaningful to be cited for this work by people who know better than anybody else what we do and why it matters. I’m accepting this on behalf of the 80 people at CalMatters and all the other folks who work with us: the partners we have around California, around the country — a number of whom are in this room — the broadcasters and news organizations in California who help us get this news out to people.”
Here are some highlights of CalMatters’ work over the past year:

Our stories and tools made government actions and decisions relatable, held leaders accountable and gave Californians vital information to engage with their government – resulting in impact felt across the state. In journalism, impact can take seconds or it can take years. When it comes to big issues we bring persistent, accountability coverage, and this year, we’ve seen that result in widespread impact: a California state audit (triggered by a 2023 CalMatters investigation) found that a law meant to reveal who funds state legislators’ sponsored travel is falling short, state legislators advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight (directly citing an ongoing CalMatters investigation on conditions inside homeless shelters), and California’s political watchdog fined a former lawmaker $106,000 for campaign finance violations (after a 2020 CalMatters story). This is only a fraction of the impact we’ve had.
Our Voter Guide has been a powerhouse resource that has helped Californians figure out how they want to vote. In 2024, we reached our widest audience thus far, by meeting voters where they were. We created TikTok videos and filters, launched an interactive ballot preview tool, partnered with local publications to show readers articles relevant to their ballot, created magazine-style quizzes that hundreds of Californians used at 40+ in-person events, printed a Voter Guide zine, added Chinese and Korean translations in addition to Spanish, and a version for English learners. One in five California voters used our guide.
Our Digital Democracy platform, launched in 2024, shows video and transcripts from every hearing, logs every vote, provides data on lobbyists and an easy way to track bills. We’ve also trained journalists in 20+ newsrooms on how to use our AI-generated tipsheets. With the help of our tipsheets, CBS News partnered with us to reveal that California’s one-party supermajority legislature systematically avoids transparency and accountability by killing controversial legislation without voting on the record. Digital Democracy has been awarded an Emmy and won the Poynter Institute’s Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation.

Congratulations to finalists ProPublica, Mother Jones/Center for Investigative Reporting and The Texas Tribune.
CalMatters was a finalist in the same category of general excellence among medium-sized newsrooms last year, won by ProPublica. The Markup, now part of CalMatters, won the award last year among small-sized newsrooms.
Finalist, Social Media Engagement
CalMatters was a finalist for excellence in social media engagement among medium-sized newsrooms.
Last year, CalMatters used TikTok to share nonpartisan Voter Guide information and to meet younger voters where they are:

Made-for-Gen Z TikToks: We experimented a lot, failing multiple times before we found our first viral success when we started breaking down California propositions using a call center format. We created skits where a reporter played both a confused voter and a call center prop expert. TikTokers started paying attention, and we kept going, making and trying out organic ways to reach young voters on TikTok.
Launching our own TikTok filter: Like in previous elections, we created online interactive quizzes that helped California voters figure out where they stood on each of the statewide propositions. But in 2024, after being inspired by lighthearted beauty industry TikTok filters that asked viewers to vote for makeup by tilting their heads, we created a series of CalMatters TikTok filters asking you if you thought the rent was too damn high — and other similar questions — that could help TikTokers decide how they’d vote on the state’s ballot propositions this year. (Our demo.) Our quiz filters were used over 20,000 times in the two weeks before the election.
Working with California influencers: For the first time ever, CalMatters worked with influencers to help make sure our voter guide reached young voters on TikTok. We selected six influencers based on common criteria — they were in California, they normally posted lifestyle videos, and they thought of young adults as one of their main audiences. We also asked them to clearly disclose that CalMatters was sponsoring their post, to create videos in their own voice, and to tell their audience about our voter guide.

Congratulations to The Marshall Project, who won, and our fellow finalists, National Geographic and The Baltimore Banner. This is CalMatters’ first honor in the excellence in social media category.
Impact Award
CalMatters’ new Director of Product Andrew Losowsky won this year’s ONA Impact Award. The honor is for “a trailblazing individual whose work in digital journalism and dedication to innovation exhibits a substantial impact on the industry, regardless of their tenure in journalism.”
Rodney Gibbs, an ONA board member, presented the award and said, “Andrew’s work on developing The Coral Project … brought the comment section into the modern era, and it created a system that dozens of sites still use today. …[Now] in his new role at CalMatters, he’s bringing that organization’s award-winning journalism to a broader audience, and through development of tools and processes, he is helping to give Californians more agency and more access to what’s going on inside their state.”
Accepting the award, Losowsky said, “True impact occurs when journalism improves the lives of the communities it serves. … A real community is a lot more than an audience. Communities are groups of people who engage, interact and support each other. Communities are how we build trust, how we create common knowledge, how we share our humanity, how we feel less alone.”
He continued, discussing recent attacks on independent journalism, “For our industry, for this nation, for every single one of us in this room and out there, if and when [targeted attacks on individuals and journalists] come, I look forward to us standing strong, in community, together.”
Before joining CalMatters, Losowsky was the founding head of Coral, a community platform used by more than 500 major news websites in 28 countries. He ran Coral for ten years, managing its acquisition by Vox Media, and overseeing community strategy across the organization.
Losowsky is the co-creator of Perspectives, a project that helps journalists find inspiration from a broader range of work and practice, and generates connections with experts in other industries. He is also an advisor to Documented, and a founding member of the News Product Alliance.
Jaroslovsky Founder’s Award
The award, bestowed on CalMatters’ board member Robert Hernandez, is for someone who “has significantly advanced or made lasting contributions to the field of digital journalism through their work in the industry, and who exhibits extraordinary commitment to the mission, value and vision of ONA.”
Hernandez is a professor of professional practice at USC Annenberg who focuses on exploring and developing the intersection of technology and journalism. His work emphasizes empowering people through informative reporting and storytelling, community engagement, growing content distribution models, and supporting journalism financially.
Accepting the award, Hernandez said, “Despite my chaos muppet energy, they gave me this award. I am a misfit that often feels out of place, but I’ve been a blessed misfit where people have looked out for me. They welcomed me to places and that really shaped me.”
Hernandez reflected on how he has learned over his career that whenever he’s in the room where decisions are happening, he has the daunting responsibility to have the courage to speak up, and that journalists have the responsibility to speak up.
“You have to speak up and challenge each other with love and respect,” Hernandez said. “Use your voice, no matter how shaky it may sound.”
Sisi Wei, chief impact officer of CalMatters and The Markup, shared that she has known Hernandez since  she was a journalism student trying to narrow down her interests.
“He was so supportive of journalism students everywhere, not simply those who had the pleasure of taking his classes,” Wei said. “He wanted everyone to experiment, to get opportunities, to push themselves, and to push the industry. And through his own work, he did just that. And he did it in a way that included and elevated his students.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225-ONA-WINNER-GH-CM.png?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 18:57:34.980891

Nearly 60% of Vermont faces severe drought. Officials say reporting drought impacts help collect data and shape a response.

As drought conditions worsen in Vermont, state officials are asking residents to report the impacts.
On Thursday, the Agency of Natural Resources encouraged Vermonters to communicate information on dry wells and water supplies, farm losses, crop damage, low water levels in rivers, lakes and recreational areas, and other issues related to water quality or availability.
These reports help the state assess the severity of the drought, identify where and what type of assistance is needed, and make plans to address drought impacts.

The U.S. Drought Monitor shows that almost 60% of Vermont is in severe drought conditions, up from 34% last week. When people report drought impacts to state officials, the data also informs the drought severity to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which can trigger action from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Internal Revenue Service to support Vermonters who may be significantly affected.
“There are actually six types of droughts, and we’re in all of them right now,” said state climatologist Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux, a geography professor at the University of Vermont and chair of the Vermont Drought Task Force.
“The one that is particularly concerning right now is the hydrological drought, which is when we look at how dry the lakes, ponds, streams, and wells and groundwater supplies are because that’s the one that had been at these record low levels even going back to last fall,” she said. The state is now experiencing both short- and long-term hydrological drought, she added.
According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, this past August has been the driest on record in Vermont since 1895.
Occasional rains or thunderstorms won’t be sufficient to reverse the current conditions, as some areas of Vermont have seen nearly 8 inches less rain than usual in the past four months, and the soil moisture level is 60% to 80% below average, Thursday’s press release by the Agency of Natural Resources states.
The drought task force, composed of state and federal representatives, continues to meet regularly to monitor the situation and provide new recommendations.
People can consult the agency’s drought resources for a list of contacts to report drought conditions. The task force also recommends reducing water consumption at home.
“Any sort of drought-related impact, I think it’s important for us to hear about so that we can start deploying the resources that need to be deployed as a response,” Dupigny-Giroux said.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A restaurant owner charged with defrauding the state is accusing Oklahoma’s attorney general of using a pending criminal case to bolster his gubernatorial bid.
Brent Swadley is seeking to have Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office removed from the case and to have a judge prohibit them from publicly speaking about it.
Defense attorneys argue Drummond has used his position to publicly declare Swadley guilty, predict his imprisonment and paint him as “a symbol of government corruption,” according to court filings.
But in court documents, Drummond argues the accusations and request for gag order amount to an unpermitted stall tactic to delay criminal proceedings. He denies wrongdoing.
In February 2024, the state’s multicounty grand jury indicted Ronald Brent Swadley, Curtis Ray Breuklander and Timothy Raymond Hooper with one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state.
The charges stemmed from a controversial contract the state had with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen to operate restaurants in some state parks. Prosecutors allege the state was provided with false invoices, and a restaurant supplier was directed to fabricate invoices with inflated amounts.
Swadley is the company’s owner. Hooper served as the company’s chief operating officer and Breuklander is a former vice president. 
A spokesperson for Swadley’s said Hooper and Breuklander were no longer with the company.
The three men have denied wrongdoing. 
When reached for comment Friday, Drummond’s office pointed to court briefs filed in response. Drummond’s statements are allowable and a response to a media campaign by Swadley, the filing said. Swadley fails to present evidence the statements will prejudice the fact finding process, the response said.
In a motion, Drummond said Swadley is using an amended motion to disqualify “as a procedural weapon to delay these proceedings.” 
He wrote the court should deny both the gag order and removal requests because they’re attempts to delay the trial, which had been scheduled for November.
A judge pushed back the trial date over the state’s “strenuous objection.” It had not been rescheduled as of Friday.
Swadley’s attorney could not immediately comment on Drummond’s allegation about delaying the trial, a spokesperson said.
The state has also sued Swadley in civil court. Swadley has countersued.
Swadley’s filing accuses Drummond of violating the Rules of Professional Conduct for attorneys.
Drummond’s remarks are also interfering with Swadley’s business relationships, the brief said.
“These statements, which were delivered at public events, on the campaign trail, in press releases, on social media and quoted in media articles, go far beyond permissible public information and strike at the heart of Swadley’s” right to a fair trial, the motion said.
Swadley says Drummond told a banker’s group in March that people who are wealthy and well connected in Oklahoma can break the law. He also said that Brent Swadley is going to go to prison for about eight years, according to filings.
A few weeks later, a bank to which Swadley had applied for a loan terminated his application, according to the filing.
In April, Drummond said Swadley “washed invoices” and took $6 million from the state, according to the motion.

‘We take this seriously’: ISDA director on out-of-state boat traffic, Idaho quagga mussels

After detecting the invasive species first in 2023 and again in 2024, Idaho officials treated the river with a chemical to kill the mussels.
But officials with the Idaho State Department of Agriculture say the amount of the river in which quagga mussel larvae were detected this year, about 3.5 river miles, is 51% lower than last year’s range, which was 7.2 river miles. Officials say that is progress, and shows the agency’s treatment strategy is effective.
“Quagga mussels pose a serious threat to Idaho’s water infrastructure, ecosystems and economy,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Chanel Tewalt said in a statement. “Full eradication remains the goal, but even reaching a level of containment is uncommon in other U.S. systems. (The agency’s) treatments are critical to prevent widespread impacts to agriculture, power generation and Idaho’s aquatic environments.”   
The announcement came two years after Idaho officials first found the invasive mussel species in the Snake River near Twin Falls in September 2023. 
This year’s detections are located near Shoshone Falls, according to the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.

 After copper-based chemical treatment in Snake River, Idaho officials planning ‘targeted treatment plan’ for this year

In response to detections in 2023 and 2024, officials and contractors applied a copper-based chemical called Natrix to the river, which is meant to kill the mussels but also kills fish. Officials also boosted other prevention and monitoring efforts, including water craft inspection sites and public education to clean water crafts.
The Idaho State Department of Agriculture is preparing a “targeted treatment plan” for this year, officials announced in a news release. 
The treatment will likely involve the copper-based chemical Natrix, “as it has been proven to be effective,” agency spokesperson Sydney Kennedy told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
The agency spent $1.5 million on Natrix in 2023 and $2.1 million in 2024, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
In a joint statement, officials from the city of Twin Falls and the counties of Twin Falls and Jerome said their communities “are proud to stand alongside the Idaho State Department of Agriculture in this critical fight against quagga mussels.”
Thanks to the agency’s “swift action and expertise, the infestation has been contained to a small stretch of the Snake River, and we are encouraged by this progress. Protecting our waterways from quagga mussels is essential to our farms, residents and the entire Magic Valley community, and this partnership is key to safeguarding the future of our region,” read the statement by Twin Falls Mayor Ruth Pierce, Jerome County Commission Chairman Ben Crouch and Twin Falls County Commission Chairman Don Hall.
The State Department of Agriculture reports it has inspected roughly 159,000 water craft this year. 
In the area of the Snake River that is infested, officials say the agency conducted more than 450 samples out of more than 4,500 across the state.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A Rhode Island federal judge Friday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from awarding grants to applicants responding by a one-week deadline to a drastically revised notice for funding to build housing for people experiencing chronic homelessness.
HUD’s new notice issued Sept. 5 superseded a funding notice issued in May and served as yet another example of chaos unleashed by the Trump administration on the courts, U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy said at the Zoom hearing. The deadline for applications was 3 p.m. Friday, a half hour before the hearing began.
“It’s unfortunate that we are here on these things that are done so last minute by these agencies, but here we are,” McElroy told attorneys representing the plaintiffs in a case filed Thursday by attorneys for National Alliance to End Homelessness and Providence based Women’s Development Corporation (WDC).
Lawsuit over federal housing grants filed in Providence federal court

The plaintiffs are suing HUD and HUD Secretary Scott Turner over new eligibility criteria for applications for $75 million in Continuum of Care Build grants. They claim the new rules are unconstitutional and unlawful because applicants are prohibited from being so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” for immigrants, providing “harm reduction” services for drug users and having inclusive policies for transgender people. The revised grant funding notice indicated that grants would be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.
The case, National Alliance to End Homelessness v. Turner, et al., asks the court to block HUD’s unlawful funding restrictions and restore fair access to federal housing funds for providers nationwide. The lawsuit claims projects in 36 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are now ineligible for Continuum of Care Build grants under the Trump administration’s criteria.
Kristin Bateman, senior counsel with Democracy Forward, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, argued that the abrupt reissue of the funding notice violated the HUD Reform Act, which requires new funding opportunities to be issued with 30 days notice.
“Here there was a seven-day turnaround with no justification,” Bateman said.
Joshua Schopf, a trial attorney for the Department of Justice’s civil division, argued that the HUD secretary had 30 days to publish his reasons for waiving the standard notice with a federal register.
“This happened Sept. 5… he has until Oct. 6 to publish his reasons,” he said. “We haven’t violated procedure because it’s still ongoing.”
Bateman also took aim at the revised eligibility criteria that prohibit applicants from having policies supporting transgender people, which she said conflicts with existing federal law barring discrimination against non-cisgendered people.
“There’s no way someone could comply with those federal laws and this eligibility criteria treating sex as a binary thing,” she said.
“We’re not going to defend that particular condition,” Schopf told McElroy.
WDC had been informed in August by the office of U.S. Sen. Jack Reed that it would receive a $7 million Continuum of Care Build grant for a project to build 14 units for individuals escaping domestic violence in five new buildings in Providence’s West End. It had applied for the funding in May. But the nonprofit developer said it would be ineligible to apply for the new notice issued Sept. 5 since it has no control over the city or state’s stance on immigration and other policies nor could it reapply with only a one-week turnaround.
“The new conditions, if they’re precedent, you could argue that nobody in Rhode Island would be eligible if this applies to other grants,” WDC Executive Director Frank Shea told Rhode Island Current Friday afternoon.
Shea said he was pleased the court issued the restraining order and that the grant fund won’t go elsewhere for the time being. 
“That was the fear, it would be hard to undo,” he said.
During the hearing, McElroy said she was convinced that HUD’s new grant eligibility criteria caused irreparable harm.
“The irreparable harm is that these funds would be lost forever by anybody that intends to apply,” McElroy said.
“The court’s decision provides significant relief for communities in vulnerable circumstances and for the principle that federal housing funds exist to serve people in need, not to advance partisan goals,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, in a statement issued Friday just as the 54-minute hearing concluded. “The administration cannot unlawfully weaponize essential housing resources. We are proud to fight alongside our clients and partners as the case continues.”
The Trump administration now has 14 days to ask for a preliminary injunction. McElroy also tasked the DOJ with a briefing schedule and suggested hearings could be held in person in Providence instead of virtually if Shopf would like.
“Rhode Island’s lovely in the fall, not so much in February when it rains constantly,” she said.

The threats, which targeted the home and office of Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) and the home of Majority Floor Leader Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe), also prompted one school evacuation and a lockdown at City Hall. No explosives were found at any of the three locations, according to Santa Fe and state police departments. 
The bomb threats followed Wednesday’s fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, and came amid similar threats across the country, including at numerous Historically Black Colleges and University campuses, leading to lockdowns and canceled classes. 
One of the emails was sent to the Santa Fe Mayor’s office, and is under investigation by Santa Fe Police. 
Mayor Alan Webber told Source NM in a phone call that he could not provide a copy of the threat emailed to his office Thursday, but said the email’s tone was “very matter of fact,” and contained no expletives.  
“In broad strokes, the email was describing what the sender was alleged to have put into the mailbox, and that it resembled a pipe bomb, how it had been constructed and essentially what the timetable was for doing harm,” Webber said. 
He told Source NM this kind of email was not common. 
“This is a fairly rare occurrence for people to make a threat like that in the first place, thankfully, or would think that the way to get it to the public or to the intended target is by sending an email to the mayor’s office,” he said. 
Webber said the day was already emotional, noting the anniversary of 9/11 and Kirk’s death – and said that he thought the timing of the threat was related to one or either of those events. 
“We’re all in this together and disagreeing is fine, but violence is never the solution,” he said. 
Webber said Santa Fe Police decided not to issue emergency alerts about the threats to prevent further threats to evacuated children, and noted that the affected streets were not “busy thoroughfares.” 
Santa Fe Police Deputy Chief Ben Valdez told Source NM the department acted out of caution, and to prevent the locations of school evacuations and pick-ups.   
“We don’t know if it is a legitimate threat or if it is a threat that is trying to solicit a response where now they expose students or faculty to danger,” he said. 
New Mexico State Police declined to make anyone available for an interview, but said in an email that the threats were emailed, and directed only at the specific lawmakers. Source NM has pending public records requests for the emails and police reports with both agencies.
State Police alerted Santa Fe police to the emailed threats, and was also in contact with the Legislative Council Service Director Shawna Casebier. 
Casebier, who is also the chief staff for the interim Capitol Security Subcommittee, told Source NM in a phone call that members met in closed session in June, Casebier said — following the assasination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband — and may meet again before the 2026 January session. 
“Regardless of what happens in other states or in the national landscape, capital security, security of legislators, staff, public, in the building is of the highest priority and concern,” Casebier said. “We are constantly evaluating to ensure that the security protocols and infrastructure are appropriate to address concerns.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WirthReena-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-09-12 17:58:03.387932

Joe Lombardo said at a Friday press conference.
The governor said the “bad actor” involved is believed to have received “information through our internal system, not public based or distinct personal information. It’s information on data that is endemic to state processes or state inventory or state databases.”
He added, “Right now, the breadth of that has been identified.”
Lombardo said he could not provide specific details, echoing past press conferences where he has emphasized that the investigation is ongoing and that state and federal officials must balance transparency with security.
When asked about the motive of the attack, the governor responded, “Well, obviously it’s a ransom, right? To achieve monetary gain as a goal.”
Lombardo did not provide any details of the ransom or whether it has been paid.
Lombardo said 90% of state public-facing websites are back online.
 
Information on the current status of various state services can be found at oem.nv.gov/recovery.


Of those that remain down, the state is prioritizing “public safety and consistent impact,” he added. Among services still down: background checks needed for certain people attempting to buy firearms, the state’s victim notification system, and the sex offender registry lookup.
“While we are not yet at the finish line, we are moving there faster than expected,” added Lombardo.
Lombardo said the state received 150 million hits to its firewall in the 72 hours after his first press conference — 300% more than it typically receives.
He also said phishing attempts spiked after recent news reports about the state forcing all state employees to reset security credentials and passwords.
Lombardo highlighted the incidents while making a point about the need to withhold information about the technical details and nature of the cyber attack.
The governor expressed support for a legislative cybersecurity working group announced by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager earlier this week.
“I would support any endeavor by the Legislature to identify some sort of solution to help us in this endeavor,” he said, adding that it could involve hardware, software or monetary solutions. “In my opinion, [it] has risen to an emergency, and I think it’s necessary that we address it sooner than later.”
Details on that working group are forthcoming, according to a press release from the Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)YUKON — With no active cases of New World screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working to prevent its spread from Central America, a Trump administration official said Friday. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins outlined the Department of Agriculture’s plan to prevent the spread of screwworm to the United States, including a partnership with the government of Mexico, during a stop at Express Ranches in Oklahoma. 
New World screwworm is a fly that lays eggs in the wounds of living animals and its larvae burrow and feed on healthy flesh, causing illness or death. The insect usually infects livestock and is typically found in South and Central America, but one case was detected in a human this summer who had returned from travel to El Salvador. 
“President Trump’s America First agenda means our (agricultural) community deserves unwavering support in the face of critical threats like this one,” she said. “As the situation evolves, we will continue our efforts to keep vulnerable livestock ranchers and the rest of America safe. The U.S. has defeated the New World screwworm before, and we will do it again.”
Earlier this sumer there was a confirmed case of screwworms in Mexico about 370 miles from the U.S. border, south of Texas. The USDA halted live cattle crossing at the border and got “really serious” about preventing the spread, Rollins said. 
No cases of screwworm have been detected in livestock in the United States. 
“So again, we’ve got plan A, plan B, plan C, plan D, but we are not messing around with any of them,” Rollins said. “We are getting fully prepared at every single level for whatever comes.”
The USDA’s plan to prevent the spread of screwworm includes investments of up to $100 million for innovations to find new ways to combat the insect and $750 million to create a facility in south Texas to sterilize flies and combat the spread. 
Releasing sterile flies was a technique used to eradicate the pest in the 1960s to disrupt the reproduction of screwworms and is being used again today. The hope is that those sterile flies will then mate with wild ones, producing infertile eggs, experts said. 
Another $21 million is being invested to renovate an existing fruit fly production facility in Metapa, Mexico, to produce more sterile flies.

Rollins estimated the facility in Mexico will be functioning again in the coming months, but the Texas facility will take 12 to 18 months to produce. Combined, these facilities will produce up to 400 million additional sterile flies per week. 
Agents from the USDA will also monitor the U.S.-Mexico border as “Tick Riders” along with dogs to detect infested livestock, Rollins said. 
In order to prevent screwworm from crossing the southern border, the U.S. partnered with Mexico. Mexico has waived duties on eradication equipment being sent across the border and allowed for the U.S. to complete aerial drops of sterile flies, Rollins said. 
“I’ve only been on the job about seven or eight months, but many have said that our partnership with Mexico right now is as strong and as transparent as it has been in decades,” she said. 
The USDA will also inspect animals and carcasses for signs of New World screwworm infection to protect the country’s food supply. 
Screwworm was more widespread in the United States in the 1960s, but it was later eradicated. 
U.S. Representative Frank Lucas, R-Oklahoma, said it’s a “critical battle” to prevent screwworms from reaching the United States again. 
“The battle on new world screwworms [is] the chief threat we face in the livestock industry,” he said. “I was too young to remember it firsthand, but I listened to my late father and grandfather talk about going out every day all summer long with a bottle of stuff to paint newborns’ navels and treat every wound on an animal. I’ve listened to my old retired game warden point out to me that before these were eradicated in the 60s, we had dramatically fewer deer and other wildlife because they attack all animals.”

U.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove said in his Friday ruling that the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which is representing an incarcerated person, “has not shown at this preliminary stage a constitutional violation that warrants enjoining the enforcement.” 
Court documents say the ACLU’s client, Maddilyn Marcum, was “diagnosed with gender dysphoria and placed on HRT five years prior” to incarceration. HRT refers to hormone replacement therapy. The ruling says that the client was ineligible to receive HRT post sentencing due to not being on it when entering Department of Corrections custody.  
“This decision is disappointing, but we will continue to litigate our case on behalf of Ms. Marcum and all transgender people who are incarcerated in Kentucky.” Corey Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement. “We will continue to demonstrate to the court how this cruel policy violates our clients’ right to receive medically necessary healthcare.”
Ban on public funds  for KY prisoners’ transgender care becomes law without Beshear’s signature

The ACLU is challenging Senate Bill 2 from the 2025 legislative session, saying it violates the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits the use of cruel and unusual punishment. 
The law, a high priority in the Republican-controlled legislature, says public dollars cannot be used to fund a “cosmetic service or elective procedure” for Kentucky inmates. It also says if a health care provider documents that ending a treatment would harm an inmate, use of the drug or hormone may be “systematically reduced and eliminated.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, let it become law without his signature. 
The case will continue, an ACLU spokeswoman said. This ruling means the law will be in effect as the case makes its way through the courts.

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers, economists and community leaders met in Augusta on Friday to begin a new approach to address Maine’s property tax burden. 
While there is bipartisan agreement that the burden is too high, the Legislature held off on any substantial reform this past session to first convene a task force to holistically study the issue.
The initial meeting of what will ultimately be a two-year study of the issue largely consisted of an overview of the current property tax structure and assistance programs. However, discussions already indicated a range of ideas, such as reevaluating current non-taxable properties and exemptions as well as looking to other states for possible answers. 
For example, Rhode Island added a tax on non-owner-occupied properties assessed at $1 million or more, what is being referred to by some as the “Taylor Swift tax” because the singer has a vacation home on Watch Hill, said Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and a nonvoting member of the task force.
Republican Sen. Bruce Bickford of Androscoggin pointed to the Florida Constitution authorizing its Legislature to allow counties and municipalities to grant exemptions to certain people who are 65 years old or over. 
The ultimate goal of the Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force — which has 13 voting and two nonvoting members — is to determine the source of the problems with the current system of property taxation, identify who is most negatively affected by the current system and how those people are impacted.
An interim report detailing preliminary findings and recommendations is due to the Legislature’s Taxation Committee by Jan. 15. A final report, including suggested legislation, is due by Dec. 15, 2026. The group has to meet at least four times but no more than eight, though that doesn’t include subcommittee meetings. The next meeting has yet to be determined. 
Legislators suggest task force tackle challenge of property tax reform

What’s been tried?
The state has made several changes to try to address the property tax burden over the years. 
The state budget has taken on a lot of that responsibility, Allen said, pointing to Maine only recently meeting its requirement to fund 55% of K-12 municipal costs, which have been rising. 
The state has also added new assistance programs, though some not for long. 
In 2024, lawmakers expanded eligibility to the Property Tax Fairness Credit — which provides refunds for property taxes or rent paid. The cost of this credit to the state has gone from $15 million in 2018 to a projected $100 million in this fiscal year, according to Allen. 
That expansion, as well as the creation of a Property Tax Deferral Program, in 2024 was meant to soften the blow from the short-lived Property Tax Stabilization Program that allowed older Mainers to freeze their property taxes. 
The Legislature repealed that program after just one year in effect, following skyrocketing cost projections, concern about wealthy property owners taking advantage due to a lack of income restrictions and the administrative burden it left on municipalities.
Lawmakers considered a host of changes earlier this year, including several Republican proposals to reinstate the stabilization program, which were ultimately rejected. Proposals to collect extra taxes on short-term rentals also failed. 
Other bills are being carried over into the next session, which begins in January. Some of those plans include expanding the Property Tax Fairness Credit, expanding property tax assistance for veterans and their survivors and increasing the state’s tax exemption for homeowners. 
Many of these suggestions would tweak existing programs, such as the Homestead Property Tax Exemption, which provides a reduction for property tax purposes of up to $25,000 from the value of a home for those eligible. 
“Are those programs achieving the aims that they originally set out to?” asked task force member Vinnie Caliendo, president of the wholesaler Native Maine Produce and Specialty Foods. “Are any of them being either abused and not benefiting the right parties in the way that was the original intention or, conversely, are they and could they be enhanced so they do so better?”
Bipartisan efforts to expand property tax exemptions face pushback from Mills administration

Current factors
Property taxes have long been a concern in Northeast states, which tend to rely more significantly on them for revenue to fund public institutions such as schools. But Allen said during the Friday meeting that the burden of such taxes has become more of an issue across the country since the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s not just that the value is going up,” Allen said. “It’s that the value on residential is increasing [while] commercial property values were declining, so more of the burden of the taxes is being pushed onto residential properties.” 
Maine was hit harder than some other states because a lot of people moved into the state during the pandemic, he added.  
Allen also provided context to recent reports that have ranked Maine as a state with the highest property tax burden. 
If all property taxes in the state are divided by the population, Maine lands around the tail end of the top ten. If all property taxes are divided by personal income, that rank moves up. Allen says the latter is problematic because Maine residents don’t pay all property taxes. That calculation doesn’t factor in wealthy people who have second homes in the state. 
Historically Maine has topped census lists of the percentage of housing units vacant because they are used as second homes, with northern New England neighbors closely following. 
“We’re an outlier, and again, if you’re just going to take those total properties and divide them by our personal income — this is one reason why we’re going to be number one,” Allen said. “We’re Vacationland.” 
But Allen clarified, that doesn’t mean Maine doesn’t have high property taxes. 
Right now, possible increases in valuations are worrying many across the state.  
“The thing that seems to get people that I’ve talked to in my community wound up is the change in value,” said task force member Robert Nutting, the Republican representative of Oakland. 
Many towns are now getting caught back up with delayed revaluations that reflect post-pandemic jumps in residential property value. 
Increased assessments don’t necessarily mean higher property taxes, rather they determine the proportion each property owner pays of a town’s taxes. Typically this means while some residents will see higher taxes, others will see them lowered, and some will see them remain the same. 
How are property taxes determined in Maine?
Property taxes are how municipalities in Maine raise money. The money mostly goes toward three buckets: county, schools and municipal expenses. In most towns, schools constitute the majority. 
If a town wants to raise money, assessment changes must be approved by a public vote. Tax rate is then determined by dividing the amount to be raised by total taxable value. 
Under the Maine Constitution, property tax must be assessed at its “just value,” which courts have interpreted to mean fair market value. This just value clause is one of the most consequential provisions in the property tax world, according to Peter Lacy, director of the property tax division in Maine Revenue Services and a non-voting task force member. 
“There is a fair amount of discretion for assessors in determining what just value means,” Lacey said, “but it is, at least in theory, a somewhat stable value.”
Municipalities must also follow the assessing standards outlined in state law. For example, one requirement is that the total local valuation of taxable property can’t fall below 70% of fair market value. 
If the state Legislature passes a statutory exemption, the state is on the hook to reimburse at least 50% of the tax loss. If the Legislature requires additional municipal work for a new program, then the state is required to reimburse municipalities for at least 90% of the cost of that additional work.
Those will have to be among the many factors the task force considers in determining its recommendations.

After the pandemic, inflation and cost of housing made starting to teach in Montana very difficult.
But a new program, passed by the 2025 Legislature, has already boosted starting teacher pay and kept districts from struggling with open positions, according to school leaders. In fact, the program has become so successful that nearly every district has been able to leverage it to help retain early-career teachers.
But it was House Bill 252, Student and Teacher Advancement for Results and Success Act, or “STARS,” passed by the 2025 Legislature, that helped boost the starting pay. For districts, it meant a stretch of the budget: The new law says that for districts to qualify for the funding, the starting teacher salary must be 62% of the district-wide average. This helps teachers get to the average level more quickly.
During the Legislature, teachers told of not being able to teach school without a second job, or struggling to find housing even somewhat affordable. A look at most national metrics showed Montana hovered somewhere near the bottom of the nation when it came to starting-teacher salaries — below most nearby states.
For years, Montana had been accused of favoring mid- and later-career teachers at the expense of newly minted professionals. Most districts rejected that notion, but said that unions and schools had more teachers with experience pushing for competitive wages while teachers who were dissatisfied left quickly, leaving fewer voices to advocate to unions and school districts to raise the minimum. Moreover, routine annual raises of 2% to 3%, during the course of a teaching career compounded to better salaries in the cycle of raises, meaning that those who had made it past the first few lean years of teaching salaries were more likely to see an affordable wage.
Erwin Garcia, the superintendent of Billings Public Schools, the largest public school district in the state, said that his district was seeing as many as 100 teachers per year leaving. He noted that not all of the pressure was coming from the pay.
“Most people referred to the mental health of students and the behavior,” Garcia said.
And statistics bear that out: The district recorded the number of times a student struck a teacher — in 2013, the number was zero; last year, it was 33. Eighty-eight percent of those instances were in elementary school, with many being in kindergarten. Garcia believes what children are experiencing at home is brought into a classroom, and teachers begin to modify and teach better behavior.
 Lance Melton, the chief executive officer of the Montana School Boards Association, gave an example of how the new program works. He said Kalispell’s starting pay was 56% of the average salary, so the base salary was increased by roughly 6% for new teachers. He said the goal is for the starting salary to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of average pay for districts to retain the most staff. He said the program has given districts the flexibility to scale their own pay scale, because, for example, the base cost of living in Bozeman or Missoula may be different than Billings or Miles City.
Melton also said that previous efforts looked at the average teacher salary, but that often ignored the base salary, meaning it was harder to recruit and retain teachers.
Garcia said the Billings district did other things to help the school year, including trimming some programs in order to fund fully priorities. For example, one other item Billings Public Schools tried is shortening the school year by increasing the teacher-pupil instruction time. In other words, the length of the school day extended, but the number of days shortened, making it more attractive to teachers as well as parents who want a longer summer break.
Even since the program was implemented, the number of vacancies dropped in Billings from 100 to 30.
While Billings had to stretch to make the budget work, Garcia said all districts in Montana and beyond are struggling, the smaller raises were not keeping pace with the cost of living. The STARS program brings the base level up.
“So when we were giving the teachers a raise, we were not just doing them a favor, we were being fair because $40,000 in 2020 is not what $40,000 is in 2025. What we were really giving, as a district, was being eaten up by inflation,” Garcia said.
He said getting starting teachers earning more is also a quality-of-life-issue: He said he knew teachers working an extra job after school and one on weekends.
“It’s pretty depressing if you have to work a second or a third job. Your quality-of-life is diminished,” Garcia said.
Melton said that the Legislature was able to thread the fine needle between state help and local control. While the state doesn’t mandate any district use STARS, almost every district has in order to bring starting salaries up. He sees that as the surest sign of success.
Montana’s demographics also make it difficult, Melton said. In 1996, public schools had 165,000 kids enrolled — roughly 17.4% of the population. Since then, the overall population has grown, but the number of school-aged children has dropped, causing the percentage to shrink to just above 14%. Those percentages may not sound drastic, but that’s an 11% decrease, and funding is figured on a per-student basis.
Melton said the decline in students hasn’t necessarily meant that districts could cut 11% their budgets because of inflation and overhead costs. As an example, a classroom of 23 where three students leave, means a loss of more than $25,000 for the district, but the resources needed, including a teacher, will not decrease by the same amount.
If Montana’s school-aged demographics had simply kept pace, Montana would have nearly 217,000 students enrolled in public schools. While the population decline is substantial, the amount of money schools get has also decreased.
“When COVID came along, it was an inflection point because we were already behind and then we fell behind because of inflation,” Melton said. “COVID relief funds kind of masked it, but we were already falling behind.”
He said the new increases help put districts back in a position to be competitive.
“This helps with attrition, gives teachers a better of vision of having a comfortable lifestyle,” Melton said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-525409577-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

(Photo courtesy of WEDC)Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation Secretary and CEO Missy Hughes will step down from her position in the Evers Administration on Sept. 19, according to a Friday announcement. 
Hughes was first appointed to the position in 2019 and was confirmed by the state Senate in 2021 and in 2023. She is the first woman to serve in the position. Prior to that, she served as general counsel and chief mission officer at La Farge dairy cooperative, Organic Valley.
Hughes thanked Evers in a statement for “his vision and support for our efforts to build an economy for all.” 
“Each of our state’s successes serves to inspire more development, more innovation, and more growth,” Hughes said. “People start seeing something good happening in their communities, and they want to keep it moving forward. Opportunities to be in the national news for positive accomplishments show companies and talent that Wisconsin competes on the global stage. Every day, Wisconsin is solving problems for the world, and we’ve made sure the world has us on its mind. I’m incredibly grateful to have been a part of this work and the Evers Administration.”
According to Evers’ office, WEDC during Hughes’ tenure has worked with companies to commit over $8 billion in planned investments and to create or retain over 45,000 jobs. 
Hughes’ departure comes as she considers a run for governor in 2026, in the first open race since 2010, though she made no indication of her future plans in her statement. 
Gov. Tony Evers’ decision not to run so he can spend time with his family has left a lane for Democratic leaders across the state to consider a run. So far, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez entered the race first and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley launched his campaign this week. Others considering include state Sen. Kelda Roys, Attorney General Josh Kaul and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison).
Evers said Hughes has played an important role in his administration’s focus on “building an economy that works for everyone, investing in Wisconsin’s homegrown talent and Main Streets, and supporting and expanding some of our state’s most iconic brands and companies while attracting new industries and opportunities here to Wisconsin.”

(Courtesy Bill Banowsky/ ""A Savage Art"")When political cartoonist and Australia native Pat Oliphant won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1967 — just a few years after moving to the United States — he wasn’t pleased. He didn’t like the cartoon that won and, as such, didn’t enter the contest again and used his platform to criticize the Pulitzer Board. 
Oliphant’s refusal to hold any person or institution beyond reproach can be seen in most if not all of the more than 10,000 cartoons he’s created over the course of a career spanning 10 presidents, by way of measure. A new documentary, “A Savage Art: The Life & Cartoons of Pat Oliphant,” captures the independent mind behind the work. 

 Pat Oliphant cartoons 








OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA
























































The New York Times notes in its positive review of the recently opened film that even people unfamiliar with Oliphant’s name have probably seen his cartoons. But at least one person wasn’t as familiar with his work before he met Oliphant personally: Bill Banowsky, the documentary’s director. Both Banowsky and Oliphant, now 90 and suffering from macular degeneration and glaucoma, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is how they met, after Banowsky and his wife moved to the city about 10 years ago. 
“I didn’t really know a whole lot about his cartooning until I met him, and then we became fast friends after that,” Banowsky, who has a background as a film producer, lawyer and movie theater owner, told Source NM.
The film also delves into the history of political cartooning, and its intersection with politics and journalism. “A Savage Art” is currently playing in Santa Fe at Banowsky’s movie house, Sky Cinemas, and will be showing in theaters across the country starting Sept. 12 and into the fall. The following interview has been edited for concision and clarity.
 
Source: Were you a fan or buff of political cartoons in general before you met Pat Oliphant?
Bill Banowsky: Not particularly. I think I really kind of came to appreciate the importance of political cartooning as a form of satire, because I am very interested in politics and incredibly disturbed by what is happening in our political world. It’s more disturbing now than in my entire lifetime, and I’m somewhat obsessed about that. The work Pat did and the work great cartoonists are doing today to highlight the outrageous things our government is doing…is needed because the Democrats aren’t meeting the moment in the way that I think an opposition party could and should. So, having this additional line of defense, if you will, is important, and I’m glad that there’s still good work being done. 
Pat Oliphant drew more than 10,000 political cartoons, and won the Pultizer Prize for editorial cartoons in 1967. (Film still/courtesy Bill Banowsky)
How did you approach profiling an artist you admire but also thinking about what his work represents?
Pat was not partisan. One of my favorite cartoons is shown in the very early part of the intro section, and it shows Alice in Wonderland and Humpty Dumpty —these two big Humpty Dumpties are identical. One has a T-shirt that says Democrat and one says Republican, and they’re just hugging each other. And this guy asks Alice, ‘Do you know who you’re going to vote for?’ 
I think that really represents Pat’s feeling about partisan politics. He was as brutal toward Bill Clinton as he was toward Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. My feeling in terms of what we wanted to impart in this film is: He’s opposed to greed and to avarice and to overreach and to bad behavior, regardless of who it’s coming from. 
Now, if he were working today, he would be working overtime, because we’ve never seen such greed and avarice and overreach and bad behavior as we’re seeing now. We are, I think, in  uncharted waters. But if you look over the history of his work, going back from [Lyndon B. Johnson] to [Donald Trump], you’ll see that he wasn’t partisan. And he really just touched on Trump — he was losing his eyesight by the time Trump was elected the first time around. Some of the Trump cartoons we have in our film actually are from 2011/ 2012 and [Barack] Obama was president, but Trump was on the stage…and ever the fool. And so he did characterize him in some cartoons back then. But what I love about Pat is his integrity in his work. He called a spade a spade, and it didn’t matter whether it was a Democrat or Republican.
Do you think that approach would work in today’s environment?
No, I think he would be a little bit more brutal toward the Republicans in today’s environment. I don’t think there’s any question about it. He would also point out how feckless the Democrats are. And he did point out how they anointed Hillary Clinton. And then they just did it again with Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris. A lot of the problems we’re in right now are the results of the choices of the Democratic Party, and allowing those decisions to be made as they have against the will of the Bernie Sanders’ element of the Democratic Party.

Does the film, then, have a call to action?
I hope so. We want to be part of the resistance to all of the authoritarian impulses that are flowing through our society in our politics right now. We want to inspire people to say no. We want to inspire people to get their voice out in whatever ways they can to stand up to horrible behavior.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oliphantsupremecourt-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

“Unfortunately, I faced very strong resistance to my candidacy this cycle due almost entirely to the stigmatization of mental health in America,” Caraveo said in a statement. “I hope that one day we will see more acceptance and understanding of illnesses like depression, and that leaders at all levels will be able to support those in need in actions and not just words.”
Caraveo was elected in 2022 as the first-ever representative for the 8th District, drawn by an independent redistricting commission after Colorado was awarded an additional congressional seat following the 2020 census. The district encompasses parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County and is the state’s most competitive.
Other Democrats left in the race include state Reps. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City and Shannon Bird of Westminster, state Treasurer Dave Young, and Amie Baca-Oehlert, former head of the Colorado Education Association. The Democratic primary election will be in June 2026.

Larson relied on familiar themes, faces and places as he began a campaign unlike 13 previous runs for reelection.","Congressman John B. Larson relied on familiar themes, faces and places Friday as he arrived in a union hall in East Hartford to begin a campaign unlike 13 previous runs for reelection: At 77, Larson faces his first serious challenge for the Democratic nomination since winning an open seat in 1998.
Campaign kickoffs are theatrical pieces, and Larson’s featured themes of loyalty, experience and seniority — attributes that made challenges unthinkable in other years in Connecticut, a state historically hostile to primaries against incumbent Democrats.
As the congressman stepped to a microphone on a crowded riser to formally become the fifth Democrat to declare their candidacy in the 1st Congressional District, a snippet of a 1970s pop hit played: “We’re still having fun, and you’re still the one.”
Both notions have been tested this summer. Four challengers, including former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, opened campaigns that found no fault with Larson’s liberal, pro-labor voting record but insisted the time had come for new leadership in a struggling Democratic Party.
Larson ignored his challengers to focus on a desire to return to Washington for a 29th and 30th year to fight President Donald Trump on immigration, gun control, student debt, health care, women’s rights, climate and the congressman’s favorite issue, the preservation of Social Security.
“It’s time for Democrats to unite and stand together, because we’re in a fight. You know it, and I know it. So I ask you, are you ready for a fight?” Larson said, pausing briefly for the certain affirmative answer. Smiling, he added, “I officially announce my campaign for congressman from the First District.”
He promised action on his agenda in the first 100 days after Democrats retake the majority in the House, though Republicans would still control the White House and  most likely the Senate.
East Hartford is home to Larson and his large extended family. He began his career more than 45 years ago as a school board member, then was elected to the council and state Senate. His brother, Tim, is a former mayor and state senator. He grew up in Mayberry Village, public housing.
The current mayor, Connor Martin, once worked at Goodwin University for another Larson brother, Dan Larson. And Larson was introduced by his niece, Arianna Larson. To launch the campaign, he chose a familiar setting, the International Association of Machinists hall across the street from Pratt & Whitney.
“The thing about a big family and loyal friends — when you attack one of us, you attack all of us, and we stick together,” Larson said.
An old friend, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, sat in the front row near Joe Suggs, a retiree who competed with Larson for the congressional seat in the 1998 primary. Kevin Sullivan, a former state Senate leader and lieutenant governor, also came to show support, as did former state Sen. Eric Coleman. Sullivan and Coleman are in their 70s. Clyburn is 85.

Martin, the mayor, turns 34 next week. He said the congressman and two of his brothers have been mentors.
“His story is not very different than mine, and probably many of us in the room, growing up in public housing, right? Not having generational wealth, right?” Martin said. “His family, having to work two to three jobs to take care of their family is a common story in America, especially with middle class America.”
Larson called out the two establishment figures at the top of his campaign: the chair is Daniel Papermaster, a lawyer and former aide to two former senators, Chris Dodd and Joseph Lieberman; and the finance chair is Alan Lazowski, a wealthy philanthropist and chief executive of Laz Parking.
Lazowski was a key supporter of Bronin’s in Hartford.
“But John has been a dear friend for over 40 years, and he’s always delivered for our district, for all 27 towns, for Hartford,” Lazowski said. “And I believe that he’s the right leader we need to get things done. His seniority in Congress is unparalleled, and you can’t just come in as a freshman and have an impact.”
Lazowski said he tried to talk Bronin out of running, and he dismissed concerns about Larson’s age. His father, Rabbi Phillip Lazowski, is 95 and working on his 16th book.
“He works harder than anyone I know, and John has that spirit,” Lazowski said.

Joe Toner, the executive director of the Connecticut Building Trades Council, which represents 30,000 union construction workers, said the council already has Larson, an old friend. 
“He’s been by our side for the last 27 years, 28 years, and that’s not going to change. He’s never been a bad vote for us in the building trades. Quite frankly, he’s never been a bad vote for the district,” Toner said. “So we’re honored to support him. We’re going to stick with him. This is no time to make a change.”
Ruth Fortune, 37, a Hartford school board member, filed campaign papers July 3 and was quickly followed by Councilman Jack Perry, 35, of Southington. By the end of August, the field included Bronin, 46, and the 43-year-old Gilchrest.
On Friday, Bronin said Larson’s announcement was evidence that time has passed him by. Pledging action in 100 days on an agenda he cannot deliver was wrongheaded, Bronin said.
“While I have an enormous amount of respect for John Larson, I don’t think John Larson recognizes the moment that we’re in,” Bronin said. “Voters don’t want empty promises. They don’t want to be misled. Voters want to see that we recognize that if we’re going to deliver the things that our country needs, we have to build a different kind of political movement.”
Bronin waited to talk to reporters at a riverside park in East Hartford after Larson’s event. Gilchrest offered a similar critique in an emailed statement, expressing admiration and a demand for a change.
“I’m not running for Congress as a referendum on John Larson — I’m running because Congress as a whole isn’t listening to the voices of everyday people and has failed to deliver the change families need,” she said. “We can’t keep expecting the same people to do better next time.”
“Our families deserve a representative who will meet this moment with urgency and deliver real solutions — as I’ve done here in Connecticut on paid leave, gun safety and reproductive freedom. We can’t wait any longer.”
Larson left the union hall for a fundraising lunch at Cafe Aura, the Manchester restaurant owned by Geno Auriemma. Larson reported having less than $300,000 in his campaign account as of June 30. Bronin reported raising $500,000 in his first week.
The next campaign finance reporting period is in October.

(Photo by Jeff T. Green/Getty Images)The federal government is unenthusiastic about cranking up its biggest cleanup project next month at the Hanford nuclear site in south-central Washington. But it will meet an Oct. 15 deadline to bring the so-called glassification facility online, the U.S. Department of Energy said Thursday. 
Whether the department may move later to shut down the facility, which will be used to turn radioactive waste into glass, is still hazy.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., talked with U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Wednesday about earlier reports the Department of Energy wanted to back out of firing up the long-delayed Hanford plant by Oct. 15 and go to an undefined alternate method to neutralize 56 million gallons of radioactive waste.
That waste is stored in 177 leak-prone underground tanks in the center of the Hanford nuclear reservation and is at risk of seeping into the Columbia River.
Wright acknowledged to Murray that he wants to stall work on, or possibly eliminate, a completed facility to convert 20 million to 25 million gallons of the least radioactive tank wastes (dubbed “low-activity wastes”) into a benign glass. The process involves mixing the wastes and glass flakes and melting them together.
The department’s Thursday statement and Wright’s discussion with Murray contain ambiguous statements that, while promising glassification will begin by Oct 15, do not rule out the Department of Energy switching directions later. 
Murray’s office acknowledged these ambiguities and said the Department of Energy still needs to answer many questions to clarify its intentions and thought processes. In its statement, the Department of Energy’s Washington, D.C. headquarters did not address the Washington State Standard’s questions about the lack of clarity.
“I need to see real evidence that this administration is moving forward on our decades-long effort to turn nuclear waste into glass at Hanford. I also need an explanation for the conflicting information I have gotten from the Department over the last 48 hours—and I need the Deputy Secretary to sign off on key documents so the completion of hot commissioning at the Waste Treatment Plant can move forward,” Murray said in a statement on Friday morning.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, in a written statement Thursday, said that if the federal government backs away from its glassification plans at the site, it would be a “stunning waste of resources, a violation of multiple legal agreements and a slap in the face to the workers who have brought us to this point.”
“We will be challenging this decision. There’s too much at stake for the people of Washington and our environment,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson planned to discuss the issue further at a press conference on Friday afternoon in Kennewick.
On Wednesday, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said his office is monitoring the situation, including preparing to leap in if the federal government tries to stray from its legal obligations on this project.
Washington State Department of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said he’d seen news reports and heard from Murray’s office that the federal government has decided to abandon its efforts to commission the waste treatment plant. 
“If these reports are accurate, it would violate legally binding agreements,” Sixkiller said. “We are now just days away from beginning to treat low-activity radioactive waste at Hanford, and any delay or change in plans would threaten years of work and billions of dollars in investments.”
‘I am not satisfied’ 
Murray said that Wright “admitted to me during a phone call that the Department of Energy is planning to curb hot commissioning at the Waste Treatment Plant at Hanford — an astonishingly senseless and destructive move and a threat to the entire nuclear cleanup mission at Hanford.”
The secretary’s comments, Murray said, didn’t track with “positive news” from the lead contractor on the project, Bechtel, that safety reviews and technical tests for one of the waste treatment melters were completed, and the facility was on track to begin operating next month.
“Not only has this facility already been built, but commissioning is ahead of schedule. Secretary Wright claimed that moving forward with hot commissioning is an issue of safety, but records do not corroborate his assertion,” Murray added. 
Wright did not elaborate to Murray about the nature of the safety issue. The Department of Energy did not reply Thursday to emailed questions on this and other matters.
“Whether Secretary Wright was given bad information or is simply confused about how the (glassification) facility works, I can’t say, but I am not satisfied by his explanation for why DOE has suddenly decided to stall progress on the Waste Treatment Plant,” Murray said.
Murray also said she’d put a hold on the nomination of Tim Walsh to oversee Hanford.
Walsh is Wright’s intended replacement for Roger Jarrell, who was fired Monday from his position as principal deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management, which oversees Hanford’s cleanup. 
Politico E&E reported that Wright wants to replace Jarrell with Walsh as part of a move to take Hanford’s cleanup in a different direction.
Decades of cleanup still ahead 
Hanford has been looking at glassifying its tank wastes since the 1990s. 
It began construction in 2002, with the first glassification plant legally scheduled to go online in 2009 — 16 years before it actually will. This first plant is supposed to take care of 40 to 50 percent of the tanks’ “low-activity” wastes. 
The master plan has been to build two low-activity glassification plants plus a third to handle the site’s 5 million to 6 million gallons of high-level radioactive tank wastes. 
The entire project’s original budget in 2002 was $4 billion. This has grown to roughly $30 billion. The first low-activity waste plant cost slightly more than $9 billion. 
Hanford’s cleanup is governed by a frequently modified 35-year-old legal contract among the Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state ecology department, plus some federal court decrees — meaning the cleanup schedules and standards are legally locked in. 
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs, including those exploded in New Mexico and over Nagasaki in 1945. 
That development work created many billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive wastes, the worst 56 million gallons of which were pumped into 177 underground tanks. About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into the aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
The tanks are considered the worst radiological contamination problem in the Western Hemisphere. 
Hanford’s current legal target calls for glassifying all wastes by 2052. The Department of Energy has internally moved those targets back to 2069, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office. 
After four years of closed-door negotiation, the Department of Energy, the EPA and the state agreed to try encasing the contents of 22 tanks in grout, which is a cement-like substance.
The Government Accountability Office has been bullish on the grout idea. 
Since 2017, the watchdog agency has issued three reports strongly recommending that the Department of Energy look at replacing the second low-activity-waste glassification plant with a plan to grout the roughly 50 percent of low-activity wastes not handled by the first low-activity plant. Grouting is theoretically a faster and cheaper option.
Washington officials have always been skeptical about grout, citing its lacking of track record with the types of wastes found in Hanford’s tanks. The Department of Energy has been mum in the past about its preferences.
The 2024 agreement calls for grouting to be used on low-activity wastes found in 22 tanks that also contain high-level wastes. A decision on grouting technology — which will then lead to budgeting and scheduling — is due by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, all 149 single-shell tanks and the majority of the 28 double-shell tanks are way past their design lives. So far, only one double-shell tank has sprung a leak, in its inner wall, and thus can no longer be used. 
Roughly one-third of the single-shell tanks are confirmed leakers and cannot be used to store wastes. At least 1 million gallons have leaked into the ground, with some already reaching the Columbia River seven miles away. 
If leaks occur in more double-shell tanks, that could delay glassification by several years and create further problems. It would take seven years and $1.5 billion, the Government Accountability Office has reported, to build four 1-million-gallon double-shell tanks.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/radioactive-waste-sign-hanford-1024x605.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Despite a last-minute scramble, California Senate leaders failed to fix an environmental law rollback for advanced manufacturing, leaving pollution concerns untouched as session ends. 


In June, California Democrats rushed to significantly roll back the state’s landmark environmental law to clear the path for land development.
Environmental justice advocates weren’t happy. Because of changes signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, certain developments now are exempt from environmental reviews, which advocates fear will cut out tribal community feedback, threaten endangered species and lead to more pollution for some of the state’s most at-risk residents. Facing backlash, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire promised a fix.
“That is an issue that we’re going to need to continue to focus on in the weeks and months to come before we leave this session in September,” McGuire told his fellow senators in June.
He’s now run out of time. With just hours until the legislative session ends, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and McGuire have not agreed on how to meaningfully address those environmental concerns, punting the discussion to the fall. 
“This is a complex policy issue and we must get [it] right for Californians,” said Nick Miller, a spokesperson for Rivas, when asked why the talks stalled. “Our assessment is it needs to go through a public process with input and discussion.”
The differences laid bare the growing rift between the pro-development Assembly, which has pushed to cut red tape to build more housing faster, and the Senate, which has been more skeptical about private development without labor and environmental protections. 
The lack of progress has angered environmental justice advocates and lawmakers, who said the leaders failed to make good on their promises. 
“To say that the trust has broken is, I think, is a little bit of an understatement,” said Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Hayward Democrat who was among 35 lawmakers to urge legislative leaders to fix the law in August. “Several of us have asked to have this fixed, and we were told that it was going to get fixed, and now we’re here and we’re told that it’s not.” 
This week, California leaders negotiated and released a budget-related bill to implement the June updates with minimal changes. But the Senate’s budget committee shelved the bill Wednesday amid senators’ criticism that it didn’t go far enough to regulate pollution, and environmental groups called the bill “premature and harmful.” 
‘To say that the trust has broken is, I think, is a little bit of an understatement.’Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Hayward Democrat
In a symbolic move, Senate leaders announced Wednesday a separate, last-minute measure to reinstate environmental review requirements for some high-polluting manufacturing plants within 300 feet of homes and schools, despite knowing it did not have time to pass this year. 
“We thought it was really important for the public to see that when we made that commitment, we meant it. That we were not just talking about it,” said Senate Budget Committee Chair Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and a major champion of the environmental review exemptions and housing construction. 
“We would prefer to do it now,” he added. “But we need a three-party agreement to do anything.”
That going-nowhere proposal did not satisfy environmental groups. High-polluting plants have the potential to harm residents far beyond 300 feet, which amounts to half a city block, said Asha Sharma, state policy manager for Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.
Adding to the chaos, Assemblymember Damon Connolly, a San Rafael Democrat, on Friday introduced an uber-last-minute measure that largely reflected what environmental groups say they want. The proposal would restore environmental scrutiny for projects like hotels and resorts, developments on habitats for protected species and most advanced manufacturing plants. 
That proposal could not be voted on until next year.
Polluting facilities pose a ‘massive problem’
The June update exempts “advanced manufacturing” facilities such as hydrogen production facilities, plastic recycling facilities and lithium mining sites from environmental reviews as long as they are located in industrial zones and not on protected lands. 
In the months after, several advanced manufacturing projects have been proposed, including facilities on the San Bruno Mountain and in Solano County.
Environmental justice groups say restoring environmental reviews for projects like these is a priority, because those facilities are some of the most hazardous and polluting facilities and are often located near low-income communities of color. The environmental review process is typically the only chance residents get to voice concerns about developments near their homes, Sharma said.
Some lawmakers said that’s why they won’t vote this week for the budget bill to allocate money to implement the June reform. Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat on the budget committee, called the manufacturing exemptions “incredibly expansive” and a “massive problem.” 
“Most of us thought: ‘Why would we possibly want to vote for this bill … when the commitments in terms of cleanup legislation haven’t been met?” he told CalMatters.
Frustrations grow over last-minute dealmaking
Talks to tighten environmental regulations stalled amid the governor and legislative leaders’ fast-moving secret negotiations on major energy and climate deals this week, a common occurrence near the end of the legislative session.
The stifled effort contrasts how quickly California’s top Democrats scaled back the environmental rules in June. The governor at the time threatened to reject the state budget if the deal did not come through. The rollback was tucked into budget trailer bills — a tool leaders have increasingly used to rush major policies through with little public scrutiny.
“That is so ironic, because apparently it was totally fine to jam everyone on an exemption for advanced manufacturing … but God forbid you rush a cleanup bill,” Delfino said.
The rushed nature of the June deal, critics say, is why a “cleanup” is necessary.
“It was rammed down everyone’s throats,” Allen said. “It’s probably why we feel the need to push back on this particular issue because … this was a particularly aggressive and out-of-whack set of changes.”
“I continue to be extremely disappointed with anyone who takes advantage of this notion that delay gives leverage,” said Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Torrance Democrat who said he didn’t cast a vote on the June rollback because of the manufacturing exemptions. “It prevents us from having a more open, transparent and democratic process to fully debate these important policy proposals.”
Even those who did vote for the rollback argue for more limits placed on manufacturing. Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, said he grew up next to a manufacturing plant and suffers from asthma to this day.
“It needs to be addressed immediately. …We are not in the 1970s and ‘80s anymore,” he said in a hearing Thursday.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/041323-CONSTRUCTION-MHN-CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin ExaminerThe U.S. Department of Education has abruptly terminated nearly $11 million for two grant programs that have been helping Wisconsin serve children with vision and hearing loss and others receiving special education services, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.
Wisconsin is one of several states to be affected by the cuts to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part D grants. Others include Washington, Oregon and a consortium of New England states including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, according to ProPublica.
Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly called on the Trump administration to reconsider the decision in a statement this week. 
“Make no mistake, losing these funds will directly impact our ability to serve some of our most vulnerable kids,” Underly said. “Wisconsin had planned work with these funds that includes direct support for deafblind learners and their families and efforts to recruit and retain new special education teachers.”
According to DPI, the Trump administration said the programs “reflect the prior administration’s priorities and policy preferences and conflict with those of the current administration.” 
The first program to be affected is the Wisconsin Deafblind Technical Assistance Project, which provides assistive technology tools, coaching, family support and professional training for young people up to the age of 21 with vision and hearing loss. The program currently serves 170 students, and of those, 85% have four or more disabilities. 
The funding cut comes in the middle of a five-year grant cycle. Wisconsin was supposed to get a total of about $550,000 that was expected to last through September 2028.
“These are kids who depend on specialized support just to access their guaranteed right to a free and appropriate public education,” Dr. Underly said. “Losing these dollars at this point in the year will be devastating for the kids who need these supports the most.”
The other program being cut is the State Personnel Development Grant, which focuses on helping address Wisconsin’s critical special education teacher shortage as well as assisting with recruitment, retention and development.
The grant funds from the program, which totaled $10.5 million, was helping to fund a number of programs, including the Special Educator Induction Program. In its first year, the state program helped 280 new special education teachers. 
“At a time when schools in every corner of the state are struggling to find and keep special educators, cutting this support is unconscionable and harmful to every student with an IEP,” Underly said.
According to DPI data, only 46% of new special education teachers in Wisconsin remain in the field after seven years. 
The state agency plans to appeal the Trump administration’s decision.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland GovernorNew Hampshire is the only New England state not participating in a regional effort of Northeastern states to create vaccine guidance separate from the federal government. However, Massachusetts Health Commissioner Dr. Robert Goldstein said this week his team is “actively communicating” with New Hampshire’s public health agencies about the effort.
Neither the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services nor Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office responded to the Bulletin’s requests for comment.
In August, a group of public health officials from eight states — Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — met to discuss banding together and creating their own set of recommendations for vaccines separate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The effort comes amid concerns about the actions of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic appointed by President Donald Trump. In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women. In June, he fired 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing many of them with vaccine skeptics. And, in August, he cut $500 million across 22 projects that sought to research mRNA vaccines for respiratory illnesses like influenza and COVID-19. Health officials throughout the country have decried the moves as dangerous and argued they’re not based in scientific fact.
Goldstein, speaking to a group of health journalists in Boston Monday, said the states’ August meeting was a continuation of discussions that had been ongoing all year.
“Back in January and February, states across the Northeast came together to start thinking about how we can operate and not replace CDC,” he said, “but backfill if parts of CDC start to fail and augment where CDC maybe wasn’t doing a good job in the first place.”
Goldstein described the group of state health officials as “a collaborative that has no name and a collaborative that is very cautious.”
“Nevertheless, we are a collaborative that has worked together on real, concrete issues,” he said.
Despite New Hampshire’s absence from the collaborative, Goldstein said communications continue with New Hampshire and other states.
“We’re having real conversations with red states, and they appreciate what we’re doing and lean on what we’re doing,” Goldstein said. “And also they can’t politically be the ones who are publicly coming out with the guidance.”
Goldstein said he expects the collaborative to expand. Indeed, since August’s meeting, Delaware has joined the group, Delaware Public Media reported this week.
“Folks in other parts of the country know what we’re doing,” he said. “They’re listening to us. They are interested in our recommendations, and I think we may end up as a much larger collaborative at the end.”
Earlier this morning, a group of Western states — California, Oregon, and Washington (Hawaii has since joined) — announced a similar but separate effort called the West Coast Health Alliance. That group of states have been more forthright in identifying their collaborative as a response to Kennedy and Trump’s. The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington released a joint statement: “President Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people. The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences.”
Many in the public health field have expressed mixed feelings about the effort. They’re afraid of the impacts of Kennedy’s policies and the turmoil he’s created in the federal government’s public health apparatus, but also fearful of how conflicting health recommendations and guidance will confuse Americans.
Dr. Debra Houry was the chief medical officer and deputy director at the CDC until she, along with a group of other high level officials, resigned in protest over the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez. Asked by a Bulletin reporter about these two collaboratives, Houry said, “I get why people are doing it, but it’s going to cause some confusion and haves and have-nots.”
She also worries about “medical tourism by states” if providers decide to offer vaccines or other care only where it is recommended.
Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, called this “a balkanization of public health.” She compared it to gun policy.
“With firearms, they flow across state lines, which is why we see higher rates of firearms homicide and suicide in California after there are gun shows in Nevada,” Ranney said. “Similarly vaccinations, if you don’t have a group vaccinated in one state, it’s not like everyone in that state stays in that state. People move across state lines all the time.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vaccineassociation.jpg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Josh Stein on Friday. (Photo illustration of a COVID-19 vaccine by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Gov. Josh Stein signed an order Friday afternoon allowing eligible North Carolinians to receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine without obtaining a prescription.
This includes senior citizens as well as adults over 18 who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list of high risk conditions, including asthma, COPD, diabetes, ADHD, heart disease and cancer.
“Right now, North Carolina is one of only a handful of states where people must get a prescription before they can get a shot at the pharmacy,” Stein said. “This is unnecessary red tape. It is time for North Carolina to get in line with other states across the country.”
Pharmacies may ask the patient certain questions or ask them to attest to the conditions that would make them eligible, but medical documentation is not necessary.
The Medicaid program is currently paying for COVID vaccines for individuals who are beneficiaries, said Larry Greenblatt, state health director and chief medical officer at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
“Vaccines are one of the most effective means available to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death,” NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said. “They help protect the health of children and adults, their families, and the entire community from the spread of infectious disease.”
Following state law, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina can administer those vaccines recommended by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) , but ACIP has yet to give its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines this season, NC Newsline previously reported.

SC grand juries join calls to allow cellphone signal jamming in state prisons

The three-person Federal Communications Commission will vote at the end of the month on whether to change a longstanding rule barring states from blocking cellphone signals in prisons.
Acting U.S Attorney Bryan Stirling pushed for the change for 12 years as head of the prisons agency — including making trips to Washington to testify — without getting anywhere due to pushback from the telecommunications industry. He’s pleased to finally see real movement, he said.
“I was frankly stunned, and happily so,” Stirling told reporters Friday.
Stirling and other law enforcement officials have long pointed to the dangers of allowing inmates access to contraband cellphones. Using the devices, prisoners have run drug rings, operated scams and ordered hits on people’s lives, officials have said.
Last month, the state grand juries joined the calls for action after signing off on numerous indictments of people already serving time for another crime.
“It’s a matter of public safety,” Stirling said. “It’s safety for the prisons, it’s safety for the public, it’s safety for the state of South Carolina.”
The change is far from final. If the commission votes Sept. 30 to move forward, people will have an opportunity to offer public comment on the possible change. The commission must then vote again before officially changing the rule.
If the change is approved, South Carolina will be ready, said Stirling and Joel Anderson, who took the agency’s helm in April.

Over the past two years, legislators have spent $18.5 million to install and maintain technology in state prisons that can identify cellphone signals, which agency officials can then report to the phone numbers’ carriers to get the phones shut off. But that’s a tedious process.
The same company providing that technology can add on a feature blocking all cellphone signals, Stirling and Anderson said. Stirling made sure that was written into the contract when the state bought the technology to prevent starting a $34 million project from scratch if the rule changed, he said.
“One of the things I wanted to make sure is we didn’t have to go back and rip all the equipment out and redo it,” Stirling said.
South Carolina was the first state in the country licensed to use the method of tracking and shutting down each individual cellphone, which officials have compared to a game of “Whac-A-Mole.” Last year, the technology resulted in 2,600 phones being shut off within the six prisons that used it, Anderson and Stirling said.
But reporting each phone is time-consuming, and it didn’t stop more phones from coming into the prisons, Anderson said.
Jamming can also block Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals necessary to fly drones over prisons’ 60-foot netting, which inmates use to deliver drugs and other contraband, Anderson said.
“What we have today, it’s really helped us a lot, but it can be better,” Anderson said. “That’s what we want. We want it better.”
The use of cellphones inside prisons has endangered prison officers as well as the general public, Stirling and Anderson said.

In 2010, inmates ordered a hit on anti-contraband officer Capt. Robert Johnson, who survived being shot six times at his Sumter home. In 2018, Army veteran Jared Johns died by suicide after becoming the target of an inmate-run extortion scheme. And in 2022, a man was charged with setting fire to the home of Lt. Francisco Collazo in what authorities believe was an inmate-ordered hit following a contraband bust.
Prisoners used cellphones to run a massive international drug enterprise that resulted in convictions for 40 people, both inside and outside of the state’s prison system. Unmonitored phones also make it possible for inmates to coordinate the smuggling of drugs into the prisons, which can hinder the rehabilitation process for prisoners struggling with addiction, Stirling said.
Cellphones put prisoners themselves in danger. If an inmate faces threats at one prison, officials used to be able to transfer them and keep them safe. Now, other inmates can communicate their feuds across the state, making sure threats follow a prisoner wherever they end up, Stirling said.
“This is something that I think is just vitally important for the public safety in South Carolina,” Stirling said.
The prohibition on jamming cellphone signals relies on a part of the federal Communications Act of 1934 barring anyone from interfering with any “authorized” radio signals. Prisoners’ illicit cellphones shouldn’t qualify because they’re not authorized to be in prisons, argues a commission report on the possible rule change released this week.

Federal prisons are allowed to jam cellphone signals, since the law bars only states from interfering with radio signals. That rule never made sense to Stirling, especially in places like Bennettsville, where federal and state prisons sit less than three miles apart, he said.
“If the federal government can do it, why can’t the states?” Stirling said.
Inmates would still be able to call their families using prison-supplied-and-monitored telephones and tablets, which will be able to get through the jamming, Stirling and Anderson said. The signal blockers also won’t affect officers’ radios used to communicate throughout prisons, the directors said.
“I’m telling you, jamming is the answer for these cellphones,” Anderson said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3863-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 16:56:54.530812

Lawrence McClure talks to reporters following a Legislative Budget Commission meeting on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s budget outlook for the coming year is stable, but the prospect of potential deficits in the near future led the state House budget chief to suggest Friday that his chamber once again seek to lower state spending.
Lawmakers earlier this year clashed over the budget, leading to a lengthy stalemate that pushed the 2025 session into overtime. At the time, House Republicans claimed the state had been spending too much money and needed cuts to avoid future budget shortfalls.
In the end, the Legislature passed a smaller budget paired with substantial tax cuts designed in part to limit how much money the state receives from taxpayers.
A new long-range financial outlook for the state shows that Florida legislators should have a nearly $3.8 billion budget surplus for the 2026-27 fiscal year, which opens on July 1. But that surplus is projected to turn into a deficit the following fiscal year year and grow to a $6.57 billion hole in 2028-29 fiscal year.
The Legislative Budget Commission, which annually must approve a long-range financial outlook, heard a presentation on the projections before voting to approve it at its Friday meeting.
After the vote, House Budget Committee Chair Rep. Lawrence McClure, R-Dover, said it was his intention to have the “House dig even deeper this year for efficiencies, waste, and ineffective programs. I believe it to be our duty.”
“Everyone understands that we’ve got to keep chipping away at this,” McClure said.
McClure did not mention any specific areas for cuts, but noted that healthcare and education were the largest portions of the budget. Many “cost drivers” could be looked at, including the health insurance program for state workers that is once again projected to go into the red over the next few years, he said.
But McClure added that one way for legislators to tackle future deficits is to refrain from “spending as much of the new money.”
“We’re not at a place yet where we have to go in and cut services to the core,” he said.
Legislators sign off on a new outlook each September. The Legislature won’t begin work on a new budget until next year’s session starts in January.
The House and Senate squabbled over the budget this past spring as House Republicans insisted that spending had been growing too much the previous few years under Gov. Ron DeSantis and previous legislative leaders.
House Republicans pushed for billions in tax cuts as a way to reduce the amount of money in government coffers. After an extended session, the Legislature wound up passing a more than $115 billion budget that was smaller than the 2024 budget. But lawmakers did not cut taxes nearly as deeply as House Speaker Daniel Perez wanted.
Senate Majority Leader Jim Boyd, who also sits on the legislative budget commission, told McClure that the Senate “shares your concern and desire for fiscal responsibility.”

(Photo via Getty Images)Rhode Island has joined the growing list of states, including its two New England neighbors, in taking steps to ensure state residents can access the latest COVID-19 vaccine, despite more limited federal criteria. 
Gov. Dan McKee on Friday announced two separate state measures that counteract recent federal criteria adopted in August by the Food and Drug Administration, which restricted updated booster shots to people 65 and older, or with underlying health conditions. The FDA’s policy is far more limiting than in past years, prompting strong pushback by established medical organizations and some state officials.
“We are taking action in Rhode Island to ensure that the public health turmoil at the national level does not affect the ability of Rhode Islanders to access vaccines that keep us healthy and safe,” McKee said in a statement. “It’s crucial that people who want to get the COVID-19 vaccine have the ability to do so in Rhode Island.”
 A new Rhode Island Department of Health order explicitly authorizes pharmacists to continue giving COVID-19 shots to all patients ages 3 and older. The four-page order, which remains in place until withdrawn or replaced by something else, suggests that pharmacists can give the shot as an “off-label” use to those who don’t meet the more restrictive federal criteria. That aligns with recommendations by major medical organizations, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for last year’s vaccine. The CDC has not yet issued guidance on the 2025-2026 vaccine, though its advisory panel on immunization is slated to meet at its Atlanta campus on Sept. 18 and 19.
“We will continue to make the COVID-19 vaccine available, and we will continue to be the source of science and fact-based information about vaccines in Rhode Island,” Dr. Jerry Larkin, state health director, said in a statement.
A separate notice issued Friday by the health department and Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner requires health insurance companies to keep covering COVID-19 shots. Insurers have already told state officials they intend to comply with this directive, according to McKee’s office. 
“Access to the COVID-19 vaccine promotes public health and mitigates outbreaks of disease that raise insurance costs and strain our hospitals and health care providers,” Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King said in a statement. “Vaccine coverage without patient cost-sharing eliminates financial barriers for consumers and preserves necessary access.”
Last week, Massachusetts became the first state in the country to defy federal restrictions by ensuring state insurers provide coverage for COVID-19 shots. On Wednesday, Connecticut followed suit with a pair of policies authorizing pharmacy distribution and mandating insurance coverage.
Other states have adopted similar policies this week, including Delaware, Virginia, New Mexico, Arizona, Maine and North Carolina.
State medical leaders backed McKee’s decision in separate statements, including Dr. Kara Stavros, president of the Rhode Island Medical Society, and Dr. Scott A. Rivkees, president of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Evidence of the COVID-19 virus rose in recent weeks, according to state monitoring of wastewater facilities. In the week of Sept. 6, the virus level was considered “high,” while emergency department visits and hospital admissions have started to tick up, according to online data. More than 90 people have died from COVID-19 this season, while 60 died due to the flu.
State vaccination rates for the 2025-2026 flu season have not been made publicly available.
The latest COVID shot is expected to be available at primary care provider offices in the coming weeks, according to McKee’s office. Adults can also get boosters at retail pharmacies or health centers, though children between six months and five years old should go to a pediatrician or family physician.
More information about where to get vaccinated, including arranging transportation, is available on the state health department website.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) The line at a local food bank’s weekly distribution in Albuquerque’s International District has increased in the last few years, organizers say, as neighbors in nearby homes join the queue alongside the growing population of unhoused residents.
Marissa Brown, who runs the Roadrunner Food Bank distribution, says the line has increased by approximately 50 households to 225 each week. She estimated a line once composed mostly of unhoused people pushing carts is now probably 60% people with roofs over their heads.
“We are just seeing more of our neighbors who are housed coming, too, because it’s just hard for everyone,” Brown told Source New Mexico as people worked their way through the line Friday morning. “We’re really pleased that we can just expand that reach to anyone who might need it, but it certainly has expanded.”
Even before cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program contained in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” take effect, President Donald Trump’s second term has already hurt the food bank’s ability to feed hungry people in a state where more than one in five residents has food stamps, food bank officials told Source New Mexico on Friday. 
By the #s: More than half of NM groceries, convenience stores at ‘high risk’ due to SNAP cuts

For example, inflation has reduced how much food Roadrunner can buy with donations or grant funding, and the federal “Department of Government Efficiency” cuts to emergency food assistance programs earlier this year by 30 truckloads of food worth a little more than $1 million, according to Roadrunner officials. 
On Friday, that reduced budget meant food recipients had less variety to choose from, she said, as they walked through the line at the International District Library, though the food bank did happen upon a donation of flower bouquets, giving recipients a “surprise gift of joy.”
Still, Brown called it “frightening” to consider what will happen if the food bank has to rely solely on donations as people lose SNAP benefits, both at the distribution she runs and at food banks and other nonprofits across the state. 
“Even though the SNAP cuts haven’t quite happened yet, the [existing] benefits are not lasting as long,” she said. “So folks always do express how grateful they are that we’re here week after week, because they just wouldn’t be able to make it through the month.”
Food banks across New Mexico have previously warned that they don’t have the capacity to feed all New Mexicans if SNAP goes away. 
Jason Riggs, Roadrunner Food Bank’s director of advocacy and public policy, told Source New Mexico in a phone interview Friday that the Albuquerque food line, which is growing and feeding an increasingly diverse group of people across the income spectrum, is a harbinger of the near future after SNAP cuts go into effect. 
NM food banks say they will struggle to provide meals for those who lose federal benefits

“Whenever there’s changes to SNAP, we see food lines grow,” he said. 
New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee analysts told lawmakers at an interim legislative meeting Wednesday that one-in-four New Mexico children live in households without consistent or adequate food. 
Of the roughly 460,000 New Mexicans who receive SNAP benefits, more than 36,000 could lose them entirely due to their immigration status or new work requirements, according to the LFC analysts. 
The Legislature will convene Oct. 1 in a special session primarily to discuss how the state will adapt to the federal cuts. 
Riggs said he hopes the Legislature focuses immediately on how it will mitigate the impacts of SNAP’s new work requirements, which go into effect Jan. 1. 
“Within months, there’s thousands of people that are suddenly going to be subject to work requirements,” he said, and the state has to figure out how to explain what’s happening and identify resources as soon as possible. 
“All that has to happen extremely quickly in order for thousands not to just flat out lose SNAP. So regardless of where we point the finger for people losing SNAP, our concern at the food bank is people suddenly losing their food resource and relying more on our food pantries.”

One of the people who could lose benefits is Kyle Neri, a military veteran who has lived on Albuquerque streets for the last few years with his dogs Mama and Bailey. He picked up a bag of mandarins and tins of beans and oatmeal Friday morning, along with a Ziploc bag of dog kibble. 
He said a car crash a few years ago damaged his spine, but he was denied disability assistance. He’s making do with $120 a month in food stamps, he said, along with a veteran’s disability payment of $700 for his Army service in the late 1990s. But inflation is already making it nearly impossible, he said, to feed himself while trying to save for permanent housing. He said he’s “of course” worried about losing food stamps amid rising food costs.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-12 19:30:55+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Special education schools fail to provide required services,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/12/report-special-education-schools-fail-to-provide-required-services/,State auditors wrote that some private special education schools in CT are failing to give students all the services they need.,"Auditors raised concerns on Wednesday that some private special education schools in Connecticut are failing to give students all the services they need, hiring staff without background checks and relying on substitutes who lack certification. 
State auditors looked at records from five special education schools across the state — The High Road School of Wallingford, Adelbrook Academy in Cromwell, the Grace S. Webb School in Hartford, University School JPE in Bridgeport and the American School for the Deaf. In each case, the auditors reviewed services rendered for one fifth of the students at the school. 
The report found that the High Road School of Wallingford, for example, provided to its students less than a third of the individual services for fine motor skills that were required in their students Individualized Education Plans, or IEPs — documents created by school districts that outline exactly what services a student should be receiving each year. The school also provided less than half of the individual and group counseling services that its students’ educational plans demanded. 
The Grace S. Webb School in Hartford, part of Hartford Hospital’s Institute of Living, provided about half of the group counseling services that its students’ plans demanded and 68% of individual counseling services required in those plans. 
In their responses to the audit, the schools argued that chronic absenteeism prevented them from being able to offer all the services that their students were required to receive.  
“We serve students who struggle with chronic truancy, as defined by the State,” the Grace S. Webb School responded in a statement to the audit, adding that they offer specialized programs that attempt to reduce student absenteeism that can be driven by psychiatric or emotional problems. “Given the population of the students who struggle to maintain consistent attendance at school, we often deliver services in non-traditional settings as students can tolerate, which may not have always been captured fully in documentation.” 
The High Road School of Wallingford gave a similar response. 
“Chronic absenteeism and other attendance challenges are common among our referred student population and can significantly limit our ability to deliver scheduled services,” they wrote, adding that they have added in a new monitoring system meant to help the school reach out quickly if a child is not attending or engaging. 
A spokesperson for the High Road Schools told CT Mirror that most of the school’s students come in mid-year with intensive needs and high levels of absenteeism. 
“One of our main priorities is creating a safe, welcoming and positive school culture that encourages attendance and drives students’ willingness to learn,” she wrote. She said they are in “close communication” with the local school districts and review the services that students receive each month. 
The Adelbrook Academy in Cromwell, which serves 80 students, mainly with autism spectrum disorder, appears to have done better than the others, providing more than 85% of services for motor skills and language and communication skills. But the auditors noted that the academy did not provide any record of the counseling services that were being offered through the school. 
Alyssa Goduti, president and CEO of Adelbrook, said that they don’t bill counseling services separately, since they consider them part of services every child receives. She said their data has since been updated.
In response to the audit report, the State Department of Education said they were “concerned” about the allegations but said it was the responsibility of the local school districts to make sure special education students were getting the appropriate services. 
The High Road School of Wallingford is one of four High Roads schools across the state. Last March, the four schools were the subject of a report from the Office of the Child Advocate and Disability Rights CT that revealed more than 1,200 reports of students being placed in restraints and seclusion within one year. Nearly half of those took place at the High Road School of Hartford Primary/Middle School. 
The report found that the students at High Roads were “grossly underserved both in terms of educational planning and service delivery.” 
“The investigation revealed widespread student disengagement and chronic absenteeism across High Road locations, failure to adequately assess and support students’ educational needs through individualized service delivery and, perhaps most alarmingly, gross deficiencies in the number of certified special education teachers and other credentialed educational staff working with children and systemic failure to ensure and/or document that staff had undergone employment checks and criminal and child welfare background checks,” the report stated. 
In September 2024, the Office of the Child Advocate and Disability Rights CT filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Education Programs claiming that the state Department of Education had failed to properly monitor what was happening in private special education schools. 
The Department of Education had said it  “vigorously disagree[d] with the conclusions” of the report and said they had not received any complaints about the school during the time period the report took place. The High Roads Schools said the report did “not accurately reflect the academic and behavioral supports at our schools” and that they had outlined their plans for improvements. 
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Connecticut Children’s Advocacy Center and the former Child Advocate, said she was concerned that the High Road’s report was a “canary in the coal mine” that indicated widespread problems of accountability within the industry. 
“You can’t have services and a system of care for highly vulnerable people that nobody oversees without bad things happening. And we do not learn that lesson despite being taught that over and over and over and over again,” Eagan said. 
Eagan said that while the local school district was responsible for making sure that a student was getting the special education services they were required to have by law, it was the state’s responsibility to oversee the districts. 
Matt Cerrone, director of communications for the state Department of Education, said the agency was reviewing the audit to determine next steps. In July, the state announced the hiring of an outside firm to review the agency’s system around special education and how it responds to complaints. 
Another concern Eagan raised was that certain schools were not conducting required background checks or hiring qualified teachers. She said one of the issues they found in the High Road report was a lack of credentialed staff and long-term uses of temporary substitutes. The High Roads spokesperson told CT Mirror that the school does background checks on hiring and that they have a department dedicated to hiring documentation.
The audit found that one school in particular, University School JPE in Bridgeport, did not show any evidence of background checks being done for any of the nine teachers that the auditors reviewed. 
The school responded that they had purchased the school from another company shortly before the 2023-24 school year commenced and that they kept the employees from the previous school. They said they had been unable to get anyone to conduct fingerprinting on their employees but that they had all been submitted to background checks in April 2024. 
“At the time of the audit, USJPE had been in operation for less than one year and had not had the opportunity to conduct recurrent background checks. Background checks are completed upon hire and recurrent background checks will occur April 1st for anyone employed for one or more years,” the school said. 
The auditors also raised concerns around the American School for the Deaf and the Grace S. Webb School for a lack of policies and internal controls around background checks for their employees. According to the auditors, four of six American School for the Deaf staff who were hired before July 2019 did not have a records of a national criminal history records check, and one of seven staff at the Grace S. Webb school hired before that date lacked the same record.
The American School for the Deaf said its current policy requires background checks for new employees and for any promotions. The Grace S. Webb School said they plan to implement a process to ensure that periodic background checks are conducted.  
“The Grace Webb School has long been a place of healing and learning for students who need specialized psychiatric support,” said Tina Varona, spokesperson for the Grace Webb School. “The students who attend the school face unique challenges that make it difficult to integrate into mainstream classrooms and are often unable to attend a traditional school.”
Jeff Bravin, the executive director of the American School for the Deaf, told CT Mirror that the school was using a new tracking system to make sure students were getting all their services and that they had created stricter protocols, including a new tracking system, that would confirm that “every staff member has undergone the necessary checks and verifications before beginning their work with students.”
“The safety and well-being of our students are the highest priorities at the American School for the Deaf. We take the audit’s findings very seriously and want to assure our community that we have already taken appropriate steps to address all issues raised,” Bravin told CT Mirror.
The schools, with the exception of Adelbrook. were also found to have various degrees of non-compliance with the requirement for employment history verification, and all the schools except the High Road school had multiple staff members without prior work references in their files. 
The auditors warned that a lack of background checks put students’ safety at risk and noted that not having employment verification history would increase the risk that one of their staff members might have been fired from or left a previous job, or had their credentials suspended because of “an allegation or substantiation of abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct.”
Goduti said that although Adelbrook was compliant with all background checks, they were implementing ways to conduct recurring background checks to maximize safety. 
“Ultimately, kids need to feel safe. Families need to feel safe when they’re sending their students to us. So that is something that we prioritize,” she said. 
In a review of teaching certifications, four of the eight teaching staff that the auditors reviewed at Wallingford’s High Road School were long-term substitutes not certified to teach special education. Two of the four teachers the auditors reviewed at the University School JPE did not have evidence of a certificate in education, and the school principal did not have a state certification in either education or administration.  
The High Road School responded that they followed state requirements around hiring, and that people hired temporarily without certification were given mentorship and professional development. The school noted that they continued to try and recruit for positions, but said a nationwide teacher shortage required them to have “flexibility.” 
The University School JPE said the two teachers without a certification had bachelors degrees in their respective fields, and that the principal had a master’s degree from Fordham, had taught at Sacred Heart and Fairfield University and had worked for the prior owners of the school since 1984. 
Data from the State Department of Education shows that staffing vacancies at approved private special education programs have decreased by about 400 over the last two years, but that there are still 2,500 vacancies at programs across the state. 
Goduti said that while Adelbrook wasn’t facing staffing challenges, she was well aware of the shortage of special education teachers. She said her school does internship programs and they travel to high schools and universities to promote special education as a choice for young people. 
“We need to figure out how to get more incredibly talented young people to want to go into special education as a career. It’s a hugely rewarding career. So we’ve been thinking creatively about how we can incentivize and really encourage folks to work in this field,” she said. 
Goduti said Adelbrook appreciated the auditors’ work and that they were always trying to improve. But she said the report also didn’t show the dedication of their teachers or their students’ successes. 
“ We serve kids that really have had a lot of doors close on them in their lives. We try to meet them with compassion and commitment and rebuild the sense of trust and help them to think about what are their dreams and how do they get there,” she said. “All those beautiful parts of our service system, which we gladly showed the auditors when they came to visit, it just doesn’t come out in an auditor’s report that only identifies deficiencies but not successes or best practices that maybe could be shared or highlighted.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024_0312_SR_HighRoads_005-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — President Donald Trump granted a disaster declaration for Kansas Friday in the wake of destructive June storms and after bipartisan support from lawmakers concerned with recovery efforts.
Severe storms landed in southeast and south-central Kansas on June 3, causing tornadoes, straight-line winds and flooding that lasted until June 7 and damaged farms, homes and power lines. Roads in some areas were impassable.
Kansas was eligible  for more than $7.5 million in federal assistance, and it now can be shared among Barber, Butler, Chase, Coffey, Cowley, Franklin, Greenwood, Harper, Hodgeman, Kingman, Lyon, Morris, Osage, Stanton, Sumner and Wallace counties, according to a news release from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“These federal funds will go a long way in supporting the restoration work by those in counties impacted by the storms,” Gov. Laura Kelly said in a Friday news release.
The storms damaged bridges, utility infrastructure and roads in multiple Kansas counties, according to the Kansas Adjutant General’s Department, which is responsible for multiple state agencies, including the division of emergency management.
“The declaration allows state and local levels of government, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations that provide vital and essential services, such as rural electric cooperatives, to apply for public assistance funds for emergency and permanent work for the repair or replacement of infrastructure damaged by the disaster,” the department said in a news release.
On Tuesday, Kelly proclaimed another state of disaster emergency due to heavy rains and flooding in counties in central Kansas.
“Heavy rains and flooding impacted several counties yesterday and we will do what we can to support those counties,” Kelly said. “Do not drive into standing water, just 12 inches of rushing (water) can carry away most cars. Turn around, don’t drown.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/femasignmiranda_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderIt’s the final countdown for Democrat Debra Shigley and Republican Jason Dickerson in their mission to represent a suburban Atlanta state Senate district.
Early voting begins Saturday in parts of Fulton and Cherokee counties ahead of the Sept. 23 election, when residents will select a successor for former state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican now serving as U.S. Treasurer.
Democrats are hoping to replace the MAGA stalwart with Shigley, a Milton mom, attorney and small business owner.
Shigley was the top vote-getter in last month’s special election, but the Republican vote was split six ways. Flipping the seat that Beach regularly won by wide margins will not be an easy feat, but Democrats are expressing confidence that frustration with GOP control of the state and federal government will help push Shigley over the top.
They’re pulling out all the stops, including an assist from Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is scheduled to help with Shigley’s weekend get-out-the-vote effort.
Dickerson, a Cherokee County investment manager, has been hitting the trail as well and touting endorsements from top Georgia Republicans like U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick of Suwanee.
Republicans are betting that Dickerson will consolidate the votes earned by other Republicans in last month’s race and stop Democrats from flipping the seat.
Early voting will take place Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling places will be open on election day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced a Jonesboro business executive as her latest appointment to Arkansas’ State Board of Education on Friday.
David Peacock, president of Hytrol Conveyor Company, replaces former board chair Sarah Moore, whose term expired at the end of June. Peacock’s term runs until 2032.
In a press release announcing her second 2025 education board pick, Sanders praised the Marine Corps veteran as “an incredible asset” and leader, who is “passionate about workforce readiness, literacy programs, and education freedom.”
“With leaders like David helping implement the reforms we’ve brought about over the past two-and-a-half years, I know our school system will only continue to improve,” Sanders said in the release.
Peacock said in the same release that he was “honored and humbled” by the selection, and that he looked forward to working with Sanders and the other board members to help students “succeed and thrive.” Peacock donated $250 to Sanders in 2021, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks money in politics.
“Education has opened countless doors in my own life, and it’s a privilege to now help create those same opportunities for children across Arkansas,” he said. “Partnering with parents and communities to prepare our students for the many paths ahead is both essential and inspiring.”
Peacock served in the Marines for over a decade, and worked for Rubbermaid, Textron, JLG Industries and Kalmar Industries before he joined the conveyor company in 2014. He holds a bachelor’s degree in history from The Citadel and a master’s degree in management from Webster University, according to the release.
With Peacock’s appointment, Sanders has selected a majority of the current board membership. She appointed Ken Bragg and Leigh Keener in 2023, Gary Arnold in 2024, and Aaron Abbott last month. Sanders will have an opportunity to appoint another member before the 2026 general election, as the term of the board’s current chair, Adrienne Woods, expires next summer.
Sanders also thanked Moore, a former elementary school teacher who holds a doctorate in education policy, “for her years of support and for her help in implementing” the LEARNS Act of 2023.
Moore was appointed in 2018 by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and previously served as Hutchinson’s education policy advisor from 2015 to 2017.
“Because of her hard work and dedication, the future for Arkansas’ students is brighter than ever,” Sanders said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-12 19:06:35+00:00,CT Mirror,"As government funding deadline nears, CT Dems seek leverage",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/12/ct-government-funding-deadline/,How would CT Democrats exert what leverage they have in a Republican Congress — and what would they accept in a spending deal?,"Congressional Democrats, including Connecticut lawmakers directly involved in the appropriations process, are assessing the best way to influence government funding legislation with a quickly approaching deadline.
During the last government funding fight in March, enough Democrats ultimately backed a GOP spending bill that didn’t include their input, a move that kept the government open and averted a shutdown but riled up a base that wanted the party to put up a fight amid the cancellation of federal funding.
At the time, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, who had voted against the GOP spending measure, called on his party to “change our tactics.” But six months later, the Connecticut senator insisted Democrats will employ a different strategy over government funding.
“Ultimately what happened in the spring was … a handful of [Senate] Democrats voted for a bill that was written totally and completely by Republicans,” Murphy said in an interview. “That’s not going to happen this fall. Democrats in the Senate aren’t going to vote for a bill that isn’t negotiated between Republicans and Democrats.”
But the bigger question confronting Democrats is how exactly they go about exerting the rare leverage they have in a Congress completely controlled by Republicans — and what they’d be willing to accept in a spending deal to keep operations going. 
With the looming threat of a shutdown, lawmakers are facing a deadline of Sept. 30. And Connecticut’s appropriators — both Murphy and U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, are playing active roles in the debate over funding for fiscal year 2026. Both are pushing for bipartisan negotiations but underscored that a lack of Democratic priorities and the continuation of the Trump administration withholding funds are nonstarters.
Congress is eyeing a short-term deal that will buy them more time to negotiate a full-year spending package. That stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, keeps government agencies running at current levels for a specific amount of time.
Government funding fights have become increasingly thorny issues for Congress. But this latest cycle is further complicated by outside demands from the White House and an ongoing push to withhold funds already approved by Congress.
Republicans advanced an initial rescissions package this summer that cut billions of dollars in public broadcasting funds and foreign assistance. Now, the Trump administration is seeking to take back an additional $5 billion through a process called “pocket rescissions” that would circumvent Congress. A federal judge recently ruled that such a move is illegal.
White House budget director Russ Vought has indicated he wants to keep Democrats out of the appropriations process and have it be “less bipartisan.” But realistically, any funding legislation needs support from Democrats in order to pass. Republicans only need a simple majority in the House, but in the Senate, they need votes from at least seven Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance a bill.
Some Democratic appropriators like Murphy are wondering whether they can “trust” any funding agreements negotiated with the majority party because the administration could once again decide to circumvent Congress and its power of the purse.
“This president has either canceled or refused to spend over $400 billion, and that decision is both illegal and deeply harmful to our economy,” Murphy said. “We really risk writing a budget that’s not worth the paper it’s written on if the president decides he’s going to spend the money that he wants to spend and not spend the money in blue states or that are aligned with priorities that aren’t his.”
DeLauro, along with her fellow top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, released an updated tracker detailing how much the Trump administration has withheld in federal funding. The number has fluctuated as some funds have been released, but the most recent estimate is around $410 billion, including cuts in health, education and environmental grants.
How CT’s appropriators are navigating spending talks
While some White House officials are looking at more of a party-line strategy, appropriators are taking a more bipartisan approach.
DeLauro plays an even larger role as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. She’s been part of the committee for years, served as chairwoman when Democrats were in the majority in 2021 and has been the ranking member since Republicans took back the House.
She noted that the House and Senate have been on two different tracks and have spending bills with different topline numbers — the House is working with GOP-led legislation, while the Senate is pursuing bipartisan negotiations.
“We’ve made some progress here. I’ll continue to negotiate, but I will not support an agreement that doesn’t include Democratic priorities and doesn’t stop the stealing of funds through whatever procedural efforts the White House and [the Office of Management and Budget] wants,” DeLauro said in an interview.
“There’ll be tough negotiations, but I’ve been there before, and we ought to be able to come to a conclusion,” she added.
She indicated Thursday that talks between the Four Corners — the top Republicans and Democrats on the two appropriations committees — were heading in the right direction. DeLauro said they are “in sync” with a continuing resolution that would keep things for about a month or a little longer. Though that puts them at odds with the request from the White House for a months-long stopgap that runs through Jan. 31.
DeLauro was named to the conference committee that will include members from both parties as well as both chambers to negotiate and reconcile differences on three funding bills: Agriculture and Rural Development, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch. The plan would be to pass full-year funding for those three along with a stopgap bill to temporarily fund the rest of the government.
Meanwhile, Murphy is still working on a bipartisan bill as the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. But he said Wednesday that they have yet to reach a compromise. His subcommittee pushed back the markup of the DHS bill that was scheduled for earlier this week.
Murphy attributed the holdup to the way the Department of Homeland Security is repurposing funding approved by Congress to go toward stricter immigration enforcement and Trump’s deportation and detention agenda. But he still hopes they can compromise.
What Democrats hope to get
Lawmakers have a few more weeks to sort out the details, but so far, Democrats are playing hardball, raising the prospects of a shutdown. But it’s also not immediately clear what their final conditions will be to win their support. 
“The Republicans have to come to meet with us in a true bipartisan negotiation to satisfy the American people’s needs on health care, or they won’t get our votes, plain and simple,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press conference this week. Schumer took a lot of flak in March for helping to get the GOP spending bill across the finish line. At the time, he argued a partial shutdown would have been a worse option than voting with Republicans.
Health care has emerged as one of their main priorities in a spending agreement. And more Democrats appear to be rallying around an Affordable Care Act subsidy, known as the enhanced premium tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of the year.
If Congress doesn’t extend it in some capacity, insurance premiums are expected to increase, and the loss of financial help could lead to some Americans losing coverage altogether. Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
“Our entire health care system will be undermined by the failure to renew these premium tax credits,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said during a press conference at the state Capitol on Friday. “Health insurance and these premium tax credits are absolutely essential to lowering the cost of health care.”
Blumenthal has co-sponsored federal legislation that would make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent.
Nationally, if the subsidies sunset at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that more than 4 million people would lose health care over the next decade, citing the increases in out-of-pocket costs because of more costly premiums. 
Amid the changes in the federal health policy landscape and the expiring tax credits, the Connecticut Insurance Department this week approved double-digit rate increases for state-regulated health plans in 2026.
Murphy said he’d like to see an agreement that goes beyond extending those subsidies and seeks to roll back some of the cuts to Medicaid that’ll be implemented in the coming years through President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
“I see a health care disaster coming for Connecticut and the rest of the country later this year, and this budget has to abate that disaster,” Murphy said. “I’m not going to vote for a budget that isn’t real, and unless we put some provisions in this bill that make it harder for Trump to undermine the rule or law and ignore the spending in the bill, I don’t see how I can vote for it.”
Between some health care protections and commitments that the White House won’t redirect or cancel congressionally approved funds, Murphy thinks his vote is easy to get. “That’s a pretty minimalist set of demands, if you ask me.”
But those demands may not be met.
While the ACA subsidy extensions seemed to be on the table, Republican leadership recently indicated that it wouldn’t be a part of negotiations. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he wants a “clean” bill.
But Democrats haven’t been the only ones pushing for the renewal of those subsidies, especially with the political reality that many Americans would lose coverage or face higher premiums at the start of the midterm election year in 2026. Some Republicans have also been supportive of extending the tax credits, and a group in the House recently backed legislation before spending talks ramped up.
Without getting into the specifics of what could be at the negotiating table, DeLauro said health care will be a “broad” piece of what Democrats are seeking. And both Murphy and DeLauro would like to see commitments that Trump won’t interfere with the new rounds of federal funding they are trying to pass.
“There’ll be a broad discussion about health care. Health care is a cost of living issue. I’m not specifying this one or that one,” DeLauro said. “We need a broad conversation about what should be included and that’s what the Democratic leadership is going to be doing.”
New strategy?
Democrats have been saying for months they want to fight harder — something that their supporters have been clamoring for since their defeat in the November elections.
Frustration surfaced among Democrats in the House and Senate over their funding strategy months ago.
Both Murphy and Blumenthal voted with many of their Senate colleagues against the funding bill. Nearly every House Democrat, including every member of Connecticut’s delegation, also voted against the bill in the spring.
Plus, the risk of a shutdown looms large amid negotiations and the uncertainty of finding consensus. And Democrats and Republicans are already giving a preview of the inevitable blame game that would play out if funding lapses after Sept. 30.
Republicans say the ball is in Democrats’ court to accept a deal to keep things open. Democrats, meanwhile, argue the GOP controls Congress and the White House and it’s on them to find consensus.
“The ultimate question of whether there’s going to be a government shutdown at the end of the month is going to be up to congressional Democrats, and that’s just the way it is,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said.
There hasn’t been a government shutdown since the first Trump administration. It was a partial shutdown that started late December 2018 and lasted about a month into January 2019.
If there’s another one during Trump’s second term, Republicans would pay the price, Democrats say.
“I think we can come to a reasonable compromise here,” Murphy said, “And if the government shuts down, everybody in this country knows who runs the House, who runs the Senate and who runs the White House.”

However, […]","Secretary of State Diego Morales speaks at a Sept. 12, 2025 press conference at the Indiana Statehouse. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle) The Indiana Secretary of State’s Office said Friday that a Vigo County man is being investigated for allegedly voting without being a U.S. citizen. According to Secretary of State Diego Morales, the man —who has a Mexican passport — registered with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in 2018 and voted in six separate elections.
However, no charges have been filed and the office couldn’t release a name. Morales praised a recent law that added additional citizenship verification for certain voters, which he said allows election officials to scrutinize voter rolls.
“This case in Vigo County is proof that hard work is paying off; it is proof that noncitizens have voted in Indiana; and it is proof that our legislation is necessary and effective,” Morales said.
Under House Enrolled Act 1264, voters with registrations tied to temporary identification credentials from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles must meet additional proof of citizenship requirements, which includes an appeals process. 
Following the law, which was enacted in July, the BMV sent names with temporary credentials to the state’s election division. In a comparison with the state’s registered voters, the election division identified 1,611 names in 91 counties that needed to provide additional information.
Those counties then had the responsibility to follow-up. Once notified by the county, registered voters had 30 days to verify their citizenship. Morales’ team said they hadn’t heard from counties about the other 1,610 names submitted for additional verification and couldn’t confirm if any others had been checked. “A few” names had their citizenship verified directly by the office.

Upon receiving his notice from Vigo County, the man apparently responded by providing his Mexican passport and verbally confirmed that he wasn’t a citizen, according to the office’s legislative policy director, Kegan Prentice.
Prentice said providing the Mexican passport was “obvious” proof of the man’s non-American citizenship, though it is possible to have dual citizenship.
“… usually, at minimum, if they’re going to respond to this notice they’re not going to respond with proof of citizenship from another country,” Prentice said.
Vigo County referred the case to local law enforcement, who turned it over to the Indiana State Police. 
Morales said his office has additionally notified the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI. 
“Some critics said that these measures were not necessary; that noncitizens were not voting in Indiana,” said Morales. “… we are even facing a potential lawsuit over these requirements. But we now have concrete evidence that this is happening in Indiana.”
 Additional context

With the 2024 law, voting rights advocates worried that a naturalized citizen might miss the county’s letter about providing additional proof of citizenship and lose their voter registration. In April, several voting rights groups sent a “notice of violation” alleging that the new law runs afoul of the National Voter Registration Act.
Prentice rebuffed that criticism.
“Just because the registration is canceled, does not mean that individual can’t vote. There are plenty of failsafe mechanisms in Indiana. Individuals can always cast provisional ballots,” Prentice said.
Morales, a naturalized citizen who was born in Guatemala, said he would be “more than happy” to share his naturalization documents if he’d been flagged for additional scrutiny.

“I don’t think that this is a barrier. I think that we’re talking about transparency and I would have no problem — and I know many other naturalized citizens who would not have that problem — to show their proof of citizenship,” Morales said.
Groups of individuals who may have driver’s licenses, but aren’t citizens, include immigrants granted temporary protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy or Ukrainian refugees. 
Morales pointed to a similar effort to check citizenship in Iowa that identified 2,186 individuals. Of those, 277 were found to be noncitizens and 35 voted in 2024 elections. Of those, six have been charged as of June.
“That is why I’m thinking that this is the first case,” Morales said.
Morales also said the state had complied with an expansive DOJ data collection effort, providing names, addresses, driver’s licenses and partial Social Security numbers of registered Hoosier voters to federal authorities.
“If providing the Justice Department information can help Indiana with ensuring our voter list is accurate and up-to-date, we will do so. We will take all the help we can get,” Morales said. “I am proud to work with President (Donald) Trump and his administration to strengthen election integrity.”
Jerry Bonnet, the office’s chief legal counsel, said the Attorney General’s Office advised them that they were “required to provide that information.”
Other states found otherwise and have declined to share their voter lists. On Friday, Stateline reported that the DOJ is sharing that information with the Department of Homeland Security to identify noncitizens.
Morales vowed to continue his work to tamp down on noncitizen voting, which is rare.
“My biggest accomplishment so far as secretary of state is requesting proof of citizenship, and I’m always going to be working with President Trump and his administration and our general assembly here to make sure that only U.S. citizens are able to vote in Indiana,” he said.
In 2024, Indiana had 4.8 million registered voters and just under 3 million, or 62%, voted in that year’s general election. The Hoosier state has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the country.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For nearly three years, prospective business owners have eagerly waited for the date they could join Rhode Island’s budding retail cannabis market. That day is now here.
At the start of the Cannabis Control Commission’s monthly meeting Friday afternoon, chairperson Kimbelry Ahern announced regulators are now accepting online applications for two dozen new retail licenses through late December.
Under the 2022 act that legalized recreational cannabis, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to retailers, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives.
Cannabis regulators open screening portal for social equity retail license applicants

The commission opened the initial screening process for social equity applicants on Aug. 29. Social equity applicants are defined as those who were adversely affected by the War on Drugs, including residents in census tracts of five Rhode Island municipalities identified as “disproportionately impacted” areas from past cannabis prohibition.
As of Friday, Rhode Island Cannabis Administrator Michelle Reddish said 89 prospective social equity applicants have already applied for screening. Certification is expected to be complete some time in November.
All recreational licenses will be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone.
Regulators will accept submissions through 4 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 29. Ahern said Commission and Cannabis Office staff will provide technical assistance resources guidance for prospective applicants.
“Today is a significant day for the commission and Rhode Island,” Ahern said. “This milestone represents the culmination of years of work and collaboration.”
It’s certainly been a slow road for the state to establish its recreational cannabis market. Over a year passed before the three-member commission was impaneled, which then needed to hire staff to draft proposals and conduct a review of rules adopted in other states.
That left sales to the state’s seven pre-existing medical dispensaries, which have been allowed to sell recreational cannabis under hybrid licenses.
Those seven stores sold a combined $118 million worth of cannabis products last year, according to state data. Through the end of August 2025, existing hybrid retailers have made nearly $80 million in sales.
Regulations were finally approved by the commission in April, taking effect in May.
The inaugural rules require applicants to first be screened to ensure they meet qualifications before being placed in a lottery held in each of six designated geographic zones.
All prospective retailers are required to pay an application fee of $7,500 and a yearly $30,000 licensing fee. But the application fee will be waived for the first year for approved social equity applicants — whose qualifications for the speciality license  through the end of September.

Free.,Trump administration sued for using Ghana as ‘end-run’ around deportation protections,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-sued-using-ghana-end-run-around-deportation-protections,,"WASHINGTON — A Friday lawsuit from a civil rights group accused the Trump administration of bypassing deportation restrictions on immigrants slated for removal by sending them to Ghana and having the West African nation deport them to their countries of origin, despite credible findings they could face harm there.The move violates not only the due process rights of immigrants, but circumvents deportation restrictions placed by immigration judges who determined those immigrants could not be returned to their home country, attorneys from the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, wrote in their suit. “Defendants know that they may not, consistent with U.S. immigration law, directly deport non-citizens to countries from which they have been granted fear-based protection,” according to the brief. “As an end-run around this prohibition, Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work.”The Department of Homeland Security and government of Ghana did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.  Ghana President John Dramani Mahama confirmed to Business Insider Africa this week that the country struck a deal with the U.S. to accept a group of 14 deportees and send some back to their countries of origin. The attorneys argued that immigration judges granted their five plaintiffs fear-based deportation protections to their home country under the Immigration Nationality Act and Convention Against Torture. They are asking U.S District Judge Tanya Chutkan to require the return of the plaintiffs to the U.S. Chutkan sits on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was appointed by former President Barack Obama. The plaintiffs are nationals of Nigeria and The Gambia.Third-country removalsA deportation protection, such as a ""withholding of removal,” doesn’t create blanket protections from removal. It requires the U.S. to find what is known as a third country that will accept the deportee. Certain other requirements do apply. The government must notify the deportee of the country of removal and give them a chance to object if they fear persecution there. The U.S. government must ensure that a third country that accepts a deportee won’t then conduct a removal to their home country, where U.S. immigration officials have found they could face harm.The suit says that none of the plaintiffs were notified they would be removed to Ghana and instead they were placed on a U.S. military plane and none were given a credible fear interview of being sent to the West African country. They were placed in straitjackets and remained on the plane for 16 hours, according to the suit. The plaintiffs are referred to by initials in court documents. One, referred to as K.S., “is hiding and fears for his life” in The Gambia.K.S. was granted protections under the Convention Against Torture, a United Nations treaty, because he is bisexual and fears returning to The Gambia where he could face harm, according to court records. The Ghanaian government deported him to The Gambia on Wednesday, according to the suit. Four others are detained in Ghana. They are referred to as D.A., T.L., I.O., and D.S in court documents. Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records. “The comments by U.S. officials on the plane on the way to Ghana, combined with news reports about Ghana’s involvement in a deal with the U.S. about repatriating non-citizens to their countries of origin in Africa, indicate that the U.S. is deporting people to Ghana with the intention that they be deported to their countries of origin,” according to the suit.",,,,2025-09-12 15:56:43.170569

The free three-day event, held from Sept. 16-18 at the Environmental Learning Center in south Jackson, was organized by HOPE Enterprise Corporation and Yancey Consulting. It will include presentations and support from other major financial institutions like Capital One, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.
The idea for the festival, HOPE CEO Bill Bynum said, was developed following the 2024 election as a way to empower people in communities across the Deep South.
“Last November, it was clear that we were at a very critical point in the country and that there were going to be changes in the economic policies going forward,” Bynum told Mississippi Today. “But we’d also seen over the years that we know what it takes to ensure that people in places like in the Delta, in the Alabama Black Belt, in south Jackson, in Central City in New Orleans could navigate these economic shifts, these political shifts, these crises.
“So we reached out to our investors, to our board, to our team here at HOPE and our allies and said, ‘It’s time to create a new paradigm where everyday people in the South have the tools they need to prosper,” Bynum continued. “Delta Fest is not just a forum, it’s not just a conference. We see it as a strategy, a vision.”
An opening ceremony will take place on Sept. 16 and will be hosted by comedian Rita Brent and feature musical performances by Benjamin Cone with members of the Mississippi Mass Choir and the Jackson State Sonic Boom Pep Band. Later, there will be a fireside chat with music executive and Jackson State University professor Cortez Bryant. 
The next two days are dedicated to sessions broken into three tracks: Ownership, Entrepreneurship and Community Infrastructure. One will feature Jackson Mayor John Horhn along with the mayors of Birmingham, Montgomery and Little Rock. They will be joined by other local and national leaders, policymakers, creatives and entrepreneurs to share ideas, resources and information.
Bynum said he expects that by the end of the festival, there will be “some clear direction, some clear tools that people can put to use to start to advance a prosperous economy.”
“This isn’t just ideas and platitudes, this is really around, ‘What can people pick up right now to do and build within their entrepreneurship, ownership and community infrastructure?’” said Lisa Yancey, the founder and president of Yancey Consulting. “Anything that we want to materialize, anything that we want to manifest isn’t outside of us. It is already within us … We just need to activate it.”

DPH officials believe exposures may have occurred between Sept. 2 and 11 at Georgia State University, Sweetgreen Restaurant in Atlanta and at youth soccer practices and games.
This case represents the seventh case of measles in Georgia this year, while other states have been dealing with larger outbreaks.
Last year, Georgia had six cases of measles. Before that, except for 2019 when there were 18 cases, Georgia has had little to no confirmed cases of measles for the last 15 years.
Measles symptoms appear within one to two weeks of exposure and can include high fever, runny nose and watery eyes before a rash of tiny red spots breaks out, usually starting at the head and spreading to the rest of the body.
The virus can lead to severe complications, especially for groups including young children and pregnant women. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in five unvaccinated people who gets measles in the U.S. is hospitalized. About one child out of every thousand who gets measles will develop encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that can lead to intellectual disabilities.
Between one and three out of every thousand children who get measles will die from respiratory or neurologic complications, the CDC finds.
Measles is preventable with the MMR vaccine, which also protects against mumps and rubella, a routine vaccination recommended for all children. But health experts worry that growing vaccine skepticism could contribute to the spread of preventable diseases like measles.
In Georgia, 88.4% of incoming kindergarteners had gotten their MMR shots during the 2023-2024 school year, according to CDC data – that’s down from 94% 10 years prior and 99.6% in the 2009-2019 school year.

They gave advice to state Sen. Jason Bean, who was at the dais presiding over the Missouri Senate  (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A newly-gerrymandered congressional map and limits on voters’ ability to amend the state constitution cleared the Missouri Senate Friday, capping two weeks of contentious debate that drew national attention.
The changes to the initiative petition process will appear on the statewide ballot next year. 
The new map, designed to give Republicans control of seven of Missouri’s eight seats in Congress, now heads to Gov. Mike Kehoe for his signature. It may ultimately end up on next year’s ballot as well, with a group called People NOT Politicians Missouri announcing Friday that it will file a referendum with the secretary of state’s office to “put this deeply flawed map before Missouri voters.”
The legislature reconvened last week at the urging of President Donald Trump, who has demanded Republican-led states rework congressional districts so the party holds on to its slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm election. 
The White House started pressuring Missouri Republicans to get in on the act in July, and this week phoned in to the state Senate GOP caucus meeting. The initiative petition changes were added to the agenda by Kehoe, with Republicans arguing the current system makes it too easy to change the Missouri Constitution. 
The Missouri House passed both measures Tuesday. The Senate gave them final approval Friday morning 21-11 after moving to shut down a Democratic filibuster following four hours of debate. Republican Sens. Lincoln Hough of Springfield and Mike Moon of Ash Grove joined nine Democrats in opposition to the new maps and the initiative petition changes.
Democrats say both proposals as a power grab by the Republican supermajority and a Trump-inspired assault on democracy. And they’ve denounced changes to the Senate’s rules this week designed to undermine any possible opposition. 
“This is a cynical maneuver designed to put a thumb on the scale of democracy, to ensure predetermined outcome regardless of the will of the people,” said state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat. “It is a betrayal of our duty to represent the people, and not a political party.”
 Congressional map

Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. Cleaver represents the 5th DIstrict, which includes most of Kansas City and Jackson County. 
The 5th District, which has been represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, would be carved up, with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County, would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
The intended result is a map where Republicans hold seven of the state’s eight seats. 
Revising congressional district lines occurs every 10 years, after the allocation of seats following the federal census. The Missouri Constitution mandates it but is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to do so at other times. 
Democrats argue it is unconstitutional to draw another map before the next census is complete. 
The Missouri NAACP filed a lawsuit in Cole County arguing the governor’s decision to call a special session was unconstitutional. Cleaver has also promised to go to court to challenge the new map.
Republicans say critics are misreading the constitution and are confident the new map will survive any legal challenge. 
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, said Friday that the map undermines decades of work to reunite a community divided at Troost Avenue, the line separating Black and white sections of Kansas City when housing segregation was legal. 
The GOP-backed map, Nurrenbern noted, splits Kansas City down Troost once again.
“Somebody in D.C. sought to resurrect the Mason Dixon Line of Kansas City,” she said. “Somebody in D.C. decided to split the 4th and the 5th congressional districts down Troost.”
Moon, one of only a handful of Republicans who have publicly opposed the new map, expressed concern Friday about legislators not being allowed to have any input in the process. 
“I ask myself what President Trump would do if he were in this body,” Moon said, “and someone told him, ‘this is all you’re going to get, and you vote yes, sit down and shut up.’”
For those seeking to repeal the map through the referendum process, they must collect 100,000 signatures in 90 days to put the map on the November 2026 ballot. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
“This fight is not over,” Elsa Rainey, a spokeswoman for People NOT Politicians Missouri, said in an emailed statement. “Missouri voters — not politicians — will have the final say.”
If they collect enough signatures, the legislature would have to move the referendum election to another date. That’s because local election officials say congressional districts must be finalized by May 26 for ballots to be ready in time for the August primary. 
The last time the referendum process was successfully deployed was in 2018, when labor unions successfully repealed a right-to-work law. The Missouri AFL-CIO has signaled it is likely to assist in a referendum over the maps.
 Initiative Petition

Missouri is one of 24 states that allows citizen initiative petitions. They can be used to either amend the constitution or change state law, though the path to successfully doing so is often arduous and expensive, requiring tens of thousands of signatures to even land on the ballot.
In recent years, Missourians have used the initiative petition process to legalize abortion and recreational marijuana use, as well expand Medicaid eligibility.
Republicans have fumed at the success of progressive ballot initiatives for years, arguing they are bankrolled by out-of-state special interests.
When the bill cleared the Missouri House, Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis said amending the state constitution has become too easy. Any changes, he said, should have “broad consensus across the state.”
The legislation approved Friday would require constitutional amendments put on the ballot by Missouri voters to attain both a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts in order to pass.
Based on last year’s election results, that change would mean as few as 5% of voters could defeat any ballot measure. The new requirements would only apply to citizen-led initiative petitions, not amendments placed on the ballot by the legislature.
“If you’re a politician in Jefferson City, you become more powerful after this passes,” sais state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat.
The question will go on the 2026 ballot and require a simple majority to approve.
Sam Licklider, a lobbyist for the Missouri Association of Realtors, told lawmakers this week that his organization will oppose the proposal on the ballot.
In 2010, the realtors raised $4.4 million to amend the Missouri Constitution to prohibit sales taxes on real estate transfers. That was followed in 2016 by a $5.6 million campaign to prevent lawmakers from extending the sales tax to services.
“We are well positioned,” Licklider said, “to ensure our arguments reach the public.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_bean1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Two federal agencies had to move 35 people from the Minnehaha County Jail in the run-up to a state-funded saturation patrol late last month in Sioux Falls.
Minnehaha County officials asked federal agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Marshals Service to transport the inmates, whom the county is paid to house, to other regional facilities to make space for a surge in local inmates.
“These troopers are very good at what they do,” said Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead, who had advance notice about the operation. “If 15 or 20 troopers show up, they’re going to make arrests.”
State corrects record: 78 people arrested during ‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ saturation patrol

The saturation patrol ran on three days leading into Labor Day weekend as part of “Operation Prairie Thunder.” The branded campaign is a two-part initiative from Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, meant to address crime in Sioux Falls — where some crimes have hit five-year lows — and help federal immigration agents detain people suspected of being in the U.S. without authorization.
The Rhoden administration has said the operations won’t impact the Highway Patrol’s budget, but the movement of inmates points to other costs associated with the campaign.
ICE agents moving inmates aren’t on the street enforcing immigration law, said Milstead. The county jail, meanwhile, lost the revenue it had earned by housing federal inmates, and the federal agencies incurred the expense of transporting them to other facilities.
The first of what are meant to be monthly saturation patrols over the next six months put 15 additional Sioux Falls-area state troopers on the city’s streets. 
On top of tickets for drunken driving and speeding, the troopers arrested 78 people on drug charges. Twenty-seven of them were booked at the Minnehaha County Jail and released on their own recognizance, but 51 stayed through the weekend to await a bond hearing with a judge.
Milstead said he supports the enforcement efforts, but that supporting it meant making room at the jail to brace for the impact.
“As another operation approaches, we’ll need to do the same thing,” he said.
Courts, public defenders also impacted
The court system also felt an impact. Two judges hear bond arguments and set release conditions for inmates in two separate courtrooms the afternoon after a typical weekend. The courthouse was closed the Friday before Labor Day and on the holiday, however. 
Between the extra days and the extra arrests, the courthouse needed to pull another judge into service in a third courtroom to manage the overflow.
It’s not the first time that’s happened, though, according to Second Judicial Circuit Court Administrator Karl Thoennes. The Tuesday after the holiday was “busy, heavy, but not unusual necessarily” after a four-day weekend in the state’s largest metro area.
Minnehaha County Public Defender Traci Smith said her office saw a “significant uptick” as a result of the operation. 
“Our concern is that these are typically non-violent, nuisance-type offenses and outstanding warrants,” Smith wrote. “Dedicating substantial attention to these cases diverts limited resources away from our ability to prioritize the most serious cases — those involving victims awaiting resolution and matters that directly impact public safety.”
Federal inmate movement
The movement of federal inmates was meant to insure there would be space for local inmates, who take priority over inmates from other jurisdictions. 
Sheriff Milstead said his jail asked ICE to move 16 of its detainees to other facilities, and for the U.S. Marshals to transfer 19. The federal agents had to drive some as far as Sisseton.
“They’re moving some of them 150, 200 miles away,” Milstead said.
‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ will assist with deportations and boost Sioux Falls law enforcement

Some of the transferred inmates will likely need to return to Sioux Falls, at least temporarily. That’s because the federal government has prisons, but it doesn’t have jails. 
People incarcerated as they await trial on federal charges typically stay in local jails, and the federal government pays a fee — $114 per day, per inmate in Minnehaha County — to house them. Jails also collect fees for housing ICE detainees before they’re transferred for appearances in regional immigration courtrooms.
The jail in Sioux Falls didn’t stop taking federal inmates after the transfer. Eight people were arrested on immigration violations during the saturation patrol and were booked at the jail, filling half the beds ICE detainees had left before the operation began.
ICE did not immediately respond to questions from South Dakota Searchlight about the situation.
Barry Lane, a public affairs specialist for the U.S. Marshals Service, said it’s not uncommon for federal inmates to be moved out of local jails to make space when things get busy. Transporting inmates, he said, is “one of the most expensive things we do.” 
Lane, who works in the Washington, D.C., area, said he wasn’t aware of any particular difficulties for marshals in South Dakota. 
“Whatever’s going on near you, it may or may not be unusual,” Lane said.
Locals would like to see permanent commitment
Milstead expects the “roller coaster” of jail movement to continue with Operation Prairie Thunder, but he’d like to see a more permanent response from the governor’s office.
He and Sioux Falls Police Chief Jon Thum have had conversations to that effect with Rhoden’s office since the first saturation patrol. Their hope is to embed a state trooper permanently in one of the area’s joint task forces. There are three: one for violent offenses, another for the service of felony warrants and another that targets drug trafficking.
Those task forces, he said, help explain why the city’s been able to hold the crime rate largely steady as the population has grown, and to see some offenses drop to five-year lows.

Thum said he appreciates the state helping out by patrolling the streets for the same reason he sees the task forces as important. His patrol officers frequently attend to calls for service and are less able to target traffic enforcement, like troopers do, or dive into long-term investigations, as the task forces do. 
“The day-to-day operations of the city tie up a lot of our resources,” Thum said. 
But Thum said the idea of welcoming a task force trooper, with specialized training in drug interdiction, may be more hopeful than pragmatic in the near term. 
Hiring officers has grown difficult statewide, the chief said. Thum’s department is authorized to have 302 officers. He has 294. The Highway Patrol, he said, “is dealing with the same thing we’re dealing with.”
“We’re perpetually playing catch up at this point,” Thum said. “Once agencies get to be a certain size, you’re just constantly in hiring mode.”
Steve Long, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said the Highway Patrol has a 12% vacancy rate at the moment, but there are trooper recruits heading soon to the state’s law enforcement academy. 
Long didn’t say how many troopers the state’s authorized to hire, but legislative documents offered in January put the figure at 201. At that time, there were 21 vacancies.
Josie Harms, spokeswoman for Rhoden’s office, said the administration is amenable to the idea of adding a trooper to a Sioux Falls task force. 
Harms confirmed that the governor’s office has been in discussions with Sioux Falls officials about it, and wrote that “it is certainly a possibility, though nothing has been finalized.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Office of Inspector General filed a formal ethics complaint Friday against former Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green — accusing her of ghost employment and misuse of state property. 
The investigation began months before her abrupt resignation last Friday.
The filing, which was signed by Inspector General Jared Prentice, accuses Green of violating multiple provisions of the state’s ethics code. 
It builds on a remediation agreement first reported this week by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, which prohibited Green from using state resources for political purposes and cautioned her against inappropriate conduct toward employees in her office.
The next step is a public meeting before the state ethics commission, where the inspector general will present evidence and Green will have an opportunity to respond. It’s up to the commissioners to decide whether the allegations constitute violations of Indiana’s ethics code and what sanctions should follow.
Green also could enter into a settlement agreement.
She did not immediately respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment Friday afternoon.
The inspector general also has a duty to refer any evidence of potential criminal activity to prosecutors, who would decide independently whether to pursue charges.
Ghost employment is a felony under Indiana law.
Allegations in the complaint
The complaint alleges she improperly involved state employees in her political campaign, used state property for personal and political purposes, required staff to perform personal errands on state time and retaliated against an employee who cooperated with investigators.
According to the complaint, Green directed two state employees to generate campaign content for her “Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green” Facebook page and instructed another staffer to proofread posts.
Investigators said those actions not only violated the state’s ban on political activity during official duties, but also amounted to ghost employment because the work was performed on state time.
Story continues below.
REDACTED Complaint - 2025-03-0077_Redacted
 
The inspector general further alleged that Green held a meeting with a political director from the National Republican Congressional Committee during working hours and used a state conference room for that meeting. 
The complaint states that Green also required two employees to retrieve her assigned state vehicle from Crown Point, Indiana — a personal task performed on state time that the OIG said also violated the ghost employment rule.
Separately, investigators pointed to Green’s use of her official title on her private “Battle-Proven Leadership” website, where she sells training seminars and a book.
By attaching her state position to those business ventures, the complaint argues, Green violated the state’s prohibition against misuse of state property. The inspector general also alleged she used her state vehicle, and instructed an employee to do the same, for personal errands.
The complaint further accuses Green of retaliation against an employee who cooperated with the OIG’s investigation. 
According to the filing, Green threatened one of her employees “with either demotion or termination” after learning the employee had provided information to the OIG. The complaint further asserts that Green “made derogatory comments” and called the employee “demeaning names” after the employee sat for an interview and responded to subsequent requests for information. 
State law prohibits retaliation against employees who participate in inspector general investigations.
Five different employees are named within the complaint. The Capital Chronicle has redacted the names from the document.
What comes next
The filing comes only days after the Indiana Capital Chronicle published a previously confidential remediation agreement Green signed with state officials in July. 
That document laid out restrictions for her continued employment, including an explicit ban on using state vehicles for political purposes, a directive not to ask employees to staff political events and a warning not to comment on employees’ appearances. 
The remediation agreement was intended to correct problems and allow Green to remain in office, while the inspector general continued its investigation.
Remediation document reveals ethics concerns before Indiana cabinet secretary resignation

Green ultimately resigned on Sept. 5 after serving less than nine months as Indiana’s first secretary of public safety.
The complaint was released one day after the Indiana State Ethics Commission held a closed-door meeting in Indianapolis. 
Commissioners met for less than 20 minutes in an executive session to consider a probable cause affidavit and “an individual’s alleged misconduct.” Green’s case was not listed on the public agenda, however, and commissioners declined to comment afterward. 
By law, complaints remain confidential until probable cause is established.
The process requires the commission to determine whether ethics violations occurred and, if so, what sanctions are appropriate. Penalties can include fines and even barring a person from future state employment, per state statute. 
Green’s resignation marked the first departure of a cabinet-level official in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration. 
Following her appointment in January, Green’s responsibilities included oversight of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Correction, the Criminal Justice Institute and the Parole Board.

“I want you to know that I will not back down from any fight to protect your rights and freedoms,” Riggs said. “I am committed to a North Carolina where workers are protected, freedoms are exercised, and families can thrive.”
On the conference’s first day Wednesday, Gov. Josh Stein made a similar promise to help create a North Carolina that supports working families. The second day of the gathering largely focused on the federal crackdown on government employees under the Trump administration and how labor leaders can take a stand.
The annual convention also saw a changing of the guard in the NC AFL-CIO, with MaryBe McMillan stepping down as union president after eight years in the role. Riggs swore in her successor, Braxton Winston II, a former Charlotte City Council member who was the 2024 Democratic nominee in the state labor commissioner race.
McMillan commended Riggs for remaining steadfast and fighting for the voting rights of North Carolinians amid the monthslong election challenge by her opponent, Judge Jefferson Griffin.
“She never gave up,” McMillan said. “She fought fiercely for voting rights and for justice, for all of us, for our democracy, and to make sure that all of us had a voice in that democracy.”

Riggs said she was grateful for McMillan’s 20 years of organizing in the state’s largest labor federation, adding that there remains much work to do to achieve fair conditions for workers.
“We are in a state where wages are too low and workers do not have adequate protections. We’re in a state where unions don’t have the ability to fully organize or advocate for our workers,” Riggs said. “But in this moment here, looking at what’s happened in the last year, I want to celebrate the progress that you have made for our state and our people. North Carolina is better because of the people in this room.”
She commended the growing number of unions in the state as well as skills trainings, paid internships, and organizing campaigns created by labor leaders in North Carolina, where unions have historically faced structural challenges. A right-to-work state, North Carolina is estimated to have the lowest union participation rate in the U.S., at 2.4%.
But the state’s unions have been important political forces, Riggs said. The NC AFL-CIO endorsed and mobilized to elect both Stein and Riggs, the most prominent elected leaders at this year’s convention. Riggs said she was inspired by the persistence embodied by labor activists in North Carolina as she fought to uphold her own win in the state courts.
“I want to thank you for your support, and I want to let you know that your example inspired an entire nation, because folks really needed to see what a fight looks like,” Riggs said. “And if they’d been following labor, they would have known labor’s been fighting all along. But in the moments after the November election, people needed to see a fighting spirit and they saw it here in North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9123981-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

Several hundred Boeing workers cheered Friday afternoon at the St. Louis Music Park in Maryland Heights after learning union members voted overwhelmingly to reject a new contract offered by the company. 
“It was jubilant for a minute,” said Boeing assembly mechanic Christy Williams, “and now we’re heading back to the strike line.”
About 3,200 Boeing workers who assemble advanced aircraft and weapons systems at the company’s facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Ill. have been on strike since Aug. 4.
Union members of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 voted Friday to reject Boeing’s modified five-year contract offer, choosing to remain on strike.
“Our members in St. Louis have once again shown that they will not settle for Boeing’s half-measures,” said IAM International President Brian Bryant in a prepared statement issued Friday. “Boeing must start listening to its employees and come back to the table with a meaningful offer that respects the sacrifices and skill of these workers.”
According to the union statement, Boeing’s modified offer didn’t include a sufficient signing bonus relative to what other Boeing workers have received or a raise in 401(k) benefits.  
Williams said the new offer wasn’t much different than the previous rejected offers and called it “insulting.”
“We need to be compensated,” Williams said. “They don’t think we’re intelligent enough to understand contractual agreements, but we’re good enough to build the best fighter jet in the world. It’s crazy to me.”
She said it didn’t address one of the most important issues of compensating longtime workers. It mostly benefits newer workers, she said, like Williams and her son who joined the company a few years ago.
“This contract works for me and my son,” she said, “but it doesn’t work for the people at the top of the scale. And if the people at top of scale don’t continue to go up a little bit, especially based on economics and economy and cost of living, then it’s eventually going to cut all of us off who are at lower scale.”
In a statement after the vote, Boeing said it was “disappointed” employees rejected what its touts as offering 45% average wage growth. 
“We’ve made clear the overall economic framework of our offer will not change, but we have consistently adjusted the offer based on employee and union feedback to better address their concerns,” the company said. “In the meantime, no further talks are scheduled. We will continue to execute our contingency plan, including hiring permanent replacement workers, as we maintain support for our customers.”
Williams said members aren’t too worried about the company’s threat to hire permanent replacements because there’s no one there to train them.
According to the union statement, the workers assemble and maintain things like the F-15 fighter jet, F/A-18, and cutting-edge missile and defense technologies, adding that their work “plays a vital role in safeguarding national security and supporting U.S. and allied defense operations.”
“The message could not be clearer—our members expect Boeing to do better,” said IAM Midwest Territory General Vice President Sam Cicinelli. “They will not be brushed aside with small adjustments. Boeing needs to stop dragging its feet and negotiate an agreement that honors the contributions of its workforce.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2964-2-1024x812.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(Photo by Amelia Ferrell Knisely/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia Democratic lawmakers kicked off their statewide tour Thursday in Huntington, fielding questions from local residents concerned about paying their bills, their local schools and health insurance. 
A state employee raised a question about the financially-troubled Public Employees Insurance Agency, which wasn’t addressed during the most recent legislative session. “My fundamental question is, is my wife going to lose her health insurance?” he asked.
It was the first stop on West Virginia House Democrats “Kitchen Table Tour” that will take them around the increasingly red state this fall to talk with constituents ahead of the 2026 legislative session. The GOP supermajority in the Legislature ignored pressing issues, Democrats say, like the need for clean drinking water, child care options and skyrocketing utility costs. 
“We would like to focus on issues that West Virginians need us to focus on. There are a lot of things that are not getting done,” said Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, who also serves as chair of the state Democratic Party. 
About 50 people attended the tour’s first stop at Huntington’s Kitchen. 
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, and Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, attended the event, along with Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, who is joining House Democrats for part of the tour. Other Democratic lawmakers will join at future stops.  
“West Virginia, unlike any other place probably in the union, we’re probably all more alike when it comes to these kitchen table issues,” Lewis said. “Everybody worried about their high-ass utility bill. Everybody worried about whether I can get a good job, whether your grandchildren aren’t going to be able to afford college … we’re fighting for you, and you have the opportunity to fight for yourself.”
The party is also hoping to recruit volunteers and candidates ahead of next year’s election. There are 11 Democratic members in the state Legislature, which is overwhelmingly GOP and holds a supermajority in both chambers. After years as a blue state, Republican voter registration is growing in the Trump-friendly state, and Democratic registrations now account for just 28% of West Virginia registered voters.
In the 2024 election, 50 House of Delegate and Senate races — almost all with Republican candidates — were uncontested. 
“We have done a lot with a little. We just need more,” Hornbuckle said. “We have been able to effectively slow down some things, and every once in a while stop that legislation, but we do desperately need more numbers.”

Education a big concern in Huntington 
WOWK news anchor Amanda Barren moderated the event, and it kicked off with a retired teacher immediately asking about the impact of the state’s school voucher program, The Hope Scholarship, on public education. The nearly $100 million program, established in 2021, gives families roughly $5,200 per student in taxpayer money to use for private schools, homeschooling and more. 
“Some people are just not going to turn that down, and they don’t understand the consequences of that,” Hornbuckle said. 
Cabell County Schools, which contains Huntington, has said students using the Hope Scholarship contributed to a $7.1 million funding decrease this year. Population decline was also a factor. 
Hornbuckle said he plans to introduce legislation next year that would require families using the Hope Scholarship to pay their public school if their child is going to participate in athletics or arts programs. 
“Since you pulled that money out, you’re not paying for the services right now,” he said. 
Pushkin emphasized there are limited guardrails on the program, and millions of dollars from the of Hope Scholarships were used at out-of-state schools and to purchase iPads, dance studio fees and more. 
House Democrats proposed a bill banning the use of Hope Scholarship funds at out-of-state schools, but the measure wasn’t taken up for consideration this legislative session. 
With more families choosing homeschooling, a woman in the audience said she worried about children who were being homeschooled without oversight. “We don’t know if these kids are being put in a bad situation,” she said. 
Garcia responded that the Legislature still needs to work on adding guardrails to the state’s limited homeschool regulations, noting the 2018 death of 8-year-old Raylee Browning who was being homeschooled after teachers reported potential child abuse. Three adults are in prison for her death.
In 2024, a Boone County girl died from apparent starvation while being homeschooled.
No laws have been changed to tighten homeschool laws in cases of suspected child abuse despite attempts from House Democrats.
“It’s the simplest way to have a narrow exception, and we haven’t been able to pass that. That is crazy,” Garcia said. “That is one of the things that we’re fighting right now — to have more accountability for those kids, especially those who are in that vulnerable state.”
Other attendees raised questions about affordable housing, and one woman emotionally shared the challenge making ends meet while paying a mortgage. She worried about others who can’t find a safe and affordable place to live with children despite working.
“I know how close I am to poverty that I am, and I’m a nurse … I don’t know how [families] make it,” she said. “If you’re down, you cannot get up.”
There were also concerns about the state’s limited public transportation and massive shortage of child care spots. 
Democratic lawmakers took notes on people’s concerns, saying they’d like to learn more and explore potential future measures — especially bipartisan legislation — to address problems.
“Stay in communication, call us, email us … so that way we can strategize when we need to strategize,” Lewis said. “Ultimately, don’t be discouraged. Don’t be downtrodden. The power is with us.”
The dates for the rest of the tour are: 

Martinsburg on Sept. 15
Morgantown on Sept. 30
Charleston on Oct. 7
Fairmont on Oct. 14
Wheeling on Oct. 16

Matt Meyer has signed a package of bills aimed at strengthening support for the state’s volunteer firefighters and emergency responders, addressing declining ranks and rising emergency calls that threaten emergency response capacity.  This is critical to Delaware because we are unique. Delaware is the only U.S. state that relies on volunteer firefighters even in its capital city, Dover. Only Wilmington has a fully paid fire department. Without enough volunteers, response times could lengthen and communities could face serious safety risks.
Key Bills


House Bill 171 updates the Delaware Volunteerism Act, allowing high school students to earn one elective credit and fulfill community service requirements by volunteering with local fire departments. Schools must notify students of the option during course selection.


Senate Bill 28 provides a $7,000 funeral expense benefit for deceased members of volunteer fire companies, ladies’ auxiliaries, and volunteer ambulance or rescue companies. The benefit takes effect Oct. 1, 2025, and applies even if other state burial benefits are available.


Senate Bill 86 expands the Delaware Volunteer Fire Service Revolving Loan Fund, now permitting donations from individuals, charitable groups, and counties.


House Bill 124 increases the maximum fees the State Fire Marshal’s Office can charge to reflect rising service costs.


“Volunteer firefighters save lives every day,” Meyer said in a statement. “These bills are an investment in public safety, in teaching the next generation, and in the dedicated Delawareans who answer the call when we need them most.”
A Mounting Crisis
“Delaware’s volunteer fire stations are facing a serious recruitment and retention crisis and it’s has been building for more than a decade”, said Gordon Edwards III, Fire Chief of the Brandywine Hundred Fire Company No. 1 in North Wilmington, and a third-generation firefighter.    The challenge for Firefighters is changing:


Shrinking Volunteer Numbers: Enrollment at the Delaware State Fire School dropped from 408 in 2009 to just 189 in 2019, a decline of more than 50 percent.


Rising Emergency Calls: Over the past 30 years, emergency calls have tripled statewide, putting more pressure on fewer volunteers.


Changing Lifestyles: Younger generations juggle school, work, and social demands, leaving less time for unpaid service. Many newcomers assume fire services are fully paid, and traditional family legacies of firefighting are fading.


Economic Pressures: The rising cost of living makes it harder for people to commit time to volunteer roles that offer no financial compensation.


“Volunteering at your local fire station is more than fighting fires… it is the first step to helping protect the people in your community,” remarked Gordan. “We are looking for a wide variety of volunteers, not just firefighters. We have tasks for almost anyone, including helping to coordinate emergency responses, organizing community events and fundraisers, teaching fire safety at schools and community centers, and maintenance roles that will keep the equipment and vehicles ready for use.”















Editor’s Fact Box: How to Help Delaware’s Volunteer Firefighters
Volunteer Opportunities• Fire & Rescue Roles: Most Delaware fire companies train new volunteers for firefighting, EMS, or rescue operations.• Support Roles: Many stations also need administrative help, fundraising assistance, and event volunteers.
Where to Start• Visit the Delaware State Fire School website (statefireschool.delaware.gov) for training details and application links.• Contact your local fire company—most have online sign-up forms and monthly orientation nights.
Other Ways to Give• Make a tax-deductible donation to your local fire company or the Delaware Volunteer Fire Service Revolving Loan Fund.• Share their recruitment posts on social media to help spread the word.
Why It MattersDelaware relies on volunteer firefighters across nearly every community. Your time, skills, or financial support can help keep response times low and neighborhoods safe.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/R.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

Charles Ray Crawford, 59, is set to be executed Oct. 15 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, after multiple requests by the attorney general’s office. 
Eight justices joined the majority opinion to set the execution, concluding that Crawford has exhausted all state and federal legal remedies. Mississippi Supreme Court Justice T. Kenneth Griffis Jr. wrote the Friday opinion. Justice David Sullivan did not participate. 
Last fall, Crawford’s attorneys asked the court not to set an execution date because he hadn’t exhausted appeal efforts in federal court to challenge a rape conviction that is not tied to his death sentence. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up Crawford’s case. 
A similar delay occurred a decade ago, when the AG’s office asked the court to reset Crawford’s execution date, but that was denied because efforts to appeal his unrelated rape conviction were still pending. 
After each unsuccessful filing, the attorney general’s office asked the Mississippi Supreme Court to set Crawford’s execution date. 
On Friday, the court also denied Crawford’s third petition for post-conviction relief and a request for oral argument. It accepted the state’s motion to dismiss the petition. Seven justices concurred and Justice Leslie King concurred in result only. Again, Justice Sullivan did not participate. 
Crawford was convicted and sentenced to death in Lafayette County for the 1993 rape and murder of North Mississippi Community College student Kristy Ray.  
Days before he was set to go to trial on separate aggravated assault and rape charges, he kidnapped Ray from her parents’ Tippah County home, leaving ransom notes. Crawford took Ray to an abandoned barn where he stabbed her, and his DNA was found on her, indicating he sexually assaulted her, according to court records. 
Crawford told police he had blackouts and only remembered parts of the crime, but not killing Ray. Later he admitted “he must of killed her” and led police to Ray’s body, according to court records. 
At his 1994 trial he presented an insanity defense, including that he suffered from psychogenic amnesia – periods of time lapse without memory. Medical experts who provided rebuttal testimony said Crawford didn’t have psychogenic amnesia and didn’t show evidence of bipolar illness. 
The last person executed in Mississippi was Richard Jordan in June, previously the state’s oldest and longest serving person on death row.

The stories and memories of the place endure.,"This was a Friday night in 1978. Malcolm White, who planned to settle in New Orleans, was visiting Jackson. His Booneville buddy, the late Michael Rubenstein, then a popular Jackson TV sportscaster, suggested they dine at The Mayflower Cafe. And dine they did.
“The place was packed and there was a line waiting outside, and it seemed everyone knew everyone, and of course everyone knew Rube,” White remembers. “The fish was fantastic, the vibe even better. Everybody seemed to be smiling and laughing between bites. I looked a couple tables over and there sat Miss Eudora (Welty), herself, and of course she was having as much fun as everyone else. It just felt like home. It was definitely my kind of place. I had a similar experience at the old Cerami’s at the Reservoir the night before. But that night at The Mayflower I thought to myself, ‘Hmmmm, Jackson, this is a place I could live.’”
Forty-seven years later, White, who became Jackson’s arts and entertainment engine, has never left.

Rick Cleveland
I moved to Jackson a year later, taking a job at The Clarion Ledger with no plans to make Jackson a permanent home. I had similar experiences at The Mayflower. Back then, The Mayflower stayed open until hungry people quit coming in, often well after midnight. We would put the finishing touches to the sports section around midnight and head to the ’Flower for redfish, oysters or soft-shell crab and something cold to drink. Lots of times, we already had eaten the blue plate lunch there, too. Mr. Mike (Kountouris), the longtime owner and an unforgettable character, took care of us. Friday nights were like homecoming. I am not telling you The Mayflower kept me in Jackson all these years, but I am telling you it has been an integral part of my life. It has been for so many. And Friday nights remain like homecoming.
What brings this all to mind this week was The New York Times listing of America’s Top 50 restaurants of 2025. The Mayflower Cafe made the list, along with such nationally renowned restaurants as Emeril’s in New Orleans, Sunny’s Steak House in Miami, and several of the newest, hippest restaurants in food meccas such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
What sets The Mayflower apart on this week’s list: It opened its doors at the corner of Roach and Capitol 90 years ago. The next oldest restaurant of the Times’ Top 50 is Emeril’s, which opened in 1990. Clearly, The Mayflower endures. Indeed, Malcolm’s father and my dad were Mayflower regulars as far back as the early 1950s. Mississippi governors, political leaders, movers and shakers were regulars even before that. 
But it wasn’t so long ago we regulars feared The Mayflower’s days were numbered. Jerry Kountouris, Mr. Mike’s son who took over for him, was ready to retire and nobody in the Kountouris family wanted to continue the restaurant business. Jerry, who had somehow guided The Mayflower through the pandemic that closed so many restaurants across America, put the business up for sale. For the longest time there were no takers. On more than one occasion, Jerry confided he was ready to close the place.
Enter former Jackson Mayor Kane Ditto and business partner Mart Lamar, who bought the building and convinced Hunter Evans and Cody McCain, owners of the popular and award-winning Elvie’s in Belhaven (which made the same New York Times list in 2022), to run the restaurant. The “new” Mayflower, which kept so much of what made the old Mayflower so special, opened for business in August of 2024. It took all of a year for it to be named one of America’s top 50 restaurants.

Said Ditto, “I just thought it would be devastating for downtown Jackson, especially the west side, if The Mayflower closed. It would have been. I am just so happy we were able to keep it going, and I am happy for this recognition from The New York Times. It is richly deserved.”
It had to be a difficult balancing act for Evans, a James Beard Best Chef finalist, and McCain to decide what to keep of the old place and what to change. Perhaps the best move was to retain many of the people: wait staff, cooks, bussers and security. The menu has  remained much the same, from the delectable onion rings to Redfish Jane. So have the sauces. The prices are higher, yes, but surely you have been to the grocery store lately.
Says Evans, “The hardest part was I felt like I had to explain to the old guard that we were not trying to come in here and make it about us and change everything. Our main goal was to preserve the history and story of The Mayflower. We thought the best way to do that was to renovate the dining room with some necessary changes. We didn’t just show up with new ideas and say, ‘Forget the old Mayflower.’ I called old regulars, I asked them about the menu and what they ate, I went to the Department of History and Archives. We care a lot about The Mayflower, everyone who has made this a part of their lives and the significance of this restaurant to our community.” 
Was there added pressure because of the place’s rich history?

“There was a little pressure, for sure, but we also understood what it would take to usher The Mayflower into the next 100 years as well as thrive in our community,” Evans answered. “That is why this recognition is so rewarding. We were able to help share this story that started so long ago. We are a small part in the life of this restaurant but we were able to share the story of this institution to the world.”
There are welcome menu additions such as the feta-brined fried chicken and Trout Amelia. There’s now an oyster bar and a happy hour. Oh, and yes, you need not leave the restaurant to use the restrooms, which are shiny and new and clean. Maybe it was part of the charm of the old Mayflower that, when nature called, you went outside, around the side of the building and up a narrow, dreary stairway to perhaps the most spartan toilets imaginable. I will always remember what my wife said one time, returning from the ladies’ room: “If I ever decide to commit suicide, I know just the place.”
So many memories and stories: 

Of so many Mayflower nights with the late author and pal Willie Morris, who charmed everyone in the place and who almost always was the last customer to leave before they locked the doors behind him. When paying his tab, Willie once also wrote a check for $10,000 to my then 6-year-old son, and in the memo line he scribbled: “FOR BOOKS!” Willie usually ordered spaghetti, took it away in a to-go box and shared it with his cat, Spit McGee, sometime before dawn. To this day he remains the only person I ever knew to order spaghetti at The Mayflower.
Of sitting in a booth with my family when the then-Governor and his wife stopped by to chat. The governor went on and on, as politicians do, as we put our dinner on pause. Finally, he left. Said my 3-year-old daughter: “Just who does he think he is?” Out of the mouth of babes…
Of many lengthy lunches with the late Gov. William Winter who loved The Mayflower almost as much as he loved Mississippi. Every lunch was a history lesson. That’s where he told me about the Southeastern Conference’s first office being just down Roach Street on the 13th floor of the Standard Life Building. As a result of that lunch, a historic marker now marks the spot one block from the front door of The Mayflower.
And this from Sandra Stevens Burns on Facebook: “My late husband, Warren Burns, was missing, in an Alzheimer’s haze. He was found standing in front of his beloved Mayflower, having walked there from Woodland Hills. When asked how he found it, he grinned and said, ‘I could smell the rolls.’”

For years, I had a long-running bet with Mr. Mike, who always grumbled about the sad state of the old King Edward Hotel, a crumbling home for pigeons and vagrants, just down Capitol Street from The Mayflower. Mr. Mike bet me he would die before the King Edward was either torn down or refurbished. As I often told him, it was a bet he couldn’t win because if he won I couldn’t pay him. He won. Mr. Mike died in 2005. The King Edward reopened as a Hilton Garden Inn in 2009. Mr. Mike was right. He usually was.
His beloved Mayflower Cafe will celebrate its 100th birthday in 2035. I am placing no bets but surely hope to be there. And I hope the soft-shells are in season.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/12120246/Mayflower-DOYLE-39.jpg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

Catherine Cortez Masto speaking with a Forest Service employee after the Davis Fire in Washoe County in 2024. (Cortez Masto Senate office photo)When Linda Wadleigh was a forestry major at Utah State University she came upon her first summer job as a firefighter, a role that led to a 30-year career in wildland fire management with the U.S. Forest Service.
After years in the field, she and a handful of other women firefighters decided to create a boot camp to recruit and prepare other women to become firefighters through hands-on training and classroom learning opportunities.
“I didn’t see many other women, and I just wanted them to have the same chance that I did, to see what a great career this is,” Wadleigh said.
The Women in Wildfire Boot Camp program was established in 2011 and continued for more than a decade before it was terminated in February because of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.
As part of Trump’s sweeping plan to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government, his administration has issued dozens of orders cutting support from government initiatives to promote more diversity.
At a July 10 Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, U.S. Forest Service Acting Chief Tom Schultz was asked to explain why the boot camp program was eliminated. He responded, “there are still ample opportunities for all firefighters to be trained without singling out solely women.”
About 84% of federal wildland firefighters are men, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The U.S. Forest Service boot camp was launched to bring new firefighters, especially women, into a field that has historically struggled with worker retention.
The boot camp provides a structured path to becoming a wildland firefighter, but graduates still need to apply and once hired all new recruits receive the same fire training and must meet the same physical standards. 
After the program’s success in Arizona and New Mexico it expanded into 14 national forests across several western states. It was also adopted by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. At the program’s height, it trained and recruited over 200 people a year.
“We’ve recruited hundreds of applicants, that’s a great number to work with. We don’t want to lose that when we have trouble filling all our jobs,” said Wadleigh, who hired firefighters in her position as a district ranger at the Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona before retiring last year.
Those recruits went on to fight wildfires in surrounding states, including Nevada, as U.S. wildfires have grown more severe in recent years.
Linda Chappell, another firefighter who helped run boot camp’s, said she knew the program had legs by the third year when it started regularly receiving more applicants than available slots.
“Women don’t know they can have this job, or women are hesitant to jump in for an entire fire season. After getting them in for a week of training they knew if they loved it or didn’t,” Chappell said, who retired in 2021 as an intermountain regional fuels program manager.
Both women are working with several members of Congress to urge the Trump administration to reinstate the program, saying its elimination will exacerbate the shortage of federal firefighters.
The Forest Service has lost more than 1,400 fire-certified federal workers since February as part of the Trump administration’s work to reduce the size of government. The agency has also recently asked firefighters to work more hours amid the staffing cuts.
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and six other senators on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee sent a letter to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior Friday requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp program and its immediate reinstatement. 
“Thousands of firings at land management agencies across the country have already left land managers understaffed for upcoming fire seasons. We are concerned the elimination of this program will exacerbate this issue,”  reads the letter.
The National Intraagency Fire Center reports the U.S. has experienced more than 48,000 wildfires that have burned through more than four million acres across dozens of states this year.
“Eliminating a successful outreach program such as the [Women in Wildfire Boot Camp] unnecessarily limits recruitment to a smaller pool of potential trainees when there is already a shortage of skilled and willing potential workers,” the letter continues.
Chappell, the firefighter who helped run boot camps, said she believes the program was caught up in a sweeping DEI ban without reason.
“We think it may be just an unintended consequence. We’re not convinced that’s what they intended when the executive order was signed. So let’s go ask, is that really what was intended?” Chappell said. 
However, announcements about the boot camp that are still online warn “any previously issued diversity, equity, inclusion or gender-related guidance on this webpage should be considered rescinded.”
The letter requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp was also signed by U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR.), and Angus King (I-Maine).",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GkqhUxZW0AAdq69-1-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-09-12 14:57:34.211904

(Photo: Lisa Sorg)The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission voted 10-5 Thursday to adopt a new definition of “wetlands.”
This change would mean the state “wetlands” definition aligns with the federal definition, which shifted in 2023 due to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency.
This decision meant the EPA’s authority to regulate wetlands became limited to those with a “continuous surface connection” to permanent navigable waters.
North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality has been applying the revised “wetlands” definition since a 2023 law took effect in June of that year.
The law modified the text’s definition to say, “wetlands classified as waters of the State are restricted to waters of the United States.” The modification follows the federal decision to recognize wetlands only as those that are connected to navigable waters.
Sue Homewood from the Division of Water Resources led the presentation on the “wetlands” definition.
“While we did a regulatory impact analysis, the baseline was the session law that is already in place. The Division has been implementing this session law since it was passed,” Homewood said.
As a result, the conclusion from the regulatory impact analysis was there is no change in adopting this rule from the session law.
Opponents to the rule amendment voiced concerns over the loss of wetland protection in North Carolina, Homewood told the commission. There were also worries about how the rule would impact flood resiliency and wildlife habitats.
Julie Youngman, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said many other states were deciding to adopt stronger wetland protections to fill the gap that was being left by the Sackett decision.
“It’s concerning that the General Assembly in North Carolina chose to do the opposite,” she said. “Rather than fill the gap left by Sackett, it created a bigger gap by declaring wetlands that were previously protected under North Carolina law.”
Environmentalists would like to see legislators consider legislation related to reimplementing preservation and conservation for isolated wetlands.
Wetlands can act like a sponge in times of heavy rain, absorbing stormwater that would otherwise rush downstream to flood communities.
Fewer protections for wetlands could impact the water filtration service that they naturally provide, meaning more pollutants could enter wildlife habitats and drinking sources. NC Newsline has previously reported that in North Carolina 2.5 million acres of isolated wetlands are vulnerable.
“We should focus on what’s important for North Carolina: that we’re spending a lot of investments in mitigation and flood resiliency, that these wetlands could help provide for that,” Homewood said.
One commissioner asked if there was an analysis on the impact of the resources that would no longer be covered following the change.
Homewood said the division has not conducted an analysis on the federal definition.
“It’s a moving target,” Homewood said.

These are a few experiences cited by plaintiffs in a March 28 class action lawsuit against the architect and vendor of the state of Rhode Island’s online public benefits and health insurance marketplace portal, RIBridges. The system was hacked by cybercriminals in July 2024, exposing the personal information of an estimated 644,401 Rhode Islanders. The data breach went undetected and unpublicized until mid-December. The cybercriminal group Brain Cipher took credit for the breach and leaked the data online shortly before the new year.
Now the plaintiffs are one step closer to possible relief under a tentative agreement with defendant Deloitte.
Documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island show the parties entered into mediation in June. Following an Aug. 19 mediation session, lawyers for both sides told the court on Aug. 25 that they’d reached an agreement “in principle” and would file a preliminary-approval motion within 45 days. Details, however, are slim as to what that settlement might look like. 
Peter Wasylyk, who serves as the plaintiffs’ local liaison on the multistate legal team representing the aggrieved, said in a phone call Thursday afternoon that “it’s only internally settled.”
“So at this point, unfortunately, there’s no information to give other than what was filed with the court,” Wasylyk said. “Once the final settlement is drafted, we’re going to file it with the court. I’m sure we’ll have a lot more to say once we get the final settlement.”
On Sept. 5, District Judge Melissa R. DuBose extended a stay on approval so that both parties can work out the final settlement on paper. The parties have until around Oct. 9 to file their draft agreement for court approval.
The tentative settlement intends to resolve the case Pannozzi v. Deloitte Consulting LLP, which merged a set of six interrelated lawsuits filed in response to the RIBridges data breach into one case.
RIBridges firewall worked. But forensic report says hundreds of alarms went unnoticed.

A small number of people who did not apply for benefits were also affected, as the federal government allows states one connection to national databases used to determine benefit eligibility, a pathway RIBridges fulfills in the Ocean State.
People affected by the breach — whose stolen data may have included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and health and banking information — were notified earlier this year and provided free credit monitoring. 
If the court approves the settlement, it’s likely a public claims site would go live so eligible people could apply for any possible compensation. Following that, a final court “fairness hearing” typically approves the settlement terms and payouts. 
Deloitte has already reimbursed the state $5 million for credit monitoring and other costs associated with the incident. Neither Deloitte nor the Rhode Island Department of Administration — which runs the RIBridges system through its technology office — responded to requests for comment.
A separate civil investigation by the office of Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is still ongoing, spokesperson Tim Rondeau said in an email Thursday.
Meanwhile, the state has in the final steps of securing a vendor, The Northland Highland Holding Company LLC, to “modernize” the RIBridges system, according to a procurement determination form posted online in July. The RIBridges architecture dates back to the late 2010s and, last year, the state started seeking a new vendor to build upon, but not replace, Deloitte’s existing system. The nearly $3.8 million contract would run from Jan. 1, 2026, through June 30, 2027, with four annual renewals possible after the existing contract period.

Deloitte points finger at Brain Cipher
The March 28 filing from the plaintiffs and their attorneys allege that Deloitte’s “lax data security policies” helped to create the conditions for the breach, and that “Plaintiffs and Class Members were injured and lost money or property, which would not have occurred but for the unfair and deceptive acts, practices, and omissions” it alleges by Deloitte.
“Deloitte was at all times fully aware of its obligation to protect the personal and financial data of consumers, including Plaintiffs and members of the Class,” the 71-page suit reads. “Deloitte was also aware of the significant repercussions if it failed to do so.”
In a 52-page memo filed on May 27 in support of Deloitte’s motion to dismiss the case, the defense argued that the multibillion-dollar consultancy actually had no duties to the plaintiffs or any consumers, but to the state alone.
The memo signed by one of Deloitte’s attorneys, Jeffrey S. Brenner of Providence firm Nixon Peabody LLP, argues that the suit does not “allege any facts establishing a direct relationship between Deloitte and Plaintiffs — either through contract, commerce, or otherwise.”   
“Indeed, Plaintiffs do not even allege that they were aware at any point prior to the RIBridges Incident that Deloitte had a role in the Rhode Island State-managed RIBridges system, much less that they had any direct relationship with Deloitte at any point whatsoever,” the memo reads. 
Brenner concluded that Brain Cipher was the true source of the plaintiffs’ woes, and that the cyber gang’s actions were “specifically designed to subvert and evade Deloitte’s operation of the RIBridges system.”
“Thus, even if Plaintiffs were able to establish that Deloitte breached a duty of care, Brain Cipher’s criminal cyber-attack severs the causal chain and renders any alleged negligence on the part of Deloitte too ‘remote’ to give rise to liability,” the attorneys wrote. 
Because Brain Cipher was the ultimate source of injury, the attorneys argued, Deloitte could not be held accountable for the impact alleged by the plaintiffs. The defense was not too impressed by the extent of that impact either, writing that the complaint offered “no specific facts tying their alleged injuries to the RIBridges Incident.” 
In the case of one plaintiff who testified in court documents that he had lost irretrievable time dealing with the breach’s after-effects, the defense wrote that the plaintiff “fails to include any specific allegations of how his lost time would have been spent — and expressly alleges that it may have been used for ‘recreation.’”
“Moreover,” the memo adds, “the theory that they were damaged as a result of the RIBridges Incident is facially inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ own admission that thousands of data breaches occur every year that could just as likely be the cause of the alleged injuries.”

,DC,2025-09-12 17:48:52+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Appeals ruling threatens routine care access for Medicaid enrollees at Planned Parenthood,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-ruling-threatens-routine-care-access-medicaid-enrollees-planned-parenthood,,"WASHINGTON — Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the country began telling Medicaid patients Friday that their routine health care appointments will no longer be covered as a federal court order takes effect. The change, which could remain in place for months, if not longer, will likely impact the hundreds of thousands of Medicaid enrollees who go to Planned Parenthood clinics for health care not related to abortion. “This decision is devastating to patients here in the state and across this country. And it is compounding what is an already broken and overstretched health care system,” said Shireen Ghorbani, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. “We know that cancers will go undetected, STIs will go untreated.”Dominique Lee, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, said there is no plan for other health care providers to absorb the Medicaid enrollees. “There's no one waiting in the wings to take care of our patients,” Lee said. “Planned Parenthood is the safety net.”Planned Parenthood has identified at least 200 clinics out of about 600 that could close if they cannot treat Medicaid patients and receive reimbursements from the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some people with disabilities.“We are working, you know, feverishly with our colleagues and teams to mitigate that number,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. “We have to remember 50% of Planned Parenthood patients use Medicaid for their health care insurance. And so that is a very meaningful impact to the health centers that also rely on reimbursement in the same way every other single health care provider relies on reimbursement for the services provided.” GOP law targets Planned ParenthoodFederal law for decades has barred funding from going toward abortion services with limited exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress included a provision in their “big, beautiful” law that prevents Medicaid funding from going to certain health care organizations that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in reimbursements from the program during a recent fiscal year. The language, which originally applied for 10 years but was reduced to one year in the final version of the bill, appeared to specifically target Planned Parenthood. It prevents the organization from receiving any Medicaid funding for health care services unrelated to abortion, like annual physicals, cancer screenings and STI testing.Planned Parenthood quickly filed a lawsuit in the federal district court in Massachusetts in July, shortly after President Donald Trump signed the legislation.  A district court judge issued a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction that month, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing that one aspect of the law and allowing Medicaid patients to continue going to Planned Parenthood for routine health care services.On Thursday, a three-judge panel from the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court’s ruling, clearing the way for the Trump administration to stop reimbursing Planned Parenthood for Medicaid patients while the case continues. Peyton Humphreville, senior staff attorney at Planned Parenthood Federation of America and one of the lawyers handling the lawsuit, said on a call with reporters Friday the organization is evaluating all of its options but doesn’t expect additional rulings until later this year at the earliest. “The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals has entered a briefing schedule on the preliminary injunction appeal that will be fully briefed by mid-November,” Humphreville said. “From there, the court will schedule oral argument and will at some point after the oral argument rule on the preliminary injunction appeal.”",,,,2025-09-12 13:56:56.277236

“The next phase will include a comprehensive mission with the Tennessee National Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tennessee Highway Patrol, Memphis Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies, and we are working closely with the Trump Administration to determine the most effective role for each of these agencies to best serve Memphians,” Lee said in a statement released Friday afternoon.
Lee added he plans to speak with President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon to “work out details of the mission.”
Trump told Fox News that he plans to send federal troops into Memphis, after weeks of speculation and calls from state Republican officials for him to do so.

Trump said the Shelby County city was a “deeply troubled” and that the city’s Democratic mayor and Republican governor “were happy” for him to send in national guard troops like he did in Washington D.C.
The announcement comes days after Memphis Mayor Paul Young confirmed in a statement to MLK50, a Memphis nonprofit news outlet, that his office, Gov. Bill Lee’s and the Trump administration were considering sending troops to Tennessee’s most populous city. 
Young did not respond to a request for comment by the Lookout, but told MLK50 he was “committed to working to ensure any efforts strengthen our community and build on our progress.”
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said in a statement to the Lookout that Trump’s decision to send troops was “disappointing and anti-Democratic.”
“The president sending troops to Tennessee will interfere and have a chilling effect on Tennesseans’ ability to exercise critical freedoms, such as the freedom to protest and the liberty to travel,” Harris said. “We will do everything in our power to prevent this incursion.”
Two weeks ago, Gov. Bill Lee told reporters Memphis crime had dropped by 15% in the last year and that he had no plans to deploy the Tennessee National Guard to the city, only to reverse course a week later, saying that anything was possible. 










This is an abuse of power, using troops to score political points off of crime statistics, even though overall crime in Memphis is down to a 25-year low.


– Sen. Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis


A federal appeals court ruled that Trump’s decision to take over the National Guard and send troops into Los Angeles without the California governor’s permission was illegal. His administration is appealing the ruling. 
Trump also said he planned to deploy troops to Chicago but later backtracked. In Washington D.C., the president has more direct control of the presence of federal troops because the federal government reserves significant authority over governance of the city, which was established as a federal enclave separate from any of the states.
Tennessee’s state law says the governor can deploy the National Guard in an “invasion, disaster, insurrection, riot, attack, or combination to oppose the enforcement of the law by force and violence.” But the deployment can not exceed the extent of the emergency.
Stockard on the Stump: Tennessee House speaker wants “strike force” to hit Memphis gangs

“This is an abuse of power, using troops to score political points off of crime statistics, even though overall crime in Memphis is down to a 25-year low,” said Senate Minority Leader Raumesh Akbari, a Memphis Democrat. “That’s not leadership — that’s overreach.
The Lookout previously reported that Tennessee Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton favored sending federal and state troops to Memphis as a “strike force” to cut down on gang activity.
Rep. John Gillepsie, a Memphis Republican, said on social media he was “grateful” for the decision and that “arrests must be backed by tough prosecution and accountability in the courts.”
The last time the Tennessee National Guard was deployed to Memphis was in 1978, when a strike by city firefighters resulted in more than 100 fires throughout the city in a matter of days. Then-Mayor Wyeth Chandler declared a civil emergency, calling for a military presence and curfews for residents.
This is a developing story.

In January, New Mexico environment officials cited the base for a spill of wastewater containing firefighting foam with PFAS which soaked into the aquifer after a retaining pond leaked. (U.S. Air Force photo/Staff Sgt. Alex Mercer)In mid-July, Neil Dolly left Albuquerque near dawn and headed to Clovis. Under the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act, he and his co-workers with the New Mexico Environment Department have the authority to conduct surprise inspections of hazardous waste sites, take samples and shoot photos. 
Parked at a gas station near Cannon Air Force Base, Dolly called the base to confirm names and email addresses. About 30 minutes later, he emailed officials to say he was arriving. 
Once inside, base officials and attorneys told Dolly and his assistant they wouldn’t be allowed to collect soil and water samples to test for PFAS. According to Dolly, they cited ongoing litigation between the state and the Pentagon.
No one paying attention to New Mexico’s PFAS saga should be surprised that the military kept Dolly from doing his job. But we should all stay alert to how the U.S. government thwarts the ability — indeed, the right — of states to protect their lands, waters and people. 
Patented in the 1940s, PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances have been used since then in cookware, clothing, food wrappers, furniture and firefighting foams. The same qualities that make them useful — water and sunlight don’t destroy their molecules of joined carbon and fluorine atoms — also make them hard to clean up. Instead of breaking down over time, they move up the food chain, persisting in soils and waters and accumulating in the bodies of animals and humans. Some people refer to this toxic family as “forever chemicals.”
In 2018, the Air Force notified New Mexico officials that tests at Cannon — and Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo — detected perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Firefighting foams the military started using in the 1970s had contaminated groundwater with PFOA and PFOS, just two of the thousands of compounds in the PFAS family.  
When New Mexico called for cleanup, the U.S. Department of Defense sued, challenging the state’s authority. Currently, the state is part of a multi-district federal lawsuit seeking past and future clean-up costs and all natural resource damages at Cannon Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force Base, Kirtland Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range and Fort Wingate. And in June, the state filed another lawsuit, ordering the Pentagon to clean up the plume at Cannon under a new law that clarifies the state’s ability to regulate hazardous PFAS, even if the federal government has neglected to set standards for the chemicals. 
By now, the contaminated plume is roughly six miles long, and New Mexicans have spent about $12 million on litigation. We’ve spent millions more testing well water and residents’ blood and connecting rural Curry County residents to a public water system because they can’t safely drink their well water.
“I spend a lot of time battling the PFAS monster that is just omnipresent every day with some new filing or some new denial of access or whatever it is,” NMED Secretary James Kenney told me in an interview. “There is no single more recalcitrant polluter, that is more litigious, than the Department of Defense.” 
Kenney says he’s frustrated that the Pentagon keeps trampling the rights of states like New Mexico that are grappling with PFAS contamination. “Where is this notion of cooperative federalism, that states rights are supreme when implementing federal law?” he asks. “I feel like the Department of Defense is giving the middle finger salute to Congress, and they’re OK with it.”
Meanwhile, the toxic chemicals have traveled beyond Cannon into the Ogallala Aquifer, and into the blood of people working on and living near the base. A few years ago, Art Schaap, whose dairy farm overlooks Cannon, euthanized 3,500 cows because their blood — and milk — was poisoned. 
More recently, the state released test results for 628 people who worked on or lived near Cannon, all but two of whom had at least one type of PFAS in their blood, and more than 90% of whom tested positive for multiple types of the toxic chemicals. 
PFAS’ threat to human health is well known. 
Beginning in the 1960s, manufacturers like 3M and DuPont knew from testing workers and nearby water supplies that different PFAS chemicals caused reproductive and development problems; birth defects; liver and kidney disease; and immune system problems. Additional studies have linked exposure to high cholesterol, low infant birth weights, and certain cancers, along with thyroid and hormone disruption.
As a longtime environment reporter, I have witnessed generations of state officials try to protect public health and rein in legacy pollution from federal installations. Despite the massive amount of money American taxpayers invest in the Pentagon — more than a trillion dollars this year alone — the federal government continues to punt on cleanup and put people, and our precious waters, at risk. 
At Kirtland Air Force Base, for example, 24 million gallons of jet fuel leaked into the aquifer — and still hasn’t been cleaned up. Los Alamos National Laboratory has long polluted tributaries of the Rio Grande, and few people want to consider what lies in the sediment at the bottom of Cochiti Lake. At White Sands Test Facility, the U.S. Army and NASA have contaminated groundwater with multiple pollutants. Confirmed PFAS contamination also has been established at Fort Wingate Depot, the Santa Fe Army Aviation Support Facility, the Army National Guard’s Roswell Field Maintenance Shop and White Sands Missile Range. 
New Mexico will become increasingly arid, and our water challenges will only get tougher. We can all see the parched forests and fields, shallow reservoirs and drying riverbeds. We should also be clear-eyed about the legacy of federal pollution, and what all that contaminated water means for the state’s future. That is water lost to farms, families and the future. And the recently renamed U.S. Department of War isn’t likely to prioritize cleanup anytime soon.
As the federal government openly challenges — or just ignores — the authority of states to protect their own lands, waters and people, New Mexicans can’t be kept in the dark about what we face from legacy or emerging pollutants.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A study by Iowa State University researchers shows the viability of using bio-oils to plug abandoned oil wells, an application that could drive economic growth for Iowans with farm and forest waste.
ISU mechanical engineering professor Mark Mba-Wright led a “techno-economic assessment” of technology that uses oil created from plant waste to fill orphan oil wells, or abandoned wells that need to be filled in, and sequester carbon dioxide.
Mba-Wright, who has studied bio-oils and its applications for more than a decade, said he was surprised to learn about this use of the materials when the carbon removal company Charm Industrial reached out about conducting the study. The fossil fuel and biofuel industries aren’t usually mentioned in connection with one another, he said.
“We’ve collaborated before, but this was certainly a novel application that we hadn’t considered before,” Mba-Wright said.

Bio-oils are created through a process called pyrolysis, Mba-Wright said, where plant debris is burned quickly at very high temperatures, producing both oil and biochar, a solid byproduct. Bio-oils are most commonly blended with crude oil to make cleaner gasoline and diesel. But recently, Mba-Wright said researchers have started looking to include bio-oils in chemical cement mixtures.
Charm Industrial has already started using bio-oils to fill wells, Mba-Wright said, but reached out to the ISU professor to analyze the prospects of creating mobile units the would gather and process biomass, then transport the oil to a central hub before it is injected into a well. The mobile pyrolysis units would be around the size of a combine and sit behind farm equipment to collect leftovers from harvest.
“They have units in operation and contracts in place, but they wanted to understand what is the long-term potential of making these on-site, small-scale pyrolysis units,” Mba-Wright said. “And so we have process models and financial models that can evaluate some of the configurations that we’re interested in.”
A proposed plan included in the study would involve at least 200 mobile units, according to the report, each with a processing capacity of 10 tons a day. At that capacity and with the units using debris from corn harvests, also known as corn stover, the study stated 5.3 tons of bio-oil and 2.5 tons of biochar would be created per day.
These units would cost between $1-$2 million to build, Mba-Wright said, and the study stated bio-oil would need to reach a minimum base selling price of at least $175 per ton. Capital costs would decrease over time as more units are made, according to the study, and the plan stacks up in terms of cost and productivity against other methods of carbon sequestration, like direct air capture.
The study stated there were more than 123,000 documented orphaned oil and gas wells in the U.S., but there could be between 310,000 and 800,000 undocumented wells that have been abandoned.
“Iowa State’s experts showed that bio-oil sequestration using corn stover can deliver a high-value, durable carbon removal product that outcompetes other technologies, while providing new markets for crop residues and delivering new economic value to the rural economy,” said Charm Industrial co-founder and CEO Peter Reinhardt in an ISU news release. “As the carbon-removal sector grows, Charm is grateful to work with farm and forest communities to grow this opportunity.”
Mba-Wright said the research team and company are having “ongoing conversations” about further research into pyrolysis and bio-oil through the ISU Bioeconomy Institute, a university center focused on using biomass and other renewable resources for economic and social development.
In addition to trapping carbon that would have otherwise entered the atmosphere and plugging oil wells — which also leak emissions and can pose safety hazards — Mba-Wright said this use of biowaste could bring revenue and opportunities for new practices to Iowa farmers.
Corn stover is generally left to decay in the field, but Mba-Wright said farmers could earn money by letting the debris get picked up and turned into bio-oil. The biochar byproduct created through pyrolysis could go back to the farmer to be mixed in their soil. Mba-Wright said this could lower fertilizer costs and increase land values, but he said the team did not focus on these avenues in their recent work.
“It certainly adds value to a resource that’s underutilized in most fields,” Mba-Wright said.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Mainers will be able to access COVID vaccines without a prescription, according to new guidance issued by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention under Gov. Janet Mills’ direction.
This fall, the Food and Drug Administration only approved the shots for those at greatest risk for getting seriously ill from COVID, including seniors at least 65 years old or those who have health conditions. 
That means COVID vaccines aren’t broadly available to anyone ages 6 months and older anymore, which has been enforced in other states. 
Some national pharmacies, such as CVS, previously said they would only administer COVID-19 vaccines to people in Maine with prescriptions from their doctors, according to the Portland Press Herald. 
But the new order from Mills “serves as a prescription for all Maine people,” allowing them to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at pharmacies, clinics, and health care offices across the state without a prescription from their health care provider, according to an announcement from herMills’ office Friday afternoon. 
“I will not stand idly by while the Trump Administration makes it harder for Maine people to get a vaccine that protects their health and could very well save their life,” Mills said in a statement. “Through this standing order, we are stepping up to knock down the barriers the Trump Administration is putting in the way of the health and welfare of Maine people.”
The Maine Bureau of Insurance will also ensure that health insurance companies provide full coverage for COVID-19 vaccines without any cost sharing or prior authorization. MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, also covers COVID-19 vaccinations.
The availability of vaccines still remains under question despite the order. When Caitlin Gilmet, director for Maine Families for Vaccines and communications director for American Families for Vaccines, made an appointment last month for her family, including school-age children, to get the COVID vaccine this month, they received a notification that they needed to wait until the state was able to ensure that we’re able to get these vaccines.
“I’m super enthusiastic, both as a parent and a pro-vaccine advocate, to know that the governor’s office and Maine CDC acted so quickly to defend access to covid vaccines, especially with respiratory virus season starting and kids heading back to school,” she said.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump administration health officials have argued that most otherwise healthy, younger people have so much immunity that they don’t necessarily need annual boosters anymore. But according to guidance from several national medical and public health organizations, including the Maine CDC,  “vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe COVID-19.”

I’m pretty big on Jesus. I’m also pretty uncomfortable with the message on that T-shirt. I’ve seen it before. It has been a focus by a group of pastors in Rapid City for several years.
When I got home from mass, I Googled “This city belongs …” and my computer quickly filled in the “to Jesus” and led me to a page (thiscitybelongstojesus.com) listing past and upcoming rallies here in Rapid City committed to dedicating the city to Jesus.
There is also a “This City Belongs to Jesus” Facebook page, with an introduction that reads: “This page is dedicated to the church of Rapid City coming together under the name of Jesus.”

Now, I hate to state the obvious, but Rapid City is, as its name suggests, a city, not a church. It shouldn’t be seen as a church. It shouldn’t be managed like a church. It is a community of people with different beliefs — including those on religion — and a framework of businesses and services and government to support and hopefully benefit all of us.
As a city, not a church.
Christianity is certainly the dominant religion here in Rapid City, as it is throughout South Dakota. But we Christians don’t represent everyone. And we shouldn’t try to impose our religious views on everyone, or anyone.
Nor should a mayor who happens to also have worked as a Christian minister act as a minister first and a mayor second. I’m not saying our current mayor does that. I bring him up only because before he was mayor, Jason Salamun was executive pastor at Fountain Springs Church. Sometimes he still sounds like a pastor, which is OK, up to a point.
It’s fine for government officials to be informed by their religious beliefs. It’s not fine at all when they try to impose them on others.
I love the idea of Christ being central to our lives. I certainly try to make him central to mine. But not everybody does. Not everybody believes what I believe, or what Salamun believes.
That’s why it’s so important to keep some space between religion and government. And it’s why I worry when religious leaders start talking about “the church of Rapid City” and the city belonging to Jesus.
When I saw the woman’s T-shirt the other day, I had to wonder: “OK, but what about Jews? What about Muslims? What about Hindus? What about Buddhists? What about Wiccans? (Yes, there are Wiccans here). What about agnostics and atheists?”
And, especially, given where we live, what about Indigenous people? Of course, many are Christian. But many others practice their own Native American spirituality, worshipping a creator who has nothing to do with Jesus. Imagine how they might feel when they see people wearing the “This City Belongs to Jesus” T-shirt.
Rapid City belongs to all of us residents, of course. It belongs to the rule of law, the state Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.
Christians or not, we are all citizens of the same city, with the same rights and challenges and the same hopes and dreams for ourselves and our families. And we can all call this city our own.
This is a city issue that is also a state issue and a national issue. The promoters of Christian nationalism seek a dangerous convergence of government and religion. Christian religion, of course.
But this is a nation where our many freedoms are intended to include protection for those with different religious beliefs — or none at all — from a potentially oppressive religious majority.
We have seen what happens in other countries where religion and government become one. We should never want that here.
So when it comes to message T-shirts, I’d much prefer one that reads: “My heart belongs to Jesus, but my city belongs to everyone.”
That one I’d wear.

Proposition, or “prop,” betting is legal in Connecticut, but it is tightly regulated, especially when college sports are involved. 
Prop bets let people wager on specific in-game events, such as which team scores first, rather than simply who wins.
Connecticut authorized sports wagering in 2021. The Department of Consumer Protection allows prop betting on professional sports and most college games, but there are restrictions for in-state college teams such as UConn or Yale. Bettors cannot place prop wagers on individual Connecticut college athletes and cannot bet on single games involving in-state colleges. The only exception is for approved intercollegiate tournaments with at least four teams, and even then bets must cover the overall tournament outcome, not individual games.
Connecticut law also bans novelty prop bets, including wagers on the Super Bowl coin toss, halftime show, or similar entertainment outcomes, regardless of the event’s location.

Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star.A progressive coalition of 20 Maine organizations opposed the nomination of a federal judge from Maine to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, citing his opposition of reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights, and history of defending large corporations.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination of Portland-based lawyer Joshua Dunlap to the Boston-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which covers Maine. Republican Sen. Susan Collins supported the nomination, saying Dunlap’s “professionalism and experience … make him an excellent choice for the First Circuit.” That court is the only one of the 13 federal appeals courts with no current judges appointed by Republican presidents.
On Friday, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England joined Equality Maine, Maine Women’s Lobby and Our Power Maine in urging Collins to vote against Dunlap, citing his anti-reproductive rights and anti-LGBTQ+ stances, including public opposition to marriage equality and support for fetal personhood. They criticized his record of consistently siding with large corporations over the interests of Maine residents and his affiliation with the Alliance Defending Freedom, designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Dunlap is currently a partner in the Portland law firm Pierce Atwood, and co-chairs its Appellate & Amici team. Two decades ago, Dunlap interned for the Alliance Defending Freedom, and when asked about it in a judiciary committee hearing in July, called ADF “a highly successful law firm.”
“Mainers need judges who reflect their views, especially in this moment when we are seeing the key role that the judiciary, courts and individual judges play in upholding democratic principles and constitutional rights in our fragile democracy,” said Lily James, advocacy coordinator for Maine Women’s Lobby.
“We are gravely concerned that, if confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Dunlap will become yet another judge who uses his position to take the side of banks, insurance companies and other corporations, instead of reflecting the values of Mainers and protecting the rights of individuals.”
National advocacy group Accountable.us also flagged Dunlap’s nomination, saying “Dunlap’s nomination is part of President Trump’s campaign to capture the courts with judges hand picked for their loyalty to Trump, instead of their commitment to the Constitution.”
“Joshua Dunlap has an alarming record of advancing anti-choice laws that would take fundamental freedoms away from Americans,” said President Caroline Ciccone. “His extreme ideological advocacy to gut reproductive freedom is out of step with the vast majority of Americans and calls into question his ability to rule impartially on the bench.”
Dunlap did not respond to requests for comment.
Opposition to reproductive rights
When reproductive health care providers are already fighting in federal courts to be able to continue providing care to millions of patients and LGBTQ+ rights under attack, “it is more essential than ever that the court serve as a neutral arbiter and that they maintain the ability to make decisions without bias or prejudice,” said Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.
“The fact is, the statements that Mr. Dunlap has made over the years are deeply at odds with the values of Maine people and the rights they hold dear, and we have grave concern for his ability to be impartial on matters literal, matters of life and death, on which he has taken such extreme and public positions,” she said.
Accountable.us pointed to testimonies and articles by Dunlap, including a 2015 testimony in favor of a bill proposing a parental consent requirement for minors seeking abortions in 2015, where he said that doctors were financially incentivized to encourage young people to terminate their pregnancies, and stated that parental consent requirements were about protecting minors from abuse rather than providing an additional roadblock to abortion. 
In 2017, he signed onto a testimony supporting a Maine fetal personhood bill saying it was  “purely and simply” about ensuring justice in instances of wrongful death of a fetus. Opponents of the bill said that Maine law already provided avenues for legal action in such cases, and said that the bill could lead to abortion restrictions down the line. Neither bill ultimately passed.
Opposing marriage equality  
Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine, said Dunlap’s actions and words “indicate that he would rule against non discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people, and roll back marriage equality.”
In an op ed in 2012, Dunlap publicly opposed marriage equality in Maine, complaining about supporters of marriage equality stealing opposing signs. 
“[Marriage equality] supporters vigorously assert that redefining marriage will not affect our rights,” he said in a letter to the editor.
“Yet … supporters have engaged in a concerted campaign to trample free speech by stealing signs. Their criminal behavior tells you everything you need to know about their commitment to freedom.”
He has been dismissive of same sex marriage supporters constitutional arguments, and suggested that he believes LGBTQ+ rights are inherently at odds with religious liberty, Drew said. As a lawyer and legal commentator, Dunlap has repeatedly fought for expansive religious exemptions that would allow people and institutions to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, claiming that religious motivation should be a valid legal defense.
“Dunlap has made clear that he prioritizes ideology over equality and justice,” Drew said. 
“His appointment would put LGBTQ+ people rights at risk, not only in the First Circuit, but across the country, undermining the court’s ability to safeguard the rights of marginalized people and women.”
Supporting big corporations 
Seth Berry, executive director of Our Power, cited examples where Dunlap supported Central Maine Power in overturning a voter-approved measure banning foreign governments and companies with 5% or more foreign government ownership from donating to state referendum races. The law was one of a handful around the country attempting to limit foreign influence on U.S. elections, but CMP’s parent company filed lawsuits to block its application. 
He also defended pharmaceutical companies in opioid cases, represented oil companies accused of climate deception, and sided with banks in foreclosure disputes. Berry argued that Dunlap’s confirmation would serve corporate interests at the expense of Mainers, urging senators not to support his nomination.
“If confirmed, Joshua Dunlap will be a blank check for corporate oligarchy,” he said. 
“U.S. senators who support him will sign the check, but the bills will be paid by Maine people.”

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)The U.S. Department of Justice is sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens, the Trump administration confirmed.
The data sharing comes after Justice Department attorneys this summer demanded that election officials in nearly two dozen states turn over their voter lists, alarming some Democratic state secretaries of state and election experts. They have voiced fears about how the Trump administration planned to use the data. Even some Republican secretaries of state have declined to provide their full voter lists.
Homeland Security in an unsigned statement to Stateline called information sharing essential to “scrub aliens from voter rolls” and said the federal government was “finally doing what it should have all along — sharing information to solve problems.”
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

“This collaboration with the DOJ will lawfully and critically enable DHS to prevent illegal aliens from corrupting our republic’s democratic process and further ensure the integrity of our elections nationwide. Elections exist for the American people to choose their leaders, not illegal aliens,” the statement reads.
The Justice Department said in its own statement that state voter roll data provided in response to requests from the department’s Civil Rights Division is “being screened for ineligible voter entries.”
Noncitizen voting is extremely rare. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
The data sharing marks a next step in President Donald Trump’s efforts to exert more federal influence over state-administered elections. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year that sought to require individuals to provide proof-of-citizenship documents to register to vote, a rule quickly blocked in federal court. He has also threatened to sign another executive order attempting to restrict mail ballots.
At least 10 states have either provided publicly available data or given the department directions on how to request public data. It’s unclear whether any state has turned over voter data with all information the Trump administration is seeking.
While the administration didn’t describe how Homeland Security will use the voter rolls to search for noncitizens, the agency operates a powerful program, Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, that can identify the immigration or citizenship status of an individual.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if officials upload the data.
In the past, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm U.S. citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information.
As the Justice Department has sought state voter rolls this summer, letters from the department’s attorneys to state officials in many instances have demanded full lists of registered voters that include sensitive personal information such as driver license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. At least 22 states were asked for some data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which is tracking the requests.
Some states have turned over publicly available voter files or offered directions on how to request them. Others have flat-out refused the requests.
“The Department of Justice hasn’t shown any good reason for its fishing expedition for sensitive voter information on every American,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, said in a news release Monday announcing that her office had rejected the Justice Department’s second request for her state’s voter data.
Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, said that he has no confidence that Homeland Security would act carefully with any data received.
Levitt, speaking with Stateline on Wednesday before the data sharing was confirmed, voiced concern that the Justice Department was “serving as a stalking horse” for other entities within the government.
“The fact that they’re having to sneak through the back door rather than knocking on the front door tells you that there’s improper procedures going on,” Levitt said.

University of Iowa
Brent Gage, UI associate vice president for enrollment management, said in a news release the university received more than 31,000 first-year student applications ahead of the fall 2025 semester, a record-breaking number.
Of the 5,561 first-year students enrolled at the UI this fall — the university’s second-largest incoming class in its history — 2,879 are state residents and 1,260 come from rural areas. The university reported in the release new students are moving to Iowa City from 93 Iowa counties, 47 U.S. states and territories and 37 countries.
Around one-fifth of the population identified themselves as first-generation students, according to the release, and the class’s average grade-point average came in at 3.86.
Total enrollment at the UI for this fall is 31,563, including 23,407 undergraduates, 6,269 graduate students and 1,887 professional students. Nearly 3,140 medical residents and postdoctoral students call the UI home as well.
“Interest in attending the University of Iowa has never been greater, and this group of students represents talented students from Iowa, across the nation, and around the world,” Gage said in the release. “We are excited to welcome one of the largest first-year classes that we have ever had as they join the Hawkeye community this fall.”
Iowa State University
ISU total enrollment numbers have grown for the third straight year, according to a news release from the university, supported by the incoming class and high second-year retention. The university’s incoming class hit 6,160 this fall, its fifth year in a row of growing first-year cohorts and the largest class ISU has seen since 2016.
More than half of the incoming class are Iowans, according to the release, and all 99 Iowa counties and all 50 U.S. states are represented among new students, as well as 110 countries.
Just over 20% of new students are first-generation, 22% identified as Pell-eligible and 80% are receiving some form of financial aid through scholarships or grants. Nearly three-quarters of 26,346 undergraduate students are receiving financial aid.
The class of 2029 enrolled at ISU with an average ACT score of 25 and grade-point average of 3.76. More than half of the 1,351 transfer students attending ISU this fall came from state community colleges, the release stated.
Of the 31,105 students enrolled at ISU, 4,116 are graduate students and 643 are studying professional veterinary medicine.
“We are proud of the continued growth in enrollment,” said Katharine Johnson Suski, interim associate vice president for enrollment management and executive director of admissions and new student programs, in the release. “That growth reflects our commitment to serving the state with more students from Iowa high schools and community colleges choosing Iowa State.”
University of Northern Iowa
UNI’s sesquicentennial class totals 1,549 students, according to a news release, the third year in a row the university topped 1,500 with its incoming cohorts. Despite increases in new undergraduate and graduate students, bringing their totals to 7,800 and 1,404, respectively, its total enrollment of 9,204 fell short of last year’s total of 9,283.
More than 90% of incoming students are from Iowa, the release stated, representing all 99 counties. The new class also includes students from 42 U.S. states and 53 countries.
“We couldn’t be more excited to welcome our 150th class of UNI students to campus,” said UNI President Mark Nook in the release. “We are particularly encouraged that the numbers of our incoming freshmen, transfers and new graduate students have all increased compared to last year.”
Nearly 75% of new transfer students are coming to UNI from a community college through the UNI@IACC program, a partnership between the Cedar Falls university and Iowa community colleges to ease transfers between the institutions. According to the release, enrollment in the program has grown from 252 students after its launch in 2022 to 539 in 2025. Since its inception, the release stated 348 students have graduated from the program.
UNI also saw increased interest from states bordering Iowa this year, a result the release attributes to the college’s neighboring state tuition rate program, which offers in-state tuition to students applying from Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nebraska, South Dakota and Missouri.

Because program was conceived in response to a big stink about elk numbers and damage, Game and Fish commissioner is 'shocked' by the absence of claims. 
The post No one is using a controversial compensation program for grass lost to overpopulated Wyoming elk appeared first on WyoFile .","There’s been virtually no interest in a new state program to provide financial relief to stockgrowers whose rangelands are grazed by overpopulated elk herds, according to Wyoming wildlife officials. 
The payment program’s slow uptake took some members of the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission by surprise at a Tuesday meeting in Lander. 
“I guess I’m shocked,” Ken Roberts said.
The Game and Fish commissioner from Kemmerer noted the “urgency” portrayed by “a lot of folks” who were “adamant that this had to be done.” Most of the pressure for the compensation came from landowners who’ve struggled to run cattle amid overpopulated elk herds in central and eastern Wyoming.

Game and Fish’s deputy chief of wildlife, Craig Smith, led the conversation and was quick to note that zero claims were filed in the first year of the new policy. Some landowners had inquired about how it works, he said.
Adjustments to Game and Fish’s compensation for “extraordinary damage to rangelands” trace back to summer 2023, when there was a tense Wyoming legislative meeting about elk damage. The following legislative session, the Agriculture Committee brought an unsuccessful but controversial bill that would have mandated compensation rates for grass on dry rangeland lost to elk inside overpopulated big game herd units. Then in fall 2024, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission voluntarily updated its compensation regulations in an effort to placate ranchers and keep lawmakers at bay.  
The compensation plan is specific to non-cultivated livestock rangeland, and there are several requirements: 

Landowners can receive “extraordinary damage to grass” funds when a big game herd is overpopulated by 20% or more for three or more consecutive years and the species is consuming 15% or more of the estimated forage on private ground. (Payments are still possible when herds are not overpopulated if more than 30% of the forage is being consumed.)
Landowners must also allow a “sufficient number of hunters” on the property. That means the necessary number of hunters to offset the “recruitment,” or the number of animals born into the population that survived one year. 

When the new rules were being vetted with the public, they proved widely unpopular with sportspeople — 46 of the 48 public comments on the draft regulation that stated a position opposed the new payment program. The unpopularity stemmed partly from worries that the damage claims could exacerbate an emerging Game and Fish budget crunch. 
“It was supposed to be a substantial amount,” Roberts told WyoFile. 
Although perplexing, the lack of interest is also a relief, he said: “I’m glad to hear it.”

Wyoming Stock Growers Association lobbyist Jim Magagna, who was a major proponent of the legislation and Game and Fish policy change, shared the view.
“I’m certainly glad it didn’t result in a flood of demands for compensation that would overwhelm the available funds,” he said. 
Magagna partly attributed the absence of claims to unfamiliarity with the new funding stream. 
“Landowners are not yet fully aware of that opportunity,” Magagna told WyoFile. “As an organization, we try to keep people aware of things, but we certainly didn’t put anything out encouraging people to apply for damages— it’s an individual decision.”
Wyoming Game and Fish, he added, has also come through in helping frustrated ranchers address overpopulated elk herds via other efforts. 
“The Game and Fish have been responsive with granting licenses to landowners, and they’re even bringing in professional hunters to remove elk,” Magagna said. “If the wildlife populations can be appropriately managed and the claims go away, that’s better for everyone.”

(Courtesy of The Playing Field)Federal judges in Rhode Island and Washington have blocked the Trump administration from excluding people without legal immigration status from a group of federal programs, including Head Start early childhood education.
On Wednesday, a federal judge in Rhode Island halted a broad array of rules based on the new immigration restrictions from taking effect. Wisconsin was one of 21 states and the District of Columbia to join that lawsuit.  
Reuters reported that a White House statement said the administration expected a higher court to reverse the decision.
On Thursday, a federal judge in the state of Washington ordered the Trump administration to pause a requirement that Head Start early childhood education programs exclude families without legal immigration status. That ruling came in a case brought by Head Start groups in four states, including Wisconsin.
Head Start programs were included in a broader federal directive that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued July 10 listing federally funded “public benefits” that must exclude immigrants without legal status under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.
Certain programs, such as Medicaid, have been required to verify lawful immigration status for participants. But since 1998, the federal government has considered a range of programs exempt that are generally open to all in a community, according to Reuters.
The July HHS order revoked the 1998 policy and closed the door to immigrants lacking legal status for Head Start along with a collection of programs providing mental health and substance abuse treatment, job training and other assistance.
On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy issued a preliminary injunction that halted orders from HHS as well as the departments of Education, Labor and Justice based on the policy shift.
“The Government’s new policy, across the board, seems to be this: ‘Show me your papers,'” McElroy wrote in her order.
McElroy wrote that the administration acted “in a rushed way, without seeking comment from the public or interested parties,” likely violating the federal Administrative Procedures Act.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez issued a temporary restraining order directing HHS not to apply the immigration restriction to Head Start programs.
Head Start programs have never been required to determine the immigration status of families in the program since it started nearly 60 years ago, according to Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.
The Wisconsin association joined the lawsuit against the HHS order filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of Head Start programs in the states of Washington, Illinois and Pennsylvania as well as advocacy groups in California and Oregon.
“This ruling affirms what we know to be both right within the law and right for communities,” Mauer told the Wisconsin Examiner on Friday. “Keeping eligible Head Start Families in the program is the best outcome for Wisconsin. Kids are safer and it keeps Wisconsin working.”
Martinez wrote in a 26-page opinion focused on the Head Start portion in the HHS order that harms the plaintiffs warned of “are not merely speculative.” Martinez was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed in 2004.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs told the court that a Wisconsin Head Start program reported at least four families withdrew after the federal directive was issued. Several Pennsylvania programs reported withdrawals, one reported that it expects to have to close and another said it will have to close one of its rooms due to a drop in enrollment.
The plaintiffs’ arguments “detail confusion on how to comply with the Directive, how to verify immigration status, who status is based on, whether non-profits are exempt, difficulties in recruiting and families obtaining proper documentation, and the families’ overall fear that reporting immigration status will result in a choice between family safety and a child’s education,” Martinez wrote.
The directive has unclear guidance and has had a “chilling effect” on programs as well as on families who have relied on Head Start, resulting “in the immediate harm of childhood education loss” and “leading to long-term harms in development,” he wrote. “It also results in parents losing childcare, risking missed work, unemployment, forced dropouts, and inability to pay life expenses and support families.”

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)The Indiana Parole Board will hold clemency hearings later this month for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward, whose execution is scheduled for Oct. 10 at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. 
The board announced this week that the five-member panel will conduct a clemency interview hearing at the prison on Friday, Sept. 19 at 10 a.m. Central Time.
A public clemency hearing will follow on Monday, Sept. 22, at the Indiana Government Center South Auditorium in Indianapolis. Testimony in support of clemency will be allowed from 9 to 11 a.m., followed by testimony in opposition from 1 to 3 p.m.
Ward, 44, was sentenced to death after he pleaded guilty to the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County. His case has played out through state and federal courts for more than two decades. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2017.
Execution moves forward as questions linger around Indiana’s lethal injection drugs

In late August, the Indiana Supreme Court finalized his October execution date after denying his latest appeal.
The clemency process is one of the final steps available for prisoners to avoid a death sentence. 
The Parole Board hears arguments from attorneys, victims’ families and execution supporters before issuing a recommendation to the governor. 
The governor alone has the power to commute a death sentence to life in prison, grant a reprieve or deny clemency altogether. 
Earlier this year, the board followed the same process for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, ahead of his scheduled execution. Following several hours of hearings, the parole board ultimately — unanimously — recommended against clemency for Benjamin Ritchie, and Gov. Mike Braun allowed his execution to proceed.
Ward’s legal counsel is continuing to raise questions about Indiana’s lethal injection procedures and has repeatedly pressed for records detailing the state’s supply of pentobarbital — the drug used in executions — especially about its quality and whether it has expired.
The inmate’s defense team said they also plan to pursue additional legal challenges in state and federal courts in the weeks leading up to the execution.
Braun said earlier this month that Indiana’s Department of Correction does not yet have the necessary execution drugs in hand.
When asked about the state’s drug supply, the governor reiterated that Indiana is taking steps to ensure doses do not expire before use.

MONTPELIER — The U.S. Department of Justice this week asked Vermont to hand over sensitive personal information on all of the state’s registered voters, Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas said Friday.
The secretary also said she intends to reject the justice department’s request. That’s in line with public statements she made last month, after her office received a separate but related inquiry from the feds about the possibility of information-sharing.
Copeland Hanzas’ office received a letter from the department’s civil division on Monday asking it to furnish the voter data, she said.
The secretary said her office is working with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office to draft a formal reply, which she expects to send soon.

A federal judge in July ruled Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding as the nation’s largest abortion provider fights Trump’s administration over efforts to defund the organization in his signature tax legislation.
Medicaid is a government health care program that serves millions of low-income and disabled Americans. Nearly half of Planned Parenthood’s patients rely on Medicaid.
A provision in Trump’s tax bill instructed the federal government to end Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, even to those like Planned Parenthood that also offer medical services like contraception, pregnancy tests and STD testing.
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its member organizations in Massachusetts and Utah filed a lawsuit in July against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“While the Trump administration wants to rip away reproductive freedom, we’re here to say loud and clear: we will not back down,” Dominique Lee, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts said in a statement. “This is not over.”
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to an online request for comment.
Planned Parenthood said Thursday’s ruling means that more than 1.1 million patients can’t use their Medicaid insurance at its health centers. That also puts as many as 200 of those health centers at risk of closure, Planned Parenthood said in a statement.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
Chris Winters, commissioner of the Vermont Department for Children and Families, plans to step down. 
Instead, he is set to become deputy commissioner of the Department of Labor on Sept. 22, Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday in a press release. 
Scott also appointed Rick Hildebrant to lead the Department of Health. Hildebrant works as the chief medical information officer and medical director of hospital medicine at Rutland Regional Medical Center. His appointment takes effect Oct. 13. 
Hildebrant replaces Mark Levine, the face of Vermont’s Covid-19 response, who retired in March. 
“Even as public health leadership faces challenges nationally, Vermont has consistently demonstrated that collaboration, science, and community can chart a different course,” Hildebrant said in the release. 
Winters, who previously served as deputy secretary of state, took over DCF in 2023 after an unsuccessful bid to become secretary of state. Sandi Hoffman, deputy commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, is slated to take over for Winters in an interim capacity at the department, which, among other responsibilities, oversees economic benefits, some social services and child welfare. 
In the release, Scott thanked Winters for his “steady leadership.” 
DCF’s top position is widely considered one of the most difficult in state government, and Winters has faced challenges during his tenure. 
The department oversees Vermont’s motel voucher program, which puts unhoused residents in motel rooms across the state. The program is a lightning rod for lawmakers and Scott, and as it’s downsized, Winters’ department has taken flak for the waves of motel evictions that pushed people to live outside. 
In January, the ACLU of Vermont sued DCF for allegedly tracking the pregnancies of Vermonters deemed “high-risk” and seeking custody of an unborn child. That litigation remains ongoing. 
At the Department of Labor, Winters will work under Kendal Smith, who previously served as deputy commissioner and interim commissioner, and whom Scott appointed in an official capacity Friday.

Members of a task force appointed by the Kansas State Board of Education to consider solutions to deaf education […],"Kansas deaf education task force member Kylie Stewart, center, said the state needed to address the teacher shortage in deaf education. She said the School for the Deaf student deficits in reading and math assessments needed to be a priority of the Kansas State Board of Education and the Kansas Legislature. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — Lack of a Kansas-based bachelor’s degree program to prepare specialists in teaching of deaf or hard of hearing students complicates the challenge of hiring fully qualified staff at the Kansas School for the Deaf.
Members of a task force appointed by the Kansas State Board of Education to consider solutions to deaf education issues also say uncompetitive salaries at the state’s school for 150 elementary and secondary students in Olathe made it challenging to attract educators once they’ve completed bachelor’s or master’s degrees in other states.
One member of the task force, which met at the School for the Deaf on Thursday to work on reform recommendations, said it was time the state Board of Education amended unrealistic licensing standards that made it too arduous for people drawn to the field of deaf education to secure mandated graduate-level credentials.
“The real-world impact of that is KSD can’t find teachers,” said Zach Wentz, a task force member representing School for the Deaf parents. “As a result they don’t do performance reviews the way that they’re supposed to and, so actually, you have teachers who shouldn’t be here because they’re not being held accountable. You’re motivating the school to make that decision because they know they can’t replace them if they get rid of them.”
Members of the task force likewise suggested Kansas begin subsidizing tuition and fees for students enrolled in deaf education programs.
In addition, task force members said, the state could pay stipends to out-of-state student teachers who would complete that undergraduate obligation at School for the Deaf and possibly remain in Kansas to take these hard-to-fill special education jobs.
Only 165 of the state’s 36,000 licensed classroom teachers hold a license for deaf education, according to the Kansas Department of Education.
“If that’s your kid sitting in that classroom, you’re thinking, can the state not figure out a way to simplify this a little bit but still ensure that teachers have their skills? That almost seems like a no-win situation right now with the teacher shortage,” said Kylie Stewart, a task force member and a college special education instructor.
She said changes need to be made to improve reading and math assessment scores for students enrolled there.
Luanne Barron, superintendent of the School for the Deaf, said 57% of the current staff at the school had dual licenses to teach in the education field and to instruct deaf students. The remainder of the school’s staff lacked a portion of that licensing package, she said, but were allowed to provide instruction on a temporary basis.
“One thing that I think that Kansas really needs to invest the time and energy into is … identifying a university who will take the lead and house a deaf ed program,” Barron said.
She said the University of Kansas’ decision to phase out its deaf education degree in 2019 after a long period of declining enrollment took away a cadre of students who could complete student teaching requirements at School for the Deaf.
“The last few years,” she said, “we haven’t had anybody come as a student teacher.”
Shane Carter, director of teacher licensing in the Kansas State Department of Education, told the task force that establishing a bachelor’s degree in deaf education at a Kansas college or university was a “very sound” strategy.
He pushed back on the idea Kansas education licensure standards were driving the shortage of deaf education professionals in the state.
To help fill the more immediate teacher gap, the School for the Deaf superintendent said, Kansas should consider authorizing the awarding of certificates in deaf education after completion of a certain number of specialized courses. Or, she said, the state could allow individuals to take a comprehensive exam to demonstrate proficiency in the instruction of deaf students.
“The problem is convincing universities to set up some sort of certificate program, while also convincing the (state) Board of Education to accept it. You have to do both,” Barron said.
Lisa Karney, the task force chair who holds master’s degrees in special education and deaf education, said it would be a mistake to make changes that compromised academic rigor of teacher preparation requirements.
In part, she said, her hesitancy to embrace sweeping licensing changes reflected the immersive educational demands placed on teachers at the School for the Deaf.
“It’s crucial that you keep the rigor,” Karney said. “There’s the whole spectrum that has to be looked at and offered and taught.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wentz-Stewart-Carter-deaf-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-12 11:58:28.437606

Harvests from the Calcasieu River, where shrimp migrate each year to spawn, have declined for decades as chemical plants and refineries located farther upstream have polluted the Calcasieu, making it one of the country’s most endangered rivers.
Catches dropped even further in recent years and Mallett, along with an increasingly vocal group of fishermen, has theories about why.
It’s “because of the … darn plant,” said Mallett, a slight but sinewy 63-year-old with a grey goatee and the image of Jesus wearing a crown of thorns tattooed on his forearm.
The plant he’s referring to is Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass, a sprawling 432-acre liquefied natural gas terminal at the mouth of the Calcasieu River. The export terminal has loaded hundreds of ocean-going vessels with LNG fuel since operations began in 2022, helping to make the U.S. the world’s largest exporter of LNG. But the facility also brought noise and pollution; according to local fishermen, the industrial activity drives off shrimp.
“The shrimp don’t want to cross that barrier for some reason,” Mallett said.
“If there’s not many that come in to spawn, to have babies that go back out, you’re gonna get less and less each year,” Mallett added. “And that’s exactly what happened.”

Jeffrey Plumlee, a researcher at Louisiana State University and a fisheries extension specialist for Louisiana Sea Grant, said much remains unknown about the impact of the construction and operation of the terminals.
“The impact of LNG, specifically, these plants, has not been measured,” Plumlee said. “We don’t really have any great answers.”
Phillip Dyson grew up fishing alongside Mallett. He quit school at 13 to become a shrimper and has fished the inland waters of the Calcasieu River for the past 50 years. Before the plant was built, his boat brought in $125,000 to $175,000 per year. In 2023, Dyson said he made less than half that. Last year, he barely made enough to survive.
“Every year it drops and drops,” said Dyson, 63, standing next to one of his family’s shrimp boats, Papa’s Shadow, which is overdue for repainting and maintenance that Dyson says he can no longer afford. “If it wasn’t for Social Security, I’d go bankrupt.”

An average of 1.5 million pounds of shrimp were harvested from the Calcasieu Basin each year between 2015 and 2024, according to Peyton Cagle, the marine fisheries operations program manager for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. The figure dropped to just 750,000 pounds in 2024, or half of the 10-year average, he said.
However, Cagle said the changes in the harvest cannot be attributed to a single cause.
“Lower dockside prices, increased expenses, market competition from imported shrimp, and a reduction in the fleet are some of the reasons for the decline in landings,” Cagle said in a written statement.
While shrimp harvests were down 50% in the Calcasieu Basin in 2024, they also declined by an average of nearly 30% across all of coastal Louisiana last year, Cagle added.

Venture Global is now building Calcasieu Pass 2, a second LNG terminal adjacent to its existing facility, which will have double the export capacity. The plant is part of a massive expansion of new LNG terminals along the Gulf Coast, which will more than double America’s already world-leading export capacity.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas projects and has approved more than 99 percent of all project applications in recent decades, authorized construction for Calcasieu Pass 2 in June 2024.
However, the decision wasn’t unanimous.
The project’s adverse environmental and local economic impacts “are so great that I am compelled to find that approving the project is inconsistent with the public interest,” Allison Clements, a former FERC commissioner, wrote in her dissent just days before her four-year term at the agency ended.
“The Order improperly discounts impacts to commercial fishing businesses, which will likely be significant,” Clements added.
Dredging near the terminal is a primary concern noted in FERC’s Environmental Impact Statement for the project.
Approximately 6.4 million cubic yards of material — enough to fill 1,957 Olympic-sized swimming pools — will be excavated to create deep water berths for LNG vessels to dock and turn around at the terminal, according to the commission’s assessment.

Dredging would kick up sediment in the water, which may affect the health of shrimp, fish and other marine species by clogging their gills and reducing dissolved oxygen levels, according to the report.
Environmental advocates and state regulators have expressed concern about dredging, particularly during the migration periods for fish and shrimp, which coincide with the spring and fall commercial shrimp harvesting seasons.
In a March 2023 letter to the commission, Randell Myers, an assistant secretary with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked if Venture Global would consider limiting dredging activity to times of year that would not interfere with migration periods for shrimp and other species, as well as commercial fishing.
In its final assessment, FERC noted that the company didn’t anticipate any pauses on dredging during seasonal migration periods. The commission stated that doing so would leave the dredged area exposed to “tidal, wind, and wave action” over a longer period, potentially several months, which could exacerbate sedimentation issues.
Michael Tritico, a former coastal zone manager for southwest Louisiana tasked with protecting and developing the region’s natural resources and an environmental advocate, said not pausing during key migration periods is “the cheap way out.”
“It’s inconvenient and costs more to have the work crew leave and come back later,” Tritico said. “It’s an economic thing, and it’s not a logical scientific argument.”
Venture Global did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Plumlee said shrimp are often referred to as a “year crop” in that they live for approximately one year and their population is replenished annually. Each female shrimp releases up to a million eggs. If even a small portion of the estuary’s shrimp population can migrate in and out of the river mouth, the population will likely remain stable over time, he said.
As long as the resources juvenile shrimp need to develop, including good marsh habitat, tidal water flows and food, remain, “then I foresee them recovering quickly.”
Environmental advocates said the increased ship traffic from additional LNG terminals, not counting any disruptions from the facilities themselves, will have lasting impacts from which the shrimp may never recover.
Venture Global has plans for Calcasieu Pass 3, a third LNG export terminal at the mouth of the Calcasieu River with potential export capacity nearly equal to that of its first two terminals combined. In addition, Commonwealth LNG, an export terminal on the opposite bank of the Calcasieu River from Venture Global’s facilities, received final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy on Aug. 29 and may soon begin construction. Each of these facilities will draw massive oceangoing vessels to the rivermouth.
“They want to [add] six, seven, eight more ships every day,” said James Hiatt, founder of For a Better Bayou, a local environmental and community advocacy organization. “What you’ll have is just an insane amount of ship traffic in a place that is feeling effects of the traffic we already have. At what point is enough enough?”

In February 2023, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory committee to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, sent a letter to state and federal agencies responsible for permitting Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG export terminal, warning about the potential impact of this and other proposed LNG terminals.
“This is a radical transformation of the Louisiana coast,” the letter, signed by Acy Cooper, then chairman of the task force and a commercial shrimper, stated. “If successful, this construction and expansion will destroy the shrimping community in Cameron Parish and have serious consequences throughout the State.”
The letter ended with a warning. If the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries waits to assess the damage from gas export facilities until after they are constructed, it “will be far too late.”
Cagle, of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, said the agency conducts biweekly or monthly monitoring of shrimp abundance and size and has not seen “any alarming reductions” since construction of Calcasieu Pass and Calcasieu Pass 2 began.

If the department notices any impacts after Calcasieu Pass 2 is constructed, they would initiate an impact analysis at that time, Cagle said.
Since writing the letter, the task force, as well as the Louisiana Shrimp Association, an industry group also headed by Cooper, have focused more on the issue of low-cost shrimp imported to the U.S. from aquaculture farms in Asia.
Imports began in large numbers in the 1990s and have continued to climb, reaching 93 percent of all shrimp consumed in the U.S. in 2024, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, causing a steep and decades-long decline in the price of U.S.-caught shrimp, according to a federal fisheries report published in August.
The Shrimp Association praised a 50% tariff the Trump administration placed on imports from India, the largest importer of shrimp to the U.S, on Aug. 27. However, the group didn’t comment when President Trump issued an executive order in January lifting a Biden administration pause on U.S. Department of Energy permits for new LNG export terminals, including Calcasieu Pass 2.
LNG terminals require federal approval from FERC and the DOE. A DOE permit for Venture Global’s new facility was issued in March, which, along with FERC approval in May, allowed for construction to begin.
Cooper said the LNG issue hasn’t been on the association’s agenda for a while.
State regulators halted dredging in the Calcasieu River near the proposed CP2 terminal on August 8 after fishermen reported sediment from the project spilled beyond its intended containment area in a nearby wildlife refuge. The dredging was conducted by the Cameron Parish Port, Harbor and Terminal District in conjunction with Venture Global, which funded the project and maintained the pipe used to transport the sediment to the refuge.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Patrick Courreges, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources, said further dredging would be suspended until state and federal regulators approved a process for collecting and returning the lost dredge material.
For a Better Bayou, and Earthjustice said the spill was impacting crab, oyster and shrimp fisheries and was a potential violation of the Clean Water Act. The organizations submitted a letter to the state department of energy and natural resources and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last month seeking immediate enforcement action, including civil penalties.
The environmental assessment by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas projects, also noted that prolonged exposure to elevated noise from dredging, pile driving and other construction activity can interfere with an animal’s behavior, such as “migrating, feeding, resting, or reproducing.”
State and federal permits for the project set limits on noise pollution from the facility’s construction and operation as measured at nearby onshore locations. However, there are no noise limits for the marine environment. Habitat Recovery Project, a local conservation organization that works with local fishermen and women, received a grant from the American Geophysical Union last October to measure noise pollution in the water and its impact on marine life.
The monitoring work will be aided and expanded to assess other potential stressors to fisheries in the Lower Calcasieu River through a grant from the Community Resilience Center at The Water Institute, a research organization based in Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
Alyssa Portaro, executive director of Habitat Recovery Project, said she hopes the projects will provide the scientific data necessary to establish guardrails on LNG developments, such as seasonal restrictions on dredging or time-of-day restrictions on tanker movements, which would reduce the facilities’ impact on shrimp and other marine life.
“That would be a win for me,” Portraro said.
Others are less optimistic.
“This is not an industry that can peacefully coexist,” said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program for Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. “They’ve just gotten started.”
Environmental advocates continue to push back. Commercial fishermen, impacted landowners, and environmental groups are continuing their lawsuit against FERC over its approval of the Calcasieu Pass 2 terminal.
Meanwhile, Earthjustice is challenging the project’s dredging permits issued by the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources. The Sierra Club and other environmental organizations recently filed suit against the state’s Department of Environmental Quality over the project’s air permits. At the same time, Habitat Recovery Project, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade and the Environmental Law Clinic at Tulane University submitted a notice of intent to sue Venture Global for violations of the Clean Air Act at its existing Calcasieu Pass facility.
The Bucket Brigade, an environmental group based in New Orleans, previously noted more than 2,000 instances where emissions from the facility exceeded allowable limits during the facility’s first year of operation. The environmental groups haven’t yet filed their lawsuit; however, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has since sent Venture Global a notice of potential penalties for its emissions.
For Ray Mallett and the other fishermen, any relief from additional LNG development on the Calcasieu River can’t come soon enough. When the inshore shrimp season opened on August 11, Mallett loaded his boat, Cajun Memories, with several days’ worth of supplies and headed east toward Vermilion Bay, a 12-and-a-half-hour journey, in search of shrimp.
“I couldn’t make any money here,” Mallet said. “I had to go elsewhere.”

You can read more about the section here.

I’m a retired pediatrician and current medical educator. I’ve dedicated my life to caring for patients, training the next generation of physicians and advocating for healthcare access.
I also happen to live with a disability and use a wheelchair. For me, Medicaid is much more than a policy issue—it’s personal.
Despite the passage of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the most significant reductions in Medicaid funding will not take effect for at least two years, giving Congress an opportunity to correct its own mistake. Congress should mitigate the impacts of this legislation to help ensure patient access to care.
Beyond providing care for half of America’s children, Medicaid covers older adults, those in between jobs and people living with disabilities. Many of the people I’ve worked with – although not technically “disabled” – are still unable to work full time due to undiagnosed health conditions, limited access to employment and other barriers. Medicaid is often the only safeguard standing between them and disaster.
I often reflect on my early experience as a pediatrician during the rollout of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in the late 1990s. Until then, I had assumed most children had coverage, but when my clinic began accepting CHIP, I saw just how many families had been previously left behind.
That moment showed me just how essential healthcare advocacy is in my profession, which is why I strive to instill a passion for advocacy in the next generation of doctors.
Medicaid plays an outsized role in states like Mississippi where 60% of its recipients live in a rural area. In these underserved areas, Medicaid keeps clinics open and doctors caring for patients. Cutting the program now, when Americans and our healthcare systems are already struggling, would be heartbreaking.
Pediatric practices like mine will struggle to provide access, diagnoses and treatments might come later and at increased cost, and families will lose access to preventive care that keeps children out of the hospital.
My decades of work in Mississippi, particularly with children facing chronic conditions, have shown me how essential Medicaid remains.
Now, I’m deeply disappointed that the national conversation has shifted from expanding Medicaid access to protecting its survival.
After years working with civic and medical leaders to broaden Medicaid coverage, I now find myself forced to defend the program’s very existence.
Beyond providing for children, Mississippi nursing homes depend on Medicaid more than almost any other state, with nearly three in four residents enrolled in Medicaid. Cuts to the program would result in fewer staff and reduced services while placing a larger strain on facilities. Furthermore, even though seniors and people with disabilities make up just 35% of enrollees, they account for 66% of total Medicaid spending, illustrating the program’s role in supporting these vulnerable groups.
Although the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has been signed into law, implementation of Medicaid cuts still hangs in the balance. For example, of the nearly $1 trillion that is currently expected to be cut, the most impactful provisions won’t take place until 2027 or 2028, such as caps on provider taxes and state-directed payments, which help keep rural clinics open and operating.
Congress has ample time to reverse course and put patients first. Before the full severity of these cuts are implemented, lawmakers should roll back harmful cuts and changes to Medicaid to safeguard all Americans, as well as the hospitals and health systems that children, families and seniors depend on.

Law enforcement arrested Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Washington County resident. He was booked into the Utah County Jail.
“We got him,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said.
Kirk, a widely known and often polarizing conservative activist known for debating students on college campuses, was shot and killed during a Turning Point USA public speaking event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, unleashing a search that involved more than 20 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The FBI also offered a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the shooter.

According to Cox, a family member turned Robinson in. The suspect’s family member contacted the Washington County Sheriff’s Office saying Robinson had confessed or implied he had shot Kirk.
The information was relayed to investigators at the FBI and Utah Valley University, who reviewed additional surveillance footage from the university and identified Robinson arriving on campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at about 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

The family member who sent the tip said Robinson had become more political in recent years and that prior to Wednesday, he had mentioned Kirk’s visit to Utah Valley University.
“Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU. They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints that he had. The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate. The family member also confirmed Robinson had a gray Dodge Challenger,” Cox said.
Messages shared with law enforcement by Robinson’s roommate included Discord messages from Robinson “stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel.”
The messages also referred to engraving bullets.
Cox said inscriptions on the shell casings included messages like “Hey fascist! Catch!” and “bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao” and “if you read this, you are gay LMAO.”
Charging documents may be filed early next week, Cox said.

“This is a very sad day for, again, for our country, a terrible day for the state of Utah, but I’m grateful that at this moment, we have an opportunity to bring closure to this very dark chapter in our nation’s history,” Cox said.
FBI Director Kash Patel, who traveled to Utah during the investigation, thanked the governor and the local law enforcement agencies for resolving the case. 
Forensic evidence has been analyzed in different FBI labs across the country, and state and local authorities will continue to process evidence, Patel said.
“In less than 36 hours, 33 to be precise, thanks to the full weight of the federal government and leading out with the partners here in the state of Utah and Gov. Cox, the suspect was apprehended in a historic time period,” Patel said.
Earlier on Friday morning, President Donald Trump said a suspect was in custody.
“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him,” he said on Fox News.

Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia and Attorney General James Uthmeier argue admission into the United States is a “privilege” that shouldn’t be extended to immigrants who praise Kirk’s murder, Ingoglia and an Uthmeier aide told The Florida Phoenix. This comes one day after the State Department warned immigrants against mocking or praising 31-year-old Kirk’s death.
“Immigrants get visas, among other reasons, because the U.S. has First Amendment freedoms they don’t have in their own countries. If they’re caught celebrating the assassination of someone expressing free speech, they obviously haven’t learned the lesson,” Ingoglia, who sponsored stringent anti-illegal immigration legislation as a state senator, said in a text message.
“Send them home.”
Uthmeier’s communications director, Jeremy Redfern, said the attorney general’s office would “absolutely” support revoking these individuals’ visas and denying future entry to migrants who praised Kirk’s murder.
“Getting a visa to come into the U.S. is a privilege, not a right,” Redfern said. After this story was published, Agriculture commissioner Wilton Simpson added that he makes “three members” of the Florida cabinet to support visa revocation.
The Department of State directed staff Thursday to “undertake appropriate action” for immigrants who “glorify” Kirk’s death. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau added that these individuals “are not welcome visitors to our country.”
A State Department spokesperson told the Phoenix via email that the Trump administration doesn’t think visas should be granted to “persons whose presence in our country does not align” with national security interests.
It wouldn’t be the first time the Trump administration has authorized visa cancellation, revocation, or withholding from current or prospective U.S. immigrants. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered the use of artificial intelligence to identify foreign-born pro-Palestine protesters and revoke their student visas.
The move was aligned with President Donald Trump’s January executive order targeting visa holders who “threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology.” It also aligns with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call for the federal government to deport foreign-born students who he said were setting up university encampments to protest Israel.
The governor’s office declined to comment for this story. State Sen. Jason Pizzo, an independent who formerly served as the Senate’s Minority Leader, told the Phoenix that although an immigration attorney would be more clear on the legalities of mass visa revocation, national security and public safety is cause for removal.
“Anyone here on a visa, celebrating the assassination of an American citizen, should be swiftly revoked and removed,” Pizzo said.

Kirk, co-founder of the conservative Turning Point USA, was shot and killed in Orem, Utah, Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. While highly controversial, Kirk was a massively influential figure on the right who gained popularity by traveling to college campuses to debate students on left-leaning issues.
He’d forged close relationships with President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, who canceled his scheduled 9/11 memorial appearance in New York to instead visit Kirk’s wife and two children. Trump has announced that Kirk will posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Rep.

In a news release from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office, the funding from the agency’s Revitalization and Placemaking program would go toward creating housing and commercial space in Detroit and Dowagiac, as well as the creation of a new boutique hotel in Calumet.
A vacant building in Manistique would also be transformed into residential and commercial space using grant funding from the Michigan Community Revitalization Program.
“With these new projects in Detroit, Dowagiac, Calumet, and Manistique, we are growing Michigan’s economy and focusing on the people, places, and projects that make Michigan the best place to live, work, and play,” Whitmer said in a statement. “[These programs] create vibrant places that attract and retain talent, add new housing options, enable business creation and attraction, and provide resources for our Michigan communities.”
In Detroit, a $186,842 grant will be used to redevelop a vacant two story building in the city’s Grand River corridor into two commercial spaces with affordable housing on the second floor. 
In Dowagiac, the Wounded Minnow Building, the largest historic building in the city’s downtown corridor, will be redone to provide 10 apartments, while reconfiguring the commercial space occupied by the Wounded Minnow Saloon. The project is supported by $1.4 million in grant funding. 
Two long vacant buildings in Calumet would be redeveloped into a 17 bed boutique hotel and upscale restaurant, supported by $1.5 million in grant funding. 
In Manistique, a former funeral home would be transformed into five apartments and three commercial storage spaces, intended to help address the city’s housing shortage. The state is providing $995,000 in grant funding for the revitalization project.

COVID cases in Connecticut remained relatively stable from March through early July, before rising in late July and August. Hospitalizations from COVID, which remained low throughout the summer months, also rose in August.
“Anecdotally, I’ve been hearing about more cases, and the data also always lags behind what’s actually happening,” said Manisha Juthani, commissioner of the Department of Public Health.
While half as many cases were reported in August 2025 as August 2024, case numbers are, in part, a function of how many people choose to get tested. 
“Not every COVID case is being reported to us. So if somebody goes to an urgent care, or maybe just does a self test, we won’t get that data,” Juthani said.
On Wednesday, Gov. Ned Lamont released a statement encouraging all adults, and children older than 6 months, to get a COVID-19 booster shot.
Wastewater surveillance, which tests for COVID-19 concentration in wastewater, saw an increase in late July and at the end of August, otherwise remaining low through the early summer.
“I don’t really know if [COVID cases are] coming down, or if this is going to be part and parcel of the beginning of an early fall into winter increase,” said Juthani. “I think that remains to be seen.”

(Getty Images)Nevada should stop giving tax breaks to tech companies that build data centers in the state. 
Nevada should instead charge hefty fees and impose robust community benefit conditions on tech companies that build data centers in the state.
Nevada should demand that the cost of electricity needed to run data centers will be paid exclusively by the tech companies on whose behalf the centers are operated. 
Nevada should prohibit the companies and utilities from passing those electricity costs to other customers, especially residential ones.
Retroactively taking away tax breaks the state already granted would land Nevada in legal battles it would presumably lose. 
But Nevada can halt giveaways to, and start demanding more from, companies seeking to build new data centers. All that would take is some tweaks to the state’s demeaning and self-deprecating “economic development” statutes.
Nevada should at least do that.
Corporations are always refining their mastery of categorizing, defining, and generally masquerading reported costs and revenues in ways that benefit them and stick it to everybody else. 
So Nevada would have to fight tooth and nail to protect electricity consumers from getting saddled with skyrocketing power bills as a result of data center electricity demand. 
Nevada should at least try.
Jobs, jobs, and snow jobs
Last year, when Google announced it was spending $400 million to build a second big data center in Nevada, bringing its total data center investments in recent years to north of $2 billion in the state, Gov. Joe Lombardo gushed “This investment further cements our state’s reputation as a new tech capital of the West.”
“Tech capital” sounds like something involving a rather large workforce of highly trained employees whose handsome incomes ripple throughout their communities in soothing waves of broadly shared prosperity.
But apart from the construction phase, the data center industry has, as one operator told the Wall Street Journal, “rightly earned a dismal reputation of creating the lowest number of jobs per square foot” of perhaps any indoor commercial enterprise.
Detailed data center, well, data on employment can be hard to come by. One tracking firm tallies 60 data centers (large and small) in Nevada, and according to an Axios analysis of Census data, last year there were about 3,000 data center workers in the state.
Those 3,000 jobs are the equivalent of less than two-tenths of 1% of the Nevada workforce.
That’s in line with the scale of the data center workforce nationally. Early this year the Census Bureau published a brief on national data center employment estimating the facilities employed a half-million workers in 2023,  about three-tenths of 1% of the nation’s workforce at the time.
The global corporate, financial, and governmental rush to plant gazillion square-foot server farms on seemingly every sizable parcel of currently unoccupied dry land on the planet is (again, except for the short-term construction phase) not much of a job-creator.
Stop groveling
The largest single contributor to U.S. gross domestic product is consumer spending.
Or it was.
Through the first six months of this year, tech company investment to build and equip data centers contributed more to U.S. gross domestic product than consumer spending.
So what are we —  which is to say society, humanity, the world, Nevada, etc. —  getting for all that investment, apart from higher power bills, deepfakes, the elimination of jobs, and the dismantling of career ladders?
“AI is contributing to an incredibly wide range of potential longer-term economic outcomes,” reads a brief published by the Council on Foreign Relations early this month. “The proposed aftermath of broad AI adoption ranges from productivity booms that leave large swaths of the population out of work, to incremental innovation and role augmentation, to the stuff of dark sci-fi movies.”
But wait there’s more. The CFR report notes that Nvidia and the handful of tech giants who buy its chips to stuff into their data centers accounted for more than 80% of the S&P 500’s growth over the first half of 2025. 
So that’s another thing we get for all that tech company investment: a bull market, and perhaps an irrationally exuberant one.
The CFR paper refrains from using the phrase “AI bubble” in reference to a potentially very overvalued stock market. By contrast, The Atlantic, one of oodles of publications that are not shying away from the b-word, notes that if there’s a bubble and it pops, “the silver lining would be that fears of sudden AI-driven job displacement are overblown.”
While everyone waits to see what the brave new world has in store for the people in it, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft, along with less godly entities, plan to continue collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on more data centers.
Nevada’s data center presence could quadruple (and it probably will unless the boom goes bust first) and it still wouldn’t be a “tech capital.” Or even a data center capital. Compared to California, Texas, Georgia, Florida, Virginia, New York and several other mostly coastal states, Nevada is a U.S. data center bit player. AI is going to play out how AI is going to play out, no matter what Nevada thinks or says or does.
But Nevada could at least show some self respect and not grovel before tech companies along the way.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2211086231-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-09-12 10:58:05.606155

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)President Donald Trump on Thursday approved federal disaster relief funds to aid communities damaged by June 20-21 storms that included multiple tornadoes, large hail and straight-line winds.
The presidential disaster declaration opens up federal aid for 19 counties for public infrastructure and recovery efforts. The declaration does not include a dollar amount. 
When Gov. Kelly Armstrong made the request on July 21, a preliminary damage assessment exceeded $11.4 million. The total federal aid could end up being higher based on the applications of those seeking to recoup damages, according to the governor’s office.
“This much-needed disaster aid will help our state’s communities and utilities recover from one of the most powerful summer storms in recent history,” Armstrong said in a statement late Thursday. 
Counties eligible for assistance under the presidential declaration are Barnes, Burleigh, Cass, Eddy, Emmons, Foster, Grant, Griggs, Kidder, McLean, Morton, Oliver, Ransom, Sheridan, Sioux, Steele, Stutsman, Traill and Wells counties.
The approval comes 52 days after Armstrong submitted the request. Earlier this week, state officials commented during an Emergency Commission meeting that the state typically receives a response to disaster aid requests within 30 days.  
A separate request for federal disaster relief submitted last week for August storms is still under review. That request covers Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties. The storm that included damaging winds, large hail and multiple tornadoes caused an estimated $6 million in damage, mostly to electrical infrastructure.
The state also started a program to help farmers pay for temporary grain storage and repair and replace damaged farm facilities or equipment. For more information on the Grain Storage and Facility Rebuilder Program, visit the program website.

	“We made jokes about it at the time like, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be interesting if all the seismologists in the country were killed in the catastrophic landslide?” said Mike West, Alaska’s state seismologist and director of the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
In September, just five months later, at the aptly named Surprise Inlet, the slope failed, and a succession of five landslides dumped debris into the water, triggering a localized tsunami exactly where the seismologists had paused during their field trip.

	And a month ago, at a scenic fjord elsewhere in Alaska, a mountainside collapsed into a fjord called Tracy Arm about 80 miles southeast of Juneau. The Aug. 10 event generated a tsunami that ran at least 1,500 feet up the wall on the other side of the fjord. It was the biggest Alaska landslide since 2015, when the collapse of a mountainside in a remote part of Wrangell St. Elias National Park caused one of the biggest slides in North American history and generated a 630-foot-high tsunami at a site called Taan Fjord.
Such landslide-triggered tsunamis can be deadly. In 2017, four people were killed by one in Greenland.
In the recent Alaska tsunamis, the most serious loss was a kayak and other gear that was swept out to sea at Tracy Arm. The affected campers, on an island about 4 miles away from the landslide, reported a 100-foot wave that morning but were otherwise unharmed.

	Alaska’s luck may not last, warn scientists with the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.
The center has gathered several Alaska experts into a program called the Tsunamigenic SLope Instabilities Partnership, or Arctic T-SLIP, to help address the risks of tsunami-generated landslides amid Alaska’s melting glaciers and thawing permafrost,
“Hazards from landslides and landslide-generated tsunamis are increasing. Among all the natural hazards in Alaska, this hazard is the least quantified and integrated into local, state, and federal hazard management practices,” the Arctic T-SLIP website says.
Alaska’s daunting challenges
Other glaciated regions of the world, like Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland, have rigorous landslide monitoring programs. They face their own threats. In Western Norway, for example, an array of instruments initially set up 20 years ago has been monitoring an unstable slope at a site called Åknes that, if it fails catastrophically, could produce a tsunami that would wipe out nearby communities.

	But in Alaska, where there are thousands of mountains and tens of thousands of glaciers that are unmonitored and have not even been named, and vast distances and remoteness pose daunting challenges. Scientists, agencies and communities have thus winnowed down their monitoring to the highest priority sites.
That leads to Prince William Sound.
The sound is the site of several communities. It is home to busy commercial and sport fisheries, and traversed by vessels ranging from kayaks and other small recreational watercrafts, to huge cargo ships and oil tankers. It is visited by hundreds of thousands of people who arrive by boat, train or vehicle each year.
On the northeast side, the main focus of landslide-monitoring is Barry Arm, a fjord about 30 miles from the closest coastal town of Whittier, where Barry Glacier has been receding.
Landslide-affected slopes around Barry Arm fjord are shown in this annotated 2020 map that uses a photograph taken by Gabriel Wolken, a state geological scientist. The prospect of a sudden collapse and large tsunami prompted scientists to issue an unusual warning. (Map provided by the U.S. Geological Survey)
The mountain slope there has been moving gradually for decades, since at least the 1930s, historic photographs show. In recent years, with drastic loss of Barry Glacier’s slope-supporting ice, the movement increased significantly, and there are already periodic slides. By 2020, there were episodes of movement reaching 2 meters in a 30-day period, and Barry Glacier’s retreat had exposed 600 million cubic yards of terrain, according to NASA, an amount six times the size of the 2015 Taan Fjord landslide.

	Those changes led to a dire warning from scientists that year: A catastrophic collapse of the slope could create a tsunami big enough to send a potentially fatal wave to the town of Whittier, 30 miles to the south and west. The scientists were so alarmed that they penned an open letter about the risks.
“This tsunami could impact areas frequented by tourists, fishing vessels and hunters (potentially hundreds of people at one time,” they wrote. “We believe that it is possible that this landslide-generated tsunami will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years.”

	The tsunami didn’t happen in 2020, but the risk remains. Whittier is home to about 275 people, most of whom live in a single high-rise condo building. But the small permanent population belies the town’s significance. It has a deepwater port that buzzes with activity, especially in the summer. Aside from its vessel traffic, it serves Alaska Railroad trains and a variety of vehicles that arrive through a one-of-a-kind single-land tunnel. Other vehicles depart from the Whittier harbor on Alaska Marine Highway ferries connecting the road system to the rest of the sound. 
The discoveries at Barry Arm mobilized what is now a state-of-the-art, federally funded monitoring program that has made the site one of the most instrumented mountain slopes in Alaska.

	Prior to that, West said, there were just “random university researchers or a good-hearted person at the state survey.”
Partners in the multiagency program include the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its National Weather Service, the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys and UAF and its Alaska Earthquake Center, among others.
Dennis Staley, a USGS scientist and Alaska landslide project leader, ticked off the equipment there.

The sensors can detect landslides as well as earthquakes, allowing the Alaska Earthquake Center to monitor both types of movements. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	The “backbone” is a set of tidal gauges installed by the National Weather Service’s National Tsunami Warning Center, Staley said.
Other equipment includes Alaska Earthquake Center seismic stations, which now serve the dual purposes of detecting earthquakes and detecting landslides. There is a ground-based radar system on the opposite side of the fjord to measure downslope movement. There are weather-tracking devices. There are infrasound devices that capture the sounds of rockfalls and other events. There are remote cameras to capture images over time. And new this year, Staley said, is an array of seismic devices at the top of the landslide area.

	Some of the Barry Arm instrumentation can gather information from wider areas, Staley said. Last year’s Surprise Inlet slides, for example, were captured by equipment set up at adjacent Barry Arm.
To maintain the system, scientists travel to the site at least monthly from May to October for tasks like battery replacement and a few times each winter, Staley said.
But Alaska conditions take a toll. The first seismometer installed in 2020 directly on Barry Arm’s landslide area was wiped out by a snow avalanche the following spring, he said.
Adjusting to risks
After the first year of on-site monitoring, scientists downgraded their predicted worst-case scenario of a complete slope collapse to from 30-foot wave at Whittier to a 7-foot wave hitting about half an hour after the landslide.

	That would still be dangerous, with a possible runup of over 500 meters on the opposite fjord wall and wave heights of over 200 meters in northern part of Barry Arm and over 5 meters in southern Barry Arm. Harriman Fjord, which is connected to Barry Arm, would be hit by a tsunami within 10 to 15 minutes of a big slide, scientists estimate.
Scientists have been providing periodic updates since the Barry Arm project started.
“Our job as federal scientists, government scientists, is to do our best to better understand what the actual hazard is, using the best available science, and then to make sure that we’re communicating about that hazard to the public,” Staley said.
In Whittier, people have adjusted their activities according to the risks they perceive.
A tour company that has trademarked its popular “26 Glacier Cruise” – even using an advertising jingle to do so — has reconfigured its itinerary to bypass the hazard area..

	Phillips Cruises & Tours still brings sightseers to 26 glaciers, but the trip offers a different mix than in past years, said Cody Hanna, the company’s vice president of marine operations. It is not sailing into Barry Arm anymore and, for now, the tour boats are also skipping Surprise Inlet and Surprise Glacier, though the latter has been a big draw for sightseers. Instead, the Phillips boats are taking a little more time on their tours and sailing a little farther out into the sound to a site called College Fjord, where there are multiple other glaciers, including the thinning but advancing Harvard Glacier.
“You can’t predict it, but it’s just grown enough to where it’s just not worth it anymore, so we’re back to Harvard Glacier and College Fjord,” Hanna said of the landslide risk.
Peter Denmark, owner of a kayak tour company, said he has also changed his operations because of landslide risks at Barry Arm. “We are not running any commercial tours up in that area, essentially due to liability concerns,” said Denmark, who also serves on Whittier’s city council and holds the position of vice mayor.
Barry Arm and the other landslide-prone sites around Prince William Sound and elsewhere keep him alert to the dangers, he added. “It is, personally, another hazard just from living in Alaska,” he said.

	Brenda Tolner, who has operated a waterfront shop in Whittier for more than 30 years, is less concerned.
If Barry Arm hasn’t caused a localized tsunami in the past, it probably will not do so now, she figures. “I don’t see it as any big threat,” she said.
She does not worry much about the slides in the nearby mountains because they have been happening for decades, she said. “You’ll hear the crash when they come down,” she said.
Tsunami awareness
In seismically active Alaska, people associate tsunamis with earthquakes. The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, which was the second most powerful in the historical record killed 139 people, including 11 in Whittier. Most deaths were from the tsunamis that slammed against coastlines.
The 1964 earthquake has a profound legacy in Alaska. That includes preparations for future earthquake-generated tsunamis; several communities are designated by the NWS as “TsunamiReady,” with detailed safety systems to prepare for earthquake-generated tsunamis.

	There is also a history in Alaska of dangerous landslide-induced tsunamis. In Lituya Bay, an ellipse-shaped fjord cut into the Gulf of Alaska coast, a landslide shaken loose by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in 1958 triggered a megatsunami. It sent water 1,720 feet up a mountain slope and killed five people. Thirty-six years later, in 1994, a freak underwater slide in the Southeast Alaska town of Skagway caused a localized tsunami that killed a construction worker at a dock.
The slides and tsunami risk being studied in Prince William Sound are different.
They are caused not by earthquakes but long-term weakening of slopes that are no longer supported by glacier ice. A contributing factor sometimes is the thaw of high-altitude permafrost that binds slabs of rock together. Both changes are linked to long-term climate warming.
As glaciers at the bases of mountains rapidly retreat, they are de-buttressing, said Jillian Nicolazzo,  the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Survey’s landslide program coordinator.

	“So that the ice that had been holding all that rock in place is not there,” she said. “It’s too steep, so it has to find an equilibrium.”
The thawing high-altitude permafrost that contributes to slope weakness known as rock permafrost. Though lingering snow patches offer hints, it is hard to determine exactly how much of it exists on mountains or where it is located, Nicolazzo said. What is known is that it is sensitive to warming and implicated in landslides elsewhere.
“When that ice does start to melt, the space that it occupied becomes a void, and rock and soil fill that void,” she said.
Rain can be another trigger. Surprise Inlet’s landslides last year got their final push from heavy rainfall that loosened the already unstable slope, research shows.

	For residents, there is a pressing question: Can people be warned to evacuate from a landslide tsunami just as they are with earthquake-generated tsunamis, which can take hours to hit shores?
“Potentially, yes. The difficulty is you have to know that the landslide occurred and where it occurred, to start with,” Nicolazzo said. “We might be talking minutes, but it takes the scientists that long to triangulate where it came from,” Nicolazzo said.
Seismic signals are used to pinpoint locations. Scientists at the Alaska Earthquake Center can spot the differences between landslide seismic signals and earthquake signals. Earthquake signals are more varied in their frequencies and more sudden; landslide signals tend to be in low frequencies and are more gradual.

	The center’s seismic network proved vital in the Tracy Arm event, Nicolazzo said.
“They saw it pretty quickly and they were able to triangulate,” she said. “But the timing does make it difficult. The landslide happens, and then water starts moving.”
Good news, bad news
The downgrading of the severity of a Barry Arm collapse is a piece of good news that has come from the new monitoring. The bad news – as demonstrated by the Surprise Inlet landslides — is that there are numerous other Prince William Sound sites at risk.
A 2024 USGS study used satellite data to identify 43 sites in the sound where landslides occurred between 2016 and 2022. Fourteen were previously known. Eleven of the identified sites have potential for generating tsunamis.

	Rising to the top of that list is Maynard Mountain, said Gabriel Wolken, a geologist who heads the Division of Geophysical and Geological Surveys’ Climate and Cryosphere Hazards Program.
Maynard Mountain, through which the single-land Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel runs, looms directly over Whittier and a new cruise dock that started operations this year. Shrinking Learnard Glacier clings near the top, while rocks frequently tumble off its lower flanks.
Government agencies lack the resources to do a Barry Arm-like instrumentation and monitoring program, Wolken said. But what agency scientists can do is watch the mountain, whether from land or remotely through satellite imagery captured from space.

	“We did that at Barry Arm. We’ve learned a lot from that exercise,” Wolken said.
To better understand Maynard’s contours and landslide potential, the division was planning a survey of the mountain this fall using lidar, a technology that measures distance using light beams. This year’s planned lidar survey follows one performed at Maynard in 2022.
The probability of a tsunami-generating landslide at Maynard is considered to be very low, but the results if one were to happen would be “cataclysmic,” said Bretwood Higman, a Seldovia-based geologist who is part of the Woodwell Climate Research Center team.
“If a landslide failed catastrophically, you’ve got two minutes. There’s nothing you can do in two minutes, basically,” Higman said.

Lessons learned at Barry Arm are also being applied on the other side of the Whittier tunnel, where retreating Portage Glacier is exposing an unstable slope that is already the site of frequent rockslides.
As with Maynard Mountain, lidar surveys are planned at Portage, Wolken said. There are also plans for ice-penetrating radar surveys to better understand the glacier’s thickness and the characteristics of the bedrock below, he said.

Now the glacier has retreated so much that it is around the right corner, requiring a boat ride or mountain hike to see it in summer.

	Higman, who spends a lot of time scouting the Portage Glacier area, said two slide areas by the melting glacier are combining to reshape the slope. “The very bottom of the slope is just falling apart and crumbling onto the glacier,” he said.
There is no permanent community at Portage Glacier, but the area is a popular destination for tourists and recreational users. For tourists, Portage Glacier’s retreat is part of the attraction. At the Forest Service’s Begich, Boggs Visitor Center, big windows that once provided close-up views of glacier ice now overlook open water. People wanting to see the namesake glacier must now hike up a mountain pass or boat across the lake or, in winter when the lake is frozen, ski or skate across it.
New device could provide communities with advanced warning 
Higman, who has experimented with a series of measuring devices at different Southcentral Alaska mountain sites, has come up with what he believes could be a valuable tool for community-based landslide safety.
It is a simple, glass-encased device using the type of radar signals that are employed on fishing boats. The devices send radio signals, “like a walkie-talkie,” through the internet to nearby databases. The goal is to detect changes in the slope. Since small movements precede big slides, the devices could give advance warning opportunities.

The devices use a simple radar system to measure slope movements that might precede landslides, and they are able to send signals by internet that can be recorded in a database.

	The devices promise to be more practical than other equipment Higman and his partners have positioned on various slopes, he said. They do not need to be embedded into holes dug into bedrock, as is necessary with some movement-measuring equipment. They are relatively cheap and easy to retrieve and replace, if needed. They could be managed by members of the public in affected communities. And they might avoid the problems with equipment he has installed at Columbia Glacier, a Prince William Sound landmark, where mountain goats have gnawed on or possibly eaten expensive communications and GPS devices.
Higman said he has nearly a dozen of the devices, and he has deployed them in a few places, mostly at Portage and at a Matanuska River Valley site called Glacier View, where a slide threatens a small subdivision.
It’s only a start, he said.
“I’m aiming for 100 sites. That’s what we need,” he said.

Beyond the sound
On the long list of landslide-prone glaciated areas is the coastal town of Seward, a popular tourist and recreation destination just outside of Prince William Sound on the Kenai Peninsula.
The town of 2,800 has recent experience with landslide-generated tsunamis.

	Last year, a section of mountain face fell into a marine site called Pedersen Lagoon, triggering a local tsunami that reached a height of about 56 feet. The Aug. 7, 2024, event did not injure anyone, but it damaged a private lodge’s wooden boardwalks and affected a Kenai Fjords National Park camping area. Previously, a 2022 landslide in Seward caused a small tsunami that was detected by equipment aboard the UAF-operated research vessel Sikuliaq.
Wolken, who loves to visit the picturesque coastal town with his family, laughed when asked if the precarious conditions of the slopes there dampens his enjoyment.
Family trips now to Seward are punctuated with safety lectures delivered to his two young daughters, and his watchfulness is constant, he said.
“I’m always looking at the slopes. I know the destruction that’s possible from gravity,” he said. “I don’t zone out. I’m always scanning.”

Just how many hazardous sites are out there? Bretwood “Hig” Higman, a geologist based in the Kenai Peninsula town of Seldovia, has done a basic inventory.
From 2012 to early this year, there have been more than 1,000 slow-moving slides of different varieties, with triggers that include receding glaciers, thawing permafrost, extreme weather or combinations of those factors, according to his calculations.

	In a state where people contend with earthquakes, floods, wildfires and erupting volcanoes, it may be difficult to add another type of natural disaster to the public’s list of worries, Higman said. But elevating landslide awareness and preparedness is necessary as events increase, he said.
“It is vastly more risky than most things we deal with,” said Higman, a partner in an Alaska landslide science program created by the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.
Shallow, sudden slides triggered by rain
The lesson has been learned in Southeast Alaska, where catastrophic slope failures triggered by extreme rains have proved deadly. Since 2015, 12 people have been killed by landslides in Sitka, Haines, Wrangell and Ketchikan. Victims included an entire family of five killed by a sudden slide in Wrangell in late 2023.
In Southeast Alaska, steep mountains that were created through tectonic processes rise from the water’s edge, and rain is frequent. It is naturally susceptible to landslides.

	“One of the primary processes that sculps the landscape in southeast Alaska is landslides and glaciers and rivers,” said Dennis Staley, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist and Alaska landslide program leader. “When you combine rapid uplift with steep slopes with junky rock and lots of rainfall, you have all of the key ingredients for landslides.”
Southeast Alaska landslides are classified as shallow slides because they involve the soil, trees and other materials atop the bedrock rather than the rock itself. Those slides are numerous; the USGS recorded 162 news-reported slides in Southeast Alaska from 1990 to 2024. They are longstanding threats. A 1936 landslide in Juneau, for example, killed 15 people.
Now climate change is compounding the threat by creating more extreme rainfall events, driven by atmospheric rivers, as well as bringing more winter rain that, in other years, would be snowfall.
That means efforts to monitor landslide risks extend not just to topography studies but also the details about precipitation. Whether it is rain or snow – or rain-on-snow – has implications for slope stability, and the multiagency team studying landslide risks in Southeast Alaska has developed a prototype monitoring station to record precise qualities of the precipitation, as well as wind and temperature.

	Beyond federal and state agencies’ work and that of university organizations like the Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, there is focused work by tribal governments and community organizations.
The Sitka Sound Science Center, previously known for its fisheries and ocean science work, now has one of the most well-developed landslide programs. The center’s landslide program was launched in 2015, after a slide there killed three. The center now maintains a local landslide hazards dashboard, and it participates in and coordinates a variety of research projects and educational programs.
One is the Kutí project, a partnership with the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska and other tribal partners. Named for the Lingit word meaning “weather,” the program is funded by a National Science Foundation grant awarded in 2022. The purpose is development of a more regional Southeast Alaska monitoring, warning and educational system.
The Sitka center’s work has been hampered by Trump administration budget cuts and policies. A landslide conference that the center was set to host last spring was canceled because Trump administration policies prevented federal partners from attending.
Permafrost thaw and frozen lobes

	Farther north, slopes are shifting and creeping as permafrost thaws, creating hazards for infrastructure. The best-known case may be in Interior Alaska at Denali National Park and Preserve, where one of the more than 140 detected landslides along the park’s sole road interfered with travel.
That slide, at a site called Pretty Rocks at the midpoint of the 92-mile road, had been ongoing for years, creating maintenance headaches for park staffers trying to keep the road open. In 2021, it finally made the road impassable there.
A project is underway to create a bridge over the slide area, but it is proving more complicated than originally envisioned. Early on, it was estimated to cost a bit under $100 million and expected to be completed by the 2025 tourist season. Since then, the completion date has been pushed back, with full road access expected to resume in 2027. The cost is now estimated at $150 million, a figure that does not include potential work at other landslide sites along the park’s road.
More than infrastructure at risk from Interior landslides. Last summer, when a guided rafting expedition encountered a landslide on the Nenana River just outside the park, a woman in the party was killed.
 

A frozen debris lobe in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve is seen in 2020. This lobe of frozen material was stable and nearly completely vegetated until about 2005, when it began to thaw and move downslope. (Photo provided by the National Park Service)
 

	Yet farther north, masses of frozen material are working their way down to the corridor that holds the trans-Alaska pipeline. University of Alaska Fairbanks and state scientists have identified more than 200 of them in the Brooks Range. As of last year, said UAF’s Margaret Darrow, there were 99 identified along the Dalton Highway, the road that parallels the trans-Alaska pipeline and the sole land route to the Prudhoe Bay oil complex.
The conglomeration of moving ice, water, crumbling rock and vegetation have their own descriptive name: “frozen debris lobes.” Darrow, the principal investigator on various UAF projects, began studying them in 2011, when she drove up the Dalton Highway for a two-family camping trip with a colleague.
The lobes, which move more quickly than thawing permafrost but are not causing sudden collapse, proved enough of a threat to the highway that the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities rerouted a section in 2018, part of a $25 million project that addressed thaw problems along the highway.
The reconfiguration proved necessary. The leftover section of highway was left in place as a test site, and the frozen debris lobe continued to flow. By late 2023, it had shoved the leftover highway section about a foot to the side, according to research led by Darrow.

	In the Arctic, in Alaska and elsewhere, permafrost thaw caused by warming temperatures has triggered widespread landslides known as retrogressive thaw slumps.
Among the affected sites is the Noatak Valley in mountainous Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, considered a hotpot for such slides. In that remote region, the safety of people and property is not much of an issue, but water quality can be. Numerous retrogressive thaw slumps have dumped tens of thousands of cubic meters of sediment into a single creek, according to the National Park Service.
Keeping abreast of the hazards from all types of unstable slopes in Alaska requires coordination by agencies at all levels of government, universities and other entities, said Jillian Nicolazzo, a geologist who leads the state’s landslide hazards program.
“At the moment, we can’t do it all,” said Nicolazzo, a geologist who leads the landslide program at the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. “Everyone pitches in a little bit, because it is just too much for any one agency.”

Addressing federal uncertainty
The state program gets funding from the USGS, and a big boost for U.S. landslide monitoring has been provided by the National Landslide Preparedness Act signed into law in 2021. Through that act, Congress in 2021 appropriated $4 million specifically to landslide hazards in Prince William Sound.
But the law, which authorized federal funding for landslide programs, expired in 2024.
Legislation is pending in Congress to reauthorize it, with sponsors from Alaska and Washington, states with deadly slides in recent years. One bill is sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington. Another is sponsored by U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Washington.
Without reauthorization, prospects for future funding are clouded.
The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year would cut funding for USGS natural hazards work – which includes landslide hazards – by about a quarter, from $203 million to $157 million, according to a Congressional Research Service report.
As with the canceled Sitka conference, Trump administration policy interrupted landslide work last spring in Prince William Sound. Massive federal layoff and spending freezes prevented some planned maintenance work at the Barry Arm landslide site.
If federal support for Alaska landslide monitoring becomes spotty, there is a potential backstop: citizen science.

	The Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys earlier this year launched an online app through which members of the public can report the landslide risks they encounter. Those could be actual slides, small rockfalls, cracks or anything unusual, and the division encourages people to submit photographs.
The hope is that important information will be gathered “if people are out hunting and fishing and recreating, especially if they see a lot of landslides that we don’t,” Nicolazzo said.
Without help from the public, scientists like her have to rely a lot on things like satellite imagery, she said. “I mostly sit at a computer and look at Google Earth. The images can be years old,” she said.
So far, the Alaska Landslide Reporter app has not been promoted or used much. But Nidolazzo is hopeful about its eventual utility.
Public awareness is, for now, the prime solution to the landslide problem in a place as big, mountainous, wild and fast-changing as Alaska, Nicolazzo said.
“I think educating people about the risk is the best we can do at this point. Because the area is so large and people are everywhere,” she said.

Years ago, I chose a defining fork in the road and applied to graduate school. As I anxiously awaited acceptance in the  University of Missouri-Columbia’s  School of Journalism, it was my good fortune to snag a summer job at the State Historical Society of Iowa in Iowa City.
As a northwestern Iowa native, living and working in clear view of the beautiful Old Capitol landmark broadened my sense of state history. Just think, in 1857 our fledging Legislature had the foresight to prioritize the creation of the State Historical Society of Iowa! As someone who loved both history and genealogy, the library at 402 Iowa Ave. was a treasure trove.
Today I live much closer to the State Historical Society of Iowa built in 1987 in Des Moines, and I was dismayed to learn in June of staffing cuts at both locations and the abrupt decision to shutter the Iowa City branch by 2026.
I should have seen it coming. Remember in 2023 when Gov. Kim Reynolds rammed through a reorganization of state government, reducing 37 cabinet level-agencies to 16? The State Historical Society of Iowa lost its autonomy, and was placed beneath the Department of Administrative Services, which received one-half of its requested funding this year. The Research Library requires only a miniscule portion of the budget, yet it was deemed a financial drain and “duplicative.”
Plans are underway to move 40% of the research library’s collection to Des Moines this month, but due to space constraints, a new home is being sought for the remainder.
The “Annals of Iowa,” an academic journal edited and published by the state for 163 years, also now is looking for a new home. Although it basically was self-supporting, the decision was justified as a staffing issue.
A Change.org Petition to Save Iowa History 2025 has garnered 7,008+ signatures to date.
Required whitewashing?
This history-making-headlines moment in Iowa is a bellwether for the current upheaval of our national history. In observance of our country’s 250th anniversary this year, the Trump administration wants the Smithsonian to “celebrate American exceptionalism” by “removing divisive or partisan narratives and restoring confidence in our shared cultural institutions.”
The Smithsonian Institute’s Board of Regents is being required to conduct an internal, comprehensive review of its exhibits and materials and “implement content corrections where necessary.”
The initiative takes aim at eight of the Smithsonian’s 21 museums. Additional museums will be included in a second phase.
Most troublesome is the Trump directive to remove “improper ideology.” Who will be the arbiter of “proper” ideology? Does this mean our history will be whitewashed?
In April, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminated National Endowment for the Humanities grants to thousands of groups across the country including humanities councils, museums, historic sites, archives, libraries, educators, and media outlets.
Fortunately, a federal judge has ruled that this abrupt elimination of grants previously approved by Congress was “unlawful” and that a lawsuit by humanities groups can move forward.
However, humanities councils still are operating without their congressionally appropriated funds, and many have already laid off staff and canceled vital programs.
In April, the beloved National History Day competition for high school students was jeopardized by these DOGE cuts. A social media funding campaign allowed the national competition in May to go forward. But the future of National History Day remains uncertain. Its 2026 theme is very timely: “Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History.”
Gaining a foothold in classrooms
Yet against this backdrop of iconic historical resources under siege, a new history exhibit, The Founders Museum, opened inside the Eisenhower Executive Building next door to the White House. It’s a partnership between the White House Task Force 250, the U.S. Dept. of Education, and PragerU.
Ever heard of PragerU? Me, neither. It’s not a university, any more than the University of Okoboji is. It’s a conservative nonprofit founded by conservative radio host Dennis Prager and an associate in 2009, and funded by very wealthy donors. Its business model is 5-minute edutainment videos covering an array of topics. It also has its own PragerU YouTube Channel.
You may recall the “America First” test adopted by Oklahoma to screen New York and California teacher applicants on their wokeness quotient? PragerU created the test.
The Founders Museum features 56 portraits of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, along with 40 AI-generated, animated short videos of these historical individuals telling stories — produced by PragerU. The intent is for these individuals, places, and events to come to life, making history engaging to Americans. No doubt it’s a worthy goal.
However, did President John Adams ever say, “Facts don’t care about your feelings?” Probably not, but his AI character does. Ben Shapiro, a prominent conservative commentator, has used it often, and it’s even become a meme.
Most of us aren’t experts in multiple fields, and therefore we don’t know all the facts. The facts we’re using as our filters and how we source them are critical components.
PragerU maintains that the Signers’ narratives are based on letters, speeches, and original writing. However, the issue goes beyond whether the animated stories are based on historical archives; PragerU’s carefully curated narratives raise the issue of which individuals integral to our history are being left out: People of color? Working class Americans? Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant to the U.S., didn’t sign the Declaration of Independence because he was with the Continental Army in New York at the time.
Another section, titled Ladies of the Revolution, raises my hackles; why not call it: Women of the Revolution? All ladies are women, but does this imply not all women are ladies? Mercy Otis Warren, a woman well ahead of her time, stridently criticized leaders at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention through her writings. She spoke truth to power. But her words seem watered down in her AI story.

Another section will feature 20 “Major Events,” but it appears incomplete.
The Founders Museum isn’t only available to tourists in Washington D.C. There are plans to take it on the road with mobile museum trucks during this Sesquicentennial year. Schools and state capitols will be encouraged to incorporate The Founders Museum in some way. (Oklahoma and Florida already have approved PragerU’s separate history initiative in their classrooms.)
History: What is it good for?
Why do we need history? Why do the archival resources that form the foundation of history matter?
Plainspoken former President Harry S. Truman once said, “The only thing new in the world is the history you don’t know.”
In fact, history offers lessons with uncanny applications to current events. For instance:
(1) At a Sept. 4 with Health and Human Services Secretary RFK, Jr. ,Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, presented a chart showing the positive impact of vaccine use in reducing and eliminating infectious diseases in the past century. She pointed out, “You’re basically trying to refute over 100 years of history on vaccines.”
(2) Why was the Insurrection Act passed in 1807 and why are we hearing about it today? How about the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878? The Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy military or federalize the National Guard against Americans in certain cases of emergency or rebellion. The primary exception to it is the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally bars the military from civilian law enforcement.
(3) Why did fluoridization of drinking water became widespread in the U.S. by 1960? It’s been hailed as one of the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century for its success in preventing tooth decay in children and tooth loss in adults, especially those in low-income families with limited access to dental care. Why is RFK, Jr. targeting it, with Utah and Florida following his lead to ban it, and other states proposing legislation?
(4) Why is the Civil Rights struggle such an integral part of our history? Florida’s revised K-12 curriculum teaches that some Black people benefited from slavery because it helped them develop useful skills. Could this partially illustrate why considerations of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion still are relevant after 250 years of U.S. history?
(5) Why should the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Labor Statistics remain independent? As Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, pointed out at confirmation hearing of Stephen Miran, this isn’t a theoretical argument. “We’ve actually seen this happen before when other countries with authoritarians take control of the central bank, working people suffer from higher inflation,” she said.
When Richard Nixon tried to paint a rosier picture of inflation and unemployment data, he wanted to purge Jewish members of the BLS because of unfounded bias. “There’s a Jewish cabal, you know, running through this…. ” he said. “But there’s the BLS staff. Now how the hell do you ever expect us to get anything from that staff, the raw data, let alone what the poor guys have to say [inaudible] that isn’t gonna be loaded against us? You understand?”
Is history history – will it become a victim of identity politics? History is not only the stuff between the covers of dry, dusty books. And history certainly isn’t the faux history bought and paid for by ideologues living in the lap of luxury. History is a living and breathing entity that humanizes us, binds us together as a nation, and impacts our daily lives. That’s something to celebrate in our 250th year!
If our leaders respect our history, and we the people scrutinize it, we can save ourselves from our worst human instincts. History doesn’t belong to one group of Americans, or one political party, or presidential administration. It belongs to us all. Indeed, history has its eyes on us.










Men in authority will always think that criticism of their policies is dangerous. They will always equate their policies with patriotism, and find criticism subversive.


– Henry Steele Commager

Sinclair Inc., the parent company for Rhode Island’s WJAR, is taking over the infrastructure and operations for one of its rival market stations, ABC6 (WLNE), Jessica Bellucci, company spokesperson confirmed to Rhode Island Current on Friday morning.
The local market share agreement between Sinclair and ABC6’s parent company, Standard Media Group, lets Sinclair take over the equipment, operations and infrastructure for the second broadcast station, without changing the license ownership. The transaction closed Friday morning, Bellucci said.
“Sinclair is committed to producing distinctive content that delivers value and strengthens the connection to the local communities we serve,” Bellucci said in an email. “WJAR and WLNE represent the best of local broadcasting in the region, and we look forward to building on that legacy to continue to serve viewers across Southern New England.”
Bellucci declined to answer additional questions. 
However, beloved local  TV meteorologist Kelly Bates posted on social media Thursday that she and other ABC6 workers had lost their jobs due to the new agreement.
“It happened again,” Bates said in a Facebook video. “Our station was just bought by the station that I worked for previously and that parent company has decided I am a redundancy and needed to go.”
Bates spent most of her two-decade career at WJAR. She left the station in September 2021 amid a contract dispute, sparking outrage from Bates’ supporters, according to news reports. She returned to airwaves less than one year later, scooped up ABC6.
Standard Media Group  did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday. The company still listed ABC6 as one of its local stations on its website. 
The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training has not received any notices for layoffs at ABC6, Samuel Aboh, an agency spokesperson, confirmed Friday. Under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, companies are required to let state and local officials know in advance about mass layoffs or facility closures.
A non-license agreement lets the two stations bypass longstanding federal regulatory restrictions which seek to prevent monopolies in local broadcast markets. However, a single company owning two local stations, including licenses, might not be out of the question, either.
In July 2025, a federal appeals court threw out part of the Federal Communications Commission’s longstanding regulations that restricted ownership in a local broadcast market to no more than one station. Meanwhile, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, continues to push for further deregulation of broadcast regulation and ownership limits.

Gretchen Whitmer takes questions from journalist Gretchen Carlson following her Build America Build Address in Washington, D.C. on April 9, 2025. | ScreenshotGov. Gretchen Whitmer said the nation’s recent lagging jobs report and the uncertain nature of federal tariffs will be in focus during a speech planned next week.
The Democrat’s announcement also hinted that she’ll address Michigan’s stalled budget negotiations in what would be her first major public statement on the Legislature’s failure to put a spending plan in place. The current fiscal year ends Sept. 30, and the state government is facing an Oct. 1 shutdown.
Whitmer announced in a news release Wednesday that she will deliver an address to the state Tuesday. Her office said the governor would also touch on new troubling signs in America’s manufacturing sector.
All of that potentially bodes unwell for Michigan’s economy, and signals additional trouble for the nation’s economic status.
“Federal tariffs are driving economic uncertainly, leading to massive job loss, instability in our nation’s manufacturing sector, and concerning signs for our economic future,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Elected leaders need to set aside politics, do our jobs to protect and defend our constituents, and work together so we can create a bright future for every American. In Michigan, that includes passing a balanced, bipartisan budget that lowers costs, invests in education, healthcare, public safety, and roads. I look forward to laying out the stakes on Tuesday.”
Whitmer cited the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics current employment statistics preliminary national benchmark summary, and a report from the independent, bipartisan Center for American Progress. The latter asserts that President Donald Trump’s tariff trade war was squeezing middle-class manufacturing employment.
Whitmer’s speech will be delivered from the state capital in Lansing, but a time and location has not been announced.

After a summer characterized by masked federal agents detaining immigrants in Los Angeles, the California Legislature passed two measures Thursday that seek to force law enforcement officers to identify themselves.
Senate Bills 627 and 805 were among the most controversial to pass in the final days of this year’s legislative session. They would ban local, out-of-state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, as well as require officers to be readily identifiable, respectively. 

State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and lead author of SB 627: “As we go through this horrific era of mass deportation and a Supreme Court that allows this authoritarian regime to do whatever the heck it wants to do — including straight-up racial profiling of Latino people — California should lead and put a stop to the secret police.”

The measures passed along party lines, with Republicans in opposition. Police unions also oppose the proposed mask ban.

GOP Sen. Tony Strickland of Huntington Beach, in a statement: “This is a reckless anti-law enforcement proposal that puts law enforcement officers and their families at real risk, undermining the safety of the men and women who bravely protect our communities.”

Though today should be the last day of session, lawmakers are expected to extend their work through Saturday to give final votes to some last-minute deals they struck this week. Those that pass will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for his signature or veto, and those that don’t are dead for the year.
Other proposals awaiting Newsom’s decision, include: 

Regulate companion bots: SB 243 would put tighter regulations on online chatbots powered by artificial intelligence to limit their risks on young users.


Higher car dealer fees: SB 791 would raise the cap car dealers can charge to process documents from $85 to $260.


Wage boost for incarcerated firefighters: AB 247 would increase the minimum wage for incarcerated firefighters fighting active wildfires to $7.25 an hour.


Abortion pill protections: AB 260 would help protect California pharmacists, doctors and hospitals from penalties for dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone to out-of-state patients, and remove the names of patients and providers from abortion medication prescriptions.


Kill mute swans: AB 764 would make it easier for hunters and landowners to kill the invasive species.


Ban plastic glitter: AB 823 would enforce a first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of personal care products that contain plastic glitter or plastic microbeads.


Save the bees: AB 1042 would create a health program for managed honey bees that would provide grants to beekeepers, farmers and others for projects and research supporting the struggling population.

Google pulls the strings behind the scenes

As one of the top spenders in California lobbying last year, Google has poured millions of dollars to influence the state government. But its involvement in some proposals isn’t always clear-cut, underscoring the stealthy ways the tech giant goes about trying to shape policies, report CalMatters’ Khari Johnson and Yue Stella Yu.
It quietly orchestrated a campaign to water down a proposed California regulation, and it was so stealthy that lawmakers didn’t see the company’s fingerprints until CalMatters informed them.
In April the company began reaching out to small businesses using email lists, urging them to sign a petition opposing a measure that would require browsers to give users a way to automatically tell websites not to share their personal information with third parties. 
This outreach campaign, however, did not look like it came directly from Google, but rather the “Connected Commerce Council,” which Google backs financially. Google itself also never took a public position on the measure.
Though Google’s tactics aren’t illegal, it raises concern among some advocates who are critical of big tech’s influence.

Brandon Forester, an organizer for the nonprofit MediaJustice: “None of us wants to enter a surveillance marketplace every time that we go on the internet. Part of the reason they need to do the shadow lobbying is because the things that they want to do to achieve their infinite growth model is not good for the public.”

Less food, more solar

In stretches of the San Joaquin Valley that rarely get enough water to grow food, farmers and ranchers faced with barren, parched land have the opportunity to generate a new crop: solar energy. But a bill that aims to incentivize more farmers to install solar panels has farmers split, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
Under a 60-year-old law known as the Williamson Act, farmers can enter into contracts with local governments that allow them to pay less on their property tax as long as they use their land for farming. To cancel the contract before the end of its term results in steep penalty fees.
But AB 1156, if passed, would enable farmers to suspend contracts and avoid fees if they use their land to capture solar energy, although their property tax would still increase. The bill would help the state reach its clean energy goals since generating solar power requires hundreds of thousands of acres.
Though some farmers welcome an alternative use for their dried-out land, others argue that the bill undermines farming regions and chips away at the adjacent economies that help the agriculture industry operate.

Stephen Routh
Stephen Routh is a political science professor at California State University Stanislaus


California is starting to reach blue-flame-level political heat over two constitutional questions around mask wearing. 
Can local governments ban masks during public protests, as one Central Valley city did six years ago? The Modesto ordinance returned to the spotlight in June after several people protesting the immigration raids were arrested, prompting challenges from the ACLU and the NAACP. 
And should California prevent law enforcement officers from wearing masks while performing their duties? Lawmakers this week passed the No Secret Police Act, stemming from outrage over masked federal officers detaining individuals they believe are immigrants.
Ultimately resolving these questions involves balancing people’s right to safety with their right to express their views publicly. It’s a puzzle that’s more complex than it looks.
When a local government such as Modesto bans masks, at first glance it appears to be an understandable and legitimate policy to protect the public in large gatherings. It’s aimed at preventing or minimizing violent behavior by those who’d be emboldened to engage in it if their identity is cloaked. 
On the other hand, not allowing protesters to be anonymous harms their ability to protect themselves against retaliation from opponents, including government officials. Also, mask bans sweep in people wearing masks for medical or religious reasons.
In this light, mask prohibitions can be seen as unconstitutional intrusions on the rights of free speech and political association.
The First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.” But it doesn’t mention freedom of association. The U.S. Supreme Court has decided freedom of association is implied from the explicitly stated rights of speech, press, assembly and petition, which together are called freedom of expression. 
The Constitution protects free expression — except if it incites lawless actions, is obscene, defames, defrauds or is part of a criminal conspiracy.
Any government that restricts protected expression must ensure the regulation is content-neutral, meaning it can’t vary based on its content or impact. The critical question about local mask bans is are they content-neutral or content-based? 
A complete ban on masks at demonstrations would seem, on its face, to indicate content neutrality if no single group or expression is being directly favored or disfavored. The Supreme Court would likely uphold it as constitutional.
What happens when government agents apply the law in a way that impacts certain groups of people differently, affecting who gets arrested for violating the ban and who feels chilled or hesitant about participating in a protest? Those with views that run contrary to the influential private actors or governmental officials are likely to mask up out of fear of retribution.  
What about protestors who, for medical reasons or religious beliefs, need to cover their faces? If a mask ban carves out exemptions for them, how would government officials ascertain who these people are in a public protest? 
Such selective or capricious enforcement of an otherwise constitutional law can render it illegitimate in the eyes of the Supreme Court, which may conclude that the mask ban contains content-based elements and is unconstitutional. 
Different constitutional concerns are at play with the ban on law enforcement masks the state Legislature approved. The ban would affect local police and federal officers, including ICE, Border Patrol and Homeland Security. 
It’s difficult to imagine the Supreme Court — whether it has a liberal or a conservative majority — allowing a state to micromanage or second guess federal law enforcement operations by not allowing government agents to mask up, especially while enforcing  immigration law, which the Constitution places under federal purview.
Since the earliest days of our republic, the Supreme Court has consistently reined in state efforts to constrain federal government endeavors. The court is acting on federalism principles in the Constitution: Federal law generally preempts state law or policy. 
The only plausible avenue California has to push back against federal face covering would be if Congress enacts such a law and the president signs it. That’s highly unlikely. The Trump administration says officers in ICE raids would face threats and doxxing if they weren’t masked.
Few constitutional issues arise if the potential anti-masking law is applied only to local police. The concern is more about policy and practice. Holding local officers accountable for their actions must be balanced against giving police discretion to make tactical and operational decisions.  
Distilled, mask bans create legal and societal issues that are tough to resolve at any time — but even more so now, as partisan battles brew daily amid aggressive exertions of federal and presidential power.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825_Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA_TS_CM_32.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936

Following an exceptionally dry summer, all of Utah is currently in drought — most of the state is in “severe” drought, while some desert regions are rated as “extreme.” A number of the state’s reservoirs are below 50% capacity with just two, Current Creek and Strawberry, above 85%. Great Salt Lake levels are veering back into dangerously low levels, while statewide precipitation data puts 2025 at far below the 10-year average.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has already issued a state of emergency related to the drought. Now, the federal government is announcing emergency loans, covering nine counties in Utah — Box Elder, Cache, Duchesne, Rich, Salt Lake, Summit, Utah, Wasatch and Weber — and three in Idaho — Bear Lake, Franklin and Oneida.
Now, small businesses, agricultural cooperatives, nurseries and private nonprofits (which include faith-based organizations) experiencing financial losses related to the drought can apply for assistance through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, administered by the Small Business Administration, or SBA. 
The SBA said in a news release that losses don’t have to be physical — the loans can be used to pay debts, payroll, accounts payable and other costs incurred due to the drought. 
“Through a declaration by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, SBA provides critical financial assistance to help communities recover,” Chris Stallings, associate administrator of the Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience at the SBA, said in a statement. “We’re pleased to offer loans to small businesses and private nonprofits impacted by these disasters.”

The loans can cover up to $2 million, with interest rates as low as 4% for small businesses, and 3.6% for private nonprofits, with terms up to 30 years. The interest does not accrue, and payments are not due until 12 months after they are distributed.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) will request a $5.6 billion budget for fiscal year 2027 to support programs like the Alabama Reading Initiative (ARI), English language learners (ELL) and speech pathologists.
The department plans to request $52 million to help coach struggling readers beyond third grade.  The department previously asked for the same amount and was granted $12 in supplemental funds.
The department originally requested $25 million for the program for fiscal year 2027, which starts on Oct. 1, 2026.
Alabama House passes $10 billion education budget

Tonya Chestnut, who represents District 5 on the board, said the department should ask for more.
“If we decrease it, are we really saying this is a priority or are we saying that we are trying to appeal to what we think the legislators want?” Chestnut asked during the meeting.
Chestnut proposed raising the request back to $52 million, based on a calculation from “if every struggling reader in every school got the same services” according to Alabama Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey.
“I feel that every child, regardless of where they’re located, should, if they need the support, have it available,” she said.
District 4 Representative Yvette Richardson said asking for more money would help address students who are in the gap due to Alabama Comprehensive Assessment Program (ACAP) testing.
“Because we started with $52 [million] at least ask for $52 [million] whether we get it or not because there may be some [students] that fell in between when we ended up giving the ACAP,” she said to Mackey.
The board decided to ask for the full $52 million and said they will negotiate with legislators to secure the funding.
ALSDE is also requesting additional funding for the High Needs Special Education Program for fiscal year 2027. The department is requesting an additional $3.4 million to be back to their original budget for the program.
The reason money for the program decreased for fiscal year 2026 is because it was reallocated.
“In the budget process, the legislature moved $3.4 million out of this line item to the new RAISE Act Special Education fund,” Mackey said to the board. “Districts are still getting it, but they’re getting it through the RAISE Act Special Education fund.”
The program, which was started by the board, uses the funds to ensure that students who need special assistance such as nurses or to be placed in a different school, have the resources they need.
The department will also request an additional $50.4 million for school safety. 
Mackey said the money will be used by the schools to get approved items outlined in the School Security Act including cameras, fencing, ballistic film to place on windows, weapons and metal detectors.
Another big ticket item that ALSDE proposed more funding for is assessments.
“We always ask for more money in student assessment because we’re always in the hole in student assessment,” Mackey said. “It’s a very expensive endeavor to do assessments and some of our most expensive assessments per child are not the ones we talk the most about.”
The board is proposing an $8.3 million increase in student assessments to bring their budget up to $28.8 million.
The board would use the additional money to improve the quality assurance of ACAP and virtual platforms for homeschooled students to test at home with their own devices.
ALSDE also wants to focus on expanding the career technical initiative. The board is requesting an additional $15 million be added to the budget for CTSO membership, grants, the expansion of career exploration to elementary and middle schools and expanding the Academy of Craft Training in Birmingham.
The board will vote on the budget on Oct. 9.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9616-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936
,California,2025-09-12 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Two years later, Californians still don’t know full impact of the $20 fast food wage",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/fast-food-minimum-wage-california/,"Fast food prices barely went up but jobs held steady after the wage increase, researchers in a union-friendly economic center wrote. But an industry-backed study said 19,000 jobs were lost.","As the California Legislature churns toward the end of its 2025 session this week, processing the remnants of thousands of bills introduced during the year, several measures encompass the Capitol’s most enduring conflict: Labor unions vs. employers over working conditions.
Unions seek higher wages and benefits, citing the welfare and financial needs of workers and their families. Employers counter that the cost of providing what unions want adversely affects their competitiveness in other states and nations and forces them to raise prices, reduce employment or even leave California to remain solvent.
In the main, unions fare better than employers in California’s political arena — not surprising given that union-friendly Democrats from the governor down dominate the Capitol.
One of the most intense union-employer battles arose in 2022 over legislation that would have raised the minimum wage for fast food workers to $22 an hour. It also declared that fast food franchises are merely subsidiaries of their parent chains, rather than independently owned businesses.
Fast food companies and franchisees saw it as a double whammy that not only would increase their costs but it would undermine the franchise system itself. The industry also disliked the bill’s creation of an appointed council with the power to regulate fast food working conditions, especially wages.
The measure passed both legislative houses with party-line votes, and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it. The industry responded with a campaign to put the issue on the ballot, pledging that affected corporations would spend any amount of money to overturn the law due to its effects on the franchise system.
Which faction would win such a battle will never be known, however, because a year after the bill was signed and after lengthy negotiations, a compromise was worked out and quickly enacted. It raised the minimum wage to an initial $20 an hour and left the oversight council intact, albeit with some changes. More importantly to the industry, it did not interfere with the franchise system.
The new wage went into effect in April 2024, and since then the industry and the unions have sparred over its impact not only on wages but on overall employment and fast food prices.
The factions are marking the second anniversary of the 2023 compromise by issuing reports that could not be more different.
Labor acted first with the September 5 release of an analysis by UC-Berkeley’s Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. It’s a research organization whose reports uniformly support the union side of issues.
Researchers Michael Reich and Denis Sosinskiy declared that the $20 wage did not reduce fast food employment, didn’t change the number of hours worked and “only led to minimal menu price increases (about 8 cents on a $4 burger).” They said their study included price data from more than 2,000 restaurants in California and other states.
Five days later the Virginia-based Employment Policies Institute — which was created by Berman and Company, a lobbyist for restaurant, hotel beverage, tobacco and fossil fuel interests —  issued its study based on data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
It concluded that California’s fast food industry has lost 19,102 jobs since Newsom signed the law in September 2023, including 15,988 since the law went into effect last year, more than double the rate of loss seen in fast food outlets nationally. It did not delve into fast food prices.
The two competing studies from less-than-objective sources leave us still wondering what the true impact might have been. It’s a knowledge gap that should be filled by someone or something with impeccable credentials because other business sectors might be the next targets.
In fact, there’s already a battle in Los Angeles over the $30 wage for workers at hotels and other hospitality businesses imposed by the city council.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021825-Fast-Food-JH-AP-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-12 08:56:27.683936
