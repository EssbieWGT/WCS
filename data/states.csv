(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado will continue to lease a crucial piece of state-owned infrastructure to the Union Pacific railroad for the next 25 years in exchange for help with its plans to expand passenger rail service to several mountain communities, under an agreement signed Monday.
The deal, signed by Gov. Jared Polis and Union Pacific president Beth Whited at the governor’s residence in Denver, extends the railroad giant’s lease of the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which crosses under the Continental Divide between Winter Park and Rollinsville. The state owns the tunnel, which was completed in 1926 and leased to Union Pacific for a term of 99 years. A short-term agreement had previously extended the lease for four months following its expiration in December 2024 while the new terms were finalized.
“Moffat Tunnel represents an important part of Colorado’s history, as well as a bright part of our future,” Polis said in a press release. “With this work, we are showing the country a new model for pursuing passenger rail through collaboration with the railroad.”

Following the 1997 decommissioning of the Tennessee Pass line near Leadville, the Moffat Tunnel route is the only way for trains to travel between Colorado’s Western Slope and the Front Range. In addition to regular freight traffic, the tunnel is used by Amtrak’s long-haul California Zephyr passenger line, which makes several stops in Colorado on its route between Chicago and San Francisco, and the seasonal Winter Park Express, which offers service to the Winter Park ski resort from December to March.
The core of the new lease agreement is a state license for three daily round trips, or up to 506,000 train miles annually, for a new passenger rail service between Denver and mountain communities to the northwest. The mountain route, plans for which have been floated by Colorado transportation officials for the last several years, would complement the state’s separate efforts to reestablish north-south passenger service along the Front Range, still a decade or more away.
The state promised Monday that passenger rail to the mountains will be operational much sooner than that, with daily, year-round service between Denver and Granby beginning by 2026, and “flexibility for the state to expand service in future phases” as far as Steamboat Springs, Craig and Hayden. That expansion will depend on “needed capital improvements completed that are identified in the access agreement,” the state says.
“Today’s agreement will offer residents and visitors throughout Colorado new opportunities and choices to get where they’re going,” said Sally Chafee, chief of staff for the Colorado Department of Transportation. “More passenger rail trips between the Front Range and mountain communities in Winter Park, Granby, and beyond will offer an option in addition to the drive over Berthoud Pass.”
The new lease agreement also includes provisions finalizing Union Pacific’s sale to CDOT of the Burnham Lead Line, railroad track easement near the disused Burnham Yard in central Denver. The acquisition will help facilitate the planned redevelopment of the 60-acre former rail yard site.
“Union Pacific is proud of the hard work and spirit of collaboration that went into this agreement with the State of Colorado,” Withed said. “We came together as true partners and the result is an agreement that benefits the citizens of Colorado and the businesses and people who rely upon Union Pacific to deliver the goods and material vital to today’s economy.”

Christine Todd Whitman looks on. Both are leaders of the Forward Party, a political party launching in New Mexico. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Alaska U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski is one of the few  Republicans standing up to President Trump and expressing fear that key strategic alliances, our democracy, civil liberties and the rule of law are being under-mind. She also was one of the few  Republicans to vote to impeach him.
What makes her different? What allows her to feel  free to make those statements and take that action  that are nearly unheard of right now within the  Republican MAGA party? It is the structure within which she was elected.
Alaska has non-partisan primaries that allow all  voters to vote for all candidates. Primaries are no  longer controlled by the parties. Then the top four  vote getters go to the general election where ranked  choice voting is used.
She can move through the primary without fear of  being “primaried” in a race in which only the party  base, the most MAGA, can vote. Rather, she is incentivized to reach out to all voters, and the  majority of voters want her to be independent and vote her conscience, not tow the party line. This is  what democracy reform at all levels is about: Creating a representative government that works for  all of us all the time.
This is the opposite of what Wyoming has, which is a  closed primary system. Remember how brave Congresswoman Liz Chaney was to buck her party  and vote to impeach President Trump because he incited the Capitol riots through his election  denialism? Well, she lost her Republican primary  election in Wyoming by a huge margin because only Republicans could vote.
But, so what? Why is that important today here in  New Mexico?
The New Mexico Legislature recently passed SB16, which allows independent voters to choose one major  party ballot. This is one small step toward that ideal where all voters can vote for all candidates. I spent 10 years as founder and president of NM Open Elections working on its passage.
It will set up a situation in which partisan candidates have to reach out to independent voters who will not  have the same feelings about party discipline as the party base, and I mean with both the Republicans and the Democrats. It means candidates and  incumbents alike will have to do a better job of  spreading their message and listening to a broader cross section of the voting public. And it means there  is a better chance that incumbents can vote their  conscience, rather than bending to a party line that they may or may not agree with all the time. And the outcome of this freedom will be better policies  representing a broader cross section of voters.
I know that we are years away from being able to  pass the next steps in democracy reform here in New  Mexico, but we have taken the first step by ending our closed primary system. But make no mistake there have to be next steps.
Step one: Educate independents that they can vote in  the 2026 primary and make sure large majorities do.  Let’s prove the pundits wrong and show that  independent voters will come out to vote when given  the chance.
Step two: Support candidates who will prioritize  reaching out to those independent voters and teach  them how to communicate with these non-aligned  voters.
Step three: Plan for the next steps in reform including finally passing an independent redistricting  commission, paying our Legislature, placing term limits on our Legislature to match the term limits we  have on nearly every other office and moving to a truly open primary system in which all voters can vote for all candidates in first round public elections.
To be sure, Democrats supported SB16 in greater numbers than Republicans and I deeply appreciate that. But Democrats oppose nearly every reform in step three above as do Republicans. The other states that have adopted these reforms, and there are many, all have legislative by-pass through ballot initiate where a voter can gather signatures and place an  issue on the ballot. We don’t have that here.
Unfortunately, both major parties play politics with the law to game the system. When President Biden  declined to seek re-election, why did the Democratic  Party refuse to hold a primary or even an open  convention so that many candidates could be heard and vetted?
It’s time for a party to put voters first and that is why I am now working with others to found the New  Mexico Forward Party. We support all the democracy reform issues listed above and will be running  candidates in 2026 for the State House of Representatives against those law makers who voted  against open primaries.

The House-approved annual budget bill reveals policy and political fault lines
The post Weekly Roundup – Budget Bonanza appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","BEACON HILL passed another annual mile marker with House approval of an annual budget bill, and as is often the case, the road there was more interesting for the way it revealed policy and political fault lines than for the nuts and bolts of spending state dollars.Yes, representatives added some $81 million to the bottom line, but they also tilted at times into discussion of immigration enforcement, clean energy mandates, communication between incarcerated individuals and their loved ones, and much more.In most cases, the topics got a few minutes in the spotlight because Republicans pushed for public discussion and standalone recorded votes. And virtually every time, Democrats flexed their power-in-numbers strength and circled the wagons to reject GOP proposals to tack serious policy changes onto the budget.That doesn’t mean they limited amendments only to earmarks. House Democrats slipped a few eye-catching initiatives of their own into the mega-amendments they hashed out in private, including language prohibiting the Department of Mental Health from cutting caseworker levels beyond fiscal 2025 levels.Another provision quietly tucked into the House budget would require employers with 25 or more workers who do not already offer a qualified retirement plan to automatically enroll workers into a state-run retirement savings plan, or else face fines.While Republicans generated commentary and recorded votes on several high-profile topics, they did not present a unified front over the course of the week.Only a subset of the 25-member House GOP caucus expressed support for roll call votes on several tax policy proposals from Rep. Marc Lombardo of Billerica, and the same pattern played out again when first-term Rep. John Gaskey tried to force a roll call during a debate about transgender athletes in high school sports.The kerfuffle over tax amendments prompted Lombardo, who mounted a failed bid to become House GOP leader at the start of the term, to call for House Minority Leader Brad Jones to resign from that post.“This is unbelievable. This is absolutely treasonous from the Republican leader to not want to give roll calls for the taxpayers,” Lombardo said in a video he posted to social media from outside the House chamber. “You’re not hurting me. The amendment went down just the same. What you’ve done is hurt the party, for candidates that want to run, and you’ve hurt the taxpayers who want to understand how their representatives vote. Brad Jones conspired with the Democrats today. I expect more of that this week. He needs to resign.”Jones fired back, saying the lack of unified Republican support for roll calls on Lombardo’s idea was a result of the Billerica rep not showing up to private meetings, according to the Boston Herald.“I’m not going to go waste my time working with people who just want to kick me. It’s kind of human nature. It’s not Republican, not Democrat … it’s just human nature,” Jones said, per the Herald. “He’s obviously still hurting over the fact that he got smoked.”Said Lombardo: “Brad Jones might be the Republican manager but he certainly is not the Republican leader. Leaders take care of their team and do what’s right for the team and lift everybody up. We don’t try to create division in the ranks. And that’s what Brad did earlier this week. Perhaps he’s upset that he’s getting local opposition for him supporting massive earmarks that the Democrats are putting in and actively conspiring with the Democrats against Republican initiatives.”The budget now moves across the hall to the Senate, where the top Democrat this week cautioned the plan the Senate plans to pass this month might shift considerably later in the year if federal funds are pulled back.Senate President Karen Spilka said the budget that makes its way back to Gov. Maura Healey’s desk “may not be the final budget if some of these cuts, or many of them, unfortunately prove true.”Beacon Hill Democrats have spent months talking up the damage of potential federal actions, while not making spending adjustments and expressing hope that the Washington funding faucet will stay in the open position.The governor, often a vocal critic of Trump, finds herself walking a fine line these days, especially as peers like Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan draws criticism and interest from some corners for actively fostering a relationship with the president.“Any governor in any state wants to have a good working relationship with the federal administration, and that continues to be the case,” Healey said. “What is also clear after 100 days is that this federal administration is finding ways to hurt our states left and right.”Before they get to their annual budget rewrite, senators will take up another spending bill putting to use about $1.3 billion in collected-but-not-appropriated revenue from the voter-approved surtax on wealthy households.The draft that emerged this week augurs tricky negotiations between House and Senate Democrats.Both the House and Healey proposed directing most of that money toward transportation and the T in particular, where recent service improvements could be threatened by a budget gap. The Senate, however, suggested a more even education-transportation split and less than half as much one-time MBTA funding as did the other two corners of the Big Three.Senate budget chief Michael Rodrigues said his team wanted to “maintain as close to a 50-50 split as possible between education and transportation,” describing “serious concerns” about special education costs in school districts.The spending dispute is one of the first big pressure points this term for House and Senate Democrats, who four months in still have not agreed to final rules reforms they touted as a way to boost transparency.Other signs of tension are emerging, like when House budget chief Aaron Michlewitz capped off completion of his chamber’s annual budget bill by taking a shot at the Senate.Less than an hour after the engrossment vote, Michlewitz circulated an email listing which representatives attended which Ways and Means Committee hearings in recent months — in the process resurfacing a House-Senate disagreement over in-person attendance requirements.“Per the rules proposals passed by the House, our intention is to regularly publish this committee member attendance information on the legislature’s website,” Michlewitz wrote. “However to this point we have been unable to do so, because the Senate has not allowed Legislative Information Services, our joint IT department, to publicly post House member committee attendance.”Zing! And on the subject of transparency, the Ways and Means Committee that Michlewitz leads is one of the few on Beacon Hill that notify the press when they are voting to move bills out of committee.The state Department of Public Utilities also ruffled feathers this week with a sudden regulatory action further reducing how much gas companies can charge customers for replacing pipes.DPU Chair James Van Nostrand said the change would provide savings for ratepayers at a time of high energy costs, slamming gas companies for “costing the state’s ratepayers billions for over a decade” via “unnecessary” Gas System Enhancement Plan projects.But some figures are less than thrilled. The business-backed Mass Coalition for Sustainable Energy called on regulators to rethink the order “and ignore unrealistic, ideologically driven assumptions that put our safety and economic future at risk.”The post Weekly Roundup – Budget Bonanza appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bigstock-Massachusetts-State-House-Bos-31318976.jpg?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

Sarah Trone Garriott announced Monday she will run as a Democratic candidate for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District.
Currently, the 3rd District is represented by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican who has held the seat since defeating former U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, a Democrat, in the 2022 election. The Iowa House seat, covering much of the Des Moines metropolitan area and much of of central and southern Iowa, is expected to be one of the most competitive districts in the 2026 general election.
Trone Garriott, currently representing West Des Moines in the Iowa Senate, said in a video announcing her campaign she was well-suited to run for the seat because of her track record winning in competitive state legislative races.
“I’m no stranger to tough fights,” Trone Garriott said. “I’m the only Iowa Democrat who flipped two seats from red to blue, then won a district that went to Trump in 2024. I know how to win, and I know how to deliver for Iowans.”
She was first elected to the Iowa Legislature in 2020, when she defeated Republican Scott Cirksena to represent Iowa State Senate District 22. In 2022, she defeated then-Senate President Jake Chapman to represent Senate District 14 after redistricting, and won a close race against GOP challenger Mark Hanson in 2024.
Trone Garriott, a 46-year-old Lutheran pastor, said she would work in Congress to lower the costs of child care, health care and housing, as well as “restoring the rights and freedoms lost in recent years.” She also criticized Nunn’s time in Congress, saying “Zach Nunn has failed us.”
“As Iowans struggle with higher costs, attacks on our personal freedoms and reckless cuts to our public schools, Zach Nunn is not showing up,” Trone Garriott said. “He’s not listening, and he’s not working for us. Iowans know that I show up for all my constituents, and that I listen and that I speak out.”
Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson with the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans’ campaign arm, criticized Trone Garriott in a statement Monday.
“Out of touch Democrat Sarah Trone Garriott is another activist attempting to radicalize Iowa — pushing a dangerous, extreme agenda that would raise costs, allow men in girls’ sports, and weaken public safety,” Tuttle said. “Iowans want leaders who deliver commonsense results, and that’s exactly why they’ll send Zach Nunn back to Congress.”
While Nunn has not officially announced a reelection campaign, he is expected to run for the seat again in 2026. He ruled out a run for governor last week in an interview on the WHO AM Simon Conway show, saying he is focused on his work in Washington, D.C., on issues like cutting taxes and securing the U.S. southern border.
Nunn won in 2024 against Democrat Lanon Baccam with roughly 52% of the vote. In the previous election, the race was rated as a “tossup” by some political forecasters — Sabato’s Crystal Ball now has the seat, alongside Iowa’s 1st Congressional District currently represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, listed as “tossup” races heading into 2026.
House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has highlighted Nunn’s seat, as well as Miller-Meeks’ and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson’s, as “Districts in Play” in the upcoming midterm elections, areas where Democrats plan to focus their efforts to flip seats and potentially regain control of the U.S. House.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, and Zach Nunn are running scared, and they should be,” DCCC Chair Suzan DelBene said in an April statement. “From tanking the economy, gutting Medicaid, abandoning our veterans, to making everything more expensive, they’ve broken their promises to Iowans, and it’s going to cost them their seats. The DCCC is already working to recruit authentic and battle-ready candidates in Iowa who reflect these districts and will work to better Iowans’ lives, not line Elon Musk and their DC party bosses’ pockets.”
Trone Garriott is not the only Democrat expected to run in Iowa’s 3rd District. Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst and Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, have also said they are considering running for the seat, though Trone Garriott is the first to officially launch her campaign.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8284-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

(DOTD video via Franklin Associates)Road construction and repair is arguably the most visible sign of government at work, so it’s no surprise that the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development – with an $19 billion backlog of highway projects – is in the crosshairs of Republican state leaders pushing for a public agency revamp.
A package of legislation promises to deliver that overhaul of DOTD, which employs 4,300 state workers. Its key components are scheduled for debate Tuesday in the state House of Representatives. 
But there are concerns the changes will be radical rather than surgical, bringing to mind a chainsaw-wielding Elon Musk and the federal government cuts his Department of Government Efficiency has made. The Trump administration has since had to rescind many of those dismissals.
The proposals to shakeup DOTD would place more control over highway construction projects directly under the governor’s office, with an emphasis on infrastructure considered critical to economic development. Critics worry that underscoring expediency could come at the cost of safety when designing and building roads and bridges.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rep. Ryan Bourriaque, R-Abbeville, authored the proposals and rejects suggestions that his bills bear any resemblance to the DOGE-driven purge in Washington. For starters, he said efforts to reconfigure DOTD have been shaped through bipartisan feedback from members of the House Committee on Transportation he chairs. It’s held monthly meetings since January specifically to get input on his proposals, he said. 
“I don’t think a lot of the things we’re talking about surprise a lot of people, you know, because we’ve had these discussions,” Borriaque said last month in an interview.
Long-distance dedication
Borriaque’s House Bill 556 would restrict the DOTD’s use of the state Transportation Trust Fund to actual construction projects. That would end the practice of using the money to pay DOTD employee salaries and benefits that goes back more than 30 years. 
The fund, established in 1990 with a specific dedication to roadwork, gets its proceeds from taxes on gasoline and motor fuels. Beyond having employee pay siphoned from the account, the fund revenue stream struggled to keep up with increases in construction costs.  
Borriaque’s proposed changes mean compensation for DOTD employees, which comes to $438 million next fiscal year, would have to come out of the state general fund. There’s consensus among lawmakers for limiting the trust fund to actual construction, an objective they’ve discussed for years but never figured out how to achieve. 
To accomplish it, it means the governor and lawmakers would have to cover DOTD personnel costs while facing a budget deficit that will exceed $570 million in another two years, according to the most recent legislative fiscal staff forecasts. 
Lawmakers don’t have to tackle this math for another year, as Bourriaque’s measures wouldn’t take effect until July 1, 2026. 
Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, the legislature’s lead author of the state budget, told The Advocate last week money in the general fund that has been put toward DOTD projects in the state construction budget will cover employee overhead at the agency instead.   
Power shifts
Bourriaque originally wanted to give DOTD’s secretary more authority to “eliminate any position within the department,” reinforcing an executive order Gov. Jeff Landry issued last May. Bourriaque has since updated the job reduction provisions to align with state Civil Service rules, acknowledging the legislature cannot unilaterally have classified employees fired. 
Rep. Joy Walters, D-Shreveport, was among the few members of the transportation committee who pushed back on unfettered DOTD employee reductions without any prior assessment of the impacted professionals or their importance to the agency.  
“I do know that change is necessary. Change is good,” Walters said in an April 15 interview. “But I believe also in transparency.”
Gov. Landry might get the insurance laws he wants, but not without ruffling some Republican feathers

Another concern for Walters lies within Bourriaque’s House Bill 640, which creates the Office of Louisiana Highway Construction in the governor’s Division of Administration. The office would have its own executive director and staff, but there are no details yet on the size of the staff or compensation for these new government positions.
Proposed measures within House Bill 528 by Bourriaque would allow the governor to appoint a deputy secretary for the new DOTD Office of Transformation, which was launched in January. It was among the recommendations of a Boston Consulting Group review of department operations and structure, which led to a DOTD “strategic improvement plan.”   
The ultimate goal of the governor might be to do away with DOTD, Walters said, and replace it with the state Office of Highway Construction. The governor has never stated this is his intent, but the creation of a new Division of Administration offshoot for transportation seems to move away from the DOGE philosophy of shrinking government, according to Walters.
“If you ask me, we are giving the governor a lot of rein outside of the scope of what is necessarily needed to run government effectively,” she said. “My strong concern is that we are politicizing that particular position, and then you can be hired and fired really quickly.”
Walters said she’s more amenable to a provision in House Bill 556 that creates an assistant secretary of project delivery within DOTD. Borriaque referred to the role as a “change agent” that would replace the current post of chief engineer. Walters’ research into transportation agencies in other states found that California has a similar position with oversight of thousands of employees directly involved in highway construction.
Expert advice
When Bourriaque’s bills advanced from the transportation committee, there were questions about whether it would reduce the number of engineers at the agency. In an interview, he said amendments on the House floor would likely restore the chief engineer’s duties and carve out a more specific job description for the new project delivery leader.
Peter Robins-Brown with Louisiana Progress, an advocacy group for the poor and working class, asked committee members to keep safety in mind when shaking up the DOTD. He linked improved conditions for pedestrians and cyclists with the ongoing legislative efforts to bring down auto insurance costs.  
“The fear is that in the rush to catch up with that backlog – which is important, right, like we need to catch up with that backlog as quickly as we can – we don’t want to see what is already, apparently not a very good process for creating safer roads. We don’t want to see that get bumped down the priority list,” Robins-Brown said in a subsequent interview. 
Norma Jean Mattei, an engineering faculty member  at the University of New Orleans, is also part of the Louisiana Transportation Research Center, DOTD’s testing and experimentation arm. 
Mattei, who was national president of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2017, said any reform at the department should take place with preserving institutional knowledge in mind, given the relatively short career spans of politicians. 
“One of the issues with elected officials is they come in and they only have this lens of four to eight years, and they’re gone,” Mattei told the Illuminator. “Then somebody else comes in with another vision. You want to have some type of continuity so that there’s not this knee-jerk reaction … you wipe everything clean every time we’ve got a new person in charge.”

Janet Mills enters the House chamber for the annual joint State of the Judiciary address on Feb. 25, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills and the leaders of five other northeast states extended an invitation to Canadian leaders Monday to discuss the importance of cross-border relationships amid actions from the Trump administration that have threatened them. 
While additional details regarding the time and date of the meeting were not available, the leaders proposed to meet in Boston in “the near future,” according to a news release from Mills’ office. 
“Our economies and our cultures have enjoyed strong relationships for generations, which is now strained by the president’s haphazard tariffs and harmful rhetoric targeting our northern neighbors,” Mills said. 
She added that she looks forward to telling her Eastern Canada counterparts that Maine values their partnerships and “will work to ensure our historic friendship and deeply intertwined economies endure for generations to come.”
The invite came from Mills, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, Rhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee, and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott — the only Republican in the group. It was sent to the premiers of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Québec.
As President Donald Trump has gone back and forth on imposing tariffs, some as high as 25%, on Maine’s northern neighbor, Mills, along with Maine’s business community, has warned that any new tax would have a significant negative impact on the state. 
In radio addresses and other statements, she has also underscored how vital Canada is to the state’s economy, especially as a trade partner. Every year, Maine exports $1.4 billion in goods to Canada and in turn imports more than $5 billion worth of goods. 
Mills specifically said that any new tax could increase costs for daily essentials such as gasoline and food. The most heating oil dependent state in the nation, Maine imports more than 80% of its heating fuel and gasoline from Canada, the release said.
Similarly, the agriculture sector said in early April that the tariffs could incite a trade war that would increase costs for consumers and eat away at already thin profit margins. 
Mills is also concerned that Trump rhetoric about Canada could harm Maine’s summer tourism season. Last year, Canadian visitors spent nearly half a billion dollars in Maine, but Mills’ office said estimates show that the state could see Canadian tourists drop by about 25%. 
“Whether Canadians decide to visit this summer (and we truly hope they do) or at a later time, they will always find a warm welcome in Maine,” said Carolann Ouellette, director of the Maine Office of Tourism.
While it’s not clear whether or how much the tariffs will directly impact electricity, the Maine Office of Public Advocate has raised concern about the potential impact on customers, especially 58,000 ratepayers in Aroostook and Washington counties who live along the border and have little choice but to rely on Canadian energy to keep their lights on.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates that around 4,200 missing and murdered Indigenous peoples cases are currently unsolved as law enforcement agencies are not responding effectively or urgently to violence faced by the indigenous and culturally competent resources are scarce.

And while Michigan made strides last legislative session to expand funding for resources for indigenous violence victims and connecting indigenous stakeholders to lawmakers, leaders in Michigan must holdfast to the commitment to end the crisis of violence, Melissa Pope, chief judge of the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi Tribal Court, chief justice of the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians Tribal Court and member of the Michigan Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention and Treatment Board said in a statement on Friday.
“In addition to the full enactment of the laws addressing this crisis, we must commit the resources necessary for immediate and ongoing searches when Indigenous People go missing until they are found,” Pope said. “We must also commit the resources to provide safety to victims while offering culturally honoring services to heal the trauma of survivors, support the families of the missing, and honor those who have been murdered while supporting the loved ones whose lives will be forever changed. Of crucial importance is the prosecution of those who murder and commit violence against Indigenous People. It is only through these combined efforts that Indigenous People will be safe from violence.”
The majority of indigenous people will experience violence in their life, with the National Institute of Justice reporting that 83% of men and women in the community will experience violence in their lifetime, a rate 52% higher than the general population. And women and girls are almost twice as likely to experience sexual violence than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts.
Michigan is home to 12 federally recognized tribes and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer posted a video on “X” Monday calling violence against indigenous Michiganders unacceptable, and applauding the Michigan Attorney General’s Office for creating a Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Task Force late last year to investigate long-overlooked cases.

“We all need to do more to raise awareness and pursue justice. Since taking office, I’ve been committed to working closely with tribal governments so we can address historic traumas and develop specific policies and protocols to investigate and reduce all incidents of violence against indigenous women and girls,” Whitmer said. “The bottom line is, no one should live in fear, and every victim deserves justice. But let’s keep working together to make it happen.”
In recognizing May 5 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons (MMIP) Awareness Day, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) addressed violence against Indigenous Michiganders in a news release as a “crisis” that the department is urgently addressing.
In the interest of raising awareness and honoring the lives that have been lost in Michigan, the state health department is calling attention to the Division of Victim Services (DVS) which provides grant funding to Michigan tribes to address sexual violence, domestic violence and other victim services in a culturally honoring manner.
Elizabeth Hertel, Director of the state health department, in a news release said the state health department is not simply committed to raising awareness, but partnering with tribal communities to best address violence and the impact it has on the entire community.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Facetune_03-05-2024-13-21-13-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

Linda Dunbar, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians and marginalized Communities advocate for New Day Advocacy Centers, said when she was in foster care 50 years ago in St. Paul, Minnesota, her mother was murdered and her killer was never charged.
Rose Barber, a member of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, a Wisconsin Murdered, Missing, Indigenous Women and Relatives (MMIWR) Task Force Member, and president of American Indians Against Abuse, said decades ago, an Alaskan Native friend went missing and his body was never found. Even today, nobody knows what happened to him.
After a round dance performed by the Red Cliff Women’s Hand Drum group, dozens of names were read of tribal members from Minnesota and Wisconsin who are officially listed as murdered or missing, names such as Melissa Beson of Lac du Flambeau, missing since March 17, Gene J. Cloud, Jr. of Black River Falls, Lisa Lynn Ninham of Menominee County and Nevaeh Leigh Kingbird of Bemidji, Minnesota.

And then more names were shouted out, names that had never been officially reported but who family members said had just disappeared and were never heard from again or who died a mysterious death.
The names were honored at the No More MMWIR event, which was held Sunday, May 4, in Bayview Park in Ashland by the shore of Lake Superior.
The event is one of several being held around the nation during the month of May to raise awareness of the MMIWR issue that has plagued tribal communities nationwide. On some tribal reservations, the murder rate for tribal women is ten times the national average. Tribal members face violence, both domestic and outside their families, at a higher rate than the general population. Several factors contribute to the MMIWR phenomenon including the fact that missing people belong to a vulnerable population that has suffered historical trauma and is disproportionately affected by poverty and substance abuse; exploitation associated with itinerant workers in mining and oil camps near reservations; and an inconsistent track record of law enforcement committing resources to solve murders or finding missing person.
Justine Rufus, co-chair of the Wisconsin MMIWR Task Force, rural coordinator of the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, and a Bad River member, spoke about the need for state funding to address the issue.
Rufus said that since the task force was created five years ago, awareness of the MMIWR issue has grown, but the number of MMIWR cases has also risen.

“We can keep creating awareness and education, which is very important,” she said. “What we really need is actual action to address this crisis. Our relatives are going missing at higher rates now since we created this task force. We are being murdered at higher rates. We are being sex trafficked higher than we’ve ever seen, so it takes real action.”
Rufus said no state has designated dollars for the MMIWR issue in its budget. (Minnesota sends a percentage of license plate fees to underwrite its MMIWR Office, part of the Department of Public Safety.)
She noted that Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed budget includes $3.5 million to create 11 MMIWR liaison offices with the 11 tribes in the state, working with the Attorney general and the Department of Justice.
“I applaud Gov. Evers for putting this in the budget,” she said. “He’s the first governor in the nation to put any dollars towards this crisis. But now is the time of action. We need to call your legislators to tell them that we demand to continue this work.”
Rufus also called for more funding for law enforcement. “Some of our communities don’t even have law enforcement,” she said. She noted the ongoing search for Melissa Beson in Vilas County has consumed many resources.
Rufus encouraged the crowd to contact legislative Joint Finance Committee members to urge them to approve funding for MMIWR issues.
Rene Ann Goodrich, a Bad River tribal member and MMIWR advocate for the last 10 years, who is a member of the Wisconsin MMIWR Task Force and a board member of the Minnesota MMIWR Office, a member of the Native Lives Matter Coalition and the No More MMIW and Relatives Movement, noted the local effort in the Twin Ports area of Superior and Duluth, Minnesota to raise awareness.
She said MMIWR events feature important Native American elements.
“I wanted to share a little bit about some of the cultural practices that we bring as a people to the contemporary missing and murdered indigenous women and relatives movement that helps to promote the healing for our families and our communities.”
She noted the cultural practice of offering tobacco and prayers to request guidance. And she talked about how the red dress had become the official symbol of the MMIWR movement. For Native Americans, red represents a “connection between the physical and spiritual world.”
“The red dresses began with our sisters doing this work and advocacy for lost loved ones up in Canada, and so we’ve started the work down here about 10 years ago with the red dresses,” she said, “so we’re asking for communities from Minnesota to Wisconsin to please start hanging out those red dresses and hang out red shirts also, because our men, our boys, our two spirits people, they matter, too, and we want to honor them.”
For many tribal people who had dealt with historical trauma, including the legacy of family members being shipped to federal boarding schools, Goodwich said, it is difficult to talk about the MMIWR issue but the red dress or red shirt is a way to raise awareness.
“I understand that it’s a difficult topic, and it’s very difficult for many of us to be able to speak about this movement, this legacy of trauma, this intergenerational trauma that we do carry,” she said. “So the red dresses are a quiet form of advocacy. They speak for themselves. Hang out a red dress on your porch; hang it in your yard. You’re spreading awareness that way. You don’t necessarily need to have all the data or the background, but this is a quiet, honoring form of advocacy that everyone can do.”
Goodwich noted that she and her granddaughter, Alexis, were gathering names family members wanted to honor, including those who have not been officially recognized as missing or murdered.
“As we become more educated and more familiar about this epidemic and how it impacts us, Indigenous people disproportionately across Turtle Island (Earth), leaving us with this legacy, including the boarding school, the legacy from this colonization, how this violence disproportionately impacts our women and our girls …  we’re learning more each year about the broad spectrum of violence that is this movement,” said Goodwich.

Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) represents a district that includes the Bad River and Red Cliff bands of Lake Superior Chippewa.
“We know that part of what makes this such a major issue that has been so difficult to solve as a country, as a state, is that we’ve just failed to make missing and murdered Indigenous people a priority,” said Stroud.
“My experience tells me that when native people are struggling, too often there’s a tendency for systems of power to have an attitude that it’s not our problem, like it’s a problem of tribes or just the problem of local communities,” she added.
Stroud said the legacy of state violence and the scourges of drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, homicide and human trafficking are connected. 
She called on people living on ceded Native American land to recognize  “the moral responsibility of our government to prioritize missing and murdered Indigenous people.”
“So as the state representative of this area of Bad River and Red Cliff and any other indigenous people who live in the 73rd, I want you to know that I care, that I see you, and I will do what I can to walk this journey with you of finding those who are missing and sitting together in the pain of those who are gone,” she said.

Dunbar noted that the Red Cliff Women’s Hand Drum Group, performing for the event, had formed to support the community, and each woman had made her own hand drum as part of her spiritual quest.
“These women wanted to come today and sing songs for everyone here for healing and for their own healing,” she said.
Those who are left behind after a family member goes missing or is murdered have a need to heal, Dunbar said, and she recounted her own experience.
“People ask me why I am so motivated to work on the MMIWR issue,” she said. “When I was a little girl, my mother was killed in Saint Paul, Minnesota. They never, ever arrested the person who killed her. They took her body and placed it in a grave, and for some 50 years my family has been looking for her grave, and as the Creator would have it, this past fall we were able to find her grave. Most of my brothers have passed on. There are only three of us left out of nine. And so our nieces and our nephews and our grandchildren are going to journey to her grave this spring to do that ceremony to welcome her home.”

Chip Campsen, Majority Leader Shane Massey and Stephen Goldfinch chat in the Senate chamber during the first week of the 2024 session Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024, in Columbia, S.C. (File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — This week will decide the fate of a massive energy package in South Carolina, after the House removed measures meant to safeguard consumers and landowners in the push to meet power needs of the state’s rapidly growing industry and population.
To produce enough energy to keep the lights on in the Palmetto State, utility executives told legislators, they needed guarantees that state regulators would review power-related permits in a timely manner and prevent years-long delays of new pipelines and power plants in the court system.
In exchange, senators told the utility sector it must ensure residential customers weren’t bearing the brunt of industry-driven power needs, particularly those of energy-intensive data centers. They also said utilities must give landowners earlier notice when construction of power plants, power lines and pipelines impact their property and that more effort was needed to help customers conserve energy and lower their power bills.
‘Cutting-edge’ supercomputing facility, a $2.8B investment, planned for Spartanburg County

But last week, state House members quietly pulled those give-and-take protections for power customers and landowners, potentially putting passage at risk with just three days left in the legislative session.
With a vote of 88-13 last Thursday, the House stripped out everything the Senate added related to data centers. Under the House version, center developers don’t have to bear their share of costs for new power plants built to power them or disclose how much water they plan to use. And they can still earn sales tax credits for computer equipment bought for the centers.
Rep. Gil Gatch, R-Summerville, told his colleagues the amendment was the result of a compromise between House and Senate negotiators.
Little else was said beyond Rep. Robert Reese asking what the amendment did about data centers, and Gatch pledging those concerns will be addressed in separate legislation next year. Reese, of rural Hopkins, was among the 13 Democrats who rejected the changes.
Other items struck by the amendment received no mention at all on the floor: Gone are additional notice requirements for landowners impacted by eminent domain, which is the taking of private property for public use. It also scaled back energy efficiency efforts.
Gatch, joined at the podium by other members of the House committee that has shepherded the bill, told the chamber it was the committee’s understanding the negotiated changes would pass in the Senate, allowing a bill two years in the making to head to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk this week.
But the Senate leaders who authored the provisions removed by the House told the SC Daily Gazette they were not part of negotiations. And they highly doubt the Legislature will revisit anything on data centers next year if the altered bill becomes law.
‘Under the gun’
The amended bill could come up for a vote in the Senate as soon as Tuesday. A final decision must be made by 5 p.m. Thursday — the end of the session, as per state law — or negotiations will carry over until next year. Power company executives have said passage this year is essential to future projects.
At the heart of the bill, sponsored by GOP House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter, is permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility company Santee Cooper to partner on a possible 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant on the site of a former coal-fired power plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
In its original form, the legislation saw significant pushback on its sweeping regulatory changes and rollback of consumer protections passed in the wake of South Carolina’s failed nuclear expansion. Both bodies ultimately left those existing protections alone.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

The reason the House removed most provisions added by the Senate during its floor debate, according to Rep. Bill Herbkersman, was contract deadlines faced by Dominion and Santee Cooper. The deadlines involve an interstate natural gas pipeline needed to supply the proposed Lowcountry gas plant and other supplies related to the project.
The House felt “under the gun” to pass something, and the new restrictions were “not really part of what we were trying to do,” in the energy bill aimed at speeding up the regulatory process for utilities as they make updates to the state’s power grid, Herberksman said, adding they hadn’t been vetted by the House committee he chairs.
“You wouldn’t half bake a cake,” said the Bluffton Republican.
One change made in the Senate, however, did survive: The House kept a Senate-added section that would make it easier for utilities to raise power bills on an annual basis.
‘Utility wish list’
The changes approved by the House last Thursday renewed criticism of the bill from environmental and consumer groups who say all that’s left is a “utility wish list.”
“What is in this bill to protect customers?” asked Kate Mixson, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “What’s left is just a list of things that make it easier for utilities and far fewer things to keep power companies from overbuilding and passing the cost on to consumers.”
“With these changes, this legislation is basically like an open bar tab for utility company spending that the public will pay for on their electric bills,” added Eddy Moore of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.
Herbkersman called that characterization a “misnomer,” arguing the gas plant at Canadys would allow Santee Cooper to replace parts of its coal-fired fleet with natural gas that emits fewer greenhouse gases. It would also guarantee the state has the energy it needs as it continues to grow.
SC’s state-owned utility enacts higher rates for data centers, large users

Senators who don’t like the so-called compromise — and weren’t involved in closed-door negotiations — include the chamber’s GOP leader.
“The data center language was one of the few things I liked about the bill, and it was not very aggressive,” said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, who authored the data center provisions.
The Edgefield Republican vowed to make his displeasure known when senators take up the bill on the floor.
“South Carolinians are going to pay more for energy generation, and citizens are going to pay more than they should for data centers … which to me is completely unacceptable,” Massey said.
Frank Knapp, president of the SC Small Business Chamber of Commerce, encouraged senators to “stick to their guns” when it comes to the power-gobbling centers.
‘It will not go easy’
While the Senate passed its version overwhelmingly last month, “it will not go easy this time, even if the votes are there,” Massey said.
Everything added on the Senate floor was important to the members who voted for it, said Sen. Tom Davis. For the Beaufort Republican, it was requiring public utility companies to do more to help customers make their homes energy efficient.
As part of these programs, power companies send inspectors to people’s homes to check for gaps in windows, leaking ducts and outdated air conditioning systems that might contribute to higher energy usage. The companies offer rebates and discounts to customers who make home improvements, and in some cases, power companies cover the costs for low-income families.
The savings rate the Senate was asking for is far below levels set across much of the country, Davis said.
Duke Energy is already meeting what the Senate version would require, but Dominion Energy would have to step up its effort.
SC nuclear reboot sees interest from big tech, large utilities

The House, however, left it up to energy regulators to decide on an appropriate savings level. What it approved Thursday also took away penalties.
Under a provision authored by Sen. Shane Martin of Spartanburg County, developers would need to contact all landowners in the path of a pipeline, power line or power plant two months before filing for any state-level permits. The companies also would have to inform landowners about their neighbors who were impacted and whether there were alternative routes considered.
It’s unclear if the measure would have applied to the pipeline feeding Canadys, which crosses state lines, so it’s federally regulated.
“The fact the House would remove this says to me they don’t want these affected landowners to know,” Mixson said. “My question is why. If these projects are really necessary — if they’re not going to be dangerous — then why not notify these communities and landowners.”
Davis said senators must now weigh the House changes against the importance of getting a bill across the finish line. Both he and Massey said taking up these provisions in standalone legislation next year will be hard to do.
“I have very little confidence that that will happen next year,” Massey said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_4985-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill (HB 1205) making it more challenging to place citizen-led constitutional amendments on the ballot, an organization working on just such an effort announced Monday that it’s going to court to block the measure.
Florida Decides Healthcare has been working for more than a year to get its proposed constitutional amendment on expanding Medicaid on the statewide ballot in November 2026. The organizers complain the state has changed the rules in the middle of the process — which is why the organization has so quickly filed its lawsuit.
The plan is to seek a temporary restraining order to stop the law from being enforced.
“This bill is not about improving the ballot initiative process. It attacks the fundamental freedom of Floridians to participate in their own democracy,’ said Mitch Emerson, executive director of Florida Decides Healthcare, in a remote press call on Monday morning. “It’s a calculated and cowardly attempt by politicians in Tallahassee to rewrite the rules, not to serve the people, but to protect their own power. This is not reform, this is repression.”
Republicans led by the governor claim that such legislation is required because of concerns about alleged fraud in the petition-gathering process. For proof, they cited throughout the legislative session a report published by the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security in January asserting that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights amendment last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions
“We have seen widespread and rampant fraud in this state and in this process,” said Lee County Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka, who sponsored the bill in the House. “We have evidence that we cannot take a blind eye to. We must take further action to put integrity back into the initiative process.”
The bill prohibits felons, noncitizens, and non-Florida residents from acting as petition circulators; requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for petition circulators; requires the sponsor to deliver petitions to supervisors of elections in the counties in which the voter resides within 10 days after the voter signs the form; and says that anyone who doesn’t register with the state as a signature-gatherer and possesses more than 25 signed petitions beyond their own and immediate family members faces a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison.
‘Traps’
“These are not tweaks, they are traps,” Emerson said Monday. “These new rules are designed to make it nearly impossible for everyday people to have a voice in the laws that change their lives.”
The lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of Florida on Sunday night. In it, Emerson claims that the new law will force Florida Decides Healthcare “to impose an extended moratorium on its petition circulation activities, severely impacting or eliminating the ability to circulate petitions and gather sufficient support for the placement of its 2026 initiative on the 2026 general election ballot.”
Floridians in recent years have raised the minimum wage, legalized medical marijuana, and restored the rights of felons to vote by going through the constitutional amendment process.
“Floridians have fought for these things that they have advocated for at the Capitol year after year after year, and then to see the immediate response in the Legislature a year after those amendments have passed making it harder and more difficult to access this constitutional right,” said Matletha Bennette, a senior staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. “The implementation of this law affects all Floridians, whether they have signed the petition or not, because it affects the ability to make the changes that they want when they really want to see it.”
In 2024, there were two high-profile proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot in Florida — one to legalize the adult recreational use of cannabis, the other to enshrine abortion rights into the Florida Constitution. Both received more than 55% support, a clear majority but short of the 60% threshold required for passage.
Gov. Ron DeSantis campaigned intensely against both measures and ended up spending taxpayer dollars in that effort. That action could not repeated, however, under a provision of the new law that prohibits anyone in state government from authorizing expenditure of public funds for a political advertisement or any other communication for a citizen-led constitutional amendment campaign.
‘Dark money’
Amendments 3 and 4 were also opposed by the Republican Party of Florida. In a statement on Monday, RPOF Chair Evan Power blasted the announcement that a lawsuit against the new law had been filed.
“It’s no surprise that well-funded, left-wing dark money groups —many backed by anonymous donors and based outside of Florida — are resorting to lawsuits in a desperate attempt to overturn HB 1205,” Power said “These shady organizations masquerade as grassroots activists but are part of a coordinated national effort to mislead voters, bypass the legislative process, and manipulate our state constitution for political gain.
Twenty separate organizations are promoting proposed constitutional amendments for next year, according to the Division of Elections.  They must submit 880,062 valid signatures by Feb. 1, 2026, to qualify.
Florida Decides Healthcare claims to have collected more than 100,000 signatures so far.
Smart & Safe Florida, the group that attempted to get the constitutional amendment legalizing recreational use of cannabis in 2024 and is actively working to get another measure on the ballot in 2026, declined to respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The Maryland Department of Information Technology (DoIT) named a former U.S. Office of Personnel Management information officer Monday as its next chief information security officer.
The department said James Saunders started in an acting capacity on Monday.
In a statement announcing the appointment, the department said Saunders will lead DoIT’s Office of Security Management, which is responsible for securing the state’s IT systems, infrastructure and private data. Administration officials called Saunders “a highly sought-after candidate,” who brings more than “15 years of cybersecurity leadership experience across the federal government and private sector.”
“I’m a big believer in partnership,” Saunders said in the anouncement. “Whether they are part of my security team or not, I will work hand in hand with those across the State of Maryland to ensure we keep our people and our assets safe, together.”

The department said Saunders served as CISO and deputy chief information officer at OPM, where he helped implement “zero-trust programs and drove a cultural transformation within the agency’s security team to enhance inter-agency collaboration.” He also served as CISO for the U.S. Small Business Administration when it was called on to develop secure systems to distribute nearly $700 billion in funds to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“As public and private organizations face new threats like agentic AI, strong cybersecurity is more important than ever,” said DoIT Secretary Katie Savage. “James Saunders is an experienced cybersecurity expert who has helped secure some of our nation’s most important systems. We are thrilled he is bringing his expertise and leadership to the State of Maryland.”
Saunders is the latest federal official to shift into high-ranking state job, as the new administration in Washington brings uncertainty about the future of the federal workforce. He follows the appointments of Commerce Secretary Harry Coker Jr., who previously worked as White House cyber security director; Health Secretary Meena Seshamani, the former administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and former Environmental Protection Agency Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz, who is now deputy secretary for external relations at the Department of the Environment.
Saunders will serve in an acting capacity until he is formally appointed by the governor and his appointment is approved by the Senate.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-05 19:15:55+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: A refugee family builds new life in CT amid federal immigration turmoil,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/05/refugee-family-ct-immigration/,CT Mirror's Laura Tillman discusses her story about an Afghan refugee family settling in Connecticut amid federal funding cuts and canceled flights.,"It’s a challenging time to be navigating the United States immigration system for resettlement agencies and refugees alike.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Laura Tillman to discuss her article, “A family of Afghan refugees arrived in CT. Here’s what happened,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Laura’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Laura. You tell us the story of the Sayed Rahim Rahim family to illustrate the chaos that legal Afghan refugees trying to settle in Connecticut are now going through. How did you find the family, and what’s unique about their story?
LT: I got a call. I wrote a story about refugee resettlement and the funding cuts that were coming through from the Trump administration in January, and the fallout of that in February. And I’d written about a woman who came from Nigeria years before, she’d been helped by IRIS to resettle. And so kind of the question, naturally, in a way, was, well, what would that whole picture look like now? Now that these funding cuts have come through, these organizations are laying off a lot of their employees and giving up office space. And so the head of IRIS let me know in February that this family had just come from Qatar. They are an Afghan family, but they had been living in a refugee camp in Qatar for a few months, and they had been anxiously awaiting the day of their flight to come to the U.S. They had their passports issued. They had special immigrant visas. And so, really, they were just waiting for the flight. And then one of the things that happened in January was the Trump administration canceled flights for about 1,600 Afghans in that situation, and so, just merely the way of getting from point A to point B was the only obstacle.
WSHU: They were actually living in a hotel room for almost a year, right?
LT: Before going to Qatar to the refugee camp, they had been living in a hotel in Kabul for about a year. In general, their lives had just become extremely restricted since the U.S. left Afghanistan in 2021. Sayed Rahim Rahim, along with his brothers and brother-in-law, had all worked with the U.S. armed forces, in his case, as an automotive mechanic. His brothers had worked as translators. And this implies, you know, putting yourself in a huge amount of danger for retribution from the Taliban. And when the U.S. left Afghanistan in 2021 and the Taliban took over the country, like almost instantaneously, their lives became very restricted. Sayed decided to take his son, who was then seven, out of school. And so yeah, they had been living, waiting, waiting, waiting to be able to come to the U.S. for a very long time in very difficult circumstances. So then their flight was canceled, and fortunately, his brother-in-law was able to use his savings to purchase plane tickets for this family. We’re talking about seven plane tickets from Qatar to the U.S.
WSHU: Under normal circumstances, aren’t those plane tickets paid for once you’ve been cleared?
LT: Normally, yes.
WSHU: So now the burden fell on them to find the funds to pay for their own passage to the U.S.
LT: Yes. And very quickly, because their passports were going to expire. They had been issued these short-term passports that were going to expire. So they had this pretty tight time frame to find the money, buy new tickets and get here.
WSHU: So, when they get here, what happened?
LT: So normally, when a family in this situation would have gotten here a few months ago, IRIS would have been ready for them. And in the case of this family, you know, IRIS had been planning to resettle them before funding was cut and all these staff members were let go. But then, you know, they found out that their flight had been canceled. Everything was kind of up in the air. But under normal circumstances, they would have had an apartment ready for them. Really just a sense of things being a baseline for starting a new life, an apartment, clothes, a fridge full of food. An IRIS resettlement worker to help enroll the kids in school quickly, to be at the family medical appointments, figure out what the parents needed to do if the father was trying to get a job, different leads on that; all of these different things down to, you know, the organization kind of prided themselves on even having a home cooked meal of Afghan dishes ready for them the night that they would arrive in their new home. And really, the sense for a lot of people that this is like, like a very happy moment to come, you know, it’s a difficult moment to leave your home, but at the same time, a lot of people who are coming, they’re escaping traumatic situations. They’re really waiting for this day to come and start this new life.
WSHU: How was their experience different?
LT: Yeah, so their experience was quite a bit different. Instead of the International Organization for Migration figuring things out with them at the airport and helping get them to Connecticut, Sayed Rahim Rahim’s brother-in-law met them at the airport. He brought them to his own home, which was already a pretty full house with his wife and three kids. They welcomed this family of two parents and five young children, and the mother is also pregnant. She is due later this month. So they didn’t know where they were going to live. They didn’t know if they were going to get any help from the resettlement agency or not. They kind of had to figure out a lot of stuff, thankfully, with the help of their family members. They do have quite a number of family members who are here, who did you know lend a hand, and Iris has done many things for this family that they’re able to do, but it’s just not the level of constant contact and just readiness that they would have had before.
WSHU: It’s been a couple of months now since they arrived. How has it been for them? Have they been able to get a place? How do they pay for their upkeep?
LT: They did get their own place to live last month, and that was a real relief. IRIS helped them get that with the deposit and the first few months of rent. IRIS is also helping them get a car, a used car that’s been donated. They’ve borrowed some money from the Afghan community in New Haven, there are some Afghan folks who have organized together to help out other Afghan families in situations where they might need to borrow money, for funeral arrangements or for something like this. In this case, they borrowed some money to be able to furnish one room in their apartment.
WSHU: The children have been able to register in school as well.
LT: Just last week, the oldest two kids started school. The youngest kids aren’t school age yet. One of them, I think, might be able to start pre-K next year, but the other two are in school, and that was a really happy moment that I got to see last week, which was the son being able to go to school for the first time, essentially, in four years.
WSHU: What about benefits?
LT: They have signed up for HUSKY, and, you know, things like HUSKY and SNAP, as well as food stamps, are a couple of the items that are at risk right now with some of the federal cuts. So I think that’s kind of a question mark moving forward for them. IRIS isn’t able to provide as much help as they would need to supplement the help that the federal government can provide. However, how much help the federal government will provide to families in this situation as time goes on is still unclear. Fortunately, I think one stroke of good luck for this family is that the father is a mechanic, and you know, unlike his brothers, who were translators, there isn’t as much work available in that field. I think that he has some good job opportunities as a mechanic. It’s a skill you don’t need to speak fluent English to be able to do. Some of the volunteers who work with IRIS have been trying to find him a job as a mechanic. So hopefully, you know, he will be able to start working soon.
WSHU: So bottom line, it seems that it’s more the refugee community providing much of the help. And as far as IRIS is concerned, how have they been able to deal with the cuts to federal funding? Have private ones made up the difference? Is it even possible for that to happen?
LT: I think private donations have made a meaningful impact, but it’s not really possible to make up for the loss of funding. For example, IRIS made the painful decision to give up its primary offices in New Haven. I think it is now sharing some space and resources with other nonprofits in New Haven. I think one of the things that has been impressive is that in the first story that I wrote about these federal cuts, I got to meet some of the people from religious groups and other groups who have become volunteers for IRIS over the years and are fairly organized. You know, there’s this group that’s been helping, Rahim Rahim and his family, who are primarily volunteers from a group of churches and a synagogue in Madison and Guilford, and they’re the ones who found this car for him. You know, one of their volunteers drove the kids to their first day of school and helped to provide, you know, some help when they were registering the kids for school, and just to make sure everything went smoothly. My understanding is that there’s a lot of manpower, of volunteers, and that’s, you know, as significant as the financial contributions, it isn’t the same, though, as the IRIS resettlement workers who speak fluent Pasto, who really have this skill set, and when they work with volunteers, it’s terrific, but they also have to train those people they often don’t speak the language of the people that they’re helping. So it is more challenging, but I think that helps a lot of these families to, you know, make it through.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0307_SR_RahmanFamily_007-edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

(Photo courtesy of Jefferson County)With the help of over $600,000 in state money, the sole access road to Olympic National Park’s popular Hoh Rain Forest will reopen this week after a monthslong closure.
Access on the Upper Hoh Road will be restored midday Thursday, announced Gov. Bob Ferguson. The road was washed out by the bomb cyclone that hit the region last year and has been closed since December.
The rainforest’s reopening comes just as the tourism season heats up. 
Usually, the Federal Highway Administration’s Emergency Relief Program would fund repairs to the road. But then-Gov. Jay Inslee didn’t include Jefferson County, where the road is located, in his emergency declaration to unlock aid for the November bomb cyclone. This made accessing federal money difficult.
State and local officials said they didn’t have the money for repairs.
So in March, Ferguson unveiled a plan to spend $623,000 in state reserves to help fix the road, which serves as the gateway to the rainforest that saw nearly 460,000 visitors last year.
“It’s the kind of thing where, if you’re just a Washingtonian, you read an article and think ‘for god’s sake, can’t someone just figure out this bureaucracy and get the road fixed,’” Ferguson said at the time. “Because it’s a lot of money, but it’s not that much money.”
The reserve money, set aside for the governor to help businesses in need, comes from unclaimed lottery winnings. Ferguson also added Jefferson County to Inslee’s emergency declaration, so if federal funding eventually comes through, that money can reimburse the state.
Private donors contributed another $27,000 to augment the state dollars. 
Heavy rains elevated the Hoh River, eroding part of the county-maintained road, causing the park to announce the closure Dec. 23. The road is located southeast of Forks, in a remote part of the Olympic Peninsula.
At the time of the closure, the county warned the road was “in imminent danger of failure.” No full-time residents live beyond the washout site.
Jefferson County will celebrate the reopening at noon Thursday, when Ferguson will join local officials for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. 
“This project represents a true partnership in action,” Jefferson County Public Works Director Monte Reinders said in a press release. “We’re grateful for the support of Governor Ferguson, the private donors, and our hardworking local contractors and crews.”

,Kansas Reflector,2025-05-05 19:08:59+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas podcaster seeks GOP gubernatorial nomination to copy Trump crusade at state level,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/05/05/kansas-podcaster-seeks-gop-gubernatorial-nomination-to-copy-trump-crusade-at-state-level/,Republican Bob Billings is first to formally enter the 2026 campaign for governor in Kansas as Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly nears the end of a second term.,"Doug Billings, a conservative podcaster and MAGA champion, stands as the only formal candidate for the Kansas Republican Party's nomination to find a replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in 2026. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Billings' podcast)TOPEKA —  Conservative podcaster and MAGA enthusiast Doug Billings is the lone person to formally file as a candidate for the Kansas Republican Party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Billings, not a household name in Kansas politics, said in an interview Monday that he was a reluctant candidate in a GOP field that could grow substantially as Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Senate President Ty Masterson, state Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, former Gov. Jeff Colyer, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara and others made decisions to join the ballot or stay on the sideline. No Democrat has officially entered the race.
“The truth is, honest to God, I don’t want to run,” Billings said. “We need a strong conservative governor in that office. We need a politician who’s going to tell the truth.”
Billings, who worked in human resources before starting “The Right Side” podcast five years ago in Olathe, said he would implement at the state level the federal DOGE framework embraced by President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk. He said the state’s economy would flourish by cutting unnecessary spending and by diminishing income and businesses taxes, including the potentially unconstitutional property tax.
“Through the Kansas Department of Government Efficiency, I will root out fraud, waste and bureaucracy across state agencies,” he said.
Targets of his budget ax would include administrative costs in public schools, fraud in poverty and unemployment benefit programs, transportation project cost overruns, ill-advised economic development incentives and operational inefficiency in prisons. He vowed to scan state agencies large and small for waste.
Billings said his Catholic values required that he provide leadership in the movement to curtail abortion rights in Kansas. He would expand the state’s support for anti-abortion pregnancy resource centers and faith-based adoption agencies as well as enact policies reflecting a “shared commitment to the dignity of every human life.” At minimum, he said, the state ought to enact and enforce a law forbidding abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat.
The Kansas Supreme Court declared a woman’s decision to terminate a pregnancy a fundamental right anchored in the Bill of Rights of the Kansas Constitution. In 2022, voters in Kansas rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have nullified the state Supreme Court’s opinion on abortion. Abortion remains legal in Kansas despite the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
 
God, guns, voting
Billings said he would strive as governor to restore Christian values that inspired the nation’s Founding Fathers and to breath new life into founding documents written by those men. He said school classes would start with a moment of private prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, which would reinforce “our unity under God.”
“Kansas must return to its roots as a society grounded in faith, morality and reverence for God,” he said. “Not as a theocracy, but as a republic that honors its Christian heritage with pride and conviction.”
He said his administration would be a bulwark against attempts to erode the “God-given” right to bear arms. He would oppose burdensome regulations, excessive fees and bureaucratic red tape that infringed on the ability of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms.
Diversity, equity and inclusion programs or “woke” agendas in K-12 schools would be eliminated to avoid advocacy for “divisive ideologies,” Billings said. The state should invest tax dollars in ways that supported decisions of parents to send their children to public, private or home schools, he said.
In terms of election security, Billings said he would order the Kansas Bureau of Investigation to launch inquiries into past election “irregularities” and decisions that undercut election fraud investigations.
Secretary of State Schwab, who said he would run for the GOP nomination for governor, has repeatedly contended Kansas elections were fair and accurate. However, Billings said “anyone telling you that we don’t have election integrity issues in Kansas is either vastly uninformed or is lying to you.”
“I will work to eliminate electronic voting machines, which are vulnerable to manipulation and erode public confidence,” Billings said. “In their place, I will implement watermarked paper ballots.”
 
Schwab, O’Hara
In January, Schwab was the first Republican to confirm plans to seek the August 2026 nomination for governor. He was elected the state’s top election official in 2018 and won reelection in 2022. He served 14 years in the Kansas House representing an Olathe district. In March, Schwab said he had been diagnosed with cancer in the lung. He said the cancer was detected at an early stage and surgery would be relied on to combat the health threat.
Schwab said his campaign would concentrate on necessity of the state to bring property assessments and taxation under control. He expressed alarm the 2025 Legislature did little to moderate state property tax collections, despite bipartisan promises after the 2024 session to tackle the issue.
“When it came time to lead, both the governor and leadership came up short,” he said.
O’Hara, a former Johnson County Commission member and one-term Kansas House member, said in February that she would campaign for governor because it was time to have a “true, proven conservative” leading the Republican supermajority in the Legislature. She vowed to deal with wasteful state spending and “ludicrous corporate welfare” in the form of business subsidies, ban DEI in government institutions and “get schools back on track.”
“I cannot stand silent and watch small businesses and homeowners be destroyed through high property taxes or watch our children drown in the sewer of wokeism in our schools,” she said.
O’Hara lost a 2024 reelection campaign for county commission to a Democrat after objecting to COVID-19 restrictions and opposing vaccination mandates.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Doug-Billings-governor-1024x530.png,,,2025-05-05 16:07:28.925115

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem touted the option as cost-effective.“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,” Noem said in a statement. “This is the safest option for our law enforcement, aliens and is a 70% savings for US taxpayers.”It’s unclear from which part of the DHS budget the funding for the travel assistance is coming, as it would roughly cost $1 billion to reimburse up to $1,000 to meet the goal of removing 1 million people.DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.President Donald Trump gave his support for the move Monday afternoon, according to White House pool reports. ""We're going to get them a beautiful flight back to where they came from,” the president said.Self-deportation would be facilitated by the CBP Home app, which was used by the Biden administration to allow asylum seekers to make appointments with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.The payment would apparently not be made in advance. DHS said that once those who use the app to self deport arrive in their home country, they will receive a travel stipend of $1,000.According to DHS, the Trump administration has deported 152,000 people since taking office in January. The Biden administration last year deported 195,000 people from February to April, according to DHS data.DHS said already one migrant has used the program to book a flight from Chicago to Honduras.“Additional tickets have already been booked for this week and the following week,” the agency said in a statement.The Trump administration has rolled out several programs to facilitate mass self-deportations, such as a registry to require immigrants in the country without legal authorization to register with the federal government.Immigrants who don’t register with the federal government could face steep fines and a potential prison sentence.",,,,2025-05-05 15:08:37.034218

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Legislation to rename the Sakonnet River Bridge after a U.S. Army soldier from Tiverton killed in action in Iraq in 2004 has cleared the Rhode Island General Assembly.
The “Staff Sergeant Christopher Potts Sakonnet River Bridge” would be the new name of the span connecting Tiverton and Portsmouth via Route 24 under the bill that passed the House on April 10 and the Senate version that passed in concurrence on May 1. Both chambers approved the legislation unanimously.
 The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Dan McKee, who can sign it, veto it, or allow it to become effective without his signature.  
“To rename this major Rhode Island bridge in his honor is a worthy tribute to a true Rhode Island hero who gave his life so that we all may live in a world free of tyranny and persecution,” Rep. Samuel Azzinaro, a Westerly Democrat and chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said in a statement Thursday. 
 “And now, hopefully whenever someone drives over this bridge, they will be compelled to look up who Staff Sergeant Potts was and discover how his legacy will live on in the state that he loved so much,” Azzinaro, a retired National Guardsman and former member of the Army Reserve, added. 
Potts served in the Rhode Island National Guard for over 14 years. He deployed to Iraq in March 2004 and was killed in Taji, Iraq, on Oct. 3, 2004, his 38th birthday. Potts’ fellow servicemembers who testified on the bill during a February committee hearing said that Potts had found a stockpile of weapons with ammo, guns, rockets, mortars, artillery rounds and more, shortly before he and a medic were executed by insurgent groups. 
Bill would rename Sakonnet River Bridge in honor of Tiverton soldier killed in Iraq War

“We think that by him finding this cache — it was the largest cache in Iraq at the time — it put a damper on the insurgents’ operations against us and saved a lot of lives,” Command Sgt. Maj. Raymond Viens, who served alongside Potts, said during the Feb. 6 Special Legislation committee hearing where Azzinaro’s bill was first heard.  
Potts posthumously received the Bronze Star Medal with Combat “V” and the Purple Heart.
Sen. Walter Felag, a Warren Democrat, sponsored the legislation in his chamber. Like Azzinaro, Felag chairs the veterans’ affairs committee in his chamber.
“Renaming the Sakonnet Bridge in his honor will serve as a fitting reminder of what our service members sacrifice in order to protect the ideals and freedoms that we deeply cherish,” Felag said in a statement Thursday. 
The bill underwent one minor revision since being introduced by Azzinaro on the House floor in January. The original version of the bill suggested naming the structure the “Staff Sergeant Christopher Potts Sakonnet Bridge” and the successful legislation simply retains the “River” in the current name.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday, but the Democratic governor has historically used his veto powers selectively, and usually after the legislative session ends in June. Several bills have become laws in the 2025 legislative session without McKee’s signature.

(Neil Mishler/USFWS)A high number dead waterfowl reported on the Bighorn River south of Hardin in February was due to starvation, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
According to a May 5 press release, FWP staff collected mallard, geese and shorebird carcasses along a stretch of the Bighorn River from Afterbay to about three miles downstream of the Bighorn Fishing Access Site following numerous reports of sick and dead waterfowl in the area.
Staff initially suspected the mortality event was related to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, but extensive testing at the department’s Wildlife Heath Lab in Bozeman showed no positive results for the disease.
Additional testing was done by the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin, where specialists confirmed there was no evidence of infectious diseases. Instead, emaciation and starvation were the only ailments consistently found among the tested birds.
According to the press release, FWP said that mid-winter waterfowl surveys done along the Bighorn River showed a higher than average concentration of birds, “which likely led to more competition for the limited food in the area.”
In addition, extreme cold temperatures and high snowfall in the region during early January likely contributed to limited availability of food.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8601170566_8596478752_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 15:08:37.034218

He said any fuel that did reach the creek has been contained by the booms in Waukee, and he didn’t observe any diesel in the Urbandale booms.
An unknown amount of the spill reached an inlet tile which outlets to Little Walnut Creek, where residents reported the smell of fuel. 
Theobald said Monday he has observed occasional whiffs of the fuel smell, which he suspects, are coming from the pond near the fuel tank where the majority of the estimated 4,000 gallons spilled was contained.
He said the tile line was cleaned by Waukee officials and no dead fish have been observed in the creek.

Some measles response plans crash to a halt after Trump cuts

Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Although Maine often prides itself on living out its motto to be a leader, especially with environmental policy, state leaders are encouraging lawmakers to pause efforts to hold fossil fuel companies accountable. 
Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim acknowledged that Maine will need billions of dollars to address the impacts of climate change, but she said now is not the time to move forward with a proposal for fossil fuel companies to cover those costs, citing the legal battles miring states that have already taken such action. 
Balancing that need and timing, Loyzim told the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee on Monday that the department is neither for nor against two bills seeking to establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other disasters.
“The fossil fuel industry created a mess in Maine and it’s high time they are responsible for cleaning it up,” said Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), who sponsored one of the bills.
LD 1870 would establish the Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program, which would be funded by payments from fossil fuel businesses responsible for more than one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions between 1995 and 2024. The legislation stipulates that at least 35% of the funds would need to be used for climate change adaptation projects that benefit low-income households. 
Trump attack on state climate laws likely doomed, but attempts to yank funds may be next

Brenner said her bill, with one Republican cosponsor, is a natural extension of the bipartisan efforts behind LD 1 that was signed into law last month. That symbolic first bill of the session created funding opportunities to make Maine homes more resilient and established a new State Resilience Office to address flooding and other impacts of extreme weather.
That legislation was in response to the series of severe storms that caused an estimated $90 million in damage to public infrastructure across Maine last winter and builds upon $60 million for storm relief that was included in the state’s supplemental budget last year.
“Instead of needing to pass a bill like LD 1 every single legislative session, we can establish a climate superfund to better prepare for and respond to storms,” said Jackson Chadwick, advocacy director for Maine Youth for Climate Justice, testifying in support.
During the public hearing, Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland) introduced LD 1808 that similarly seeks to establish a superfund to hold fossil fuel companies accountable, especially since research has shown that companies including Exxon knew of the harm decades ago and actively sought to suppress those findings. 
Though there is a lot of overlap between the two bills, Lookner said his bill provides a more robust definition around an “environmental justice focus populations” that could better direct superfund dollars to communities hit hardest. 
During the hearing, many of the proponents said they prefer LD 1870, but Lookner and others encouraged the committee to take the best components of each bill when streamlining the proposals.
Maine Lobsters Union Local 207 submitted testimony in support of Lookner’s bill, saying that Maine needs a plan for the future so heritage industries that rely on the waterfront, like lobster fishing, aren’t left with debilitating damage from extreme weather and little means to make the repairs. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce opposed the measures, arguing that they pose risks to Maine business by retroactively assigning financial liability to companies that were lawfully engaging in business. It fears such legislation would signal that Maine is an unpredictable place to do business.
Sen. Denise Tepler (D-Sagadahoc), who co-chairs the committee, asked Brenner if the superfund would pay for damages in the five areas of her district that are being impacted by sea level rise. Brenner reminded her that costs to repair roads and other public infrastructure in those areas are currently being paid for by taxpayers. 
Some committee members questioned whether the model would increase prices at the gas pump or on energy bills, but Brenner said she believes existing financial regulatory processes would prevent costs from being pushed on to consumers. 
Legal battles against superfunds in other states
Maine isn’t the first state to explore the idea of a climate superfund, as Vermont and New York have already passed similar legislation. However, those states, as well as Hawaii and Michigan, have subsequently been sued for those policies, including by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department said the lawsuit is also meant to advance an executive order from President Donald Trump that targets state and local policies involving climate change, environmental justice and carbon emissions reductions.
Rachel Rothschild, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School, told the committee it is unprecedented for the DOJ to bring that type of lawsuit and she is skeptical of the viability of the claims. 
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi argues these policies threaten the country’s energy independence, while the lawsuit claims they are unconstitutional and preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. However, Rothschild said the Clean Air Act addresses future pollution, whereas the superfund looks at pollution retroactively.
Climate superfunds, like the one proposed in Maine, build upon a long-standing principle in environmental law known as “polluter pays.” That is the same principle that requires identifiable polluters to foot the bill to clean up hazardous waste sites.
Cathy Breen, who testified on behalf of the Environmental Priorities Coalition, said the state has adopted other uses of that principle through policies such as the beverage container redemption program, as well as the recently extended producer responsibility program for packaging. LD 1870 is a priority for the coalition of 40 conservation, climate and public health organizations this legislative session. 
Loyzim said it would be helpful for Maine to wait and see how that litigation plays out in other states before creating a superfund of its own. She recommended the state wait until next year to dig into this topic and what it could look like in Maine. This would also allow the state to determine how best to implement the policy, including details like whether it would share data with other states, to better estimate the cost of such a policy.
Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) asked Loyzim how to ensure that the department continues to lay the groundwork for that conversation if the committee chooses to defer it until next year. Loyzim said they will already be tracking those legal challenges but also suggested the committee could convert one of the bills into a directive for the department to work on a report to inform future discussion.

The Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation is given for work that “exemplifies new ways of executing the craft of journalism that will engage audiences and expand the work’s impact and reach.”


CalMatters’ Digital Democracy has been awarded the Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation in the national Poynter Journalism Prizes.
The honor, for “California’s Fentanyl Fight,” is a powerful pairing of the rich Digital Democracy government-transparency database and produced in partnership with Julie Watts of CBS News. Julie’s story focused on advocates for fentanyl legislation who were upset to learn through Digital Democracy that their bills died when legislators declined to vote.
Her broadcast followed a CalMatters’ story, “Power is never having to say ‘no.’ How California Democrats kill bills without voting against them” co-authored by Watts and CalMatters reporter Ryan Sabalow. The story used data from Digital Democracy to look at more than 1 million votes cast by current legislators, and revealed that Democrats voted “no” less than 1% of the time. Instead of directly voting against a bill, Democrats often killed bills by declining to vote.
The first-place award recognized Watts, Sabalow and Foaad Khosmood, an architect of Digital Democracy at CalPoly San Luis Obispo.
Judges cited the team’s work with the “groundbreaking Digital Democracy database” built by CalMatters, which uses artificial intelligence and emerging technologies to further empower watchdog journalism and fill the reporting void left in statehouses across the country. The database collects information on millions of votes and hundreds of hours of hearings, allowing reporters to reveal hidden practices of California’s Democratic supermajority legislature.
“You read these pieces and you feel smarter and better-equipped to execute your rights in a democracy,” one judge said.
Digital Democracy includes every word uttered in public hearings, every dollar given to a politician, every bill introduced, every vote taken and more. The database enables unprecedented insights, such as a review of more than 1 million votes cast by current legislators over the past five years.
The partner investigation with CBS-TV showed the real impacts of people using Digital Democracy to see how government decisions are being made. “I personally am insulted,” said the mother of a young person who died from a fentanyl overdose. “That is what they signed up for, to represent us.”Digital Democracy and Julie Watts also contributed to a half-hour TV special on the fentanyl controversy in December. CalMatters has previously paired with CBS’ Watts, including two videos that won Northern California Emmy awards. CalMatters Reporter Nigel Duara and Watts Emmy was for a segment on how California investigates shootings by law enforcement officers of unarmed civilians, and a collaboration with Watts that featured Julie Cart’s coverage of the devastating effects of endless wildfires on the mental health of California’s firefighters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/043025-CM-Award-Fentanyl-Fight-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 15:08:37.034218

The seven individuals; Oliver Kozler, Samantha Lewis, Henry MacKeen-Shapiro, Michael Mueller, Asad Siddiqui, Avi Tachna-Fram and Rhiannon Willow, were charged last September with trespassing and resisting and/or obstructing a police officer after an encampment by pro-Palestinian protestors on the university’s Diag on the Ann Arbor campus was broken up by police in May 2024.

All seven previously pleaded not guilty and were in Ann Arbor District Court Monday morning awaiting a decision on a motion for Nessel to recuse herself from the case when they learned of the dismissals.
In announcing the decision to drop the charges, Nessel called the recusal motion a “diversionary tactic,” and that because the case had become “a lightning rod of contention,” it was no longer in the public’s best interest to proceed. 
“These distractions and ongoing delays have created a circus-like atmosphere to these proceedings,” Nessel said. “While I stand by my charging decisions, and believe, based on the evidence, a reasonable jury would find the defendants guilty of the crimes alleged, I no longer believe these cases to be a prudent use of my department’s resources, and, as such, I have decided to dismiss the cases.”
Another factor in Nessel’s decision was a letter the Detroit Free Press reported was sent to the court last week by the Jewish Federation of Greater Ann Arbor, defending Nessel against accusations that she was biased against the Muslim and Arab American communities.
“We have learned that a public statement in support of my office from a local non-profit has been directly communicated to the court,” Nessel said in her statement. “The impropriety of this action has led us to the difficult decision to drop these charges.”
In response to the news, the TAHRIR Coalition, made up of dozens of pro-Palestinian student groups at the University of Michigan, said on social media that the decision “is what happens when we resist and refuse to cower.”

The protests were part of a wave of demonstrations at college campuses across the nation that began in the aftermath of Israeli military strikes in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, surprise attack by Hamas on Israel.
Meanwhile, Nessel’s office continues to carry out an investigation of pro-Palestinian protesters accused of causing approximately $100,000 of damage at up to a dozen locations, including at the homes of University of Michigan President Santa Ono and University of Michigan Regent Jordan Acker. 
A warrant sweep in conjunction with that investigation was carried out last month at locations in Ann Arbor, Canton and Ypsilanti. Charges have yet to be filed in those incidents.
On Sunday, Ono announced he would leave the university later this summer to become the president at the University of Florida.

The Howe neighborhood of Minneapolis Friday, Oct. 11, 2024. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As we near the end of the legislative session, Minnesota legislators and Gov. Tim Walz are deliberating on a two-year budget to address the long-term deficit facing the state — and current proposals are not good news for property taxpayers.
As county commissioners, we understand the difficult decisions facing Walz and lawmakers. Counties put together balanced budgets every year. We have to weigh what is needed to best serve our residents; fulfill state and federal mandates; and limit the burden that property tax increases place on our constituents.  
Those are never easy decisions, but they will become even more challenging if the proposals being considered at the Capitol become law. 
Budget proposals from the House, Senate, and governor address the upcoming deficit in a variety of ways, but too often resort to shifting state costs to homeowners and businesses paying local property taxes. 
These shifts or “cost shares” mean that the state essentially sends a bill to counties to pay for spending related to specific state-mandated services. 
Counties would still be required to deliver the same services, except now local property taxpayers would be responsible for funding a higher percentage of state costs. County governments estimate the total statewide property tax increase because of these budget proposals would be over $200 million by 2029 and grow from there.  
In one rural county, already one of Minnesota’s most economically disadvantaged communities, these cost shifts would increase the property tax levy 9%, and that’s before factoring in any other local considerations. Metro and suburban counties are not exempt from property tax and levy impacts, with some counties seeing total cost shares greater than $20 million. These new shifts would nearly eclipse the total amount of general-purpose aid counties receive from the state.  
These proposals often get discussed at the Capitol without recognizing the very real costs that property tax increases will have on homeowners and businesses across the state.  
We’ve been down this road before: When the state faced deficits in the first decade of this century, the state started many of these cost shifts and reduced aid to counties and cities. As a result, property taxes increased by record high percentages that have not been matched since. 
We don’t want those mistakes to be repeated at the Capitol this year.    
Shifting program costs from the state to counties doesn’t reduce the size or scope of government, it just passes the buck to property taxpayers. 
State legislators are not required to consider the cost of their budget choices on local governments, and that should change. For too long, the state has made choices that just shift state costs to different taxpayers, rather than working toward solutions that balance the budget at the state level. 
Counties understand that the current economy requires difficult decisions at the Capitol, but higher property taxes shouldn’t be a solution to address the pending deficit. 
Homeowners are already facing escalating inflation, energy and general cost of living expenses.  Further relying on property taxpayers to fund government will only add to the pressure of homeownership, particularly among those families and individuals just barely making it.  
Minnesota needs a more balanced, sustainable method of funding government services, one that doesn’t unfairly burden property owners already stretched thin.

It’s the inhaler that keeps a child’s asthma under control, the glasses that help them see the board at school, the vaccines that prevent serious illness. For the families I serve, Medicaid is a lifeline, helping connect them to the basic necessities they need to be able to live, work, and learn.
That’s why I’m concerned that, right now, Republican leaders in Congress are working to push through massive cuts to Medicaid — up to $880 billion or more. North Carolina’s senior U.S. Senator, Republican Thom Tillis, has supported the plans that would slash this vital program, just one year after North Carolina finally expanded it. These cuts would be devastating, especially here in rural communities where fewer employers offer health coverage and hospitals depend heavily on Medicaid reimbursements to keep their doors open.
More than 1.4 million children in North Carolina rely on Medicaid to get the health care they need to grow up healthy and strong. That’s nearly half the kids in our state. Nearly 40% of all Medicaid recipients live outside major cities — in rural areas like mine — where access to care is already limited. When Medicaid is threatened, it’s these children and their families who will feel it first and worst.
If these cuts go through, children will lose access to routine checkups, life-saving prescriptions, and preventive care. They’ll struggle to learn, fall behind in school, or even end up in emergency rooms for conditions that could have been managed early — if they can get care at all.
And it’s not just kids. Medicaid helps low-income parents, seniors, and people with disabilities get the care they need to survive. In rural communities, where jobs often don’t come with benefits, Medicaid fills the gap. If people lose that coverage, they’re not switching to a private plan — they’re going without.
The impact wouldn’t stop at patients who qualify for Medicaid. Rural hospitals, many of which are already operating on razor-thin margins, rely on Medicaid to stay afloat. If this funding disappears, more hospitals will be forced to close. That means longer drives for emergency care, fewer options for prenatal visits or surgeries, and more risk for everyone in the community — not just those on Medicaid.
Senator Tillis must understand what’s at stake. These cuts aren’t about reducing waste or balancing the budget. They’re about shifting costs from billionaires to working families. They’re about handing tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy while kids lose their inhalers, seniors lose access to medications, and rural hospitals shut their doors.
We fought hard for over a decade to expand Medicaid in North Carolina. That fight wasn’t about politics — it was about saving lives. And we succeeded. Now, more than 600,000 North Carolinians finally have access to care. If Senator Tillis supports these cuts, he’ll be taking that away.
We can’t afford to let politicians like Senator Tillis take away our health care. Not when families are working hard to get by, raise their kids, and care for aging parents in a health system that already leaves too many behind.
From blocking Medicaid expansion as Speaker of the NC House in 2013, to trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act throughout his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Senator Tillis has a long history of opposing efforts to expand health care access — but he has another chance to show where he stands. I urge him to stand with his constituents, not with wealthy donors. Protect Medicaid. Protect our rural hospitals. And most importantly, protect our kids.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-05-05 14:08:49.729437

However, fears of a national recession are driving uncertainty about how much the so-called Blue Bus will receive from both local governments and Washington.
The North Central Regional Transit District Board of Directors on Friday approved a preliminary $53 million budget for the upcoming fiscal year, a nearly 7% decrease from the previous year’s budget. The board will meet again in June to formally vote on the budget, which staff will then submit to the state Department of Finance and Administration.
The district projects the number of riders on its 26 fixed routes to increase compared to last year, when more than 565,000 people took the bus, a marked decline from the 2018-2019 fiscal year pre-pandemic numbers of more than 814,000 rides.
In his budget message to the board, Executive Director Anthony Mortillaro wrote that the district suspended some routes or limited them to on-demand service in response to the pandemic’s outset, but most have returned, and the rest will in the coming year as they hire more staff.
The district’s service area encompasses 74 communities across 10,0000 square miles where nearly 290,000 people live. NCRTD employs approximately 100 people, and the budget pays for two additional bus drivers.
At its Friday meeting in Española, Mortillaro told the board that the district’s future projections remain uncertain because of federal actions. Nearly 50% of the district’s income comes from the federal government.
“There’s an increasing concern about the odds of a national recession due to the tariffs and high interest rates, and all that could impact tax revenues as well as future grant levels,” he said.
Most Blue Bus routes run in Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Taos and Los Alamos counties, with some connecting to eight Northern Pueblos, the Jicarilla Apache Nation and the counties of San Juan, Mora and San Miguel.
While the area is experiencing a “leveling economic recovery based upon reported tax revenues,” Mortilarro wrote, a recession could lower those tax revenues and how much grant money the federal government will provide.
Los Alamos County, the City of Santa Fe and the Rio Metro Regional Transit District, which operates the Rail Runner, contribute more than $7 million to the Blue Bus’s budget, which it uses to fund regional transit in those areas, Mortillaro wrote.
The budget also includes $9.5 million for electrical charging infrastructure in Española and Taos, and three diesel hybrid electric buses. Tariffs can add between 5% and 10% to the price of an electric bus, Mortillaro said.

Few issues on the public policy agenda in 2025 are more urgently important than the health of the environment. Whether it’s global challenges like climate change and the rise in weather disasters or hyperlocal matters like land use planning and access to clean drinking water, elected leaders undoubtedly have their work cut out for them.
Fortunately, thanks to the hard work of experts at the North Carolina Conservation Network, we now have a wonderfully comprehensive and data rich report that details exactly where things stand. The report – entitled simply enough, “North Carolina State of the Environment” – is based on the analysis of data from 114 different source indicators over a period of five years. And recently NC Newsline caught up with the Conservation Network’s Policy Director Grady McCallie and Campaigns Data Manager Luna Homsi, for a special two-part conversation to learn more.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation, we commenced discussing their organization’s new and remarkably comprehensive report on the state of the environment in North Carolina.
In Part Two of our chat, we took a closer look at some of the many specific environmental challenges confronting our state – including some encouraging news on air pollution, the importance of rapidly transitioning to a sustainable energy grid, the huge challenges posed by the spread of so-called forever chemicals, and the report’s inclusion of dozens of specific policy recommendations.

Minneapolis is among the cities forced to cancel vaccinations after cutoffs in federal funding. (Courtesy of City of Minneapolis)The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.

Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.

Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

Aron Maberry, a Clarksville Republican, sponsored a pair of bills aiming to ""dismantle DEI."" (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Language is fluid; it shifts, contorts, and adjusts as culture progresses. Largely due to social media, the fluidity of language has increased exponentially over the last decade. 
One word that exploded into the public lexicon around 2016 was the term “gaslighting.” The meaning of the word is quite broad and can apply to interpersonal relationships, work dynamics, and, most notably, politics. Ironically, gaslighting is most effective when it uses the fluidity of language to manipulate a message.
When boiled down to its most primal definition, gaslighting is the exploitation of thoughts and emotions by twisting language and truth to fit a desired mindset. To use gaslighting to its fullest potential, one must be well-versed in language, be willing to overlook any nuance, and boil a topic down to the one idea that will elicit the most emotional response in someone else. 
During the last several legislative sessions, Republican lawmakers in Tennessee have conducted a masterclass in how to gaslight Tennesseeans. 
The most recent pieces of egregious legislation by the GOP supermajority are bills designed to strip away diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives related to departmental appointments and hiring practices. As with most recent controversial legislation by the GOP, there was a lawmaker ready and willing to break down the gaslighting process.



				Logic and nuance would tell anyone that 61 years of “equality” doesn’t amount to much when you weigh that amount of time against 300 years of abuse, murder, slavery and marginalization simply based on one’s skin color, sexuality or gender. 			


Rep. Aron Maberry, a first term Clarksville Republican, was the House sponsor for HB0622 and HB0923 – both designed to “dismantle DEI.” 
The first step for any gaslighting expert is to find a word to target. It doesn’t matter what the true definition of that word is as long as that word has attained a certain connotation. In this case, the word Maberry chose was equity — the meat of the DEI sandwich. 
“The big problem in DEI is equity. We all know diversity, we all love including people. Equity is not equality, and it’s not about treating people fairly or ensuring equal opportunity … equity in the context of DEI is essentially that everybody gets the same outcome,” Maberry said.
Maberry paints a bullseye on the word equity and fires. This isn’t a difficult shot for him because the connotation of the word had already been established in corners of right-wing conversations five years ago. Now, the word is blasphemous in the world of most conservatives.  
The true meaning of equity has been lost and replaced by a mutated form of the word, one that is often equated with socialism and promises an equal outcome for everyone, when the actual definition of equity does everything except guarantee an equal outcome for everyone. Equity provides gateways and resources to opportunities that have been historically out of reach for many women and people of color. 
Maberry and Senate sponsor Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, sought to further explain the reasoning behind their bills by entering into phase two of the gaslighting process: ignore all nuances of a given topic. 
Maberry and Johnson saidthat their bills focus on merit, qualifications, skill and competency in employment decisions, and diversity will “happen naturally through fair hiring practices.” 
Yes, in a world devoid of history and nuance, “fair” hiring practices would occur naturally. 
  Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, sponsor of a bill called “Dismantle DEI. (Photo: John Partipilo)
What Johnson and Maberry fail to take into account is that systemic racism is still very much alive today, 61 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. DEI initiatives were put in place to catalyze the pursuit of more diverse personnel in business and government by intentionally recruiting people who would typically fall outside a company or department’s purview. DEI is about making sure we all understand that we don’t live in a post-racial society simply because certain hiring practices are illegal. Subconscious and systemic prejudice will always find a way to circumvent the law, even unintentionally.
Logic and nuance would tell anyone that 61 years of “equality” doesn’t amount to much when you weigh that amount of time against 300 years of abuse, murder, slavery and marginalization simply based on one’s skin color, sexuality or gender. Our society is still in the formative stages of course correction from these atrocities, and the systemic rivers of opportunity that have benefited white men for centuries haven’t dried up yet. Removing the dam of DEI initiatives simply allows those rivers to flow faster.
For their final act, Maberry and Johnson needed something to stoke the flames of emotion; something to indisputably turn the tables on inclusive initiatives. If DEI were about making room for all people to have equal access and opportunity, then the last card to play in the gaslighting hand is to flip the script completely. 
Maberry and Johnson initially tread lightly into this final act by disarming their skeptics with the admission that diversity could be beneficial before sealing the entire process with the claim that DEI initiatives weren’t just misguided but were actually a form of discrimination themselves. Nothing angers people of privilege more than believing they are the ones being discriminated against. 
Tennesseans can agree to disagree on issues of policy and legislation, but we should collectively be offended when our supermajority lies to our faces and tells us it’s the truth, as members have with anti-DEI laws designed to penalize minorities.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)A trio of Albuquerque-area Democratic lawmakers opened an in-person office space in a community college campus Saturday, one of several recent office openings that the legislators hope will boost services for constituents and also build momentum for a professional, paid Legislature in the near future. 
Newly hired district legislative aides for Sen. Harold Pope, state Rep. Joy Garratt and state Rep. Charlotte Little will regularly work from a newly leased office space at Central New Mexico Community College’s Westside campus. The office is in the “WSII” building on the north side of campus.
Thanks to a provision in the state budget two years ago, at least 20 House lawmakers have opened individual or shared office spaces since late last year in or near their districts, according to Pamela Armstrong, spokesperson for the office of House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque). More offices are expected to open soon, she said. The same provision allowed lawmakers to hire paid legislative aides. 
NM legislative recap Feb. 12: It’s still too cold to harvest, but the session is heating up

Garratt, whose District 29 covers from Albuquerque’s West Side to Laguna Pueblo, told Source New Mexico at the Saturday ribbon-cutting that, outside of the obvious benefit of the office being “a good place to work” where constituents can reach their representatives year-round, the new office could demonstrate to the public why a more professional, modern Legislature is needed. 
“Step one is actually having a staff person. Step two is having a space other than Starbucks, Panera Bread and a local coffee shop. Step three, and this is something I’ve worked on for three sessions, is modernization, paid legislators,” she said.
New Mexico’s remains the only unpaid Legislature in the country, though lawmakers receive per diem payments during the session and for interim committee meetings. Lawmakers and good-government advocates say paying lawmakers would elicit better candidates and reduce the influence of lobbyists or other outside interests. 
“I think if people see the effectiveness of being able to easily contact your state legislator, I think there would be greater public support,” Garratt said. “If we do our jobs. They’ll see it’s beneficial. People don’t know their state legislators. I got an angry phone call yesterday saying, ‘Congressman Garratt, what are you going to do about the Trump budget?’”
Lawmakers this year considered a joint resolution, which, if approved by voters, would create a commission that would determine and approve lawmaker salaries. But it never made it out of the Senate. 
An independent review of the legislation noted that a base salary of $50,000, for example, for 112 lawmakers would be cost taxpayers about $5.6 million annually.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9151-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-05 13:21:15.147897

Emily Bush captured the essence of this mission in her keynote: “We all have a part to play in making sure that women’s voices, ideas, and leadership are at the forefront of this movement.  Let’s keep supporting and celebrating women, because when they succeed, we all do.”From personal journeys to professional insights, the panelists shared candid reflections. “It’s like 50% believing in yourself and 50% having it reflected back at you,” said Sas Stewart. “If I can hit that balance… that’s the feeling.” Libby Parent added, “I can only be my authentic self. And I think sometimes growing up in your career, you may get advice to be different than you are. I was never very good at that.”The panelists brought both humor and heart as they shared the realities of leadership in Vermont and beyond. Karen Colberg, CEO of King Arthur Baking Company, offered a moving reflection on the roots of her work ethic: “What I believe really deeply is that there are parts of us that are just deep in our DNA, and they’re who we are… For me, I have this incredible work ethic. It’s from my grandmother—she was an entrepreneur… And that work ethic is deep inside me.”Sascha Mayer, cofounder of Mamava, closed the panel with a powerful reminder of what leadership often looks like behind the scenes: “There’s a million decisions. There’s a million moments. It’s saying yes, and it’s taking on challenges. It’s sharing the idea. It’s being brave every single day with a million different decisions.”Photo Credit: Lawson’s FinestThe event also spotlighted Lawson’s Finest’s Social Impact Program, which partners with Vermont nonprofits—including the Vermont Women’s Fund—to brew purpose-driven collaborations. “The Social Impact Program is a huge part of what it means to be part of Lawson’s Finest.Every year, we brew about 10 or 12 different beers in collaboration with amazing nonprofit organizations across Vermont,” said Carra Cheslin, SIP Manager. She added, “We’re so excited to be partnering with VCF, and to continue to build that relationship into the future. This event is just the beginning.”As the event transitioned into a lively networking hour, attendees continued to connect and reflect. “It’s really important to come together, to be in community as we try to create the future we want to see,” said Stacie Fagan, Vice President of Philanthropy at the Vermont Community Foundation. “That power of connection, shared experience, and mentorship—even in a group setting—was really palpable today.”This gathering served as a powerful reminder that leadership rooted in empathy, authenticity, and collaboration can transform communities from the inside out. Attendees left feeling energized and more connected to a community of women who truly want to lift each other up.Thank you to the entire Lawson’s Finest team for their commitment to Vermont.  As Emily so perfectly captured in her keynote, “Sean and Karen Lawson have pulled on every lever of their business to drive social impact—brand, product, culture, core values and philanthropy.”  Together, we’re not just raising a glass—we’re raising the bar for what’s possible when women lead, communities come together, and purpose drives progress.And it shows.Feeling inspired? Take our Giving Quiz—it’s a quick, fun way to explore charitable options that align with your giving goals and make a lasting impact.Ready to get started?Call us at 802-388-3355 (opt. 5) or email us at philanthropy@vermontcf.org and let’s put your generosity to work creating connections and opportunities in Vermont.The Vermont Community Foundation was established in 1986 as an enduring source of philanthropic support for Vermont communities.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Building a new house in today’s market doesn’t yet mean extra dollars for lumber or manufactured wood products, but Kansas building supply managers warn that tariffs have driven up other construction costs.
While on-again, off-again tariffs on Canadian timber are currently off, Kansans should prepare to pay more for just about everything else in the house, they said.
“You take the hardware and the millwork portion of our business, and we’re getting daily price increases because a lot of that product is imported from China, some from South America,” said Jay Robinson, manager of Wichita’s Mill Creek Lumber and Supply Co. “The import steel business has been affected. It’s up about 15 to 18% over the last 45 days, and we’re getting pretty much daily price updates. Fasteners, nails, screws, products for building connectors, have all seen 20 to 25% price increases.”
Hardware, like doorknobs and door hinges, is up 20 to 25%, he said.
Travis Daniels, general manager at McCray Lumber and Millwork in Topeka, agreed. 
“It’s hardware items. It’s things that are not manufactured domestically or from Canada, because so far, the Canadian government, the American government, keep flexing their muscles, and nothing really has happened yet,” he said.
In fact, Robinson said, lumber right now is at the lowest price it’s been in several years.
“The framing lumber composite is actually back to where it was in 2023,” he said, a price drop that he attributed to Canadian producers and American companies shifting as much product across the border as they could in anticipation of tariffs.
But Daniels said he is concerned that Canada’s recent election, which gave Pierre Poilievre the Liberal Party win, might have an impact on lumber.
“I’m concerned that may be setting us next up on a collision course,” he said. “I think that’s how he got elected, because he said he’ll draw the hard line against the Americans. The thing is, Canadian lumber does have some other places they can export to.”
 
Eyes open
The construction industry will closely watch the tariff situation, said Sean Miller, executive officer of the Kansas Building Industry Association. It’s important that Canadian lumber and concrete from Mexico continue to be exempted from tariffs, he said.
“Canada is the source of upwards of 80% of our lumber, so that’s a huge issue for the homebuilding industry in particular,” he said. “There is a 14.5% tariff on lumber, pretty consistent through the last couple of administrations. That lumber was exempted from any additional tariffs at this time, and that’s really critical for us.”

Miller said possible supply chain disruptions are also a concern.
“We’ve seen so much, starting really with COVID, and it’s never really come back the way we would have liked it,” he said. “That can really impact us.”
As an example, he said electrical transformers can be challenging to source for larger developments, such as 20- or 50-house projects.
“The ability for Evergy or your local electric partner to get the right amount of transformers really got limited during COVID, and it has not come back the way we would have liked to,” he said. “Electric companies have worked really hard to make sure those things are staged and ready.”
Robinson said tariffs have the potential to hurt the cost of projects that are in the works or already started, but most builders won’t be affected because they learned hard lessons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I would say pretty much 99.9% of all the builders we deal with have language in their contracts for increases due to market conditions,” he said. “A lot of builders took some pretty serious hits back in ’21, ’22, during the COVID run, when lumber prices doubled. They were not protected.”
“Unfortunately, the end user is the one that’s bearing the brunt of all these tariffs,” Robinson added.
 
No quick fix
As the politics of tariffs and interest rates play out, Daniels said there’s no way to quickly bring manufacturing back to the United States. 
“If you’re a believer that the trade imbalance with these other countries has been tremendously unfair, not America’s favorite for years, it’s not going to fix quick,” he said. “It’s going to be interesting times.”
Robinson said he believes American lumber companies could potentially manage the country’s housing starts.
“What we’re seeing right now are curtailments with the prices as soft as they are — the mills are actually cutting production back because they’re over produced,” he said. “I’m going to say that our domestic production on framing and lumber commodity products can sustain about 1.2 to 1.3 million housing starts annually, and that’s pretty close to where we’re at today.”

Altogether, lawmakers have advanced more than a dozen pieces of legislation that seek to restrict the types of records that people can obtain through the state’s Freedom of Information Act, which was passed in 1975 to provide an avenue for the public to learn how their state and local governments are operating.
Those bills, which passed out of several legislative committees earlier this year, would eliminate access to higher education records, information on Connecticut Lottery winners, the identities of people involved in hate crimes, the location of domestic violence centers, complaints about police and corrections officers, and the home addresses for numerous groups of public employees.
At the same time, there is also legislation awaiting action on the House floor that critics say could enable school superintendents to participate in every executive session for local boards of education — meaning more government business could be discussed behind closed doors and out of earshot of the general public.
Colleen Murphy, the executive director of the Freedom of Information Commission, which oversees disputes regarding the state’s open record law, said the number of bills seeking to roll back portions of the Freedom of Information Act this year is substantial.
“I think that this is a lot, and I think there are a few that are pretty sweeping and that cause us the most concern,” said Murphy, who is also a board member of the National Freedom of Information Coalition. 
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, said the wide array of records that lawmakers are now seeking to block from public disclosure is the result of requests that were made directly to individual legislators.
It’s not clear which lawmakers were responsible for each piece of legislation because they are all committee-sponsored bills. But Ritter said many of the bills stemmed from requests lawmakers received from constituents who argued the release of specific information was damaging or opened them up to harassment or physical harm.
Ritter referenced one of the bills, which would prevent the state from disclosing the addresses of employees at the Connecticut Attorney General’s office, to highlight why such legislation gains traction in the Democratic-dominated legislature.
“So when you have an assistant attorney general who’s been harassed or threatened, and feels like the redaction of his or her address would be helpful, people get sympathetic for that,” Ritter said. “Is that the right public policy? Maybe not, right? But you can understand why people put the legislation in and why you get some support.”
“I don’t think the bills are added because people are trying to undermine FOI,” Ritter added. “They’re trying to help their constituents, or help people who they think have a sympathetic case.” 
Advocates for government transparency and open records, however, argue the bills sponsored this legislative session represent a broader trend in which lawmakers seek to add more exemptions to the state’s Freedom of Information Act, which turned 50 years old this year, and slowly erode the usefulness of that transparency law.
“A lot of this is a slow creep or death by a thousand paper cuts,” said Murphy, who spends each session trying to educate lawmakers on the law. 
To be sure, several bills that made it out of committee this year seek to improve the process by which citizens and journalists can access government records.
One such bill would require the state to study how long it takes each Connecticut agency to process and respond to requests under FOIA. Another would clarify the law to allow people to use their cellphone to copy records, which would cut down on the fees that state and local officials can charge for documents.
But the majority of the FOIA-related legislation this year is focused on limiting, not expanding, access to government information.
The Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information, which is composed of journalists and First Amendment advocates, is one of the few groups, outside of Murphy and the FOIC staff, that regularly voices opposition to lawmakers’ plans to restrict information from public disclosure.
In testimony this year, CCFOI tried to explain the limitations and some of the potential consequences of blocking public access to information. 
They explained how withholding the home addresses for public school teachers and other government employees would not prevent people from obtaining the exact same information from local property records or voter registration information.
They cautioned legislators that banning access to complaints about police and corrections officials until those cases are adjudicated could allow bad officers to jump from one department to another without being held accountable. 
They warned that a bill seeking to protect the location of supportive housing for domestic violence and sexual assault victims could make it impossible for the public to weigh in when local boards and commissions are considering where to locate one of those shelters. 
And a bill that would shield the names of people who win the Connecticut Lottery or sports wagers, they said, could hide potential corruption or flaws in those betting systems.
“There are reasons for the disclosure of the names of winners who are voluntarily participating in a lottery system or fantasy contest offered by a quasi-public agency. Access to public information ensures that winnings are distributed fairly, and guards against wrongdoing in the system. Public information will likely keep abuse from being hidden,” Murphy said.
Despite that testimony, many of the FOIA-related bills sailed through the Judiciary, Government Oversight, General Law and Government Administration and Elections committees with little to no opposition from lawmakers.
The bill that would block access to formal complaints about police officers, for instance, passed out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously.
In other cases, the few lawmakers who spoke out against additional FOIA exemptions were Republicans, who are overwhelmingly in the minority in the General Assembly. 
In those cases, Republican lawmakers often cited the need for transparency about how taxpayer money is spent. That includes the bill that would broadly exempt records related to teaching or research at state colleges and universities.
“The issue we have with this is, this is property that really belongs to the taxpayers of Connecticut, and it includes any of the research the school is doing,” Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott, said of the measure on higher education records. “My feeling is this should not be exempt. People pay the bills — they are paying to fund the schools; they are paying the salaries. This should be information available to the taxpayers.” 
Sen. Rob Sampson, who also frequently opposes changes to the state’s open records law, said he has supported bills in the past to protect information on domestic violence victims, who could be at risk. But he believes the number of bills seeking to restrict access to records in Connecticut has gone too far in recent years.
“I just don’t see any real benefit to expanding the exemptions that already exist,” said Sampson, R-Wolcott. “I just feel like every year we have a number of different, you know, groups that come to the Capitol looking to be included in the list of exemptions.”
Ritter, who is serving in his third term as House Speaker, said there are members of his Democratic caucus who also believe the Freedom of Information Act should not be altered, and he emphasized that the bills sponsored this session will be subject to a debate before they have a chance of passing. 
“You have some caucus members who never want to make any changes,” Ritter said. “There’s some that weigh it, you know, on a case by case basis, and we’ll do the same thing this year.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20230104_Inauguration_Hartford_YK_101.jpg,,,2025-05-05 12:15:29.420054

Every day, I have been inspired beyond words by the vibrancy, brilliance, and dedication of our faculty, staff, students, and alumni,” Ono said in his statement. “I will miss the extraordinary intellectual vitality that fills our classrooms and laboratories, the sublime sounds of our musical and theatrical performances, and the roar of fans cheering on the Wolverines — or singing ‘Mr. Brightside’ together in joyful unity.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rahul Patel, chair of the University of Florida’s Presidential Search Committee, said members “sought a leader who could match UF’s extraordinary momentum, understand its role as the flagship university of one of the most dynamic states in the country, and inspire our community to reach even greater heights.”
In his announcement to the University of Michigan, Ono highlighted several developments under his leadership, including forging partnerships with OpenAI and Los Alamos National Laboratory to launch a $1.2B artificial intelligence research ecosystem, expanding university’s Go Blue Guarantee to provide free tuition to in-state students from families earning up to $125,000 and beginning efforts to rethink the campus’s physical space with the “Campus Plan 2050.”
However Ono’s two-and-a-half year tenure was not without controversy. In March the University abruptly closed its diversity, equity and inclusion office and ended its strategic plan to promote diversity following executive orders from President Donald Trump ending all DEI “mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities” in the federal government, and forbidding federal contractors from considering “race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin” in employment, procurement and contracting practices.
Ono also presided over the university amid continued protests of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, prompting policy changes from the university on how it handles protests and free speech on campus. Both students and faculty members have accused university leadership of targeting and discriminating against individuals participating in pro-Palestinian protests, while several members of university leadership have had their homes vandalized with messages in support of Palestine.
Ono began his tenure as U of M’s president on Oct. 14, 2022, succeeding former President Mark Schlissel after he was removed by the University’s Board of Regents following investigation into an anonymous complaint that Schlissel “may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with a University employee” with the board releasing more than 100 pages of email transcripts which appeared to show an improper relationship with a subordinate.

August Wilson

When I was a senior in high school deciding on a college I was adamant that the place I would spend the next four years at would have to have great theaters. And when I moved to Hartford in the fall, my first excursion off campus was to see a production of Fun Home, a coming of age musical about a girl coming to terms with her sexuality, at TheaterWorks Hartford, a non-profit professional theater in downtown Hartford. 
Having the ability to easily go and see local professional theater artists tell poignant stories like Fun Home has been an essential resource and source of inspiration for me while working towards my theater degree the past three years. 


That same year, 2022, TheaterWorks received a $155,000 cultural operating support grant from CT Humanities, the statewide affiliate of The National Endowment of Humanities (NEH). That year, the CT Cultural Fund Operating Grant gave over $16 million in awards to 632 Connecticut organizations including Hartford Stage, The Bushnell and Hartbeat Ensemble. 
However, Trump’s recent executive orders have substantially altered the NEH process. Trump executive orders require NEH Awards to not  be given to organizations that will use the funding for; “the promotion of gender ideology;  promotion of discriminatory equity ideology;  support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives or activities; or environmental justice initiatives or activities.” CT Humanities has yet to publicly announce how or if these changes affect their awards.

In the 2025 fiscal year, six Connecticut arts organizations were each awarded $10,000  Challenge America grants from the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA).  Challenge America provided support to smaller arts organizations, “that extend the reach of the arts to populations that are underserved.” 
Earlier this year the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA) announced that their Challenge America grant program will be canceled beginning in 2026 so that they could prioritize funding projects that celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. 
Public funding is a necessity for non-profit theater organizations. Ticket sales, individual and private funding alone are rarely enough to fund a full season of productions and run their community engagement programs. The NEH and the NEA have become essential sources of funds for theaters since their conceptions in 1965. 
Giving the opportunity for new voices and stories to emerge through independent theater is, in my opinion, essential for the betterment of society. Seeing and understanding diverse stories allows for a more compassionate and intelligent society.  Arthur Miller once said, “The mission of the theatre, after all, is to change, to raise the consciousness of people to their human possibilities.” A failure to fund arts is a failure to voice independent thoughts and discussions. It is a failure to maintain communities that initiate change. It is a failure to students, who benefit from reading plays in classrooms.
While these small arts organizations are facing funding regulations and cuts it is important that we as citizens continue to see shows, and tell other people to see shows and donate when you can. Hartbeat Ensemble Artistic Director and Visiting Professor of Theater and Dance at Trinity College, Godfrey Simmons implores those who care to, “support Hartford’s Public Theatre… to support all the theaters here in Greater Hartford with your money and your feet. Go! You have the actual power to keep us going so that we can continue to tell stories that help us–you, for we are you–to move forward and find the third, fourth and fifth ways to enfranchise us all.”
This past weekend I went back to TheaterWorks to see the last show of their production of King James, a play that tackles microaggressions and implicit bias in an interracial friendship. I left wondering if we’ll be able to see stories like these in a year.

Minneapolis is among the cities forced to cancel vaccinations after cutoffs in federal funding. (Courtesy of City of Minneapolis)The number of measles cases is approaching 1,000 across 29 states, according to newly released federal statistics. Even as the outbreaks grow, more local governments are complaining that their efforts to combat measles with vaccination clinics have been shut down by abrupt federal funding cuts.
As of May 1, a total of 935 confirmed cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They were in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
There have been three confirmed deaths, two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.

Metro Nashville, the combined county and city government in Tennessee, and three other local governments sued on April 24 over reductions in federal public health funding, saying the abrupt $11 billion in cuts nationwide forced Nashville to cancel vaccination clinics needed to combat this year’s measles outbreak. Colorado and a group of other states sued earlier in April, mentioning the impact of cuts on their ability to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Others joining the April 24 lawsuit: Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. They called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”
The funding cuts also forced Minneapolis to shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June, said Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, director of health initiatives for the city’s health department.
Last year the city’s clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots, including against measles, she said. About 30% of children in the city are not fully vaccinated, much too high to ensure unvaccinated children won’t fall victim to measles outbreaks like the current one, she added.
“There’s fear and hesitancy about the vaccine, based on some of the misinformation out there,” Pessoa-Brandão said. “There are other factors — access [to medical care] and the COVID pandemic, which delayed people getting vaccinations. We’re playing catch-up the last few years.”

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal in its present form would have huge effects on housing and homelessness in California. 


On Friday President Trump released a budget blueprint for the next fiscal year that would take a chainsaw to social, environmental and education programs. Some of the sharpest cuts are directed at housing programs that are meant to serve the poor, housing insecure and unhoused.
In California, millions are served by these funds and state and local governments depend on them to operate affordable housing, rental assistance, homeless service, planning and legal programs.
In a letter to the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, the president’s budget director, Russel Vought, laid out $163 billion in annual spending cuts coupled with “unprecedented increases” in military and border security spending. The cuts, Vought wrote, are directed at areas of spending that the administration found to be “contrary to the needs of ordinary working Americans and tilted toward funding niche non-governmental organizations and institutions of higher education committed to radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the American way of life.”
That includes $33.5 billion in proposed cuts to the Housing and Urban Development department, a 44% reduction from current levels.
Presidential budget requests rarely reflect what Congress ultimately passes into law but are instead often viewed as something between an opening negotiating bid and a political vision board. 
“You’d be looking at millions of people out on the street virtually overnight.”Matt Schwartz, president, California Housing Partnership
Even so, the budget document makes for quite a vision — one that, if realized, would upend decades of federal housing policy and affect millions of lives.
The sheer breadth of the cuts provides an odd kind of solace to some affordable housing advocates. 
“By following through on such a huge level with so many proposals that are going to gut assistance to low-income people across the country, including his own party’s states, he’s putting his own members of Congress in a very difficult place,” said Matt Schwartz, president of the California Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that advocates for more affordable housing. “The level of carnage that would be involved in doing these things is probably going to send some Republican senators running for the exits.”
A handful of powerful GOP senators have, indeed, already pushed back on the president’s proposal, though much of their ire was directed at what they saw as a lack of sufficient military spending. 
The largest single cut in federal housing policy would target the Housing Choice Voucher program. Better known as Section 8, it’s currently administered by the federal government and helps low-income tenants with their rental payments. The White House is proposing shifting responsibility for the administration of that program, which it calls “dysfunctional,” to states, while cutting its funding in half.

Resistance state: Tracking California’s lawsuits against the new Trump administration 

by CalMatters Staff 





It also proposes a two-year limit on how long a single person can receive help. That change is “completely out of touch with what people are facing in the housing market,” said Alex Visotzky, senior California policy fellow at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. With soaring rents outpacing people’s incomes, low-income tenants aren’t going to be able to magically earn enough money to start paying rent in two years, he said.
Additional cuts to four other housing voucher programs are meant to save $27 billion annually.
“You’d be looking at millions of people out on the street virtually overnight,” said Schwartz. “There’s no way states could maintain the same level of assistance.”
The administration proposes to save nearly $5 billion more by eliminating funds for local economic development grants, affordable housing developments and local initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers to new housing. 
That latter program, a Biden-era initiative known as Pathways to Removing Obstacle Housing, was denounced in the administration’s budget write-up as a “woke” program that has pursued “radical racial, gender, and climate goals.” 
The White House pointed specifically to a $6.7 million grant made to Los Angeles County to fund infrastructure planning, public transit-oriented housing and, as described in the county’s funding proposal, rezoning that would reverse the region’s “legacy of past systemic racism.”
Radical reshuffle of homelessness policy
The budget would slash federal homelessness funding by $532 million, while also radically changing the way those funds are distributed. The Continuum of Care program – the main way the federal government distributes funds to fight homelessness – would effectively end. It would be replaced by an Emergency Solutions Grant program.
The continuum program funds long-term solutions to homelessness, including permanent supportive housing, which is housing that comes with case management, counseling and other services for people with disabilities, mental illnesses, addictions or other struggles that mean they require extra help. Emergency Solutions Grants, on the other hand, fund more short-term solutions, such as homeless shelters, or short-term rental assistance for people who don’t need extra services.
That shift in funding would mean thousands of people would lose their supportive housing and end up back on the street, said Visotzky from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. 
“This would be a significant shift away from the solution to homelessness, which is housing, towards shelter,” he said. “This budget is going to take away all the pathways to get out of shelter and into housing.”
Homeless veterans fared better. The budget proposes a $1.1 billion increase “for the President’s commitment to ending veterans’ homelessness.” Those funds would go to Veterans Affairs for rental assistance, case management and support services.
The budget also calls for the elimination of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, an agency tasked with coordinating homeless policy at the federal level, which the administration had already gutted.
End of “fair housing” enforcement as we know it
The White House also proposes zeroing out a grant program that funds nonprofit legal aid organizations that enforce national fair housing laws. According to the explanatory summary of the cuts published by the administration, these organizations advocate “against single family neighborhoods and promote radical equity policies.”
That characterization is strongly disputed by Caroline Peattie, executive director of the Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California. Federally recognized nonprofit fair housing groups processed 74% of all fair housing complaints submitted across the country in 2023, according to data compiled by the National Fair Housing Alliance. The remainder go to federal and state housing regulators.
A recent example: In 2022, Peattie’s organization received a complaint that a Nevada-based appraisal company was systematically undervaluing homes owned by Black and Latino Californians. The nonprofit investigated and submitted a complaint to the state. The California Civil Rights Department reached a settlement with the appraisal company in mid-April.
If all the cuts go into effect as proposed, Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California would lose roughly 75% of its funding, said Peattie. 
“It’s just appalling,” she said. “When the fair housing organizations go away, then what?”
The across-the-board cuts come after months of legal battle between fair housing organizations and the administration. In February the Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by Elon Musk, abruptly terminated a key source of congressionally authorized funding for dozens of private fair housing organizations, including Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California. The groups sued. With that lawsuit pending, the funds, appropriated for fiscal year 2024, “are still in the ether,” said Peattie.
Last month, Congress passed a bill to keep government spending at current levels from the prior year, meaning that fiscal year 2025 spending is in a holding pattern for now.
“But as for fiscal year 2026, all bets are off,” said Peattie.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/020525-Homeless-Encampment-Sweep-Fresno-LV_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 12:15:29.420054

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)BOISE, Idaho — The day the flag bill came up for a vote in the Idaho Senate this spring, state Sen. Melissa Wintrow had no plans to speak against it. As the top Democratic leader in her chamber, she had already spent the legislative session in constant, vocal opposition to the Republican-dominated legislative agenda.
“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.
“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough. Just always picking and bullying,’” Wintrow said. “The state’s going to tell us what to do, when they can’t even address the larger problems like affordable housing? That’s what’s on people’s minds. A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, both Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at City Hall.










It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things. 


– State Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Idaho


In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”
‘Get rid of everything’
The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle, a suburb northwest of Boise. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.

Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”
Boise’s city council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.
The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.

‘It is very targeted’
In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.
“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”

One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.
Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”










It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would.


– Aaron Bullen, Utah parent and Republican activist


He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”
Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

Josh McLaurin, a Sandy Springs Democrat, announced May 5 the start of his lieutenant governor campaign for what’s expected to be a heavily contested race in 2026. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)State Sen. Josh McLaurin, a Sandy Springs Democrat, announced Monday that he is entering the 2026 race for lieutenant governor.
McLaurin is serving his fourth term in the Georgia Legislature, where he’s become known as an outspoken opponent of  Republican lawmakers who he says rubber stamp President Donald Trump’s policies.
“100 days in, the Trump administration is tanking the economy and ignoring court orders. But the Republicans running the State of Georgia are silent about Trump’s needless tariffs and his violations of Americans’ basic legal rights,” McLaurin said.
McLaurin is scheduled to hold a campaign launch event at 3 p.m. Monday at Rousakis Riverfront Plaza in Savannah. 
Vidalia Republican Sen. Blake Tillery and Conyers Republican Takosha Swan, a board member of the Georgia Department of Veterans Services, have also filed paperwork to fundraise for what’s expected to be a heavily contested lieutenant governor race next year.
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Butts County Republican, has not announced whether he will seek a second term in office or seek to replace the term-limited GOP Gov. Brian Kemp.
McLaurin said in a statement announcing his decision that if elected as lieutenant governor, he will continue standing up for “hard working” Georgians.
“It’s time to elect state leaders who understand how crazy this moment in history is and are ready to stand up and do something about it,” McLaurin said. “Georgia is my home and my heart. We’ve got amazing people and culture. We’ve got Waffle House. We could be a national example of how best to live, work, and raise a family.  But our state is run by Republicans who can’t find the spine to tell the truth about Trump’s chaos – or do anything at all to fight back.”
Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat, is the first Democrat to throw his hat in the ring to run for governor, but others could soon join him — former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has said she hopes to make an announcement soon, and former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond is seen as another likely candidate.
State Rep. Ruwa Romman, a Duluth Democrat and ally of McLaurin, quickly endorsed his bid.
“We need people who are willing to fight, do the hard work, and stand up for Georgians because the reality is that a lot of people feel left behind and this is the moment to show them who has actually been fighting for them and who hasn’t.”

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.


Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.
Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

Students from the Charter School of Wilmington have been named National Winners of the 15th annual Samsung Solve for Tomorrow STEM competition, taking home a $100,000 prize package for their groundbreaking healthcare innovation.
The Delaware high schoolers earned top honors after presenting their project live to a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., on April 28.
Their winning solution, the “AKQUA-Gel hydrogel bandage,” tackles the state’s growing physician shortage by enabling remote wound monitoring through advanced technology.
READ: University of Delaware President Dennis Assanis announces resignation
The smart bandage integrates AI-powered features, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and 3D-printed components to track key wound-healing indicators such as moisture, pH, and oxygen levels.
Linked to a mobile app, the device allows both patients and doctors to monitor wounds in real time—potentially cutting down hospital visits and easing strain on overburdened healthcare systems.
Delaware has been hit especially hard by a shortage of medical professionals, with some counties experiencing wait times for primary care that have surged nearly 200%.
The students designed the AKQUA-Gel to be part of the solution, aiming to increase access to care and improve patient outcomes through smart, accessible technology.
Samsung’s Solve for Tomorrow competition challenges students nationwide to use STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) to solve real-world problems.

This team of artisans restored three enormous stained glass windows, panel by panel, for the historic church that was a bastion for the Civil Rights movement in Memphis, Tennessee, in the 1960s. The stained glass windows depicted Civil Rights icons and paid homage to the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike, which lasted 64 days from Feb. 12 to April 16, 1968. It is the site where sanitation workers agreed to end the strike when city officials recognized their union and their raised wages.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/ Getty Images)Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage has officially signaled his intent to run for Congress. 
The Republican filed paperwork Sunday with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. Last November, Jared Golden, a Democrat who often crosses party lines, was reelected to a fourth term in the district that covers a large swath of the state. 
LePage became governor of Maine in 2011 and served until 2019. The New York Times described him as one of the “most unfiltered politicians” pre-President Donald Trump; however, he prided himself on lowering taxes and cutting regulations while chief executive. 
While the paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission lists a P.O. Box for LePage in Augusta, he became a permanent resident of Florida after leaving office in 2020 and again after losing to current Gov. Janet Mills in the 2022 gubernatorial election. He was said to have benefited from tax breaks reserved for permanent residents for property he owned in the state while living in the Maine governor’s mansion.
In 2018, LePage was sued for refusing to implement voter-approved Medicaid expansion. He has also been called out for racist remarks and left a voicemail laden with obscenities for a state lawmaker who criticized him.
“President Trump needs a fighter who will stand with him and increase the Republican majority in the U.S. House,” said Maine GOP Chairman Jim Deyermond, in a Facebook post Monday morning.
Asked about LePage’s candidacy, Golden responded, “I thought Paul was doing his best work in retirement.”
Golden is said to be considering a run for governor. Asked about his plan, a spokesperson for the representative said he’s “busy fighting the GOP’s health care cuts and working through his committees to secure jobs for Bath Iron Works and protect Maine’s fishing communities.”
“The next election is the furthest thing from his mind.”

Raphael Warnock took questions from constituents at Zion Hill Baptist Church in Atlanta. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderIn the latest Georgia town hall meeting turned heated, an event hosted by Sen. Raphael Warnock was twice disrupted by protests over a vote on weapons shipments to Israel.
The first came during a response to a question about funding for Israel.

“I have to ask you about the way we spend our money,” asked a constituent who declined to give his name. “My voice is against using our money to fund what many people would consider a genocide.”
Last month, Warnock and fellow Georgia Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff were part of an overwhelming majority of senators who voted to reject a bid to block $8.8 billion in arms sales to Israel sponsored by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders said the proposal represented an effort to force Israel to take steps to protect civilians from bombing and to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.
In November, Warnock and Ossoff joined 16 other senators in supporting a failed resolution to block some weapon sales.
Warnock told the constituent he had been working to support peace and humanitarian aid.

“I believe in the humanity of all God’s children, and that you have to center the concerns of the most marginalized,” he said. “And that’s why I was one of the first in the Senate to call for a ceasefire. In addition to that, I pressed the Biden administration, I pushed the Netanyahu administration around the ways in which humanitarian aid was not even getting into Gaza.I voted to get $10 billion in humanitarian aid to Gaza. My North Star in this conflict is a world that embraces the children on both sides of this conflict.”
During the answer, several women stood up in the crowd and began shouting things like “it’s our money” and “you’re a liar.”
For a few awkward minutes, the women berated Warnock while staff members tried to continue with the programming and members of the crowd shouted for the demonstrators to sit down.
Warnock told the protesters he would answer their questions but refused to shout over them.

“We have to decide, as somebody who is an activist myself and who comes from the activist community, you can come and express yourself, it’s a very passionate issue, or we can have a conversation, but we can’t do both of those things,” he said. “We can do one or the other.”
“As incredibly important as this issue is, and it’s a matter of life and death, there are other issues here, and these folks deserve to be heard as well,” he added.
The women left after about six minutes. Several minutes after that, a man began shouting at Warnock over his vote while another audience member who had been called on by the moderator tried to ask a question about high health insurance costs.
The man left after a brief period after being approached by Warnock staff.

Other than the demonstrators, Warnock faced a mostly friendly crowd who largely expressed concerns over actions of the Trump administration, including levying increased tariffs, cutting federal jobs and dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The senator, who is up for re-election in 2028, pledged to oppose the administration and directed constituents with specific issues to follow up with his staff.
For decades, support of Israel was a bipartisan issue, but the matter has become especially fraught for Democrats since Israel’s latest military campaign which began in October 2023 after the militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel.
According to the United Nations, as of April 22, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, including more than 8,000 women and 15,000 children. In addition, the UN finds nearly the entire population faces high levels of food insecurity as Israel has ordered a halt to all aid into Gaza, including food and medicine.

Jawahir Sharwany, one of the demonstrators who shouted at Warnock, said the demonstrations will continue until the policy changes.
“We’re not going to stop protesting and talking about it until they stop sending shipments from all these billions of dollars of weapons bills,” she said. “Warnock is signing onto the deaths of Palestinian children.”
Angry constituents have become a town hall hallmark for U.S. legislators from both parties this year.
In February, Republican Congressman Rich McCormick faced a tough crowd at a town hall in Roswell over government cuts and layoffs. In April, multiple protesters were zapped with Tasers at an Acworth meeting with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ossoff got an earful  from fired federal workers who said he needed to do more to push back against the administration.

Final Reading: A major House elections bill is hitting some roadblocks 

by Shaun Robinson

Technically, the National Conference of State Legislatures lists Vermont as having an open primary system. Voters do not declare a party preference when registering to vote. Primary election voters can choose which party’s ballot to vote. The challenge in the Vermont system is there is nothing to prevent a member of party A from running as a candidate in party B’s primary.    A recent report from by the American Political Science Association notes:  “By providing candidates with a label, parties can serve as a valuable cue and shortcut for voters. Much like people associate brands with a specific type of product, voters link parties to policy menus and develop positive or negative feelings towards them. In a country where voters cast ballots for myriad offices—not just state and federal executives and legislators but a panoply of local officials—party labels are not just a convenience that makes voting easier but a virtual necessity to sort out candidates on lengthy ballots. Besides providing valuable cues to voters, parties also help organize political ideas more coherently and ideologically in a way that most voters lack the time or interest to do.”One of the fundamentals of our election system are political parties, where each party is unique and different from all the other political parties. It is clear that the APSA task force of political scientists believes that party labels help voters to avoid being confused when making judgements about candidates. When voters are faced with a confusion candidate, a candidate from one party who runs in another party’s primary, are there any winners?Because Vermont lacks any laws that prevent candidates from one party running in another party’s primary, voters are relying on each individual candidate to stay in their lane. It is clear over the last 10 years more candidates are not staying in their lane. The actual number of candidates is low but persistent — while once the exclusive territory of candidates from one party now all boundaries have disappeared.Our lack of a well-thought-out election system may be making it much more challenging for voters to make a judgment as to which candidate best aligns with their views. It might be time to enact new laws that prevent a candidate from running in a party primary for which they are not a member.  Or we could bin the existing system and move to a multi-party primary system, where Vermont would hold a single primary election where every candidate for an office, regardless of party, is listed on a single ballot and the top candidates move on to the general election.  The challenge for the Legislature is one of politics. Legislators, and political parties , requently have their own best interest at heart. Making changes to the existing primary election system has proven elusive. Often, in situations like this, where it is difficult to develop a legislative consensus, it is the thoughts of citizens shared with their legislators that can make the difference between improving the primary election system or no change.    Let’s improve the system and help every Vermonter get the best out of their vote.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Russell Frank: Let’s rethink our primary system.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 11:05:00.350000

Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were picketing at manufacturing locations in East Hartford and Middletown, after about 77% of nearly 2,100 union members voted to approve their first strike since 2001, union officials said. Their contract expired late Sunday.
“Pratt and Whitney is a powerhouse in military and commercial aerospace products because our membership makes it so,” David Sullivan, the union’s eastern territory vice president, said in a statement. “This offer does not address the membership concerns, and the membership made their decision — we will continue to fight for a fair contract.”
The company, a subsidiary of Arlington, Virginia-based RTX Corp., called its latest wage and retirement proposal competitive, and said its workforce is among the most highly compensated in the region and industry.
“Our message to union leaders throughout this thoughtful process has been simple: higher pay, better retirement savings, more days off and more flexibility,” the company said in a statement. “We have no immediate plans to resume negotiations at this time and we have contingency plans in place to maintain operations and to meet our customer commitments.”
The company said its latest contract proposal included an immediate 4% wage increase, followed by a 3.5% increase in 2026 and a 3% increase in 2027. It also included a $5,000 contract ratification bonus and enhanced pension and 401k plan benefits.

Every day, teachers are nurturing and supporting our precious students in classrooms across New Hampshire. Teachers dedicate their careers and their lives to providing young Granite Staters with the tools they need to build bright futures and live out their dreams.
May 5-9 marks Teacher Appreciation Week nationwide — an important moment to ensure the teachers in our lives know how much they mean to us and our communities. It’s important to show — and tell — our gratitude.
I am so grateful for every New Hampshire teacher. To those who taught me how to teach, to my colleagues in the classroom who supported me and guided me throughout my career, to the dedicated professionals who I trust to teach my three sons — thank you! You inspire me every day, and you inspire the next generation to be their best selves.
This year, I hope you’ll join me to show your appreciation and show up for teachers. We can drop off a gift card and we can drop by a school board meeting. We can tell teachers how much we care about their work. And we can tell our policy makers to protect our neighborhood public schools.
At the state and federal level, anti-public education politicians are trying to turn public funding into blank checks for private schools. They want to give more handouts and tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while breaking our public schools and taking resources away from teachers and students.
We can’t afford to let them turn funding for public school students and teachers into private school vouchers. We can’t afford to let them slash programs like Medicaid and children’s health insurance that keep students healthy and ready to learn. We can’t afford to let them cut programs that keep our kids safe, like the Office of the Child Advocate. These harmful proposals — and more — are all contained in the current state budget draft.
We know what appreciation would look like in action. Teachers would have classrooms that are stocked with supplies they need and full of the joy that students deserve. Teachers would come to work at schools that are safe, welcoming, and well-funded. Teachers would have the careers they deserve that can support their families and support our communities in every corner of this state.
Whether you speak out on your social media accounts or call your lawmakers, when we transform our appreciation into support for teachers we protect and strengthen public schools.
Teachers go above and beyond for their students every day — even in the face of anti-public education politicians’ attacks on their profession and their school. They bring joy and determination to their work to ensure every student — no matter the color of their skin or the ZIP code they live in — has the resources they need to succeed.
We know the overwhelming majority of Granite Staters support the teachers at their community public schools, which are attended by nearly 90% of students and 95% of students with a disability. Now it’s time for us to go above and beyond for teachers and turn our appreciation into actions that will protect our public schools and help teachers get the support and resources they deserve.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Classroom2-1024x688.jpeg,,,2025-05-05 11:05:00.350000

The potential elimination of Head Start would represent a setback to decades of progress in advancing equitable access to high-quality services that support child and family well-being.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Morgan Crossman: Head Start is at risk and there is vital need for proactive funding solutions.","This commentary is by Morgan Crossman, executive director of Building Bright Futures.As Vermont’s Early Childhood State Advisory Council named in the Federal Head Start Act, Building Bright Futures is deeply concerned about reports that the upcoming federal budget proposal may eliminate Head Start and Early Head Start. These programs are essential to meeting the basic needs of Vermont families.BBF is committed to ensuring that all of Vermont’s children and families have access to the fundamental resources they need to thrive. BBF plays a critical role in monitoring how policy decisions — federal, state and local — affect the early childhood system and in holding decision-makers accountable for protecting and strengthening this system.In 2024, Head Start and Early Head Start served 1,249 at-risk children in Vermont, supported by $27.7 million in federal funding. These programs provide early education and much more. They ensure that children receive comprehensive health screenings, nutrition, family support and access to developmental services — critical supports that help lay the foundation for lifelong well-being and academic success.Research consistently shows that participation in Head Start improves long-term outcomes for children, including increased high school graduation rates and improved health. These programs are also a key part of Vermont’s early childhood infrastructure, especially given that access to child care, particularly in rural areas of our state, continues to be a challenge.Vermont’s Head Start programs also employ 450 people, including 260 early educators, home visitors and child development professionals — all of whom are valuable members of the state’s workforce and many of whom are paid above average salaries in their positions.BBF recognizes that the federal budget proposal is not final and is advocating to maintain federal funding for Head Start. Nonetheless, BBF urges Vermont’s leaders —i ncluding the governor, state agencies and legislators — to begin planning now for how Vermont can sustain these critical services should federal funding be reduced or eliminated. Contingency planning and cross-sector collaboration will be essential to mitigate harm to children and families.The potential elimination of Head Start would represent not just a loss of services, but a setback to decades of progress in advancing equitable access to high-quality services that support child and family well-being. The Building Bright Futures State Advisory Council remains committed to ensuring that all Vermont children — especially those most vulnerable — have access to the resources and opportunities they need to reach their full potential.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Morgan Crossman: Head Start is at risk and there is vital need for proactive funding solutions.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 11:05:00.350000

In 2005, Missouri adopted some of the strictest eligibility standards in the nation, reduced benefits, and increased patients’ copayments for the joint federal-state program due to state budget shortfalls totaling about $2.4 billion over several prior years. More than 100,000 Missourians lost coverage as a result, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that the changes led to increases in credit card borrowing and debt in third-party collections.
A woman told NPR that year that her $6.70-an-hour McDonald’s job put her over the new income limits and rendered her ineligible, even though she was supporting three children on about $300 a week. A woman receiving $865 a month in disability payments worried at a town hall meeting about not being able to raise her orphaned granddaughter as the state asked her to pay $167 a month to keep her health coverage.
Now, Missouri could lose an estimated $2 billion a year in federal funding as congressional Republicans look to cut at least $880 billion over a decade from a pool of funding that includes Medicaid programs nationwide. Medicaid and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program together insure roughly 79 million people — about 1 in 5 Americans.
“We’re looking at a much more significant impact with the loss of federal funds even than what 2005 was,” said Amy Blouin, president of the progressive Missouri Budget Project think tank. “We’re not going to be able to protect kids. We’re not going to be able to protect people with disabilities from some sort of impact.”
At today’s spending levels, a cut of $880 billion to Medicaid could lead to states’ losing federal funding ranging from $78 million a year in Wyoming to $13 billion a year in California, according to an analysis from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. State lawmakers nationwide would then be left to address the shortfalls, likely through some combination of slashing benefits or eligibility, raising taxes, or finding a different large budget item to cut, such as education spending.
Republican lawmakers are floating various proposals to cut Medicaid, including one to reduce the money the federal government sends to states to help cover adults who gained access to the program under the Affordable Care Act’s provision known as Medicaid expansion. The 2010 health care law allowed states to expand Medicaid eligibility to cover more adults with low incomes. The federal government is picking up 90% of the tab for that group. About 20 million people nationwide are now covered through that expansion.
Missouri expanded Medicaid in 2021. That has meant that a single working-age adult in Missouri can now earn up to $21,597 a year and qualify for coverage, whereas before, nondisabled adults without children couldn’t get Medicaid coverage. That portion of the program now covers over 329,000 Missourians, more than a quarter of the state’s Medicaid recipients.
For every percentage point that the federal portion of the funding for that group decreases, Missouri’s Medicaid director estimated, the state could lose $30 million to $35 million a year.
But the equation is even more complicated given that Missouri expanded access via a constitutional amendment. Voters approved the expansion in 2020 after the state’s Republican leadership resisted doing so for a decade. That means changes to Medicaid expansion in Missouri would require voters to amend the state constitution again. The same is true in South Dakota and Oklahoma.
So even if Congress attempted to narrowly target cuts to the nation’s Medicaid expansion population, Washington University in St. Louis health economist Timothy McBride said, Missouri’s expansion program would likely stay in place.
“Then you would just have to find the money elsewhere, which would be brutal in Missouri,” McBride said.










I’m not ready to think that Congress is going to willingly put us on the path of making every state go cut their benefits for the most vulnerable.


– Elias Tsapelas, director of fiscal policy at the conservative Show-Me Institute


In Crestwood, a suburb of St. Louis, Sandra Smith worries her daughter’s in-home nursing care would be on the chopping block. Nearly all in-home services are an optional part of Medicaid that states are not required to include in their programs. But the services have been critical for Sandra and her 24-year-old daughter, Sarah.
Sarah Smith has been disabled for most of her life due to seizures from a rare genetic disorder called Dravet syndrome. She has been covered by Medicaid in various ways since she was 3.
She needs intensive, 24-hour care, and Medicaid pays for a nurse to come to their home 13 hours a day. Her mother serves as the overnight caregiver and covers when the nurses are sick — work Sandra Smith is not allowed to be compensated for and that doesn’t count toward the 63-year-old’s Social Security.
Having nursing help allows Sandra Smith to work as an independent podcast producer and gives her a break from being the go-to-person for providing care 24 hours a day, day after day, year after year.
“I really and truly don’t know what I would do if we lost the Medicaid home care. I have no plan whatsoever,” Sandra Smith said. “It is not sustainable for anyone to do infinite, 24-hour care without dire physical health, mental health, and financial consequences, especially as we parents get into our elder years.”
Elias Tsapelas, director of fiscal policy at the conservative Show-Me Institute, said potential changes to Medicaid programs depend on the extent of any budget cuts that Congress ultimately passes and how much time states have to respond.
A large cut implemented immediately, for example, would require state legislators to look for parts of the budget they have the discretion to cut quickly. But if states have time to absorb funding changes, he said, they would have more flexibility.
“I’m not ready to think that Congress is going to willingly put us on the path of making every state go cut their benefits for the most vulnerable,” Tsapelas said.
Missouri’s congressional delegation split along party lines over the recent budget resolution calling for deep spending cuts, with the Republicans who control six of the eight House seats and both Senate seats all voting for it.
But 76% of the public, including 55% of Republicans, say they oppose major federal funding cuts to Medicaid, according to a national KFF poll conducted April 8-15.
And Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, has said that he does not support cutting Medicaid and posted on the social platform X that he was told by President Donald Trump that the House and Senate would not cut Medicaid benefits and that Trump won’t sign any benefit cuts.
“I hope congressional leadership will get the message,” Hawley posted. He declined to comment for this article.
U.S. House Republicans are aiming to pass a budget by Memorial Day, after many state legislatures, including Missouri’s, will have adjourned for the year.
Meanwhile, Missouri lawmakers are poised to pass a tax cut that is estimated to reduce state revenue by about $240 million in the first year.

For the first time, scientists have mapped groundwater variables nationally to understand which aquifers are most vulnerable to contamination from orphan wells.
Oil and gas wells with no active owner that are no longer producing and have not been plugged are considered orphan wells. These unplugged wells can create pathways for contaminants like hydrocarbons and brine to migrate from the oil and gas formation into groundwater zones. Plugging a well seals off these potential pathways.
USGS scientists Joshua Woda, Karl Haase, Nicholas Gianoutsos, Kalle Jahn and Kristina Gutchess published a geospatial analysis of water-quality threats from orphan wells this month in the journal Science of the Total Environment. They found that factors including large concentrations of orphaned wells and the advanced age of wells make aquifers in Appalachia, the Gulf Coast and California susceptible to contamination.
Using a USGS dataset of 117,672 documented orphan wells nationwide, the researchers found that 54 percent of the wells are within aquifers that supply 94 percent of groundwater used nationally.
“No matter where you live across the nation, you can go look at what’s happening in your backyard, how your aquifers compare to other aquifers and what the threats are,” said Gianoutsos.
 Orphan wells pockmark major U.S. aquifers

The researchers mapped the locations of orphaned wells over principal and secondary aquifers using Geographic Information Systems datasets. They then analyzed the aquifers based on factors that could contribute to vulnerability to groundwater contamination, such as the average age of the orphan wells.
Older wells were subject to less regulation and are more prone to failure. The authors found that Pennsylvanian aquifers, which span several Appalachian states including Pennsylvania, present the “maximum confluence” of risk factors. The first oil wells in the country were drilled in Pennsylvania. Orphan wells can be over 100 years old and located near coal seams and residential water wells.
The Gulf Coast aquifers, including the Coastal Lowlands aquifer system, which stretches from Texas to the Florida Panhandle, were found to be susceptible in part because wells are located in areas like wetlands and open water that are more prone to contamination.
The analysis also considered the rates of pumping from each aquifer. That led them to the California Coastal aquifers and the Central Valley, where a high density of old orphan wells overlaps with highly urbanized areas and intensive groundwater use for agriculture.
The researchers found that the Ada-Vamoosa aquifer, in central Oklahoma, has the highest concentration of orphan wells per square mile of any principal aquifer in the country.
The authors note the paper is not an analysis of the amount of groundwater contamination from orphan wells or the number of leaking orphan wells. But they suggest that policymakers and researchers could use it as a basis to target aquifers for additional investigation.
“This could be a good starting point if someone wanted to do a local investigation,” said Woda.
Gianoutsos noted that the active list of orphan wells is changing as research into orphan wells and well plugging advances. He said some 40,000 orphan wells have been added to the national list since their dataset was created. Another approximately 10,000 orphan wells have been plugged in that time.
“The threats are still there,” he said. “Just as we discover more wells, we discover additional threats.”
The research was part of the U.S. Department of the Interior Orphaned Wells Program Office through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
 Parts of Pennsylvania look like ‘Swiss cheese’ from drilling 

Orphan wells have been linked to groundwater contamination in states including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas. A 2011 Ground Water Protection Council study found that orphan wells caused 41 groundwater contamination incidents in Ohio between 1983 and 2007. The study found orphan wells and sites caused 30 groundwater contamination incidents in Texas between 1993 and 2008.
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has reported several recent cases of orphan wells contaminating groundwater. An orphan well in Vowinckel in Clarion County contaminated a family’s drinking water before it was plugged last year, according to the DEP. Another orphan well in Shinglehouse, in Potter County, was plugged by DEP in 2024 with emergency funds after a homeowner reported contamination of their water well.
John Stolz, a professor of environmental microbiology at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, has researched how fluids from oil and gas wells can migrate underground with unintended consequences.
Stolz said some of the wells in Pennsylvania are so old they were cased with wood or metal, unlike the cement that has been standard for decades. He said the wooden casings have often deteriorated completely. He said conventional drilling and more recent fracking have left much of Pennsylvania “looking like Swiss cheese.”
“It’s good to see a study that focuses on the water resources,” he said in response to the USGS study. “We are going to have greater periods of drought, and these water resources are going to become far more valuable.”
Stolz is studying a “frack-out” in the town of New Freeport in southwestern Pennsylvania. An unconventional well being fracked communicated with an orphan well over 3,000 feet away, forcing fluids to the surface. Residents of the town resorted to drinking bottled water, according to NBC News.
“The industry refuses to admit this stuff happens,” he said. “The reality is it happens on a somewhat regular basis.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240328smWell01-1024x736.jpg,,,2025-05-05 11:05:00.350000

During his presidency, UD climbed national rankings, including a 60-place leap in The Wall Street Journal/Pulse 2025 rankings, where it currently sits at No. 26 overall and No. 10 among public universities.
The university also experienced significant enrollment growth.
Applications rose by 50% since 2016, reaching a record 41,000 first-year applications in 2025.
Financial aid nearly doubled, from $94 million to $185 million, and the university’s four-year graduation rate now ranks ninth among public R1 institutions.
Assanis championed initiatives such as the “First State Promise,” which covers tuition and fees for in-state students from families earning under $75,000.
Enrollment of Pell Grant recipients rose more than 34%, while underrepresented minority enrollment increased by over 30%.
In research, UD’s expenditures rose from $176 million to $466 million, bolstered by interdisciplinary growth and the university’s role in hosting the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL). A
ssanis also led efforts to strengthen AI research and support the arts and humanities.
More than 600 faculty members were hired during his presidency—nearly half of UD’s current faculty—expanding academic expertise and diversity across the institution.
The physical transformation of the campus was a cornerstone of Assanis’ leadership.
He spearheaded development at the Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus, now home to over 1.2 million square feet of new facilities and more than 3,000 employees.
Major projects included the Tower at STAR, the Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center, and the forthcoming SABRE Center.
Elsewhere on campus, Assanis oversaw new science and residence halls, renovations of core facilities like Warner and Worrilow Halls, and improved student wellness resources such as the Wellbeing Center and Center for Intercultural Engagement.
He also boosted UD’s athletics profile, overseeing stadium renovations, the new Whitney Athletic Center, and the university’s upcoming move to Conference USA and the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).
During Assanis’ presidency, UD raised more than $1 billion through its Delaware First campaign and an additional $270 million in the past two and a half years.
This included a $71.5 million donation—the largest in university history—from alumni Rob and Kathy Siegfried, which will fund Siegfried Hall and the Siegfried Institute for Leadership and Free Enterprise.
The 4-time MIT-graduate and Newcastle University undergraduate brought a distinguished background to UD, with previous roles as provost at Stony Brook University and faculty positions at the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
A member of the National Academy of Engineers, he holds five patents and led over $100 million in research grants.
“UD is a remarkable place with a vibrant culture of interdisciplinary inspiration to reimagine what’s possible in higher education,” Assanis said. “I will forever treasure my experience of leading such an extraordinary institution defined by amazing students, talented faculty, dedicated staff and a vast network of loyal alumni and friends who support its mission.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DA_UDARF-President_Assanis_Presentation-050422-026_UDaily_-_Story_social_sharing_800x420.jpg,,,2025-05-05 10:08:29.953265

That extended area includes the Chukchi Borderland. (Photo provided by Caitlin Bailey/Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration)The Trump administration is eying the possibility of oil leasing in Arctic Ocean areas more than 200 miles from shore, an area where U.S. territorial rights are unclear.
Information about the Trump administration’s plans to add a “High Arctic” planning area to the federal offshore oil and gas leasing program, announced two weeks ago, was provided Tuesday in a formal solicitation for public comment. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, a division of the Department of the Interior, said it will accept public comments for 45 days on its proposal to reorganize the federal offshore leasing program, including the addition of the High Arctic area.
The new area proposed for inclusion in the oil and gas leasing program is part of the ocean territory to which the U.S. government is claiming new rights following a sea-mapping program conducted over several years.
The area is part of what is known as the extended continental shelf, which goes beyond exclusive economic zone borders that typically end at 200 nautical miles from shore.
The U.S. State Department in December 2023 began the process of claiming over 200,000 square miles of Arctic seafloor in the extended continental shelf. That area is more than twice the size of California.
Nations’ territorial rights in extended continental shelf areas beyond the 200-nautical-mile limits are limited to the seafloor and subsea areas, under international maritime law. They do not include any rights in the waters above, such as fishing rights.
Such territorial claims are normally evaluated for validity by a United Nations organization, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. While State Department information expresses an intent to submit the U.S. territorial claims to the commission, the commission’s website shows no pending U.S. applications.
The U.S. has never ratified the treaty under which the commission operates, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. That puts U.S. claims to the Arctic Ocean territory in some doubt; Russia has already objected, arguing that the U.S. is not part of the ocean treaty and therefore not entitled to its benefits.
It is difficult to know whether the U.S. government has a right to sell oil leases in the newly claimed High Arctic territory, an Anchorage environmental attorney said.
“In the international realm, it’s not always clear all the time,” said Teresa Clemmer, litigation director for Trustees for Alaska, an environmental law firm.

	As to why the Department of the Interior would designate an oil and gas leasing area in the High Arctic in murky legal circumstances, Clemmer said, there may be parallels in Russian and Canadian government actions that started exercising regulatory authority in Arctic areas where their territorial rights were not certain.
“That’s a way of getting a foot in the door and establishing that they have this authority,” she said.
Neither the Department of the Interior nor the State Department provided additional information to clarify the status of the territorial rights in the High Arctic or plans for oil development there.
Oil potential and industry interest also unclear
Mark Myers, a geologist and former director of the U.S. Geological Survey, said there is some indication of oil and gas potential in the High Arctic region designated for possible inclusion in the BOEM program.
He pointed to the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal released in 2008 by the USGS. The study used data collected by crews working on two icebreakers, the U.S. Coast Guard’s Healy and the Canadian Coast Guard’s Louis S. St-Laurent. But that information, too, is preliminary, Myers said.
“It’s possible that some of the southern area would have oil and gas potential based on the CARA study, but a more robust, technical evaluation of the area for oil and gas potential would be something that would be important for the federal government to do,” said Myers, who also served previously as commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources and director of the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas.
The CARA study also indicated the presence of critical minerals beneath the High Arctic seafloor, but any development of those would be outside of the oil leasing program, Myers said.
If BOEM winds up establishing a designated leasing region, it would not guarantee that any lease sales will follow, Myers noted. “It’s a very, very preliminary step,” he said.
To Clemmer, the idea of setting up a High Arctic leasing region is consistent with the Trump administration’s pro-resource-extraction policies and “wanting to open up every possible place to oil and gas development.”
But offshore exploration there might be unappealing to oil companies for reasons beyond legal uncertainty.

	The High Arctic is very remote, harsh and distant from infrastructure support that oil companies might need, Clemmer noted. “I don’t see how the economics would be panning out for them,” she said.
Even the Arctic offshore areas that are within the U.S. exclusive economic zone — the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea — hold uncertainty for oil companies.
Litigation is underway over whether the Trump administration has the authority to reverse Biden administration and Obama administration decisions putting those areas off-limits to new leasing. A previous attempt in the first Trump administration was blocked in 2019 by the federal court in Anchorage.
Operations in the federal offshore areas in the Arctic have proved to be more expensive and difficult than onshore Arctic operations. The most recent attempt was by Royal Dutch Shell, which abandoned its program in 2015 after spending what it said was over $7 billion but drilling only one well to depth.
There has never been any commercial oil production in any federally managed outer continental shelf area off Alaska’s coastline except for a small portion of the Hilcorp-operated Northstar field, which lies mostly on state territory in the Beaufort Sea but overlaps a bit into federal territory.
Myers said industry interest in returning to federal Arctic offshore areas is yet to be determined.
If it exists, it would likely be focused on sites where oil has been discovered but never produced, he said. He cited the Liberty field in the Beaufort Sea, where development has been eyed since the 1990s but where plans by BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. and Hilcorp have stalled. He also listed the Kuvlum and Hammerhead prospects in the Beaufort Sea, which date back to the 1980s. Both are very far from shore, and neither has been deemed commercially viable.
While the current administration may be favorable on offshore Arctic oil development, that could change in the future, presenting another risk for oil companies considering the idea, Myers said.
“People are always going to wonder about long-term changes in policy as administrations change,” he said.
Elsewhere in the Arctic Ocean, the U.S. and Canada have a longstanding dispute over territorial rights in the Beaufort Sea off the Alaska-Yukon border. That has affected some past U.S. oil lease sales in the Beaufort, in 2003, 2005 and 2007, for example. A few tracts in the disputed zone were offered for leasing in those sales.
Exploration in that disputed territory has not occurred, and the U.S. and Canada last year started new negotiations over the competing Beaufort Sea territorial claims.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Public Broadcasting faces a new funding threat after President Donald Trump signed an executive order recently ending federal support for NPR, PBS and their affiliate stations, including SDPB.
The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to halt all direct and indirect funding to those networks by June 30.
The Trump administration said the action was necessary to ensure that taxpayer dollars no longer support what it calls “blatantly biased and partisan programming.” According to the executive order posted on the White House website, the administration cited segments on “diet culture,” “queer ducks,” and reparations, along with NPR’s alleged refusal to report on Hunter Biden’s laptop, as examples of editorial bias. The order stated the move is part of “restoring trust in government-funded institutions.”
Lawmakers on budget committee reject Noem’s public broadcasting cut

In South Dakota, Friends of SDPB issued an email appeal warning the cuts could affect local journalism, infrastructure and access to national programming. “This would have a significant impact on our airwaves,” the email said. “Locally in South Dakota we use these dollars to pay to produce local programming, our national programming bill, and some infrastructure.”
Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the CPB, responded in a statement distributed by the Friends of SDPB: “CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority. Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.” Harrison cited 47 U.S.C. § 398(c), which prohibits federal officials from exercising control over public broadcasting.
PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger also responded in a national press release, calling the executive order “blatantly unlawful.” She said PBS would “vigorously defend its independence and mission to serve all Americans, especially those in rural and underserved areas.”
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting receives approximately $525 million annually through congressional appropriations. That funding supports local stations across the country, especially in states like South Dakota, where commercial media is limited. SDPB leaders warn that losing CPB support could reduce production of shows like “South Dakota Focus,” delay infrastructure upgrades and limit emergency broadcasts in rural areas.
Legal scholars and CPB officials say the order will likely face court challenges. According to The New Yorker, CPB has already sued the administration over attempts to remove three of its five board members — a move that would deprive the board of a quorum and halt operations.
Friends of SDPB is urging listeners to contact South Dakota’s congressional delegation — U.S. Sens. John Thune and Mike Rounds, and Rep. Dusty Johnson — to preserve CPB funding.

Cindy Holscher appears at the Statehouse in Topeka as part of the 50501 national day of action on May 1, 2025. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — As the ranking Democrat on a Kansas Senate committee modeled after Elon Musk’s supposed efforts to make federal government more efficient, Sen. Cindy Holscher was “a little bit suspicious” of what GOP leaders in the Legislature really had in mind.
Instead of looking for waste, she said on the Kansas Reflector podcast, Republicans at both the federal and state level have hurt people by eliminating critical services and jobs. In Kansas, the Committee on Government Efficiency, or COGE, took its cues from out-of-state lobbyists who promoted extremist legislation, she said. Much of the committee’s work resulted in adding red tape to public assistance programs.
Meanwhile, everyday Kansans from all corners of the state responded in real time throughout the legislative session with suggestions and comments that showed the ruling party was at odds with the people they serve — but the committee chairwoman, Republican Sen. Renee Erickson, of Wichita, kept those voices hidden until the session was over, in defiance of state open records law.


For Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat, the comments showed how frustrated Kansans are with Republican leadership.
“I do think there’s been an awakening to some degree and respect that what’s happened on the federal level is hitting people in the pocketbook, and so I think people are taking more notice,” Holscher said.
She added: “The thing I think that is very important is that, you know, people need to connect the dots in terms of, then, what’s happening on the state level that’s coming, that’s going to affect them.”
Among her concerns: a looming budget crisis that could imperil public school funding. She appeared in a red “I (heart) public schools” T-shirt at a May 1 rally at the Statehouse, where hundreds of Kansans protested Musk’s work with DOGE.
When Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, announced the formation of COGE before the session launched in January, he said he wanted to explore ways to make government more efficient. The committee launched an online portal where Kansans were invited to submit their ideas.
Those who navigated the portal were informed that their comments would be subject to open records law and could be made public. Kansas Reflector submitted a formal request for those comments in early February, and the request bounced around for three weeks before landing in Erickson’s inbox.
Erickson initially said it would take two months to comply with the request, ostensibly to allow time to redact comments that revealed personal information. She then agreed to release the emails on April 9 — two weeks after the Legislature had concluded almost all of its work.

But Kansas Reflector independently obtained copies of more than 1,500 of the public comments in advance of their official release. Nearly all of the comments were antithetical to the committee’s work, and some of the comments questioned the committee’s existence.
“What are you doing? Have you not, as an elected representative, practiced efficiency in all the bills you have introduced and votes you have taken? Give me a break. COGE is not necessary bureaucracy,” wrote Christopher Berg, of Kansas City, Kansas.
Kansas Reflector didn’t verify the names provided with submissions.
Max Kautsch, a First Amendment attorney, wrote in a column for Kansas Reflector that Erickson had make a mockery of open records law by delaying the release of public comments.
“The real reason for her delay became clear: The portal was a repository for criticism of the supermajority’s legislative agenda, and it was in the supermajority’s interest to keep that fact from the public for as long as possible,” Kautsch wrote.
Erickson told the Committee to Protect Journalists that allegations she mishandled open records requests were “patently false,” but Holscher said “there’s no doubt” Erickson violated the Kansas Open Records Act by not turning the comments over in a reasonable amount of time. Holscher said she didn’t even get access to the records, which could have informed the committee’s work, until the end of March, in the final days of the session.
“I think they were just trying to run out the clock of session, honestly,” Holscher said. “And really, I think it’s because the suggestions that were received showed that this Legislature is very much out of step with the will of the people.”
The comments included complaints about Republican lawmakers’ attacks on transgender Kansans and reproductive rights, as well as their failure to expand Medicaid or legalize marijuana.
Holscher declined to identify her favorite public comments, as so many were shockingly profane.
“Well, it’s a family podcast,” she said. “I don’t know if I can share some of those. I will say there were some that were very pointed in terms of their feelings about this Legislature and the direction that this committee was going.”
A multitude of people who submitted comments through the portal took aim at Masterson, the Senate president who created the committee.
They questioned Masterson’s lucrative Koch-funded post at Wichita State University, his generous use of hair gel, and blockage of medicinal marijuana bills.
“Get Ty Masterson to quit being a chode and allow legalized marijuana to be grown and sold in Kansas,” wrote an individual who identified themself as Blake F, of Wichita. “It’s like printing money, but that d*** tickler keeps c***blocking a slam dunk.”
Jason Young, of Lawrence, directed his comment to Masterson and other GOP leaders: “Quit swinging from Trump’s nuts and spending all of our hard earned Kansans money on election denying lawsuits and worrying about who f***ing uses what restroom.”
  Numerous comments to the online COGE portal made fun of Senate President Ty Masterson, seen here during the April 10, 2025, veto session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Other comments submitted through the online portal directly addressed the existence of COGE and the work Musk is doing through the federal counterpart, known as DOGE.
“Seriously, government would be more efficient if it didn’t waste its time and our money on things as obviously stupid as this portal,” wrote Matt Paul, of Wichita.
Noreen Carrocci, also of Wichita, said the Legislature shouldn’t do what Musk and DOGE were doing, which she described as “dismantling the government in a chaotic fashion with NO strategic thinking or planning.”
“If you decide you want to legally audit departments then do so transparently and thoughtfully, and consult the professionals in the respective departments,” she wrote. “What is happening at the federal level is illegal, immoral, and tragic. Let’s not follow that kind of leadership here in Kansas.”
Holscher said the Legislature should pay attention to comments that complained about the legislative process. Several people said committees should provide a three-day window to submit testimony on bills, or complained about the “gut and go” process, in which lawmakers at the end of the session “amend” a bill by inserting the contents of other bills, sometimes including ones that received no hearing.
And she noted that Republicans failed to deliver on their campaign promises to provide property tax relief. Instead, they passed another plan to lower income taxes.
“They have a supermajority,” Holscher said. “They can pass whatever they want. If they really wanted to get property tax relief, they could have.”

The Mezzanine Gallery in Wilmington has unveiled a powerful new exhibition by Delaware artist Shefon N. Taylor, whose mixed-media collages delve into the complex terrain of memory, beauty, and cultural identity.
Titled “The Fragment Holds More Than the Whole,” the solo show runs through May 30 and opened with a public reception on May 2.
Taylor, known for her innovative use of archival material, reimagines traditional concepts of wholeness and restoration through what she calls “archival abstraction.”
Using found imagery from vintage books and magazines, tracing paper, and thread, her work challenges how memory and history are visually and culturally preserved.

“This body of work interrogates the visual archive’s limitations and its entanglement with Black history and beauty,” Taylor said. “By working with fragments—partial, severed, obscured—I aim to honor the spaces where meaning survives outside of traditional notions of wholeness. Fragmentation isn’t failure; it’s a different kind of remembering.”
Inspired by author Toni Morrison’s idea of “rememory”—the act of reconstructing personal and collective memory—Taylor’s collages emphasize the power of the partial and the unseen.
Rather than piecing fragments back into a neat whole, her compositions highlight what remains unresolved, inviting viewers to reflect on what is left out of official narratives.
One of the exhibition’s signature pieces, “A fragment of ‘She touched my shoulder like she knew me’,” embodies Taylor’s poetic approach to materials.
Layers of fragile paper and stitched lines intersect around a single moment, simultaneously intimate and elusive.
Taylor’s work has appeared in national outlets including “Essence,” “Grazia,” and “Harper’s Bazaar,” and she has held fellowships at The Delaware Contemporary and The Winterthur Museum.
The Mezzanine Gallery, located in the Carvel State Office Building at 820 N. French Street, is open to the public Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. It regularly features exhibitions from Delaware’s Individual Artist Fellows.

(Photo by Aramelle Wheeler for KFF Health News)Food bank shortages caused by high demand and cuts to federal aid programs have some residents of a small community that straddles Idaho and Nevada growing their own food to get by.
For those living in Duck Valley, a reservation of about 1,000 people that is home to the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes, there’s just one grocery store where prices are too high for many to afford, said Brandy Bull Chief, local director of a federal food distribution program for tribes. The next-closest grocery stores are more than 100 miles away in Mountain Home, Idaho, and Elko, Nevada. And the local food bank’s troubles are mirrored by many nationwide, squeezed between growing need and shrinking aid.
Reggie Premo, a community outreach specialist at the University of Nevada-Reno Extension, grew up cattle ranching and farming alfalfa in Duck Valley. He runs workshops to teach residents to grow produce. Premo said he has seen increased interest from tribal leaders in the state worried about high costs while living in food deserts.
“We’re just trying to bring back how it used to be in the old days,” Premo said, “when families used to grow gardens.”
Food bank managers across the country say their supplies have been strained by rising demand since the COVID pandemic-era emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits ended two years ago and steepening food prices. Now, they say, demand is compounded by recent cuts in federal funding to food distribution programs that supply staple food items to pantries nationwide.
In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut $500 million from the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which buys food from domestic producers and sends it to pantries nationwide. The program has supplied more than 20% of the distributions by Feeding America, a nonprofit that serves a network of more than 200 food banks and 60,000 meal programs.
The collision between rising demand and falling support is especially problematic for rural communities, where the federal program might cover 50% or more of food supplied to those in need, said Vince Hall, chief government relations officer of Feeding America. Deepening the challenge for local food aid organizations is an additional $500 million the Trump administration slashed from the USDA Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which helped state, tribal, and territorial governments buy fresh food from nearby producers.
“The urgency of this crisis cannot be overstated,” Hall said, adding that the Emergency Food Assistance Program is “rural America’s hunger lifeline.”
Farmers who benefited from the USDA programs that distributed their products to food banks and schools will also be affected. Bill Green is executive director for the Southeast region of Common Market, a nonprofit that connects farmers with organizations in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, Texas, and the Great Lakes. Green said his organization won’t be able to fill the gap left by the federal cuts, but he hopes some schools and other institutions will continue buying from those farmers even after the federal support dries up.
“I think that that food access challenge has only been aggravated, and I think we just found the tip of the iceberg on that,” he said.
Food Bank for the Heartland in Omaha, Nebraska, for example, is experiencing four times the demand this year than in 2018, according to Stephanie Sullivan, its assistant director of marketing and communications. The organization expects to provide food to 580,000 households across the 93 counties it serves in Nebraska and western Iowa this fiscal year, the highest number in its history, she said.
“These numbers should be a wake-up call for all of us,” Sullivan said.
The South Plains Food Bank in Texas projects it will distribute approximately 121,000 food boxes this year to people in need across the 19 counties it serves, compared with an average 90,000 annually before the pandemic. CEO Dina Jeffries said the organization now is serving about 25% more people, while shouldering the burden of decreased funding and food products.
In Nevada, the food bank that helps serve communities in the northern part of the state, including the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Reservation, provides food to an average of 160,000 people per month. That’s a 76% increase over its clientele before the pandemic, and the need continues to rise, said Jocelyn Lantrip, director of marketing and communications for the Food Bank of Northern Nevada.
Lantrip said one of the most troubling things for the food bank is that the USDA commodities shipped for local distribution often are foods that donations don’t usually cover — things like eggs, dairy, and meat.
“That’s really valuable food to our neighbors,” she said. “Protein is very difficult to replace.”
Forty percent of people who sought assistance from food banks during the pandemic did so for the first time, Hall said. “Many of those families have come to see their neighborhood food bank not as a temporary resource for emergency help but an essential component of their monthly budget equation.”
About 47 million people lived in food-insecure households in 2023, the most recent USDA data available.
Bull Chief, who also runs a small food pantry on the Duck Valley Reservation, said workers drive to Elko to pick up food distributed by the Food Bank of Northern Nevada. But sometimes there’s not much to choose from. In March, the food pantry cut down its operation to just two weeks a month. She said sometimes they must weigh whether it’s worth spending money on gas to pick up a small amount of food.
When the food pantry opened in 2020, Bull Chief said, it helped 10 to 20 households a month. That number is 60 or more now, made up of a broad range of community members — teens fresh out of high school and living on their own, elders, and people who don’t have permanent housing or jobs. She said providing even small amounts of food can help households make ends meet between paychecks or SNAP benefit deposits.
“Whatever they need to get to survive for the month,” Bull Chief said.
Pinched food banks, elevated need, and federal cuts mean there’s very little resiliency in the system, Hall said. Additional challenges, like an economic slowdown, policy changes to SNAP or other federal nutrition programs, or natural disasters could render food banks unable to meet needs “because they are stretched to the breaking point right now.”
A proposed budget resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in April would require $1.7 trillion in net funding cuts, and anti-hunger advocates fear SNAP could be a target. More people living in rural parts of the country rely on SNAP than people in urban areas because of higher poverty rates, so they would be disproportionately affected.
An extension of the federal 2018 Farm Bill, which lasts until Sept. 30, included about $450 million for the Emergency Food Assistance Program for this year. But the funding that remains doesn’t offset the cuts, Hall said. He hopes lawmakers pass a new farm bill this year with enough money to do so.
“We don’t have a food shortage,” he said. “We have a shortage of political will.”

Steve Wills is Ameren Missouri’s senior director of regulatory affairs and said the company is pleased the Public Service Commission approved the settlement, calling it “fair and constructive.”
“We understand that it’s never a good time to raise rates … but we’ve made very significant improvements in our system that will enhance the reliability and the resilience of the system,” Wills said.
Ameren estimates the new prices will result in bills going up $14 per month for the average user. The approved rate increase enables Ameren to collect an additional $335 million dollars annually, which is $91 million less per year than the company initially requested.
Utilities are what’s called “regulated” or “natural” monopolies — in exchange for being the sole provider of utility service in a specified area, the companies are subject to state oversight.
Utilities must ask the Missouri Public Service Commission — the state agency that regulates investor-owned utilities — for approval to increase the prices it charges the public. Ameren filed the rate case in June 2024, which started an 11-month regulatory process.
“We spend a lot of time talking about the various issues and understanding each party’s position and try to find a middle ground that reflects a fair return for the investments that we’ve made to serve customers,” Wills said.
Ameren Missouri initially asked state regulators for permission to raise electricity rates by 15.77% — which would have resulted in an estimated average monthly bill increase of about $17.45.
Utility representatives say the additional revenue is necessary to recoup costs of “major system upgrades” and “cleaner” generation investments.
The new rates are scheduled to take effect June 1.
Michael Sykuta is an economist with the MU Financial Research Institute and said utility price hikes are a reflection of the broader economy.
“We’ve all experienced inflationary pressures in the things that we buy in our household budgets,” he said. “Companies across the board, not just utilities, are facing those same inflationary pressures for the equipment they have to buy, for the salaries they pay, for their other operating expenses.”
John Coffman, an attorney for the Consumers Council of Missouri, a consumer advocacy group that was involved in the settlement negotiations, said he thinks the agreement is fair.
“All the parties felt like they got something valuable out of the deal,” he said. “I mean it’s nothing to celebrate that we have these double digit increases, but we are happy about the way it was applied and some of the other guarantees we have going forward.”
According to the organization, the Consumers Council advocated for elements of the deal relating to low-income bill assistance, community solar power and assurance that Ameren is not allowed to charge customers for costs to mitigate pollution from the Rush Island power plant — which the company was ordered to do by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers, Renew Missouri, AARP and other organizations were also involved in the settlement.
Multiple public hearings were held throughout Ameren Missouri’s electric case. Lindsey Phoenix is an attorney living in Jefferson City who testified before the commission in January, sharing her opinion that a price hike was not justified.
Upon hearing of the settlement Thursday, Phoenix said she was disappointed with the results.
“The issue wasn’t how much of an increase they needed. The issue that everyone was there discussing was that they didn’t need one,” she said.
Phoenix, among other members of the public who testified, stressed the economic pressures many people find themselves in and how utility bill increases compound those challenges.
“I am an attorney, and my spouse is a teacher, and we are living paycheck to paycheck,” Phoenix said.
Ameren’s Wills encourages customers who are feeling squeezed to inquire about energy efficiency programs that could lower their costs.
“For those who are really struggling with the rates at a higher level, please reach out to us because we have energy assistance options available,” he said. “We have opportunities for flexible payments arrangements, budget billing and various sources of grants that we can either provide or connect customers with.”
Ameren provides electric service to much of mid-Missouri and has approximately 1.2 million electric customers in the state. The company also provides gas service for some communities, including Columbia and Jefferson City. The utility is in the middle of an ongoing rate case for gas prices.
 Shifting energy industry policies

Missouri utility rate cases are taking place while energy policies on the federal and state level are shifting.
Last month, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed a bill into law that affords utilities a variety of new financial accounting practices. The legislation includes a policy called “construction work in progress” that enables energy companies to earn revenue on power plants as they build them and before they generate any electricity.
Ameren representatives have said the bill is an important tool that could help them build new power plants, including nuclear, to meet increasing electric demand.
“We’re having to retire older facilities and build new facilities,” Wills said. “I think what some of the legislation did was try to streamline Missouri’s processes a little bit around future generation planning.”
On the federal level, President Donald Trump has signed a variety of executive orders since taking office aimed at prioritizing the fossil fuel industry, including one last month that targets increased coal production.
MU’s Sykuta said the most recent executive order could help extend the life of Missouri’s coal power plants. However, Trump’s attempts to rescind energy funds from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act could slow down investment in wind and solar as well as upgrades to the transmission grid — ultimately resulting in price increases for customers.
“Consumers pay higher costs when transmission is more congested,” Sykuta said. “A lot of that infrastructure development has been started or planned with the idea of using the IRA funding — and with the IRA funding going away some of that investment is not going to happen.”
Jenn DeRose is a campaign organizer for the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign that aims to get utilities to close coal plants and transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
The Sierra Club was an “intervenor,” or party to the Ameren electric rate case. DeRose said rural Missourians, low-income individuals, and people of color are most likely to face high energy burdens.
DeRose calls the rate case process “very opaque and difficult to understand.” Her role throughout the case was to encourage members of the public to participate.
“The number one thing that anybody can do is advocate,” she said. “Utilities, public service commissioners, they need to know the impacts of their decisions on regular people. They need to know what this looks like, and they need to know that they are responsible for creating solutions.”
The Ameren rate increase comes at a particularly challenging time, DeRose said, as summer cooling needs result in higher monthly bills and the Trump administration just fired the federal staff that administers the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
“LIHEAP is a critical program that helps people pay their heating and cooling bills, and it is essential to keeping people connected to services, but also, more broadly, it’s essential to keeping people in their homes,” DeRose said. “We know that disconnections lead to evictions.”

Five months after Democratic legislative leaders urged their colleagues to focus on bills that would make California more affordable, lawmakers don’t have much to show for it.
As CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu explains, last week Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas of Salinas unveiled four new select committees — which are essentially working groups tasked with addressing specific policies — to tackle what Rivas said are the “biggest cost drivers for Californians.” The committees will take aim at:

Lowering the cost of child care;
Making food more affordable;
Making housing more affordable;
Reviewing the effectiveness of California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which some argue leads to higher gas prices.

The committees, however, won’t meet until June. In the meantime, Rivas has backed a handful of measures that would speed up housing construction. Senate Democrats also unveiled three bills last week to lower energy costs, increase housing supplies and expand job training.
But some analysts question whether the state can legislate its way out of its most intractable issues — especially while President Donald Trump’s tariffs are increasing prices and have the potential to upend various California industries.

Garry South, longtime Democratic strategist: “(The bills) all sound good on the surface, but I don’t think there’s any predictability that if any of them pass, or all pass, that all of a sudden we are going to be out of the housing crisis in California.”

Speaking of the Legislature: A bill that would make soliciting minors for sex a felony embroiled Democratic lawmakers in controversy last week, after the bill’s author, Assemblymember Maggy Krell, objected to changes that would exclude soliciting older minors who are 16 and 17 years old. Some Democrats and criminal justice reform advocates argue that the provision would punish older teenagers in consenting relationships. 
But Republicans, as well as a few other Democrats including Krell, say those concerns are largely hypothetical, and that prosecutors wouldn’t spend time charging teenagers for having consensual sex. Read more from CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.

Wildfire survivors still waiting on claims

After deadly wildfires tore through Los Angeles County in January, survivors are alleging that State Farm is delaying or denying property insurance claims, and they’re calling for the state’s insurance chief to investigate, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Last week California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara sent a letter to the company’s chief executive, asking for a copy of State Farm’s standards for reviewing and processing smoke damage claims. Lara also asked State Farm to commit to covering at least 75% of survivors’ personal property without having claimants submit detailed inventories of their belongings. The company has until Friday to respond to Lara’s letter.
Meanwhile, California homeowners are suing State Farm and other insurers, accusing the companies of conspiring against policyholders after the wildfires. State Farm is also awaiting approval from an administrative law judge for its request for temporary emergency rate increases after receiving the initial green light from Lara in March.
A State Farm spokesperson said the company has received roughly 12,500 claims related to the fires, and have paid over $3.12 billion to customers. It estimates it will pay more than $7 billion in claims from the L.A.-area fires.

University of California looks to Texas for new leader

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
California and Texas are contrasts in the country’s culture and political wars, but are also home to two of the nation’s most prominent public university systems. So it’s no wonder that a vacancy in California is filled by a Texan.On Friday the Board of Regents of the University of California voted to hire the chancellor of the University of Texas system, James B. Milliken, as the next president of the UC. His base salary will be $1,475,000. The current president, Michael V. Drake, said last year he’d step down July, 2025. Milliken takes the job in August.Milliken brings higher-education governance experience in politically liberal and conservative states, having led the large and economically diverse City University of New York, which includes numerous community colleges. That diversity of contexts will likely benefit his tenure as UC’s leader: He must navigate the pressures of a largely progressive California Legislature that seeks access to more low-income students at the UC while also facing the Trump administration’s deep scrutiny of the nation’s universities’ practices and missions, including the UC’s.Milliken sought to address those pressures last Friday, without mentioning the political climate by name.

Milliken, to regents after his appointment: “Talent is not determined by zip code, national origin, race, gender or wealth. But too often, over history, opportunity has been. Education, and particularly public higher education, is the most effective bridge we have found to connect talent and opportunity.”

Should it get OK for a rate hike?,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/05/state-farm-fire-survivors-complaints/,Insurance department investigates State Farm over Los Angeles fire survivors’ smoke damage claims as insurer awaits approval of rate increase.,"In summary
Insurance department investigates State Farm over Los Angeles fire survivors’ smoke damage claims as insurer awaits approval of rate increase.


Rossana Valverde’s Pasadena home of 35 years is still standing after Los Angeles County’s devastating January fires — but more than 100 days later, she and her husband still can’t move back in.
That’s because they’re waiting for their insurer, State Farm, to approve and process their claims. 
“We were lucky our house made it through,” Valverde said. “At first we thought unscathed. But it definitely still smells like smoke. The windowsills have a thick layer of black ash and soot.”
After getting their home tested for toxins, they discovered it contains high levels of arsenic, lead and nickel. The cleaning, repair and replacement costs for their hardwood floors, carpet, appliances and more total upwards of $300,000, per some written estimates she shared with CalMatters as well as her own estimates of costs to replace things like their bed and upholstered furniture.
So far, she and her husband have received about $40,000 from State Farm but are having trouble getting the insurance company’s adjuster to respond promptly to their requests for more.
She said the company’s adjuster — the second one they were assigned — hardly returns emails and phone calls from her or the public adjuster she’s enlisted for help. 
“He pulls this ‘I didn’t receive it’ BS and then when I press him he suddenly finds it,” she said.
She is not alone. There are so many complaints, including a lawsuit, about State Farm delaying or denying claims after the LA-area fires, especially related to smoke damage, that fire survivors, three state lawmakers and others have asked Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to investigate. They pointed out that the company is awaiting approval for its request to raise its rates on an emergency interim basis and urged Lara to rescind his conditional approval. An administrative law judge is expected to decide on the rate hike soon.
The Insurance Department routinely investigates insurance companies’ response to disasters, which can lead to deeper examinations of their conduct and millions of dollars of additional payments. But this time around, State Farm is facing complaints as it happens to be seeking to raise its rates an average 17% for homeowners.
Under growing pressure to investigate, Lara sent a letter to State Farm Chief Executive Dan Krause last week, asking for details about how the company is handling claims. In the letter seen by CalMatters, Lara asked for a copy of the insurer’s standards for reviewing, investigating and processing smoke damage claims. He also asked State Farm to commit to providing at least 75% of contents coverage without requiring an inventory from fire survivors — the company had raised what it pays out in advance contents coverage from 50% to 65%. The commissioner set a May 9 deadline for a written response from the company.

In an interview, Lara told CalMatters that he also spoke with Krause by phone about the letter. He said he asked Krause if State Farm could maintain a visible, physical presence in the area as customers continue to need help with claims and disaster recovery centers close.
“He’s going to look at keeping a presence in Eaton and Palisades,” Lara said.
When asked whether he planned to tie State Farm’s handling of claims to the company’s request to raise its rates, the commissioner said: “I’m going to see what they respond, then move accordingly.”
Lara said he has to consider that State Farm is California’s biggest insurer, and that it has millions of customers in the state. “I want to be clear to the Legislature,” he said. “I’m balancing all the facts.”
State Sen. Sasha Renee Perez, a Democrat representing Padadena who co-wrote the letter asking Lara to investigate State Farm and withhold a rate increase, told CalMatters: “Everybody realizes we’re in a home insurance crisis. (Nobody is) saying there should never be a rate increase.” But she said her constituents have been good customers who “feel like they’ve been left in the cold.”
State Farm spokesperson Sevag Sarkissian did not answer questions about Lara’s letter to Krause or his requests of the company. CalMatters also asked about policyholder complaints. Sarkissian sent the following response by email: “We’re here to help our customers recover and we empathize with those who are rebuilding their lives. We’ve received approximately 12,500 total claims related to the fires and have paid over $3.12 billion to our customers.” 
State Farm has said it expects to pay more than $7 billion in claims from the LA-area blazes.
‘A longstanding fight’ about smoke damage
It’s unclear how many State Farm customers are complaining about the company’s handling of claims, especially about smoke damage coverage. The insurance department would not disclose exactly how many such complaints it has fielded, with spokesperson Michael Soller saying only that the complaints are in line with State Farm’s market share in California, which is about 20%. Soller said the complaints are ongoing and that complaint data is posted annually.
But a group of LA-area fire survivors of the Eaton Fire has a website with at least a couple of hundred detailed — though unverified — complaints, which Perez and other lawmakers cited in their letter to Lara.
That doesn’t surprise attorney Amy Bach, the president of San Francisco-based United Policyholders, a national nonprofit organization that advocates for insurance customers. She co-founded the group in 1991, the same year the Oakland Hills fire exposed insurance-coverage problems for survivors. 
Bach said smoke damage has been part of “a longstanding fight.” Smoke damage’s effects can seem less obvious than fire damage, and appears to be one of the factors in LA-area fire survivors having trouble with their claims.
She said the more she finds out about the effects of smoke damage,  the more she thinks insurers need to better handle related claims. 
Bach and her group now advise policyholders to make sure they get their homes tested by an industrial hygienist before cleaning, adding that if their insurer won’t agree to pay for it at first, they should get it done anyway and try to get compensated afterward.
“You have to figure out what you’re dealing with,” she said. “There’s too much at stake: your family’s health, your property value.”

A  California appeals court ruling in February could affect insurance coverage of soot and ash claims. It held that wildfire debris doesn’t necessarily mean direct physical loss or damage.
Bach was one of several advocates who recently submitted letters in an attempt to depublish — or strike from the record — the decision by the California 2nd District Court of Appeal. She said she doesn’t want insurance companies to be able to point to that court decision as a reason to deny smoke claims.
But last week, the California Supreme Court rejected the depublication requests by Bach and other consumer advocates. They included Consumer Watchdog and Consumer Federation of America, plus an association of public insurance adjusters and a couple of consumer attorneys groups. 
The groups that opposed depublication included American Property Casualty Insurance Association and other insurance groups, as well as the FAIR Plan — the fire insurance provider of last resort in California.
Just like State Farm has been accused of delaying claims and payments related to smoke damage, so has the FAIR Plan. LA fire victims sued the FAIR Plan, State Farm and other insurers over smoke damage claims earlier this month.
The FAIR Plan did not immediately return CalMatters’ requests for answers about its policies on  smoke damage.
In March, Lara issued a bulletin regarding smoke damage claims. It said insurance companies should not take the February court ruling to mean they are off the hook for such claims.
The commissioner told CalMatters last week that he is working with the governor’s office and public health officials on establishing statewide standards for smoke damage remediation — of cleaning up and stopping environmental damage. Those standards could help inform insurance policy requirements, but spokesperson Soller said the insurance department has no further details to share yet.
A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said the commissioner has requested technical support for the effort.
Other fire survivors speak out
In Altadena, Andrew Wessels is also dealing with delays from State Farm. He and his family are now on their seventh temporary home since the fire because the insurer has not approved their request for long-term housing. 
They have relied on friends, a hotel and three Airbnbs, for which they pay the rent out of pocket.
They started submitting receipts to State Farm in January, he said. As of now, they have received about $25,000 of $40,000 in reimbursements they have requested.
They have gotten their home tested and found high levels of lead and possibly chlorine gas exposure — not good for him, his wife and their two children, ages 20 months and 5.
They have requested 100% of their Coverage B, or $355,650, because Wessels said their personal goods are a total loss. He asked the company for the money up front, without having to continue submitting receipts.

Wessels said he and his family are “blocked from the ability to rebuild.” He joined other Eaton Fire survivors at a press conference last month, where several State Farm policyholders called on the insurance commissioner to reject the company’s request to raise its premiums on an emergency interim basis until it takes care of their claims.
Another survivor, Gail Jamentz, spoke with CalMatters on April 25, sounding discouraged because she said she hadn’t heard from State Farm since February. 
“I submitted my claim status Jan. 11,” she said. “I can’t go to FEMA because I don’t have a claim status.”
Photos the survivors group shared with the media show her home is standing but badly burned, with its roof caved in. She needed State Farm to declare it a total loss. She called the inside of her home “toxic soup.” 
“There’s no roof, it’s been raining, it’s all mush inside,” Jamentz said. 
Thursday, she told the Eaton Fire survivors group on Discord that State Farm had finally agreed to let her claim her home as a total loss.
“I have to give you all credit in helping expedite this process these last few weeks as I really think our press conference helped move things along,” Jamentz wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/042625_EatonFireInsurance_JAJ_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-05 09:06:14.496902

Ed Lammi
Ed Lammi is a former executive vice president of production for Sony Pictures Television. He retired in 2023 after 36 years at Sony.


Once upon a time, Hollywood wasn’t just a neighborhood. It was the beating heart of film and television production in North America. But over the last two decades, the bright lights of Los Angeles have dimmed. 
It’s not for lack of talent or vision, but because other cities and countries seized an opportunity and offered better tax incentives to lure the industry away. 
This exodus has hit California hard. Over the past few decades, Southern California lost thousands of production jobs. These are middle-class workers: set builders, costume designers, grips, gaffers, editors, caterers, drivers, camera operators and more. These are Californians who pay state income taxes, send their kids to local schools and spend their money at local businesses. 
They represent the backbone of this industry and we let them slip away. California can’t risk losing what we’ve worked for a century to build.
Much has been said about Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal to increase the California Film & Television Tax Credit Program to $750 million annually — and it is absolutely necessary. But we also need the changes that have been proposed in Assembly Bill 1138 and Senate Bill 630. Namely increasing the credit to 35% of expenses to more competitively align with other states.
Additionally, qualifying half-hour comedies is an important addition. Comedies that were once primarily sitcoms shot on Hollywood sound stages are now more likely to be shot single-camera style, similar to movies and dramas. They can be set up to shoot in locations with favorable tax credits. 
Case in point: when I was still at Sony Pictures TV, we shot “Cobra Kai” in suburban Atlanta — due in large part to Georgia’s production incentives qualifying half-hour comedies. Ironically, the reboot TV series was inspired by the 1984 feature film “The Karate Kid,” which was creatively set in the San Fernando Valley. 
California must go further. Although the issue of including above-the-line cost is somewhat controversial, some version is necessary to compete with states that offer it. A potential solution is to qualify only the scale portion of fees paid to above-the-line talent. This would solve the concern that a few highly paid performers would allow a production to get an outsized amount from the tax credit fund. 
It also aligns much more closely with the primary intent of the fund: to qualify basic, scale-wage workers.
Every show that shoots in California supports hundreds of jobs. It pumps money into local economies from lumber yards to restaurants, from car rentals to dry cleaners. This is why other places created tax credit programs of their own. They recognize that production spending is good economic development policy, generating a return on investment many times the amount of the credit. In Los Angeles, every dollar of film and television tax credit allocated generates $1.07 in state and local tax revenue and raises local wages by $8.60. 
Our crews have weathered a lot in recent years: a pandemic, two major strikes, a steep industry contraction and now the recent L.A. fires. They are eager for consistent, sustainable work.

It’s been five months since California’s legislative leaders deemed affordability an “urgent” issue for the session. So far: committees, bills, but few results


In December, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas assigned his members an “urgent” task: Make California cheaper to live in.
“Californians are deeply anxious. They are anxious about our state’s cost of living,” he told his colleagues in the wake of an election where concerns about the economy were top of mind for voters. “We must chart a new path forward and renew the California dream by focusing on affordability.”
Five months later, the state Legislature has little to show for it.
Just last week, Rivas announced four new “select committees” tasked with pitching ideas to lower the cost of housing, fuel, child care and food, but they won’t meet until June, and Rivas did not specify when he expects legislation from the committees. Some of the lawmakers assigned to chair them say they want to develop “practical” solutions but did not articulate what those would be. 
Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, has also backed a slate of measures, most of which aim to ease restrictions on housing construction, but few have reached the Assembly floor for a vote.
Similarly, Senate Democrats unveiled just three legislative proposals as their “opening salvo” to affordability last week, focusing on reducing energy costs, increasing housing supplies and boosting job training. 
While the Legislature is just starting to zoom in on affordability, prices are rising rapidly as a result of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff policies and groceries could get more expensive.

Economic justice advocates argue that Californians need immediate relief. Anya Svanoe, communications director for the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, said renters are still feeling the pinch. 
“Putting together a committee that comes together months from now that won’t even do anything until the following year does not seem to me that (lawmakers) are treating it with real urgency,” she said.
Democratic leaders told CalMatters good policies take time to develop. They noted that lawmakers had to shift their focus earlier this year to Los Angeles wildfire victims and counter Trump’s policies, and it took time to onboard freshman lawmakers. 
“I have never been one to simply do something to get clicks or make headlines. I want substance and impact,” Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire said in an interview. “My philosophy is: Do it right, not fast.” 
Rivas spokesperson Nick Miller also said the select committees — essentially working groups established to tackle niche policies — will allow lawmakers to gather more public input and drill down on specific issues during the summer recess without feeling swamped by the regular legislative schedule.
Some analysts are skeptical that any proposals could actually make California more affordable, anyway. Garry South, a longtime Democratic strategist, said affordability is a problem “too large for legislative solution,” especially when compounded by Trump’s tariff policies.
“It’s political optics to some degree,” South said. “(The bills) all sound good on the surface, but I don’t think there’s any predictability that if any of them pass, or all pass, that all of a sudden we are going to be out of the housing crisis in California.”
Tackling the ‘biggest cost drivers’
Rivas said that the select committees will tackle the “biggest cost drivers for Californians.” 
The committees will focus on four areas: Lowering the cost of child care for babies to 3 year-olds; making food more affordable and enrolling more people in CalFresh, the state’s food stamp program; exploring financing options for affordable housing; and examining the effectiveness of the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a clean energy incentive program that some argue could raise gas prices. 
Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Suisun City Democrat who chairs the Assembly Transportation Committee and will chair the select committee on fuel, said lawmakers have had a packed calendar.
“How could you even fit these types of conversations at the same time we are actively doing committees?” said Wilson, who sits on six different committees.
Lawmakers don’t need a new committee to develop solutions, because they are already introducing proposals in the current legislative session, said Mike Gatto, a former Los Angeles Democratic assemblymember who chaired the appropriations committee.
“Every single member of the Legislature has a pretty good understanding of what is causing this affordability problem in the state of California,” he said. “This information is out there.”
Select committees have traditionally been used to “give individual lawmakers who care about an issue … greater portfolio and greater exposure,” Gatto said. But he said they’re rarely effective. 
“I don’t think too many veteran Capitol watchers can recall a select committee that produced significant results on an important issue,” he said.
But Miller pointed to last year’s select committee on retail theft last year, which produced laws to clamp down on organized shoplifting and toughen penalties on property thefts.
Proposals largely focused on housing
Optics or not, state Democrats’ affordability agenda appears clearer than a few months ago. 
Led by Rivas, a strong ally of the YIMBY movement, Assembly Democrats are pressing for fewer regulations in exchange for quicker, more abundant new construction they argue would ultimately lower housing costs. 
Lawmakers in early April approved a four-bill package to expedite building by streamlining the approval process for new housing and halting most changes to building standards for six years. One proposal would allow renters to take in people at risk of homelessness as long as their landlords agree.

“These bills will alter the trajectory of the housing crisis,” Rivas said in a statement. 
Later that month, Rivas said he supported nine other “affordability” measures on housing, wage theft and broadband. One of them, introduced by Oakland Democrat Buffy Wicks, a major supporter of easing construction restrictions, would exempt most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act, making it all but impossible for environmentalists to sue to block developments. 
Most of the housing proposals Rivas signed off on represent much more technical changes, though, such as making it easier to build farmworker housing, making agencies approve developments more quickly and standardizing the housing project application process. 
It’s hard to know if any of those measures will lead to more housing construction, much less if they will make housing cheaper, said Bill Fulton, former director of planning and economic development for the city of San Diego and a fellow at the University of California-Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
“In spite of the fact that all those bills have passed (in past years), we have not seen overall housing production increase very much or overall housing affordability go down very much,” Fulton said. 
“The Legislature passed lots and lots and lots and lots of laws … without actually doing a careful analysis of what’s working and what’s not, and they continue to pass more laws.” 
Fulton said other factors discouraging building in California include the high cost of labor and building materials and high interest rates, which are not addressed by the current raft of housing bills.
Svanoe, who champions tenant protections, said state lawmakers are streamlining housing  development while doing little to make rent affordable. She supports Assembly Bill 1157, a progressive proposal to lower the cap on rent increases. Faced with pressure from YIMBY-aligned Democrats, the measure is now delayed until next year.
“There’s no room to give (on) any rent increase at this point,” Svanoe said. “It’d be the difference between someone staying in their home and someone becoming homeless.”
The housing measure included in the Senate Democrats’ affordability package is much more skeptical of new construction. While Sen. Aisha Wahab’s Senate Bill 681 would streamline some development, it would also restrict landlords from charging extra fees and crack down on homeowners association fees. 
“We’re reinforcing the state’s housing production goals, but not at the expense of the Californians who are barely hanging on,” Wahab, a Fremont Democrat who chairs the Senate Housing Committee, said in the legislative analysis.
A potential showdown looms between Democrats over housing policy — a clash already underway in the Senate.

Assembly Joint Resolution 10, a non-binding statement of support sponsored by Democratic Sen. Sandra Jauregui of Las Vegas, urges the federal government to prioritize the passage of the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, colloquially known as the Clark County Lands Bill, which would open 25,000 acres of public land in Southern Nevada to development. 
The federal legislation is sponsored by Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in the Senate and Democrat Susie Lee and Republican Mark Amodei in the House.
Thursday was the first time state lawmakers held a public hearing for the resolution, which drew criticism from conservation groups and Nevada residents who spoke in opposition of the measure. Despite forgoing a public hearing, the bill passed the Assembly in April with only six members opposing it, all Democrats.
During the Senate Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections hearing Thursday, supporters of the measure told lawmakers the release of public land would spur the construction of affordable housing, but critics argued the measure does not guarantee housing affordability and would only encourage unsustainable urban sprawl and exacerbate water scarcity.
Jauregui said there is a severe housing shortage in Nevada, leading to skyrocketing rents and home prices. Jauregui pointed to a 2022 report from Applied Analysis put together for the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association that found the region could exhaust all available land for development in seven years if current construction trends continue.
“This housing epidemic isn’t just about a housing supply shortage, but also a land shortage,” Jauregui said.
Several housing developers and business interests spoke in support of the resolution Thursday, including the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association, Builders Association of Northern Nevada, Nevada State Apartment Association, and the Greater Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce.
The Nevada Republican Party, City of Henderson, Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority and the Nevada Rural Housing Authority also spoke in support of the resolution. 
Nevada faces a shortage of 80,000 affordable rental homes for extremely low-income residents, according to the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority.
“This is not about unchecked expansion. It’s about strategic, responsible growth that allows our communities to meet the real needs of families, seniors and essential workers,” said Mindy Elliot, a lobbyist speaking on behalf of the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority and the Nevada Rural Housing Authority.
Jauregui acknowledged that just opening public land to development would not be enough to address rising housing costs in southern Nevada. She advocated for the resolution in combination with other housing bills she is sponsoring, including Assembly Bill 241, which would encourage more infill development in urban areas.
For nearly an hour, advocates and Nevada residents spoke in opposition to the resolution during public comments. Several took the opportunity to castigate Democrats in the Assembly for failing to hold a public hearing before passing the resolution. The Senate panel also came under criticism for scheduling the Thursday hearing at the last minute.
The resolution’s opponents cited concerns about water scarcity, utility costs, urban sprawl, and the urban heat island effect — a phenomenon that creates higher temperatures in cities due to an abundance of superheating man-made surfaces like roads and pavement.
Some residents expressed concern about the financial burden on taxpayers to fund new infrastructure, services, and roads in low-density suburbs if the resolution passed.
During the hearing, critics of the resolution also pointed out that the Clark County Lands Bill does not specifically set aside any land for affordable housing, meaning there is no guarantee any of the released land will result in lower housing costs. 
Jauregui refuted arguments that the Clark County Lands Bill would not create affordable housing, pointing to Ovation Development Corp’s affordable senior housing project being built on land that had belonged to the federal government before it was released to the City of Las Vegas.
“It took five years for this land to transfer from the [Bureau of Land Management]. This new act will streamline the process that allows for these types of affordable housing developments to happen and to happen faster,” Jauregui said.
Organizations opposed to the resolution included the Great Basin Water Network, Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, Sierra Club, Make the Road Nevada, and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada.
Conservation groups argued that infill development of existing neighborhoods is a better solution than development on parcels sprawling along the metro area’s edges where federal land would be privatized.  Development would exacerbate water scarcity, increase urban sprawl, and worsen housing inequities. 
Housing, or warehousing?
An analysis by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada found that around 80,000 acres of vacant or underused land in Southern Nevada’s urban core — more acreage than the entire City of Henderson — could be developed for housing near public transit and existing infrastructure.
Olivia Taniger, the director of the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter, argued the resolution would undermine attempts to promote infill and public transportation development.
“Folks don’t want housing out in Jean. They don’t want resources taken away from their communities in East Las Vegas when folks already struggle to get around on public transportation,” Tangier said.
She argued much of the public land released by the Clark County Lands Bill would likely be sold for warehouses and manufacturing rather than housing. 
Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, highlighted the cost of urban sprawl on water resources in the state. Roerink pointed to research that the Colorado River’s flow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.
“Are you willing to tell your constituents that you support inviting another 800,000 people to the region with Lake Mead sitting at 33 percent full? That’s what you need to consider with this legislation,” Roerink said.
A joint study by Clark County and the City of Henderson found that development under the Clark County Lands Bill could increase daily water demand by 49 million gallons, or about 18% of Nevada’s total allocation from the Colorado River.
Democratic Rep. Dina Titus, who represents much of east Las Vegas and Henderson along with the Las Vegas Strip,  spoke out against the Clark County Lands Bill to state legislators last month.
No action was taken on the resolution. The resolution will need to pass in the State Senate by May 23 before being sent to the governor’s desk for final approval. 
Unlike bills, Nevada resolutions don’t require approval from the governor. But Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has repeatedly  advocated the sale of federally managed lands to developers. Last month, Lombardo signed a data sharing agreement with the Bureau of Land Management to help facilitate the privatization of federal land.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4765-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

(Photo by Alex Potemkin/Getty Images)Utah is set to become the first state in the nation to ban fluoride in drinking water, with a new law taking effect later this week, on Wednesday.
That day, the fluoride taps will turn off, if they haven’t already. While Davis and Salt Lake counties, and Brigham City, are the only governments that still add fluoride to drinking water, roughly half of the state’s population lives there.  
Sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, HB81 prevents counties and municipalities from adding fluoride to drinking water, while adding it to the list of drugs pharmacists can prescribe. 
The reasoning, Gricius said, is that the decision should be left to the individual. 
“I would just say it doesn’t get more local control than my own body,” she said during the legislative session earlier this year.
RFK Jr. ‘proud’ of Utah’s ban on fluoride in drinking water, hopes other states will follow

Gricius’ bill was one of several that aligned with the “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, agenda promoted by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who praised the law earlier this year. 
Now, for health officials like Stacey Bank, executive medical director for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, the focus is on educating the public and reminding them that fluoride is now readily available at most pharmacies. 
“I’m grateful for the opportunity to have this conversation. We haven’t talked about oral health and fluoride this much in my career as long as I can remember. This is an opportunity to get the message out to the entire state,” she said on Friday. “I know it’s not always easy to get into a doctor or dentist, there are barriers there. Going to your local pharmacist, talking to the person behind the counter, is enough to take care of your teeth.”
There are currently 25 water systems serving about 1.6 million people spread out across Davis and Salt Lake counties, and Brigham City, that add fluoride to the water. Brigham City has been adding fluoride to the water since the 1960s; Davis County started in 1999; and Salt Lake County in 2003. 
Some treatment plants have already stopped adding fluoride to the water, including a handful in Davis County, and Salt Lake County’s City Creek Water Treatment Plant.

If Utahns don’t act, expect tooth decay, officials say
“If I was looking into a crystal ball, we’re going to see a decline in oral health if our community doesn’t take action, and now go to their dentist and talk about what’s best for them and receive their supplements. If that happens, I don’t think we’ll see much of a change,” said Brian Hatch, director of the Davis County Health Department. 
In Salt Lake County, where the water has been fluoridated for almost two decades, health officials say they’re losing an effective public health tool.  
“From a public health standpoint, we know that community water fluoridation is the best way to benefit individuals and the overall community’s oral health,” added Ron Lund, environmental health director for the Salt Lake County Health Department. “It’s the most efficient and effective way to do that for people who cannot afford or may not be able to go to routine dental visits.” 
But while health officials say it’s possible they’ll see an uptick in cavities in regions currently fluoridating their water, others see the bill as an opportunity. Most of rural Utah has already stopped adding the mineral to the public water supply. 
Fluoride is a hot topic now, and with the May 7 deadline approaching, it gives public health experts a chance to educate communities, they say.

“It’s an opportunity for our more rural communities. Other than Brigham City, none of our rural communities have been adding fluoride to the water. So this is bringing more attention to how important fluoride is and giving them access to get it, that they may not have known they needed,” said State Dental Director Stacey Swilling.
But concern remains. Shifting the responsibility to individuals means Utahns will have to be more proactive about getting fluoride, which could be a burden, especially to low-income families that may already struggle with access to transportation or public health information. 
Swilling, who used to practice dentistry in another state, said it was clear which patients have access to fluoridated water. 
“Anectdoally, where I used to practice, I can tell you I saw a huge difference … There’s plenty of research out there that does show the disparities,” she said, pointing to studies conducted in Juneau, Alaska, and Calgary, Alberta, where the removal of fluoride from drinking water resulted in a spike in cavities. 
Most officials agree — Utah is headed into uncharted waters. While there are case studies in other cities, counties, states and countries, Utah is the first U.S. state to pass a sweeping ban, while also trying to make fluoride more accessible over the counter.  
“We don’t know how this is going to turn out,” Bank said. “We know about barriers to care, that’s our job, to look for and eliminate those. At this point, we’re trying to educate the public. It is going to take a more proactive effort, and we are going to have to look at those barriers and let this unfold to see how those barriers are affecting people.” 
Fluoride is a mineral that has been shown to strengthen teeth by replacing minerals that are lost from acid breakdown, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the 1940s, communities around the country have been fluoridating their water. 
A recent report from the National Toxicology Program found that high levels of fluoride in drinking water can be associated with a lower I.Q. in children, but according to the report, those levels are twice as high as the current recommended amount of fluoride. 
“The thing we need to know about those studies is that they were done looking at fluoride levels that were far outside what we are recommending for oral health,” Bank said. “We know what we’re trying to do today is a safe and effective dose of fluoride.” 
Still, that drop in I.Q. is often cited as a reason to stop adding fluoride to water, part of a nationwide movement against the mineral. Perhaps the most prominent critic of fluoride is Kennedy Jr., who applauded Gricius’ bill during a stop in Utah in April. 
“It makes no sense to have fluoride in our water. The evidence against fluoride is overwhelming … we know that it causes I.Q. loss,” Kennedy, a longtime critic of certain public health policies and medical practices, said during his visit “I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban (fluoride). I hope many more will come.” 
Gricius’ bill passed mostly along party lines, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. Despite the pushback from dentists and other health professionals, it was signed by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on March 27.

(Eric Schultz for Alabama Reflector)A recent survey found significant differences in individual counties’ absentee ballot rejection rates.
The survey of 11 counties by the League of Women Voters found that almost 2,200 ballots — about 3.6% of all absentee ballots cast — were rejected in the counties on Election Day last year.
But those rates could vary considerably. In Madison County, the home of Huntsville, only about 1% of ballots were rejected. In Mobile, the number rose to 8%.

“It is a snapshot of what is really going on with the whole state,” said Kathy Jones, president of the League of Women Voters of Alabama. “When I look at the numbers, from purely a data perspective, my conclusion is that the system has some real flaws in the way that it operates.”
The survey excluded most counties in Alabama, so it is difficult to extrapolate the attrition rate to the rest of the state. The election officials from the various counties surveyed did not state why ballots were excluded.
State law outlines the rules over which absentee ballots must be set aside and not counted, but the Alabama’s Secretary of State’s Office gives county boards of registrars wide latitude for setting policies related to absentee ballots, which can lead to disparities between counties in which absentee ballots get counted and which don’t.
Alabama is one of 17 states that does not allow voters to fix errors on their ballots prior to Election Day, according to Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank based in Colorado. That, coupled with the state’s exacting rules pertaining to absentee ballots, can lead to voters getting rejected.
Democrats introduced legislation to allow people to cure ballot affidavits that would allow election officials to be removed from the envelope and placed into the voting machine, but the bill did not move out of committee this year.
In interviews, three ballot managers said  that the decision for whether to reject or accept an absentee ballot envelope is made by a poll worker who observes each of the ballots, but that decision is not discretionary.
“You fill out the form and check boxes, and then you are supposed to sign,” said Jimmy Bell, the absentee election manager for Conecuh County, where the rejection rate was about 3%. “Then you have to put the right district. It was just some stuff that they did not do.”
Poll workers may not verify the identity of the person who signed the affidavit but check whether the person actually signed the affidavit envelope required by Alabama law. For most of the ballots, it is clear if the voter made an error, and they are unable to accept the ballot to be counted as part of the election.


The registrar of voters for each county, however, may have  individual process for dealing with ballots with discrepancies.
“Put the ballot that you don’t have an objection to in this pile, put the ballot that you have an objection to in this other pile,” Bell says to his poll workers. “Then everybody has to rule on it. One person doesn’t rule, the way I do it.”
Other places are slightly different.
“If there is ever any question, they get together and look at it,” said Brian York, the absentee election manager for Talladega County, where the rejection rate was 2.7%. “That is my office, I don’t know about anywhere else. If one of the poll workers has a question, if it looks unusual, they are going to ask another poll worker.”
Messages seeking comment were left with the Mobile County Probate Office.
Voting by absentee ballot in Alabama is difficult. The state requires voters to provide a reason for voting absentee. Voters must then navigate a series of rules and procedures that, should they miss even one, would invalidate their entire ballot.
Alabama also requires voters to finish ballot applications at least seven days before an election, and the ballots themselves must be received at the elections office by noon the day of the election.
That is different from other states, according to Christian Grose, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Southern California who studies the election process.
“Arizona allows you to mail in your absentee ballot.,” he said. “As long as it is postmarked by the election, officials will count it even if it arrives a few days later.”
Arizona’s acceptance and count rate was 99.6%. The rate for Massachusetts, a state largely dominated by Democrats, was 98.8% in the 2022 midterms.
Researchers say ballot curing is the key difference between those states and Alabama.
Curing a ballot is a two-step process in which voters submit their absentee ballots that are then reviewed by election officials to ensure the person voting is registered to vote and that person who cast the ballot is the same person who received the ballot.
“States like that, Arizona is one, California is one, a number of western states, that allow people to more actively say, ‘Yes, that was my ballot, not fraud,’ allows you to still have election integrity to protect against fraud, but still gives people a chance to confirm that it was, in fact, their signature and it just changed,” Grose said.
This would help with younger voters who traditionally have lower rates of turnout than the rest of the electorate.  A study published by the  MIT election lab in 2021 found that ballot curing cuts rejection rates almost in half.
Several lawmakers introduced several bills aimed at increasing voter turnout and enhancing opportunities for voters to participate in elections within this cycle.
HB 97, sponsored by Rep. Kenyatte Hassell, D-Montgomery, during the current session, would have introduced a system of ballot curing in Alabama. The bill did not advance during the session.
“People have been doing this for the past 10 years in the voting cycle,” said Hassell, who has introduced the legislation in previous sessions. “Their vote never counted because they didn’t know they made those mistakes, of not signing one particular piece of paper, or not checking a box, or something, of whatever it could be to not have their absentee ballot count.”
Currently, when an election official receives an absentee ballot from a voter, the absentee ballot may not be removed from the affidavit envelope if it is defective. Hassell’s legislation would have required the absentee election manager to let a voter cure the ballot affidavit to address the problem.
“I did a lot of campaigns, and we would count absentee ballots,” Hassell said. “We would say, ‘This person voted by absentee, and the person said that he supported the candidate.’ So, we would count the vote. We counted absentee ballots, but then you turn around and you don’t see the results, you don’t see the correct number of absentee ballots cast. You say, ‘Something is not right. There is a problem.’”

Senate Bill 121 would, among other things, afford cash-strapped new homeowners three years rather than 180 days to landscape their backyards. An HOA could require that owners put down a single layer of rocks after 18 months, to prevent blowing dust. 
“Most people have spent most of their money on the refrigerator, the blinds, the furniture, and they actually don’t have the funds” to spend within six months on landscaping, Neal, a Democrat from North Las Vegas, said while presenting SB 121 to the Assembly Judiciary Committee on Friday. “Home ownership is very important. Achieving the American Dream is very important. But not all people are walking into a home with the same amount of money in their bank account.”
New homebuyers are “fully informed” of their obligations, HOA attorney Adam Clarkson had earlier testified in opposition to the bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April on its way to passage in the Senate. “When they purchase a home, they know whether or not they can do it. The bright line test is don’t purchase these homes if you don’t want to have to do this.” 
However, finding a home that’s not in a HOA is a challenge in Nevada, where HOAs represent the owners of 623,917 housing units – half of the state’s 1.3 million homes, according to the state. 
“You’re protecting people that bought something they couldn’t afford in the first place, knowing that they couldn’t afford it, while at the same time you’re harming their neighbors,” Clarkson said. “Now they’re not going to be in this beautiful community, because you’ve taken that away from them, because now people don’t have to do the landscaping, and they’re going to have those blights in the neighborhood.”
Mark Leon, president of the Mountain’s Edge Master Association, agreed with Clarkson while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April.  
“If landscaping your backyard is too much of a burden for you to handle, then buy a house that was already landscaped,” Leon suggested, adding the provision “only has the effect of pandering to homeowners too lazy or too unwilling to follow through on their obligation to the community, and that directly affects the property values of their neighbors who are working hard to build their new home.”
“There were just very interesting comments on the Senate side that I felt were just very classism,” Neal said on Friday during the Assembly Judiciary hearing.  
At the hearing in April, Neal said she “slightly took offense to the idea that you shouldn’t buy the home if you can’t afford to landscape your backyard,” adding she doesn’t “believe that a homeowner should be labeled as lazy” or told to find another home if they don’t like the rules. 
Failing to comply with HOA rules can be costly. The boards wield powers generally reserved for government tribunals. They can assess fines, deny property rights, and even foreclose. 
Neal’s bill is intended to take the sting out of common complaints from homeowners. 
Current regulations permit an HOA to require a resident whose vehicle has a commercial logo or ad to cover it with a magnet. SB 121 would eliminate the requirement for all vehicles, with the exception of those with a “sexual portrayal or depicting an image relating to the sale of a controlled substance.” 
The bill would prohibit an association from assessing late fees sooner than 30 days after an obligation becomes past due, and from reporting any past due obligation to a credit agency. There was no opposition to that provision. 
The legislation would also curtail an HOA from assessing a fine for an oil stain that is entirely on a homeowner’s driveway, however, a homeowner could still be responsible for oil stains on the asphalt in front of their property. 
“My vehicles do not leak but my neighbors’ do,” testified Tanya Bates, an HOA community manager in Washoe County. “I still clean the oil stains on my street to prevent oil from being tracked into my home. It’s a maintenance obligation for homeowners.” 
An amendment offered by the HOA industry would, among other things, reduce the proposed landscaping deadline to 12 months to lay down rocks and 24 months to complete landscaping. 
“I haven’t decided if it is friendly or not,” Neal said when asked if she’d accepted it. “There are provisions I appreciate and there are provisions I do not.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.



There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Eugene Jacques Bullard became the first Black American combat pilot. 
After the near lynching of his father and hearing that Great Britain lacked such racism, the 12-year-old Georgia native stowed away on a ship headed for Scotland. From there, he moved to Liverpool, England, where he handled odd jobs before becoming a boxer, traveling across Europe before he settled in Paris. 
“It seems to me that the French democracy influenced the minds of both White and Black Americans there and helped us all to act like brothers as near as possible,” he said. “It convinced me, too, that God really did create all men equal, and it was easy to live that way.” 
When World War I began, he was too young to fight for his adopted country, so he and other American expatriates joined the French Foreign Legion. Through a series of battles, he was wounded, and doctors believed he would never walk again. 
No longer able to serve in the infantry, an American friend bet him $2,000 that he could not get into aviation. Taking on the challenge, he earned his “wings” and began fighting for the French Aéronautique Militaire. 
He addressed racism with words on his plane, “All Blood Runs Red,” and he nicknamed himself, “The Black Swallow of Death.” 
On his flights, he reportedly took along a Rhesus monkey named “Jimmy.” He tried to join the U.S. Air Service, only to be turned away because he was Black. He became one of France’s most decorated war heroes, earning the French Legion of Honor. 
After the war he bought a Paris nightclub, where Josephine Baker and Louis Armstrong performed and eventually helped French officials ferret out Nazi sympathizers. After World War II ended, he moved to Harlem, but his widespread fame never followed him back to the U.S. 
In 1960, when French President Charles de Gaulle visited, he told government officials that he wanted to see his old friend, Bullard. No one in the government knew where Bullard was, and the FBI finally found him in an unexpected place — working as an elevator operator at the Rockefeller Center in New York City. 
After de Gaulle’s visit, he appeared on “The Today Show,” which was shot in the same building where he worked. 
Upon his death from cancer in 1961, he was buried with honors in the French War Veterans’ section of the Flushing Cemetery in Queens, New York. 
A sculpture of Bullard can be viewed in the Smithsonian National Space and Air Museum in Washington, D.C., a statue of him can be found outside the Museum of Aviation, and an exhibit on him can be seen inside the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, which posthumously gave him the rank of a second lieutenant.

And your desires show who you are.
After four years in the U.S. Senate, we have few doubts about what Tommy Tuberville wants.
A man sent to Washington to represent Alabama spends a lot of time on television talking about President Donald Trump or his enemies. Alabama is a peripheral concern. In some cases, Tuberville takes positions that are demonstrably bad for the people here.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When he’s not ignoring Alabamians, he’s embarrassing them. Tuberville in 2022 made an overtly racist assertion that Black Americans are criminals at a rally in Nevada. He also took a very long time to acknowledge that white nationalists are racists.
And Tuberville appears to despise transgender people. He attacked a Space Camp employee — a private citizen — because that person was transgender. He thinks, falsely, that men somehow got into the women’s boxing events at the 2024 Olympics.
Tuberville blocked military promotions for almost a year because the Biden administration wanted to help enlisted women access health care. He compared Vice President Kamala Harris, a former senator and California attorney general, to a “crazy ex-girlfriend.” When U.S. Sen. Katie Britt — his Republican colleague; an experienced politico and a former leader of Alabama’s largest business group — bombed her State of the Union response last year, Tuberville said she had been “picked as a housewife.”
Also, he forgot that triangles exist.
And all of that is before we get to questions about whether Tuberville actually lives in Alabama; possible conflicts of interest in his stock trading and questions about one of his charities.
This is the guy who’s going to clear the gubernatorial field?
He might. Tuberville appears to be edging into next year’s race for governor. And Republicans seem ready to give way to him. Even the suggestion that Tuberville could run led Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Rick Pate to give up plans to run for the office.
The senator would, of course, be a strong candidate. Tuberville has name recognition and a record that appeals to hard core Republican primary voters.
As a sitting senator, he should raise money easily. Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth, another possible gubernatorial candidate, had $1.3 million in his campaign account  in January compared to Tuberville’s $628,000 in March. But Ainsworth will need to spend all that and more to reach Tuberville’s levels of notoriety.
There’s no doubt the senator could be our next governor.
But why does Tuberville want to be governor?
“If you’re the CEO of a state then you can help more in a certain amount of time,” Tuberville told Alabama Daily News in March.
Oh boy.
The Legislature, not the governor, holds the power in Alabama. The governor can do little more than make suggestions to lawmakers and sign the bills sent to her desk. If she vetoes a bill during the session, the Legislature can override her with a majority vote. She has a more effective pocket veto near the end of a session, but lawmakers can work around it.
If you want to be a successful chief executive in Alabama, you must know the boundaries of the office. Occasionally you get a George Wallace with enough loyalty from voters to bend legislators to his will.
More often, Alabama governors must work outside the Legislature to appear strong. This means doing things that don’t directly involve the Legislature. Like immediate response to natural disasters.  Or recruiting companies to the state.
Bob Riley did both to project decisiveness even as a Democratic-controlled Legislature controlled the purse strings. So does Kay Ivey, who understands where she has leverage and where she doesn’t.
Robert Bentley also used that combination. But he wasted it in pointless confrontations with legislators, overestimating his power and showing the weakness of the office.
Let’s hope a Gov. Tuberville does not end his career the way Bentley did. There will be plenty of ideological overlap between Tuberville and a (likely) Republican-controlled Legislature.
But Tuberville’s habit of running his mouth and alienating people without forethought doesn’t bode well. In the inevitable moments when the governor clashes with lawmakers, the chief executive needs to know what the office can and can’t do. And try to get a good result and escape the fray with as much dignity as possible.
One can’t assume a man who speaks like an uncle’s Facebook post has that subtle touch. If Trump gets his way on the economy and disaster aid, Tuberville will have fewer avenues to show leadership. And if a Gov. Tuberville talks to lawmakers like Sen. Tuberville treats his constituents, he will quickly learn who holds the cards.
But really, he shouldn’t be sitting at the table. Power has revealed Tuberville to be shallow, spiteful and more interested in attention than the state he represents. He treats most Alabamians with contempt and views his job as an annex to a television career.
And if Alabama voters, knowing all that, elevate him to another political office, what does that reveal about us?

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The high-profile lawsuit challenging Alabama’s 2022 law banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 19 has been dismissed by all parties involved.
Neither the plaintiffs – transgender youth and families challenging the ban – or the Alabama attorney’s office filed an official explanation for the move or a suggestion of a settlement with the court.  In separate statements, the plaintiffs said they would continue to fight for access to the care, while Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall declared it a total victory for the state and a vindication of their position.
“The shutting down of medical care in Alabama has forced our plaintiffs and other Alabama families to make heart wrenching decisions that no family should ever have to make, and they are each making the decisions they need to make that are right for them,” said Scott McCoy, deputy legal director of inclusion and anti-extremism litigation team at the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a joint statement from organizations representing the plaintiffs. “We salute the courage of these plaintiffs and we will continue fighting to ensure families across the country have the freedom to get their transgender children the proven medical care that enables them to thrive.”

Marshall declared the dismissal a decisive victory for the state and claimed in a statement that a “court-ordered discovery” uncovered what he described as “medical, legal, and political scandal that will be studied for decades.” 
“We uncovered the truth,” the statement said. “We exposed the scandal. We won. Alabama led the way, and now all families are safer for it.”
Messages were left with the Attorney General’s office seeking clarification. According to the statement, the discovery process in the case revealed that “key medical organizations misled parents, promoted unproven treatments as settled science, and ignored growing international concern over the use of sex-change procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors,” but does not state how. 
The statement also alleged that internal communications showed the “standards of care” were legally and politically crafted but does not provide specifics. 
The law, known as the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, made it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty blockers or hormones to transgender minors, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to 10 years. The law did not ban the use of puberty blockers to treat precocious puberty in cisgender children. 
It also prohibited gender-affirming surgeries for individuals under 19, though health care providers have repeatedly testified such surgeries are not performed on minors. 
The legislation led to immediate legal action after being signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey in April 2022. Initially, a federal judge blocked the ban on medications, citing interference with parental rights and a lack of evidence demonstrating harm from the treatments. But that decision was overturned in August 2023 by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which stated that there was no fundamental right to gender-affirming care. 
U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, writing for the majority, cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which struck down federal abortion protections and ruled that abortion was not a right “deeply rooted in the nation’s history and tradition.” Lagoa wrote that gender-affirming care had no historic grounding in the law.

(File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maryland Matters)Tonii Gedin concedes that there were some growing pains when the state began to grapple with the then-emerging COVID-19 pandemic five years ago, including how it spread and how to best combat it.
“We were learning. We were trying things and making the best decisions we could with the information that we had at the time,” said Gedin, the Anne Arundel County Health Officer who served as the deputy health officer during most of the COVID pandemic.
The pandemic sparked debates about the appropriate level of response, and not all actions were successful, most famously the 5,000 COVID-19 test kits from South Korea that were procured to great fanfare early in the crisis by then-Gov. Larry Hogan, only to be found later to be flawed.
But the pandemic, stumbles and all, gave health officials lessons in effective public health communication and outreach that have stuck around five years later, putting the state on better footing for the next public health crisis to hit the state.
“We have more data available to us to understand what’s happening,” said Sean O’Donnell, deputy chief of Public Health Services at the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services. “Going through the pandemic, and the unprecedented challenges associated with that, we definitely had lessons and a roadmap so that we are now better prepared to handle future public health emergencies.”
O’Donnell said that one of the most important lessons from the pandemic is that COVID-19 highlighted how access to health care varies across communities.


COVID-19 by the numbers
April 29, 2020
Total confirmed cases: 20,849
Total confirmed deaths: 985
April 29, 2025
Total detected cases: 1,511,171
Total confirmed deaths: 18,438


“Before COVID, we had seen many of the same disparities across populations — who’s coming out to get a flu vaccine, who’s coming out to access medical resources, doing preventative health,” he said. “We see disparities. We see our residents with less resources access health care less.”
O’Donnell said that in Montgomery County, bridging the gap in health care access during the pandemic meant the health department needed to meet community members “where they’re at” – testing sites and vaccination campaigns were targeted to communities with less access, such as in low-income communities.
“We had data telling us where people were vaccinating and where they weren’t and we could send in resources into geographic communities or into the populations that had lower vaccination rates.
Gedin said that Anne Arundel County saw that same pattern and created an “ambassador” program that recruited community members to help push communications about the pandemic.
Anne Arundel has continued the program to this day due to the success of the ambassadors, particularly for the county’s Korean residents, Spanish-speaking communities and “different populations that are more vulnerable or have more issues with access to health care.”
“We’ve been able to find a number of health topics … outside of COVID that they’re tackling,” she said. “They’re tackling mental health, weather preparedness. They’re looking at things like overdose prevention and making sure that communities have naloxone [a drug to reverse opioid overdoses].”
Meanwhile, the shift to social distancing during the pandemic meant that Maryland’s public health system needed to adapt the technology needed to track the virus and help get messaging out to community members.
Kristy Frashure, deputy director of disease, prevention and management for the Anne Arundel County Health Department, said that surveillance methodology such as wastewater testing for COVID-19 and other viruses were improved over the course of the pandemic.
 


 
The county continues to test wastewater to track transmission of COVID-19 now that testing is less widespread than in the early years – and it uses the technology to track other viruses such as the flu.
“We’re still using that, not just for COVID but for other various infectious diseases,” Frashure said.
She added that the knowledge and acceptance of “telehealth” services have gained popularity since the pandemic.
“We’ve had some of these things before COVID, telehealth and whatnot, but certainly during the height of COVID, that really accelerated the adoptions of … these digital health solutions, which increased access to care for individuals and reduced the risk of infection,” Frashure said.
A 2024 report from the Maryland Health Care Commission said that while “telehealth visits have declined in recent years both nationally and in Maryland, they remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.”
“Embracing these technologies have really proved effective and we’re still using them today,” Frashure said, noting that mental health issues have particularly benefited from increased awareness of telehealth services since the pandemic.
“With the pandemic and quarantine and lockdown and individuals working from home … I think the pandemic really set a light on mental health,” she said. “Certainly post-pandemic we really need to prioritize mental health and the well-being of all the communities.”
O’Donnell noted that there were some costs that came with social distancing protocols and remote life.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“None of this was done lightly, and there was a cost to all of it. Not just the economic costs. I can talk about how successful social distancing is, but it comes at a behavioral health cost. It has an educational costs,” he said. “All of these things have to be balanced. We have to balance the successes we’ve seen in the past with what these costs are.”
The Montgomery and Anne Arundel health officials agreed that a lot of the public health infrastructure built through COVID-19 remains to help battle future severe diseases – assuming federal resources are available for additional support.
“We’ve learned that when we have those resources, we can do amazing things,” O’Donnell said. “I do think we could do it again – public health has the knowledge and the will to do it. But that’s not a standing resource that we all have.”
As for the lessons learned during the pandemic, he said that the experiences of battling the worst of COVID-19’s impact will have a long-lasting impression on those on the frontlines.
“I don’t think we’re going to easily forget those because of the lasting impressions they’ve had on us,” O’Donnell said. “Our health care workers who watched tens of thousands of people die – they’re not going to be forgotten.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Masks-on-Maryland-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

La orden ejecutiva “Solo Inglés” es una clara violación de los mandatos federales del Título VI de la Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964.  Al no codificar y rectificar sus antigua indiferencia sistémica de hablantes no nativos de inglés, el estado ha renunciado a la oportunidad de brindar información crítica a sus habitantes cuyo idioma nativo no es el inglés, a los usuarios del lenguaje de señas y a aquellos que dependen del lenguaje sencillo para su comprensión.


En el centro de esta cuestión estaba el Proyecto de ley del Senado (SB 955), un proyecto de ley que propuse y que fue presentado en la sesión legislativa de 2025 por el senador MD Rahman. El proyecto de ley buscaba establecer políticas que garantizan que las personas con dominio limitado del inglés pudieran acceder a información y servicios públicos a través de recursos de traducción e interpretación. Fue un paso necesario hacia la creación de una Oficina de Acceso al Idioma, una entidad centralizada que supervisaría y coordinaría los esfuerzos de accesibilidad lingüística en todo el estado. Sin embargo, a pesar de su potencial para atender a más de 400,000 residentes cuyo idioma principal no es el inglés ni el algonquin (el idioma oficial del estado), el proyecto de ley no logró salir del Comité de Administración Gubernamental y Elecciones.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
El fracaso de SB 955 es más que un simple revés legislativo; es una negación de derechos fundamentales. El acceso al idioma no es un privilegio, es una necesidad para una participación equitativa en la vida cívica y cotidiana. Sin él, miles de residentes de Connecticut a lo largo de su vida se quedan sin la capacidad de interactuar con los servicios gubernamentales, los proveedores de atención médica, los sistemas legales y las instituciones educativas de manera significativa.
Esta decisión refleja una tendencia preocupante de privilegio de la información y exclusión lingüística, lo que refuerza las barreras para las personas que no hablan inglés y los usuarios de lengua de señas. Es un significante contraste con los principios de inclusión e igualdad de oportunidades que Connecticut dice defender. La ausencia de una Oficina de Acceso Lingüístico dedicada significa que los residentes seguirán enfrentándose a servicios lingüísticos fragmentados e inconsistentes, marginando aún más a las comunidades que ya luchan por navegar los sistemas burocráticos.
Durante años, defensores, hemos luchado para corregir esta injusticia, trabajando incansablemente para garantizar que Connecticut reconozca los derechos de TODOS sus residentes, independientemente de su origen lingüístico, edad y capacidad. El hecho de no aprobar SB 955 no es sólo un rechazo de un proyecto de ley: es un rechazo de las personas a las que debía servir.
A medida que Connecticut avanza, debe reconsiderar su postura sobre el acceso a información lingüística. El Estado no puede permitirse el lujo de ignorar las voces de quienes han sido sistemáticamente excluidos. La lucha por el acceso equitativo a la información y al idioma está lejos de terminar, y es imperativo que los legisladores revisen este tema con la urgencia y el compromiso que merece.La pregunta sigue siendo: ¿Seguirá Connecticut dándole la espalda a sus comunidades diversas o finalmente tomará medidas para garantizar que el acceso al idioma ya no sea una barrera para los servicios esenciales? La respuesta definirá el compromiso del Estado con los derechos civiles en los próximos años.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-05 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How will car tax changes affect you? Here’s what to know.,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/05/ct-car-tax-changes/,Lawmakers adjusted a law that changed how CT assesses car values after some towns said they’re getting less in car taxes. Here's what to know.,"For years, lawmakers have been working out the details on a plan to change the way Connecticut towns assess the value of motor vehicles for tax purposes. 
A 2022 law requires that Connecticut towns use the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, rather than the National Automobile Dealers Association valuation system to figure out how much vehicles are worth. The law aims to make the way cars are valued more predictable and uniform as they get older.
But now that the change went into effect, some town officials said they’re bringing in less money and are increasing their mill rates to make up for the loss.
Lawmakers had adjusted the law during a special session over the summer and, in response to the towns’ concerns, changed it again with an emergency-certified bill at the start of this legislative session. Still, some lawmakers want to phase out the car tax altogether.
Here’s what you need to know about the changes.
How does this affect my taxes?
It’s likely that most people’s vehicles will be valued lower, which would bring down their taxes. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price also has a set 20-year schedule of depreciation, as opposed to the National Automobile Dealers Association, which fluctuates more.
That means car owners should be able to better predict what their future car tax bills will be, based on how old their vehicle is. 
The new system of valuing cars is less susceptible to market swings. The change aims to prevent big shifts, such as the one many people saw during the pandemic when the price of vehicles — and the cost of the car tax — spiked.
What does this mean for my town?
Towns have reported that the change has meant big drops in their grand lists, or the total value of taxable property in town. The town gets a certain percentage of that value as tax revenue, which it uses to pay for town projects and programs such as the school budget, roads, water systems and libraries.
Some towns have increased their mill rates to make up for the difference, meaning that property taxes could increase in the coming year.
What has the legislature done?
State lawmakers have worked on this issue for years. 
When the 2022 law mandated that towns use the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, the list began with an 80% valuation for vehicles that are up to a year old, meaning that it drops to 80% of its original value in that year.
But legislators said they needed to make “fixes” to the statute before it went into effect in October 2024. They met in June in a special session to make technical changes to the law, including starting the depreciation schedule with an 85% valuation for vehicles that are up to a year old, lessening the impact on municipal budgets.
But after the law went into effect in July, some towns complained that their budgets had taken too much of a loss. In February, lawmakers responded to the concerns by passing an emergency-certified bill that allowed towns to opt to set the depreciation schedule beginning at 90% of the original value, rather than 85%. Several towns have since decided to use the provision and change their schedules.
Most Democrats have been supportive of the changes, saying it will help towns better plan their budgets and lower car taxes for regular people. Some said it didn’t go far enough, and that Connecticut should get rid of its car tax altogether.
Several Republicans opposed the measure and said they worried that towns would lose too much money under the new system.
What is happening with the car tax now?
Connecticut politicians have been talking about what they say are problems with the car tax system for decades. Because each of the state’s 169 towns have different mill rates, residents pay different amounts for the same vehicles based on where they live.
Often, this has meant that people who live in cities, which tend to have higher mill rates, pay more in car taxes than people in wealthier suburbs. Lawmakers and governors have said they want to change that. Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, has worked for the past couple of sessions on bills that would eliminate the car tax entirely.
He’s now working on a way to phase out the tax, although the details of that plan aren’t yet clear because lawmakers are still negotiating the language, with a goal of passing a plan this session.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0225_SR_ParkedCars_003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A legislative effort to make it easier and cheaper to build houses and apartments is all but dead for the year. 
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers and advocates entered the legislative session with an ambitious but carefully-crafted set of bills to remake Minnesota’s zoning and land use rules, opening up construction of more homes and apartments across the state. 
The coalition’s chances of passing meaningful zoning reform likely ended Thursday when four Democrats and two Republicans in a Senate committee voted against an amendment that contained a bare-bones version of the package.
“We really brought what we felt was the bare minimum of what we needed to do to help people — we hear them, we understand that they’re asking for more housing options, that they’re asking for more affordable housing,” said state Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL- Burnsville, who chairs the Senate housing committee. “This was our opportunity to do a small fraction of that.”
Minnesota is facing a housing shortage, and low supply means higher prices for buyers and renters. The “Yes to Homes” coalition says local government regulations are restricting building. Cities often dictate minimum square footage, garage sizes, parking spots and lot sizes, for instance, driving up costs and incentivizing developers to focus on expensive single-family home construction. 
New apartments, even if proposed in an area zoned for multi-family development, often face long permitting processes, contentious public hearings and negotiations with city planners that result in fewer units and higher costs for future residents, developers say.
Last year’s attempt to pass legislation rolling back city control over where housing is built and what it looks like failed after intense opposition from city leaders. 
In the leadup to the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers met with lobbyists for city governments to hash out their differences. The result was a more incremental approach to zoning reform, with four bills targeting different aspects of the interaction between housing developers and municipal governments. 
Despite lengthy negotiations, city governments still weren’t on board with the legislation, and city government leaders and their lobbyists turned out to committee hearings this year to voice their concerns. 
The bills passed their respective housing committees with overwhelming bipartisan support despite city opposition. 
But the bills never made it to their next stop: the state and local government committees. They stalled out as cities lobbied in opposition and the bill authors failed to secure the necessary votes.
As a last-ditch effort to get some significant housing policy passed in the Senate, Port brought an amendment Thursday to a bill in the Senate State and Local Government Committee that contained a few of the key policies.
The language would have allowed cities to require up to one parking spot per residential unit; prohibited cities from requiring the establishment of an HOA as a condition of development; barred cities from imposing aesthetic mandates, like the type of siding or features like columns, decks, balconies or porches; and required cities to establish and follow an administrative review process for housing construction permits in areas zoned to allow that type of development — i.e. not forcing developers into a protracted negotiation process, or requiring city council approval, for developments that follow existing zoning rules.
It did not incorporate some of the more controversial policies endorsed by the coalition, such as ending single-family zoning statewide, or requiring cities to allow apartment buildings along transit corridors and in commercial areas. 
Lawmakers voiced support for city leaders and were reluctant to take power from their constituent cities against their will.
“This shifts power towards developers, not communities,” said Sen. Heather Gustafson, DFL-Vadnais Heights, who voted against the amendment. She also cited the bill’s “one-size-fits-all” approach, and its failure to guarantee the creation of more affordable housing, as reasons for voting no. 
The cities in her district, where the average rent is over $2,000 per month, are already doing good work on housing affordability and should retain control over housing development, Gustafson said.
Port said she and other bill authors will bring similar legislation again next year. 
“I think these bills, in some version, are inevitable,” Port said. “It is really up to the cities and the city lobbying groups to decide how much fight they want to put into this — how much reputational damage, or how much they want to put their reputations on the line fighting this.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250425_0411-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

(Getty Images)Misinformation, myths and politics have contributed to Indiana’s lack of a cohesive, statewide policy on renewable energy. 
Seventy-two of 92 counties have moratoriums or bans on such installations, according to legislative energy head Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. Several attempts this year to intervene against blockages died, but lawmakers are starting to recognize the need for diversification. 
 “As long as there’s demand for renewables, if we can’t have them here, we’ll buy it from somewhere else – our folks will be paying the transmission costs plus the possibility of more,” said Soliday.
He said organized anti-renewable energy movements travel the state, attending county commissioners’ meetings, adding that they “can be quite unkind, threatening and so forth.”
While debate continues, the price of electricity is rising in Indiana. Once among the lowest in the United States, the state now ranks 28th for cost.
 Locals see things differently

Decatur County resident and farm owner Albert Armand emphasized he’s not against solar, but concerned about preserving valuable farmland.
“My view on these solar installations is that there’s a place for them and the best place is not a corn field,” he said. “We have a lot of ground we could use. We can put solar panels on roofs, over parking lots — if we install these on farm ground we’re going to eliminate a lot of crop acres.”

Larry Heger is another Decatur County resident who helps manage a Facebook group — Decatur County Citizens Stop Industrial Solar & Wind — alongside his wife. He described himself as “against solar taking out good-quality farm ground.”











As an elected Republican in a conservative area that votes 78% Republican, we don’t want the green energy stuff in our county.


– Ripley County Commissioner Mark Horstman



Heger’s group is primarily local landowners who, he said “would live across the road from one of the projects” and are “very concerned about their landscape, how it affects their home value.” 
He claims he’s encountered “like, less than a dozen” people supportive of renewable energy in Decatur County. Heger believes they’re the landowners “who signed the lease.”
While Decatur County has discussed a solar-specific ordinance, it’s currently under a moratorium. County Commissioner Jeremy Pasel, a Republican, declined to be interviewed.
Opposition brings likely end to Indiana utility siting bill, but the issue isn’t going away

Nearby Ripley County approved solar energy regulations last year.  County Commission President Mark Horstman said the three-person body felt their county needed its own standards.
“We had caught wind that some landowners had signed up for commercial solar and some neighbors were opposed. We realized we were set to have the state solar rules in place, because we didn’t have our own,” he said. 

He said the area eyed for solar expansion was in the north part of the county, with a farm and housing development nearby. Horstman is among those who believe such installations lower property values.
“As an elected Republican in a conservative area that votes 78% Republican, we don’t want the green energy stuff in our county,” Horstman continued. “The people that elected me do not want it in our county. On the other side — we don’t have the demographics or topographies for it. We don’t have vast lots of land in our area.”
“So, you’re basically telling somebody – your biggest investment you’re ever going to make, your home, now you’re going to look at solar panels across the street,” he said, citing a belief that the panels lower surrounding property values. “I’m not opposed if they want to put a 1,000 acre solar farm in the middle of 5,000 acres and two people live there, that’s fine, but we don’t have that type of area in Ripley County.”

Ripley County’s ordinance, Horstman believes, gives landowners room to negotiate while still requiring specific setback distances.
“I understand people have rights to do what they want on their land, but you don’t have a right to put confined feeding in a residential area, there’s rules in place,” and renewable energy should be handled similarly, he said. 
He said he personally felt the ordinance should be more stringent but the three commissioners negotiated a compromise. 
 Future of renewables

Indiana Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson thinks these types of ordinances are holding Indiana back.
“We can’t seem to get legislation passed in any way, shape or form to encourage or incentivize clean, renewable energy,” he said. “Economics and technology are certainly not standing in the way. The barriers are political, and the barriers are the will to move away” from non-renewables.
“Of course, the utilities themselves and the fossil fuel industry — they have enormous influence in Congress and statehouses across the country,” he continued.

Olson and other renewable advocates say Indiana needs to diversify its energy portfolio to both reduce prices and eliminate fossil fuels. Several have pointed to White County as a leader. 
The county currently has commercial wind and solar facilities, plus hydroelectric dams. 
Its exploration of commercial wind began in 2007. Leaders reviewed ordinances and added language where needed.
But, “it wasn’t really the county that was pursuing this,” Republican Commission President Mike Smolek said. “It was the local farmers that were pursuing this.”
“The commissioners before me did their due diligence,” continued Smolek. “They went to California, Arizona, Texas” to see how renewable energy worked in those areas and what could be done to enhance road use agreements and other items.” 











My biggest fight these last couple years has been fear and Facebook.


– White County Commissioner Mike Smolek



The county’s first commercial wind facility launched in 2008. The county approved the construction of a large-scale commercial solar facility in September 2024, according to WFLI.
But resistance to commercial solar and battery storage — plus, plenty of myths and misconceptions — has surged in recent years, per Smolek. 
“My biggest fight these last couple years has been fear and Facebook,” he said. 
“You don’t, as a normal, general citizen, get to see these things in operation, don’t understand it — they don’t know what’s going on,” he added. “And then you get people on Facebook that talk about stuff they don’t really know about. Trying to get everybody on the same page, (give them) the knowledge that you know and teach them about it is a big thing.” 
The prospect of small modular nuclear reactors have also prompted anxiety, Smolek said.

“It’s human nature to be afraid,” Smolek said. “All we can do is educate ourselves and figure out what’s best for us. The deciding factor is, we know we need power. Everybody depends on it. Every manufacturer, every household, every business all depends on this same grid.”
That’s among Olson’s top two reasons why he says rural communities should consider renewable installations: Indiana’s currently an energy importer.
“There’s absolutely no reason we don’t want to build more energy in-state and be energy independent. That’s good for everybody – it brings down prices,” and lowers consumers’ electric bills, he continued. 
With renewable energy, Olson said, you get an energy source “that is not reliant on a fuel source and all the additional costs and volatility that come along with purchasing coal, purchasing gas, purchasing oil — in the markets, operation and maintenance on the fossil fuel power plants.”
But number one is the revenue. 
Renewable energy, he said, provides income for schools, roads, parks and more. It brings jobs to the community.
The other main reason: “We are an importer of energy right now,” Olson said.
“There’s absolutely no reason we don’t want to build more energy in-state and be energy independent. That’s good for everybody – it brings down prices,” and lowers consumers’ electric bills, he continued. 
With renewable energy, Olson said, you get an energy source “that is not reliant on a fuel source and all the additional costs and volatility that come along with purchasing coal, purchasing gas, purchasing oil — in the markets, operation and maintenance on the fossil fuel power plants.”
He acknowledged that studies on the impact to property values haven’t been conclusive. But he dismissed concerns about soil and farmland as “completely junk science — if you talk to Farm Bureau, the Purdue (University) agriculture folks.” 
“Nobody … is saying we’re going to be 100% wind or 100% solar,” he continued. 
“When you invest — you want a diverse portfolio. We (similarly) want a combination of all resources to ensure reliability, ensure resiliency to shelter ratepayers from the risk of being reliant on one source alone.”

The Senate versus the House; the House versus the governor; the governor versus everybody.
They’re so furious they can’t even see straight.
The governor has one job: Look after the best interests of the people of Florida, who are crying out for affordable insurance, housing, decent public schools, clean water — small stuff like that.
But he prefers to spend his time yelling about “woke” education and exhorting cops to pick up anyone who looks “illegal,” even if they’re U.S. citizens.
The Legislature has one job: Pass a budget during their two-month session.
They haven’t managed to do it yet. They went home on Frida but they didn’t get around to the budget. They say they’ll reconvene in a week.
The Senate wants to cut sales tax on clothes costing under 75 bucks, reduce the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, and give a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees.
The House wants to slash sales tax on everything and spend $4.4 billion less than the Senate.
The two chambers are supposed to be negotiating a compromise, but Speaker Daniel Perez says senators aren’t playing nice, dismissing their proposals “unacceptable” and “patronizing.”
Senate President Ben Albritton politely insists he won’t pass massive tax cuts “at the expense of the long-term financial stability of our state.”
Such tax cuts would pretty much insure county and municipal governments — police, firefighters, parks, roads, libraries — would take an enormous hit.
The governor says cutting sales tax will only help those dang tourists — AKA Florida’s No. One industry, especially the dastardly Canadians. (Who’s going to tell him they’re vacationing elsewhere these days?)
He wants to go even bigger (and dumber), abolishing property taxes or at least upping the homestead exemption.
If you rent or you depend on local services, you’re out of luck.
Dissing DeSantis
At the moment, both chambers are either openly flouting or ostentatiously ignoring directives from the governor’s office.
The Senate has refused to confirm a slew of his nominees, including University of West Florida trustees and heads of the Department of Children and Families and the Agency for Healthcare Administration.
In an attempt to stop the washed-up-politician-to-higher-ed-sinecure pipeline, the House has passed a bill to bring university presidential searches back into the sunshine, letting taxpayers know who’s under consideration.
DeSantis is outraged: “They want the universities to be able to pursue a leftist indoctrination agenda,” he says, a statement that suggests he has never met members of the Florida House.
The governor seems trapped in a perpetual temper tantrum, calling Daniel Perez “terrible,” “rotten,” “treacherous,” and “a tool of the Left.”
This “tool of the left” is the same Daniel Perez who’s such a good little MAGA he got the House to pass a bill called “Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy” — also known as the TRUMP Act.
DeSantis had called a special session in January, demanding legislators adopt his bill, giving him near-monarchical power over private businesses and law enforcement, all in the name of fighting the sinister foreigners infiltrating the state to pick tomatoes and put up drywall.
Instead, the Legislature gaveled out, then gaveled in their own special session, thumbing their noses at the governor to whom they once bowed down before.
This is what happens when you 1. Run against Trump; and 2. Become politically irrelevant.
Mutual snark
Perez and DeSantis have been snarking at each other for months, but now their reactionary-Republican-on-reactionary-Republican war has gotten hotter than Tallahassee in August.
Not only has the House defied the governor, its healthcare budget committee has been digging into Hope Florida, a charity founded by Casey DeSantis.
Ms. DeS is generally assumed to be running for governor in 2026.
Hope Florida claimed to be about keeping needy people off that nasty ol’ gubmint assistance, funneling them to church programs and other private aid groups.
“Hope Florida is not a program,” says Casey DeSantis. “Hope Florida is an idea, Hope Florida is a philosophy.”
Problem is, as Rep. Alex Andrade, R-Pensacola says, Hope Florida also looks a lot like “conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud.”
Oh, dear.
Here’s what happened: Centene Corp., a Fortune 500 company and Florida’s biggest Medicaid contractor, overcharged for prescription drugs.
It could happen to anyone! Just ask Sen. Rick Scott.
Centene settled with the state for $67 million.
The DeSantis administration told the Legislature about $57 million of that. But $10 million that should have been divided between the state and the feds somehow got donated to the Hope Florida Foundation.
Hope Florida promptly funneled that $10 million to two political committees, one called “Save Our Society From Drugs” (they mean fun drugs, not Advil) and the other “Secure Florida’s Future.”
SFF is controlled by the Florida Chamber of Commerce, which uses it to make dark money campaign contributions.
Nothing shady there, right?
You call this ‘clean’?
It gets better (or worse if you give a damn about ethics and the rule of law): Within a few weeks these two dodgy outfits directed $8.5 million of their windfall to another one, “Keep Florida Clean” (not making this up), the purpose of which was to defeat Amendment 3.
That was the amendment seeking to legalize marijuana. It narrowly lost in the 2024 elections.
Guess who controlled the Keep Florida Clean PAC?
James Uthmeier, attorney general of the State of Florida and DeSantis’ former chief of staff and presidential campaign manager.
A lot of that money paid for ads against Amendment 3, an action that was probably illegal.
Rep. Andrade accuses Uthmeier of “money laundering and wire fraud.”
Uthmeier dismisses Andrade as a tool of “Big Marijuana.”
He says he wasn’t involved in the Hope donation thing.
Or, not very involved, or even aware of what it was, though he swam in the tightest inner circle of DeSantisWorld, up to his eyeballs in some of the governor’s stupidest ideas, including building a golf course in the fragile habitat of Jonathan Dickinson State Park.
The evidence suggests he was very involved.
Meanwhile, DeSantis is in full hissy-fit mode, accusing legislators of working with Democrats and the “liberal media” to trash his wife’s pet charity and derail her political ambitions.
In one of his weird rants he says, “Some people feel threatened by the First Lady, accusing the Legislature and the press of “doing narrative.”
He goes on: “You know, if you’re looking at 2026 and you’ve got some horse, you don’t want her anywhere near that. You’re very worried because she runs circles around their people.”
 ‘Mistakes were made’
Rep. Andrade slaps back: “I don’t care if she files to run for governor,” adding, “Given how much credit she gets for the Hope Florida Foundation and the Hope Florida program, I’m just kind of shocked at how incompetent she’s been in managing all of it.”
Casey DeSantis had been polling pretty well against declared candidate Byron Donalds, recipient of the presidential endorsement, a congressman who calls Donald Trump “Daddy.”
The Hope debacle could change that.
Hope Florida’s president Joshua Hay allowed as how “mistakes were made” and resigned, as did one of Hope’s attorneys.
Frustrated that people from the Chamber of Commerce and the various dark money committees involved in Hope refused to talk, Andrade has dropped the inquiry — for now.
The House could return to it later.
The Legislature may have backed off investigating Hope, but the “liberal media,” lawyers, political consultants, campaign managers, and maybe even some judges  will not.
More like this will come to light; more evidence of what Andrade calls the DeSantis “culture of neglect, incompetence and entitlement” will emerge, just as the 2026 gubernatorial campaign kicks off.
The Fall of the House of DeSantis is going to be quite the spectacle.

House of Representatives chamber with a football play in the foreground. (Illustration by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CREATIVE/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA— Legislators’ latest effort to overhaul the South Carolina High School League will carry over into 2026, with the bill’s chief sponsor saying she’s cautiously optimistic a solution can be reached in the off-session.
Legislators insist they’re not going to let this push for change fizzle.
The House Education Committee decided last week to postpone debate on a bill that would eliminate the organization that governs student athletics and replace it with a board appointed by legislators.
The independent league, which creates its own rules for participating middle and high schools, has long rankled legislators, who often get calls from upset parents about decisions they have no authority over.
House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson said she filed the latest bill in March out of frustration; 28 legislators co-signed. It advanced last month from a subcommittee. But then, to her surprise, a member of the league’s executive committee contacted her.
So, rather than send the bill to the floor in the final days of this year’s session, her committee decided to try to collaborate with the league on a compromise that keeps the organization’s self-governance intact.
“I’m going out on a limb, and I’m not 100% sure it’s the right limb to go out on,” Erickson, R-Beaufort, told her committee Wednesday.
The decision to pause disbanding the league followed the committee’s grilling of Jerome Singleton, the league’s longtime commissioner.
Legislators said they were tired of getting parents’ complaints about the league’s transfer rule, which requires students to sit out for a year before being allowed to play sports at their new school.
Rep. Stephen Frank, R-Greenville, even asked Singleton if he’d consider resigning his position.
“Maybe we don’t want the High School League to go away,” he said. “But the common denominator I’ve heard over and over is Jerome, Jerome, Jerome.”
Singleton said he would not leave his position.
Erickson stepped in minutes later and said issues with the league go beyond Singleton.
“It’s not just one person; it’s a problem with the way it’s organized,” she said.
The High School League has overseen sports in South Carolina’ middle and high schools since 1913. Its more than 400 members include traditional public schools, as well as charter schools and private schools.
Legislators have long threatened to eliminate the High School League.
But criticism intensified in recent years as the league grappled with the rise of sports-focused charter schools plucking students from around the state and the increasing regularity of athletes attempting to switch schools.
Erickson first proposed replacing the High School League in November 2023 after months of studying how to even out competition in high school sports.
Proposal replaces SC High School League with legislators’ own governing board

That came in the aftermath of the league establishing a multiplier for determining which bracket schools would compete in. Traditionally, schools have been grouped according to the size of the student population.
Under the change, all students enrolled at a school from outside normal attendance zones, regardless of whether they played a sport, counted as three students.
That forced athletics-focused charter schools — the reason for the rule — to play bigger schools. But it also moved smaller private schools that are in the league into bigger brackets. Legislators said that perpetuated, rather than fixed, the unfairness.
“Come on guys: Do better. Do better at your jobs. Do better for the kids,” Rep. James Teeple told Singleton and other league representatives at Wednesday’s meeting.
The Johns Island Republican said the league reached out to Erickson out of desperation, not a true desire for change.
“This dumpster fire has been burning for a long time. It’s come to the point where those in leadership have noticed we’re committed to clipping their wings a little bit,” he said. “I question the real motives. I doubt it’s in good faith.”
But Erickson said she continues to hold out hope for collaboration. She said she’s already met with Adam Lanford, the vice president of the league’s executive committee.
“I hope that, No. 1, we can increase communication,” she said.
Rep. Terry Alexander, D-Florence, said no matter what conversations occur over the next seven months, change is necessary.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that it’s going to be reorganized,” said the committee’s second vice-chairman and its longest-serving member. “We may kick the can down the road for a little bit. But there’s no doubt it will not be running like this in the next year or two.”
After the meeting, Singleton told the SC Daily Gazette he doesn’t know why Lanford, principal of Powdersville High School in Anderson County, contacted Erickson, but he’s happy to work with legislators on a solution. (Lanford did not respond to the Gazette’s messages for comment.)
“The ability to have a conversation and dialogue” is a great thing, Singleton said. “Both sides can see what’s there. And then, wherever concerns are, if there’s a medium to fix it, I think we take advantage of that.”
High School League optimism
Scott Earley, director of the South Carolina Athletic Coaches Association, said he agrees work needs to be done but called efforts to banish the league “radical.”
Earley said his travels since becoming the association’s leader in December 2023 have given him insight into how other states govern high school athletics, and South Carolina’s system stands up well in comparison.
“I don’t think the problem is nearly as bad as it’s made out to be,” he told the Gazette.
His association’s board issued a statement in support of maintaining the league, while pledging to work with lawmakers in addressing issues.
“The League has long been a trusted leader in advancing the high ideals of sportsmanship, integrity, physical welfare, and equitable opportunity for student-athletes across every region of our state,” read the statement sent after the committee meeting.
“We need to remember, it is a member-driven body — shaped by the input, collaboration, and votes of schools statewide,” it continued. “We all need to work together in the face of challenges.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/house.chamber.football.illustraiton.001-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

Photo by Getty Images. An innocent look. A wag of a tail. It’s kind of hard to resist the tug on your heart to buy the dog you see in a pet store window. The problem is that buying a pet shop puppy amounts to a direct investment in the cruel puppy mill industry, which treats parent dogs as breeding machines and puppies as mere products.  
Sad to say, public records show that the puppy mill-to-pet store pipeline is thriving in Minnesota. We’ve connected puppy stores in the state to puppy mill facilities cited by the United States Department of Agriculture or a state agency for numerous violations of animal welfare laws. There are likely more Minnesota puppy mills cited for violations and involved in-state sales to pet shops, but there are limits to what we can determine since Minnesota state inspection reports are not made public.  
Even so, the simple fact that pet shops are sourcing dogs from puppy mills with violations remains disturbing, not least because the bar for legal compliance is so incredibly low. USDA-licensed breeders can legally confine breeding dogs to stacked, wire cages only six inches larger than their bodies for their entire lives. They can repeatedly and excessively breed dogs without limits, and they can kill dogs they no longer want. 
In a disturbing appraisal of federal inspection activities, a new internal audit by the USDA’s Inspector General documented major deficiencies in enforcement. The report stated that the pattern of continued noncompliance with Animal Welfare Act requirements by licensed dog breeders “poses a threat to the well-being and safety of their dogs, leaving them vulnerable to neglect, mistreatment and suffering.” 
Here in Minnesota, the puppy mill issue got so bad in Winona County that the County Commission voted to pursue a permanent ban on new breeders.  
Luckily, the solution to the puppy store problem is simple. There is a bill in the Legislature, SF 1943/HF 2627, that would phase out the sale of puppies in pet shops, banning any new stores from selling puppies and holding existing stores accountable for their sourcing of animals.   
This legislation tackles puppy mill cruelty, but breeding conditions are just the first stop when it comes to welfare issues in the dismal puppy mill-to-pet shop pipeline. It gets worse. Weeks-old puppies endure grueling and often filthy transports, and they are so likely to be sick they are often pumped with antibiotics, which has led to antibiotic-resistant infections that have spread to humans. 
Far too often, too, families end up with sick puppies, steep veterinary bills and heartbreak. They can also fall victim to predatory lending schemes when they take out a loan to pay the exorbitant price that puppy stores charge — often paying thousands of dollars and high interest rates. 
In fact, several customers have told the Minnesota Senate their story about buying sick dogs from a local puppy store, with some accounts that end with the death of their cherished pets. 
In-store conditions are troubling too. Humane World for Animals — formally called the Humane Society of the United States — has conducted undercover puppy store investigations across the nation and nearly each time we have uncovered awful in-store conditions, sick puppies and connections to puppy mills. Our most recent investigation, released in January 2025, detailed a heartbreaking scene in a Nevada store: In the store’s back room, a tiny brown-and-white Havanese puppy was vomiting and lethargic — and left entirely alone to suffer. Staff members failed to take the puppy to a veterinarian, and she later died. This is a common story at pet shops around the country — ailing puppies denied veterinary care and even a measure of human kindness. 
The massive animal welfare and consumer protection problems posed by puppy stores have led eight states and nearly 500 localities, including nine in Minnesota, to ban the sale of puppies in pet shops. Our state lawmakers should do the same. 
This is a commonsense policy because no Minnesotan needs a pet shop to find the pet of their choice.  Shelters, rescues and responsible breeders who go to great lengths to care for their dogs and only sell puppies directly to consumers will remain great options for pet acquisition. We are lucky to have a wide network of responsible breeders in the region, including 37 breeders who refuse to sell their puppies to pet stores, and have signed a letter acknowledging that only a puppy mill would do so. 
Further, no pet shop needs to sell puppies to be profitable. According to the American Pet Products Association, Americans spent $147 billion on their pets in 2023, with food, treats and product spending dominating. Pet spending is predicted to have “solid year-over-year growth through 2030.” Similarly,  Morgan Stanley reported the pet industry is “poised to nearly triple to $275 billion by 2030 thanks to a surge in new owners, favorable demographics and increased per-pet spending.” 
Any puppy store owner would be smart to transition away from the sale of puppies and towards a pet products and services model. Many have, including Angel’s Pet World in Hudson, Wisconsin, whose owner stated in her testimony to the Minnesota Senate, “some people ask me how that decision impacted my sales… within 2 years, our customer base grew about 70%.” 
SF1943/HF2627, led by Sens. Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis and Jim Abeler, R-Anoak, and Reps. Matt Norris, Blaine, and Elliott Engen, R-White Bear Township, is a long overdue, bipartisan animal welfare and consumer protection measure that promises to bring genuine improvements in this area of concern. 
This issue is a matter of great public import and goes to the very heart of our duties of mercy and kindness toward animals.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-959093144-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

There are contests for nine Democrat-held legislative seats. Eight involve lawmakers appointed for the just-completed session who are seeking to stay in office. Winners will serve through 2026.
One race is to fill the vacancy created by the death of Democratic state Sen. Bill Ramos in April. The victor in November will serve the remaining three years of the term.
Here’s where things stand as filing gets underway.
Senate
26th District: Sen. Deb Krishnadasan, a Gig Harbor Democrat, wants to keep the seat she was appointed to after the district’s former state senator, Emily Randall, was elected to Congress. The district covers parts of Kitsap and Pierce Counties.
Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier of Gig Harbor is the lone GOP challenger to emerge so far. 
33rd District: Sen. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, served in the state House until she was chosen to succeed Sen. Karen Keiser, who retired. Orwall was the only candidate with a campaign committee as of Friday. The district includes Burien, Normandy Park, Des Moines, SeaTac, and much of Kent.
34th District: Sen. Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle, moved from the House to the Senate to replace Joe Nguyen when Gov. Bob Ferguson named him to lead the state Department of Commerce. The district includes West Seattle, Vashon Island, White Center, and part of Burien.
48th District: Sen. Vandana Slatter, D-Bellevue, served in the House until being appointed to succeed Patty Kuderer, following her election as Washington’s insurance commissioner. Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland, who also sought the appointment, is challenging her former seatmate. The district covers communities in Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland.
5th District: No one had publicly announced their candidacy as of Sunday. Meanwhile, a Democrat will be appointed to serve in the office through the election. That process is expected to get underway this month. The district covers Issaquah, Black Diamond, Covington, and part of Snoqualmie.
House
33rd District: Rep. Edwin Obras, D-SeaTac, was appointed to fill Orwall’s House seat. Kevin Schilling, a Democrat and the mayor of Burien, is gearing up to challenge him. 
34th District: Rep. Brianna Thomas, D-West Seattle, was tapped to succeed Alvarado in the House.
41st District: Rep. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, was appointed to replace Tana Senn who resigned to join Ferguson’s administration as secretary of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families. The district includes Mercer Island, Newcastle and part of Bellevue.

But much has changed since then: not least is her official entry into the race for the Democratic nomination for Michigan governor in 2026. 
Michigan Advance Editor Jon King spoke with Benson about the memoir, how her experiences – including writing “the book on secretaries of state” and becoming the youngest woman ever to lead a U.S. law school – led her to become Michigan’s top elections officer, as well as her campaign to become governor.
What follows is a conversation that has been edited for length and clarity. Advance questions are in bold, and Benson’s responses are in regular type.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Until now, the book you’re most associated with is 2010’s “State Secretaries of State,” a literal textbook on administering elections. Your latest is a memoir centered on your time as Michigan’s secretary of state. After more than six years in that role, what would you change in how you approached that first book?
That’s a great question. I think I certainly have found one of the key components of that first book, which was about the importance of being a professional, transparent secretary of state regardless of your party affiliation, regardless of whether you’re appointed or elected. That was really the essence to me of the book, that the person can lead. That still holds true today and a lot of what I experienced has just reinforced how important it is for the chief election officers in states like ours to be secretaries of state first before anything else. Meaning they’re professional, bipartisan, making sure government works for everyone, regardless of how someone votes or who they vote for.
 
  Cover image for Jocelyn Benson’s new book, “The Purposeful Warrior: Standing Up for What’s Right When the Stakes Are High”
In the “Purposeful Warrior” you talk about some of your personal heroes like Viola Liuzzo or Robert F. Kennedy, but you also mention [former Florida Secretary of State] Katherine Harris and [former Ohio Secretary of State] Kenneth Blackwell…
Not as heroes though (laughing). To me there are people who personified the stories of challenges, of turbulence, of things gone wrong. It’s a part of the book talking about finding inspiration as we define who we are and finding power in the stories of others to figure out what we want to do to respond to uncertain moments and build a better world. But the second component of the book is seeing every challenge, every missed opportunity, every bad example of leadership, as an opportunity for growth, or to get better. A big theme of of me bringing up someone like Katherine Harris was her, in my view, misuse of her office. And interference in a presidential election is what spurred me to want to be better and to do better and to be a secretary of state who would instead work to instill faith and security in the elections process. So, we can take positive examples through history or life to embolden us on our path, but negative examples of what not to do can also provide us with an opportunity to do better and to also build resilience, and I try to take something that was broken and fix it and put it back better.
 
There was a passage in your book where you talk about channeling rage into purpose, using the lemons into lemonade metaphor. How important of a philosophy is that for you? 
It is three steps of allowing yourself to be upset and angry, not trying to dismiss it or get past it, but staying in that state for as long as you need to and then finding eventually more of an objective take on a situation that enables you to make lemonade. Respond in such a way that is not just more powerful than otherwise might’ve been had that rage not initiated, but also something that is more effective in furthering your own hopes or vision for the world. We can use these moments that enrage us to inspire us to do more than otherwise might’ve been.
 
You start “The Purposeful Warrior” recounting the night in December 2020 that armed protesters supporting President Trump’s attempts to subvert the election results, showed up at your home in Detroit. You’re there alone with your young son. You describe obviously any parent’s fear and anxiety in that moment, and then finding a way forward.
It was very similar to that three step process we were talking about. As it was happening it was scary. It was terrifying. I didn’t know what was going to happen next. The uncertainty of that moment was really unnerving. The second step was to step back and say “Wait. They’re actually not protesting me. They’re protesting the voice of the people, the will of the people, the results of this election.” As soon as I made that connection, I found the strength to say, “Not on my watch.” 
 
You write about becoming the dean of the Wayne State University Law School, and your experience there, and then later when you became the Michigan secretary of state. Were they similar experiences in the sense of coming into a hidebound institution not necessarily welcome to change? And yet you brought change to both.
When I became secretary of state I had two goals: to increase voter turnout in our state across the board and to reduce wait times in our office. Everything we do is aligned with that and it means also being willing to take things apart and build them back again in a better or different way, which we did with our branch offices to achieve those goals. Similarly, when I became the dean at Wayne State Law School, we were in the bottom tier among law schools. The goal was to get into that top 50 and to build a plan to do that based on metrics and data and best practice. Ultimately it got to 55 in recent years, which was a great success. It starts with clear goals of where we’re headed, and those goals need to be bold and crystal clear. 
 
You came into the secretary of state position with a vision for how things could be done. What’s your vision for being Michigan’s governor? Why do you want to be governor? 
I’m a mom who has an 8-year-old kid, who in 10 years is going to be making decisions about whether or not he wants to stay in Michigan and whether or not we’ve given him, as a state, a good childhood with quality education where he wants to put down his roots. I want him to see Michigan is the best place to build his future, and I want the same for every family in the state, and that means ensuring that government works well. It means investing in public education and ensuring needed funding and support actually reaches the teachers and students who need it. So, whether it’s driving down costs on things like housing and food and childcare, whether it’s investing in our education system to, in my view, make us in the top 10 instead of the bottom 10 of public school systems nationwide, or simply just making government work better and more efficiently, I’ve done all of those things in other realms, and now I’m ready to put that skill set and that track record to work for the people in Michigan

In the book you talk about the lead up to the 2018 election. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan drafted a memo basically seeking to find somebody other than Gretchen Whitmer to run for governor, specifically a male Democrat like U.S. Sen. Gary Peters. Is that something you planned to include in the book before Duggan announced an independent bid for governor?
Yes. I began writing this book in 2021 in the wake of everything we experienced in 2020, really with a goal of telling that story and telling the story of what it was like both to stand up to powerful people like the president of the United States and protect the vote of Michiganders in 2020, and a part of telling that story also involved telling about how the women of Michigan provided support for each other and got to those positions in 2020. That 2018 election was such a fascinating story about three women [Whitmer, Benson and Dana Nessel] running for office with very different paths and the headwinds we encountered in those respective paths and how we dealt with it. So, those efforts to recruit other candidates to run against Governor Whitmer were well documented efforts and I felt talking about them was really important to building the context of what we as individual candidates went through and women went through in 2018 on the path to becoming the sort of nationally recognized women of Michigan in 2020 and beyond.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_1826-1-scaled-e1732662862729-1024x821.jpg,,,2025-05-05 08:13:01.101011

The month is often observed with media, local events, proclamations, and even film screenings. The purpose is to raise awareness and educate the public about mental wellness and mental illness, to reduce the stigma around the disorder. Individuals oftentimes feel alone with their illness — when in fact, one in four are at lifetime risk.
But we need to do more. This year, we are not just raising awareness — we are turning that awareness into action!
The national theme for 2025 is: “Turn Awareness Into Action.” This is a call to go beyond the conversation and take real steps to improve mental well-being — whether that means checking in on a friend, calling your legislator, or reaching out for help yourself.
In Indiana, this movement is already underway.
Improving Hoosier mental health
Just a few years ago, our state ranked 42nd in the nation for mental health care access and outcomes. Mental Health Advocates, stakeholders, and legislators turned awareness into action in 2023 and made mental health a priority via SEA 1. SB 1 was the work product of the Indiana Behavioral Health Commission and authored by Senator Mike Crider. 
Today, thanks to targeted funding and legislative action, Indiana has climbed to 26th in the national ranking for behavioral health. This improvement has not been by chance, but rather the result of the strategic efforts of the Commission and the Indiana General Assembly. Legislators included a $50 million annual investment in behavioral health in HEA 1001-2023 as well as the building of the behavioral health infrastructure of crisis response, treatment access, and community care in SEA 1. While more is still needed, we have begun to take action.
Behavioral Health Commission wraps up two-year study with $50M ask

One of the most transformative examples is Indiana’s 988 Crisis & Suicide Lifeline. This program ensures that Hoosiers can speak to trained crisis counselors 24/7 — people who live here and understand the unique needs of our state. Mental Health America of Indiana is proud to operate one of these call centers, and we’ve seen call volume grow by 184% in the last year alone.
And behind every statistic is a story. One man called our 988 line literally with a gun to his head. Because of the assistance from the trained crisis counselor who answered, he put the gun down and agreed to safety planning. “You’ve literally saved my life,” he said. 
He was one — of many.  This is the power of action.
Every Hoosier can take action! In May 2025, this Mental Health Month, please take the first step:

Check your own mental health by taking a free, anonymous screening at https://mhascreening.org. It is totally anonymous.
Start conversations with those around you — ask, “How are you, really?”
Join the movement by advocating for continued state support of Indiana’s mental health system, including funding for 988 and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs). 
Wear green in support of Mental Health Month and join us in being “Seen in Green” this May.

Diana Gonzales Worthen, a Springdale Democrat and the Legislature's first Latina, explains her opposition to a proposed law that would “prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment” by public entities on the House floor on Thursday, February 6, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)After a nearly three-week recess, Arkansas lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday to officially adjourn the 2025 legislative session, which brand new legislators described as a busy and humbling experience. 
Rep. Brad Hall, a first-term Republican lawmaker and cattle rancher in Rudy, said House Speaker Brian Evans, R-Cabot, mentored and prepared new legislators, but it was “mindblowing” to see how much work was involved once the session got underway. 
“It was really daunting, kind of overwhelming at first … it’s like drinking from a firehose,” Hall said. “The truth is you cannot really be effective as a freshman because you don’t know what you’re doing until it’s almost over.” 
Hall was one of thirteen non-incumbents elected in November to a two-year term in the Arkansas House. Twelve were brand new state legislators while Rep. Tracy Steele, D-North Little Rock, previously served in the Arkansas Legislature from 1999 to 2013.
Steele filled the House District 72 seat left vacant by Sen. Jamie Scott, D-North Little Rock, who was elected to the Senate and was the only new member of the upper chamber. 
Hall and other members of the House’s freshman class agreed there was a big learning curve and said they were shocked by the sheer volume of legislation considered over the course of three months.
Freshman class of Arkansas lawmakers includes educators and ranchers

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed more than 1,000 bills into law and vetoed four others. Lawmakers can vote to override the governor’s vetoes with a simple majority in both chambers before the sine die adjournment of a legislative session. 
Once first-term legislators got a handle on the bill-making process, they learned the importance of relationships both inside and outside of the statehouse. 
“The biggest takeaway was just really the amount of running that you do,” Siloam Springs Republican Rep. Randy Torres said. “You must learn the what, the how and the who simultaneously and very quickly, especially if you want to be effective and run bills and do the full legislative responsibility in your first year.”
Torres said he learns by doing, so he filed his first bill a few days after being sworn into office in January. Presenting to a committee the first time was “brutal” because of tough questions from his colleagues. His proposal had to be amended, but Torres, who works in banking, said he was grateful for the experience because it helped him better understand the process. 
The legislation that Torres said he’s “very honored” and proud to have sponsored and that he feels will be most impactful is Act 147, which will allow a person’s blood type to be placed on their driver’s license or identification card. Every member of the House’s freshman class signed on as cosponsors of Torres’ bill.
After introducing his legislation, Torres said he was contacted by blood banks around the country excited about his proposal because they said it would encourage people to donate blood so they could learn their blood type.
“Then also in the rural areas of our state, blood supply is very limited and so really knowing that you’re not going to have to use your universal O negative all the time will be very helpful,” Torres said. 
Rep. Jessie McGruder, D-Marion, said he was proud to be the lead sponsor of a new law that will require an early voting location in cities that have more than 15,000 residents. The West Memphis teacher and football coach said he filed the legislation in response to a legal battle over early voting in his district last fall.
“It was embarrassing what happened in my district that the election commission couldn’t come to a resolution on the fact that they needed to have an early voting location in West Memphis, which is the biggest municipality in Crittenden County, and we had to go before the [Arkansas] Supreme Court,” McGruder said. “So I wanted to make sure that everybody has the access to early voting within my area.”

Fighting for constituents back home was very important to freshman lawmakers in the House, including Rep. Diana Gonzales Worthen, D-Springdale. The longtime educator represents the state’s first Hispanic-majority district and is the first Latina elected to the Arkansas Legislature. 
“It was a very humbling experience to be the voice of 30,000 people, so they were carried in my heart as I was reading new bills and [considering] how this would impact my community,” she said. 
House District 9 is one of the most diverse districts in the state, so Gonzales Worthen said she was especially proud of her ability to bring awareness to the benefits and consequences of immigrant-related bills.  
“Our diversity, that’s our strength, but a lot of times individuals do not see that as our strength,” she said. 
Although the Republican Party has a supermajority in the Arkansas Legislature, Gonzales Worthen said it was still important to speak against bills she didn’t agree with so people could gain a better understanding of legislation. The Springdale Democrat spoke in opposition to a number of bills, including one that would “prohibit discrimination or public entities.”
Gonzales Worthen said she was disappointed in the passage of Act 116 of 2025, which eliminates required minority recruitment and retention plans and reports from public school districts and higher education institutions. The law also repeals language in state procurement proposals that encouraged minority participation or required bidders to adopt an equal opportunity hiring program designed to increase the percentage of minority employees.

McGruder, a member of the Arkansas Legislative Black Caucus, said he cried and hugged his 10-month-old granddaughter following the law’s passage because he’s “worried about the future when people don’t have adequate representation.”
“It hurts me, because it wasn’t that minorities are not comfortable or adequate or qualified for positions, it’s that the implementation of that [law] will not allow us to even be in the room anymore,” he said. “All we need is to be in the room. Most of the time we’re overqualified for the position we’re applying for, but that bill is going to hurt minorities in the future.”
For Arkansans who are considering a run for the Arkansas Legislature, this year’s freshman class recommended reaching out to retired lawmakers for advice and visiting the Capitol when lawmakers are in session to get a better understanding of the process. They also suggested speaking with family and coworkers who would also be impacted by a decision to seek office.
Additionally, they emphasized the importance of listening to and being available to the constituents they represent and who helped them get elected.
“The lobbyists down there, they’re going to be there whether you get elected or not, so you need to listen to the people that sent you there … just pay attention to what’s going on back home, and if you make them people happy, then you’ll be OK,” Hall said. “You can’t make everybody happy all the time, but you do the best you can.”
Despite the pace of the legislative session, Hall said he’ll be back because he wants “to fight for people that can’t fight for themselves.” Torres, Gonzales Worthen and McGruder said they also intend to seek reelection for the 2026 election cycle. The filing period for candidates for the Arkansas Legislature is Nov. 3-12.

The uncertainty is nothing new for Hailey, who has been in foster care since she was 2 and became pregnant at 15. After being told abortion wasn’t an option, she was determined to be a mom in the hopes of keeping her daughter from repeating the traumatic childhood she experienced.
Hailey was taken from the home of her great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, with whom she’d been living during her pregnancy, just days before going into labor. Postpartum, Hailey was shuffled between foster homes, hospitals and group homes across Missouri and occasionally separated from her daughter for long stretches. Her pleas to live with with Spradley — who is just as eager to take her in — largely went ignored. 
Hailey’s story, which was published by The Independent last week, drew immediate outrage from across the political spectrum and from all sides of the abortion debate, highlighting systemic issues advocates and lawmakers have spent years trying to fix.
A Missouri teen spent her life in foster care. Now she’s fighting the state to keep her baby

“The workers at the Children’s Division probably meant well,” said Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, after reading The Independent’s reporting. “But if they had deliberately set out to emotionally torture three generations of a single family — Hailey, her aunt and, most important, her infant — they couldn’t have done a more thorough, efficient job of it than they did and continue to do in this case.”
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, called Hailey’s case “an amalgamation of all of the horrible things that can happen to kids when they’re in care.” 
“This poor kid has just absolutely had the state fail her over and over and over again,” said Coleman, who has long advocated for improvements to the state’s foster care system as well as increased resources for mothers and their children. “And to then be portrayed as if the child is the problem is really horrifying.”
Hailey’s story is a checklist of the issues lawmakers have been trying to fix for years, Coleman said, from the failure to place Hailey with a family member, failure to get foster benefits to that family member and the confiscation of Hailey’s Social Security benefits, among others. 
The number of children in foster care in Missouri outpaces the national average. There is also scrutiny on how long these children remain in the system. In fiscal year 2024, roughly 44% of Missouri foster children were reunited with their family within a year of entering the system. The federal government wants to see 75% reunification rates.
Hailey receives Social Security benefits because her mother died when she was a child. She is among the more than 1,200 foster kids who had those benefits seized by the state last year. Children’s Division told an advocate helping Hailey that her $400 a month in benefits was being put toward Medicaid expenses and the cost of her transportation to doctor’s appointments.
Last week, lawmakers passed an expansive child welfare bill. Included is a provision, if signed into law by the governor, that would ban the state from seizing Social Security benefits from foster kids. 
Former Republican state Rep. Hannah Kelly filed numerous pieces of legislation over the years seeking improvements to the child welfare system, including a version of the legislation that passed this year. She is calling for a “major overhaul” of Missouri’s Department of Social Services after reading Hailey’s story, blaming the systematic failures on inconsistent leadership.
“These are actual lives on the line, kids’ lives are on the line and we need a system that empowers families, both biological and foster, to do what is right for the children. Then everything else will work itself around that,” said Kelly, who left the House last year due to term limits and is now running for state Senate. 
Hailey’s experience goes to show, Coleman said, that while fixing state law is important, it’s not enough.
“The focus has to be on leadership in the department,” Coleman said. 
In March, the Department of Social Services announced the appointment of Sara Smith as the new director of Children’s Division, which investigates child abuse allegations and overseas the foster care system. Smith in a recent interview with the Kansas City Star emphasized her focus on safety. The prior administration’s public priorities centered on keeping more families together. 
Baylee Watts, a spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services, said in an email Friday said Smith wants to improve Children’s Division’s training and curriculum, as well as put “a heightened emphasis on follow through support in response to Newborn Crisis Assessments, which involve calls concerning the well-being of children under one year of age made by medical professionals.”
 Lack of resources

Wexler, with the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, called the “rampant confusion of poverty with neglect” the largest problem in child welfare. 
Hailey’s story is a prime example of this, he said, and a look at how families attempt to “cobble together a safety net” only to have it torn apart by the state, including by seizing Hailey’s Social Security payments. 
“But that’s not the only tragedy,” Wexler said. “Think of all the time, money and effort devoted to destroying this family. All of it was, in effect, stolen from finding some child in real danger who really did need to be removed from her or his home. And that’s almost always the reason for the tragic deaths that, rightly, make headlines.”
Hailey’s experience as a teen mom in foster care would have been vastly different if she lived in Illinois, said Amy Dworsky, a senior research fellow at Chapin Hall, a youth and families research and policy center in Chicago.
For youth who choose to parent, the state has a Teen Parenting Services Network to help minors in foster care, Dworsky said. Hailey may even have been assigned a doula to help support her through pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. 
While Missouri has funneled millions of dollars into pregnancy resource centers and Alternatives to Abortion programs, Spradley said Hailey was not informed of how they could have helped their family. The only program she and Hailey said they were told about was a maternity home in the St. Louis area that Hailey initially resisted going to, saying she instead wanted to stay with her great-aunt.
Hailey and Spradley were often left to fend for themselves during Hailey’s pregnancy, Spradley said, forced to reach out to nonprofits to help them secure housing and calling on friends to help prepare and furnish their apartment for a baby. Their cabinets were stocked with items from local food pantries.
 Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman enters the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2023 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Sam Lee, a longtime anti-abortion lobbyist who has assisted with legislation that supports mothers and children, said he hopes Children’s Division can better work with the family to connect to resources.
“While the living situation of the three together might be less than perfect, it’s far better than the constant displacement and separation ordered by state workers,” Lee said. “A caring family — even one living in poverty and with difficulties — is far better than no permanent family at all.”
Kelley Fong, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, said it was notable how much Hailey did to prepare for her daughter’s arrival. She enrolled in teen parenting classes and lined up transportation to prenatal appointments. Spradley and her friends helped purchase and gather baby gear. 
“It’s hard to imagine what else they could have been doing to convey to the state their commitment to caring for this baby,” Fong said. 
The state seemed determined, Fong said, to “take the baby and put the baby somewhere else, which may or may not be safer for them, instead of trying to address the underlying conditions that they’re concerned about.”
What the state didn’t seem to be paying attention to, she said, is the family member who continues expressing a desire to take Hailey in.
“There’s this person that’s willing and interested and ready to help and support mom and baby however she can, and potentially, the only challenge she’s facing is poverty, as she describes,” Fong said of Spradley. “So it’s really striking that rather than provide her with what she needs to provide a stable home for mom and baby, the response is just to separate everyone. That is extremely traumatic for the new mom, for the baby, for everyone involved.”
Spradley started fighting for Hailey to be with family immediately after Hailey’s mother died in 2011. Hailey was 4 years old at the time and living with a foster family. 
In an email to then-Gov. Jay Nixon’s office, Spradley said she was writing “with concerns about Child Protective Services” and what she saw as their unwillingness to reunite Hailey with family.
“Hailey is all we have left of my niece… and we love her very much,” Spradley wrote in the email more than 13 years ago. 
She received an automated reply.
 ‘…not going to be passed around anymore’

Soon after the Department of Social Services responded to a request for comment to The Independent last month, Hailey and Spradley got good news for the first time in weeks. 
Hailey’s case worker called Spradley to inform her the state would allow Hailey and her daughter to return to Spradley’s care, at least until a court made a more permanent placement decision. While they waited for Hailey to return to Spradley’s home in Cuba, Hailey was authorized by the state to stay temporarily with a longtime friend of Spradley’s in Illinois. 
By Friday morning, the smidge of calm that had settled over the family was again decimated when an email from the state indicated Hailey would be moved into a new foster home that wouldn’t allow her to have her daughter with her. 
The state reversed course by Friday afternoon, and Hailey and her daughter were allowed to return to Spradley’s home. Hailey remains in the custody of Children’s Division, but can live with Spradley for an “indeterminate period” until a judge decides on a permanent placement.
When Hailey heard the news, she burst into a huge smile and started clapping, Spradley said. Earlier that day Hailey said she’d been so nervous she had picked a spot on her skin until it bled.
Now her voice was bright. Hailey said that she felt “great.”
“I know that we’re not going to be passed around anymore,” she told The Independent.
Spradley said despite the good news, their journey and her mission isn’t over. 
“We still want to protect other kids,” Spradley said. “We don’t want to just stop with Hailey. We want other kids who don’t have the support that Hailey has, we want to speak for them, too.” 
Hailey can exhale and focus on being a mother.

Last week, Spradley reached out to Coleman, who has since been working with the family to get answers in a case she described as “a litany of the scale of the human cost when these things are so badly handled.” 
Coleman encourages anyone facing similar struggles to reach out to their state lawmakers. 
 She believes in Hailey’s future as a successful adult because of her determination to advocate for herself and for her daughter “in the face of all this tragedy.”  
“She’s going to be able to have a happy life,” Coleman said. “I’m hopeful for her, but that’s in spite of, not because of, any of the care that she’s received.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8677-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-05 07:00:52.916404
,New Jersey Monitor,2025-05-05 10:54:50+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Assembly lawmakers to weigh bills aimed at easing impact of electricity prices,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/05/assembly-lawmakers-to-weigh-bills-aimed-at-easing-impact-of-electricity-prices/,The Assembly's utilities committee will consider a spate of bills Monday meant to defray the impact of surging power prices.,"Lawmakers are moving to defray the impact of surging electricity costs expected to raise monthly bills by about 20% beginning this June. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)An Assembly panel on Monday will consider a spate of bills meant to ease the impact of electricity prices set to surge in June.
Among the bills are measures that would alter how state regulators set profit margins for utilities, create training requirements for those regulators, and require the Board of Public Utilities to study the impact data centers have on electricity prices.
“We’re not going to find a one-fix silver bullet that’s going to solve the entire issue. It’s going to need to be piecemeal,” said Assemblyman Avi Schnall (D-Ocean), a sponsor of one of the bills. We’re going to have to find a little bit here and a little bit there and a little bit over there.”
The hearing comes about a month before electricity prices are set to surge upward by roughly 20% as a result of price-setting auctions held in July and February. The increase could add approximately $25 to an average customer’s monthly bill.
Schnall’s bill would require the Board of Public Utilities to use a stricter standard when setting utilities’ return on equity rates — the rate at which they are allowed to profit on infrastructure and other investments.
At present, most New Jersey utilities’ return on equity rates hovers around 9.6%. Utility providers are not permitted to profit off the sale of electricity itself — they sell it to customers at cost — but they can recoup costs for other investments, including capital costs, that are typically passed directly along to consumers.
The bill would require the BPU to approve the “lowest reasonable” return on equity, rather than the fair and reasonable standard used under existing regulations. It’s not clear how much the change would affect utility bills (parts of the measure would take effect months after being signed into law).
“More money going back to customers is more money going back to customers,” Schnall said.
Other bills in the package would require utilities to return excess profits to ratepayers as a direct credit to future bills or through direct payments to customers who have unpaid bills or are enrolled in utility assistance programs.
The BPU also sets revenue requirements for New Jersey utilities.
Republican officials have blamed Gov. Phil Murphy’s ambitious clean energy goals — and his focus on offshore wind projects that are now stalled under the Trump administration — for growing rates.
Assemblyman Christian Barranco (R-Morris), an electrician by trade, panned most of the bills on the committee’s Monday agenda, warning measures to limit utilities’ profitability would limit their ability to attract the investment needed to upgrade their infrastructure. Barranco’s comments echo concerns utility operators voiced at a legislative hearing on electricity prices in late April.
He noted Jersey Central Power and Light had recently pared down a $930.5 million infrastructure investment plan by nearly 80% in a bid to keep rates down.
“That’s what’s going to be affected, that sort of investment — that sort of keeping up with the reliability of the infrastructure that we’d like to see in a first-world country like ours,” Barranco said.
He praised a separate bill that would appropriate $5 million for the BPU to study the feasibility of small modular nuclear reactors statewide.
One Republican member expressed cautious support for the bill package but warned that, while the bills could help control the cost of electricity in the long run, they would do little to relieve the short-term impact of surging prices.
“I think it’s a package that is not going to help ratepayers anytime soon,” said Assemblyman Alex Sauickie (R-Ocean).
He said Republican proposals to lower or suspend the societal benefits charge — a 3% surcharge on all New Jersey electricity bills — or exempt utility services from the state’s sales tax would deliver more immediate relief.
Democrats have said that PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia, is to blame for the rate spikes because the interconnector has been slow to add some renewable projects to its grid.
Utility prices may become an even more pressing concern for low-income New Jerseyans in the next federal fiscal year. President Donald Trump has proposed zeroing out just over $4 billion in funding for a low-income home energy assistance program.
“The Budget proposes to end this program and to instead support low-income individuals through energy dominance, lower prices, and an America First economic platform,” the Trump administration said in a budget document released Friday.
New Jersey received nearly $133 million in awards under the program, which is meant to provide heating and cooling assistance to households making no more than 60% of the state’s median income. That cutoff was $92,108 for a four-person household in the current federal fiscal year.
New Jersey Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Jacquelyn Suárez told state Senate lawmakers last week that she expected New Jersey to receive federal funds for the program approved for the current federal fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30, but her department had not been told that the program would not be funded in the following federal fiscal year.

Thomas/Getty Images).There are two weeks remaining in the 2025 legislative session. While there will be a flurry of last-minute maneuvering, lawmakers have had ample time to address some long-standing needs for Missouri and its residents.
How would you evaluate what they have accomplished?
We may have different lists with different priorities, but there are surely some commonalities among them.
Do the current proposed budgets coming from the governor, House and Senate provide adequate funding for public education? A conference committee will convene this week to debate and hash out the final details of the budget.
But when it comes to providing the needed funding for K-12 education, the negotiations between what the governor proposed and that of the House and Senate portend to be tough.
The outcome will determine how much Missouri’s children in public schools stand to be short-changed.
What about adequate funding for child care, which is a major problem in Missouri? The governor and Senate have included money in their proposals. The House has not.
There are also differences in the proposed funding from all three branches for needed funding for repairs and maintenance at the state’s colleges and universities.
The same is true for the state employee pay plan. The governor and Senate are proposing one level of funding and the House another.
In addition to those areas, the conference committee will have to decide whether they are going to keep nearly a half-billion dollars of earmarks, taxpayers dollars to be spent for special projects across the state.
Have you been keeping up with the budget proposals for education and child care?
What about the substantial dollars being proposed for special projects?
Is there a special earmark(s) included to address some pressing need in your city or community?
These are questions that we should be asking the senators and representatives we have sent to Jefferson City to fight for our needs, priorities and interests.
We only have a few days left to make our wishes known.
What about the non-budgetary issues that are so critical to the wellbeing and quality of life of Missourians?
While the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the law requiring paid sick leave for employees, which took effect May 1, there is a bill still in the Senate awaiting passage that would repeal paid sick leave and change minimum wage increase that took effect in January.
Proposition A, which increases the minimum wage and requires paid sick leave, passed by 58% of Missouri voters. Yet, the legislature insists on trying to repeal it.
The abortion issue that we thought was settled with the passage of Amendment 3 by 52% of voters is once again consuming a lot of legislative time and effort. A proposed constitutional amendment passed out of a Senate committee that will once again ban abortions. The amendment can be placed on the ballot in 2026 or sooner if the governor decides to do so.
Missouri lawmakers still seem determined to disregard and thwart the will of the majority of Missourians.
Why?
Who and what are they working for in Jefferson City?
What is their end game?
If lawmakers are consumed with trying to undo the will of the people, how much time are they spending anticipating and trying to find solutions to other major problems that the state and a large number of Missourians face now and long-term?
Missouri has a severe shortage of affordable housing and a homelessness problem. You would think that would be at the top of every legislative session until solutions are found. Instead, a bill making it more difficult for low-income renters to secure housing seems poised to head to the governor’s desk.
Is there any planning taking place about how the state will support farmers and other businesses should catastrophic and costly tariffs be put in place?
What happens if there are detrimental cuts to Medicaid, Social Security and Medicare?
Tens of thousands of Missourians stand to be negatively and severely affected.
Are our state senators and representatives working with our members of Congress trying to mount efforts to minimize the negative and costly effects of tariffs and drastic cuts in other areas on our state and fellow Missourians?
Are there even efforts to communicate how traumatic those impending tariffs and cuts will be?
Lawmakers are left to focus on whatever they desire, or the causes of those who have their ear. Are you among those who have their ear, making your needs and expectations known?
Getting needed policies and laws over the finish line is not a sprint but a marathon.
They require gaining understanding and training on how to apply effective and sustained engagement with your lawmakers. Focusing a couple of weeks or months before an election is simply not sufficient to win the policy race.
The state budget must be finalized by Friday. Everything else must be completed before the legislature adjourns for the year at 6 p.m. on May 16.
There is still time to make your voice heard.
Are you pleased with how they have addressed the needs of your family, your community, your city?

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Ahead of action this week on Congressional legislation that could provide the first hard details on proposed cuts to Medicaid, Wisconsin lawmakers are urging constituents to push back against cutting health care coverage.
“One of the most powerful things we can do right now is to elevate stories and talk about how compelling a need there is for robust investment in the Medicaid program,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin told a group of Medicaid recipients at a roundtable discussion in Madison on Friday.
Republicans in Congress are trying to extend federal tax cuts enacted in 2017, during President Donald Trump’s first term. Unless renewed, the 2017 tax cuts will expire at the end of 2025.
Congressional Republicans want to offset $4.5 trillion that extending the 2017 tax cuts will add to the federal deficit over 10 years. Based on their original blueprint, Medicaid has been in the spotlight as a likely target, and this week GOP leaders in the U.S. House are expected to release their first concrete proposals.
Medicaid covers about 1.3 million Wisconsin residents — roughly one in five people in the state, according to the state Department of Health Services (DHS). Those include nearly 900,000 low-income people who have primary health care and hospital services though BadgerCare Plus.
More than 260,000 people who are elderly, blind, or have other disabilities have coverage through Medicaid, including for long-term care in nursing homes or in their own homes or the community. And another 244,000 Wisconsinites have Medicaid coverage through a variety of other special programs.
Extending the 2017 tax cuts will benefit the richest 1% of the population most, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) found.
“In order to give tax breaks for the rich, what do they want to cut? Medicaid. It’s one of the biggest targets,” Baldwin, a Democrat, told participants in the Madison roundtable. “So from the folks who are most vulnerable, to transfer money to those who are billionaires and millionaires and multi-millionaires — it is criminal in my mind. It’s immoral.”
Baldwin’s event was one of two held Friday to highlight Medicaid’s importance in Wisconsin. In Eau Claire, state Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) convened a discussion that included providers and Medicaid recipients.
Emerson’s discussion was joined via Zoom by Chiquita Brooks-LaSure administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under former President Joe Biden
“These attacks on the Medicaid program can be devastating if they go through,” Brooks-LaSure told the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone interview. “Not just for the millions of low-income people who need help, not just for the millions of middle-class families who depend on Medicaid — particularly for nursing home care, care in the home to keep you out of the nursing home, and children with special needs, whether it be autism services, whether it be developmental disabilities or physical disabilities.”
The existence of Medicaid helps the overall health care economy in the long run, Brooks-LaSure said.
Under federal law, hospitals must ensure that patients who show up in their emergency rooms are stable before they leave. But if a person’s care isn’t covered, “the entire health care system pays for that.”
Medicaid recipients who met with Baldwin described their anxiety over the prospect of losing coverage.
For Laurel Burns, who was born with no arms, Medicaid has enabled her to have health care for herself and for her two sons, now teens, whom she’s raised as a single mother after their father left.
“Being disabled has been a struggle my whole life. It’s like every twist and turn is up a steep hill,” Burns told Baldwin. Medicaid support, however, has enabled her to have health care at home, including needed assistance with grocery shopping and housekeeping.
She has been able to get a college degree and landed a part-time job working for an insurance agent.
“I would love to work full time, but the job market and being disabled is really difficult to navigate,” Burns said. “With all these cuts and threats to the program, it’s really scary for somebody like me who doesn’t have a large family.”
Megan Hufton, the single mother of two teenage boys who have autism and don’t speak, said that in addition to the support Medicaid has provided her sons as part of the program’s disability services, schools get Medicaid support to help pay for services such as occupational therapy. “I’m very nervous about the future,” Hufton said.
Baldwin’s discussion was held at Common Threads, a Medicaid-funded agency in Madison that provides mental health, rehab and alternative education services.
Liv Lacayo, who works with Common Threads clients and their families, said Medicaid enables them to get routine care so they don’t have to use emergency services as they might have to otherwise.
Without Medicaid, she said, she worries that families would be struggling for support.
Brett Maki, who must use a motorized wheelchair to get around, said Medicaid has made it possible for him to live independently, getting daily help with cooking, cleaning and laundry — “all of the basic necessities that I would need to live my life to the fullest.”
Without that, “I don’t even want to think about what that means,” he said.

(Photo by Phil Ashley/Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY – Tens of thousands of more Oklahomans would be able to afford housing if the state’s minimum wage were raised to $15 an hour, according to a new report.
Up to 40,000 households would no longer pay 30% or more on rent with the increased minimum wage, according to the report issued by Scioto Analysis, which has offices around the country and provides analysis of issues to public policymakers.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development defines anyone who is spending more than 30% of their income on housing as “housing cost burdened,” which is high, said Rob Moore, principal with Scioto Analysis. 
“If you are spending over 50% of your income on housing, you are considered very housing cost burdened,” Moore said.
If the minimum wage was increased, up to 32,000 Oklahoma households would no longer spend more than half of their income on rent, according to the report.
Lower-income Oklahomans spend a larger proportion of their income on housing, according to the report.
The report was commissioned by This Land Research and Communications, a project of the Oklahoma Donor Alliance. The Donor Alliance is a nonprofit that funds strategic research projects.
The groups are not affiliated with Raise the Wage Oklahoma, which collected enough signatures to get a state question seeking to increase the minimum wage on the June 16, 2026 ballot.
If approved by voters, State Question 832 would gradually increase the $7.25 an hour minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2029. Additional increases would be tied to the cost of living measured by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index.
The report said increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would result in as many as 550 fewer Oklahomans experiencing homelessness. Chronic homelessness would drop by 150 people a year, according to the report.
Oklahoma has seen a dramatic increase in homelessness, doubling in the past three years, according to the report.
More than 64% of chronically homeless Oklahomans live in Tulsa or Oklahoma City, according to the report.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Despite a more narrow intent in the Idaho Legislature, two child welfare attorneys worry that broad language in Senate Bill 1181 could have far-reaching effects in legal cases for parental rights termination, which some attorneys call the “civil death penalty.”
There are two ways parental rights termination cases can be brought: By the state — often initiated by a state health department, or by a private party, such as one parent wanting to end the rights of another parent. 
The law could make Idaho one of only four states in the U.S. that don’t guarantee a right to counsel in state-initiated parental rights termination cases, according to the National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel.
“We’ve not really seen a state go backwards on this before Idaho,” John Pollock, an attorney and coordinator with the coalition, told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.
But Idaho lawmakers who sponsored the bill say they believe the bill won’t work that way.
Instead, the lawmakers say the law’s impact will be more narrow: It would just revoke the automatic right to counsel in parental right termination cases brought by private parties, as opposed to the state. 
And they say the new law outlines a process for the court to grant counsel rights to certain parents under what is called a legal indigency test, which is commonly used to appoint public defense attorneys in criminal cases.
Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, cosponsored the bill in the House. He says the bill was widely negotiated and narrowly crafted.
“We were careful to make sure that we said that that counsel can still be provided if constitutionally required. And that’s how several states do it right now,” Manwaring told the Sun in an interview.

 How public defense rights work in parental rights termination cases. And how this new Idaho law changes it.

The law takes effect July 1. 
The new law makes two changes to how public defenders work on parental rights termination cases:

The bill amends an Idaho law around parental rights termination, to specify counsel shall be provided “only if such representation is constitutionally required.” That is in addition to existing language in the law that allows the right to legal counsel in those cases, if requested “and the parent or guardian is financially unable to employ counsel.” 
The bill also amends an Idaho law about broader right to legal counsel that guarantees the right to an attorney in cases brought under Idaho’s Child Protective Act. The new bill adds language “excluding actions brought exclusively under” Idaho’s parental rights termination law, found in Idaho Code Title 16 Chapter 20. 

Those two changes are what worries Mary Shea, an Idaho child welfare attorney and previous Democratic candidate for the Idaho Legislature in Pocatello.
First, there’s no constitutional requirement for counsel in parental rights termination cases, she said. The U.S. Constitution’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies in criminal cases, not civil cases — like parental right termination cases.
In a 1981 ruling, the United States Supreme Court clarified that indigent parents didn’t have a constitutional right to counsel in parental rights termination cases.

In that ruling, the court said it “would not force states to provide counsel for termination of parental rights cases except on a ‘case-by-case basis,’” Shea said. “And nobody really knows what that means. But basically that the court said if the case was sufficiently complex or complicated, that a parent’s parental due process rights would be violated. Only in the most difficult cases where without an attorney, it just is not a fair process, would counsel be required.”
In Idaho, attorneys will now have to go before judges in every parental rights termination case to make the case for right to counsel, Shea said.
The new law’s second change also effectively eliminates the right to a state-appointed public defender in all parental rights cases, she said.
“I personally believe that there should be a right to counsel in every termination of parental rights cases — because the rights at stake are so important,” Shea said.

 Bill meant to require legal indigency test in private parental rights termination cases

Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, the bill’s original cosponsor, said when he was a prosecutor, judges would ask defendants requesting a public defender about their financial circumstances. If they met the criteria, then an attorney was appointed. 
That’s the sort of vetting process he sought to bring in privately initiated parental rights termination cases through his bill.
Asked if he agreed with the concern the bill would revoke all right to counsel in these cases, Lakey said “we can see how it goes, but I don’t think so.”
In 2024, when the state took over the management of the public defense system from Idaho counties, Manwaring said officials didn’t expect they’d be providing legal counsel in private parental termination cases. 
He said there’s always been an indigency test in these cases, but Manwaring didn’t know if it was happening. 
“I think the reason it is is because a lot of times in these cases, the majority of them probably are indigent,” he said. 
In privately initiated termination cases, Manwaring said lawmakers believe counsel shouldn’t be automatically provided. By instead allowing a judge to determine if counsel should be provided, he argued the state can analyze the scope of how many private cases get counsel appointments.
“Because these are taxpayer funds,” Manwaring said. “This is a state agency. We want to be careful that we’re not overstepping the bounds of what the state should be paying for.”

Idaho State Public Defender Office spokesperson Patrick Orr said the office believes its public defenders should not be representing parents in privately brought cases. If a court appoints legal counsel in a privately initiated case, he said “it will be up to others to decide how to find, assign, and pay attorneys to represent clients in private termination cases.”
“Our office, which provides indigent criminal defense representation and representation for parents in Child Protective Act cases where the state seeks to interfere with the parent-child relationship, should not be providing legal representation in disputes between private parties,” Orr told the Sun in an email.
 Parents representing themselves face difficult prospect, attorney says

Parents would have a tough time representing themselves, Shea said.

“If you don’t understand the rules of civil procedure or the rules of evidence, if you don’t know how to get your questions about the other side’s case answered in the discovery process of litigation, and if you don’t know how to argue your case to a judge — it would be very difficult for a parent to go against an attorney on the other side and succeed,” she said. 
But even if lawmakers had fixed the bill to just end the right to counsel in privately brought parental termination cases, Pollock said his legal advocacy group would still have an issue with the bill. 
Several courts have struck down that distinction to only remove the right to counsel only in privately initiated cases, ruling those moves violate equal protection, he said. 
 Bill attempts to clarify public defense roles, amid rocky new system

The bill is an attempt to clarify public defender roles months into Idaho’s troubled switch from county-level public defenders to a state-managed public defense office. 
In October 2024, Idaho officially transferred public defense from Idaho’s 44 counties into the new statewide agency, called the Office of the State Public Defender.
During that transition, some public defenders quit, citing new pay cuts. 
The ACLU of Idaho, which sued the state in 2015 alleging Idaho’s public defense system violated low-income people’s constitutional right to counsel, in January asked the Idaho Supreme Court to intervene in the new public defense system. The organization alleged “countless indigent defendants have appeared in courts” across Idaho without representation from the State Public Defender’s Office, the Sun previously reported.

Manwaring said the bill was meant to be a first step to smooth out kinks in the transition. And he expects more tweaks in the years ahead. 
“We know we’re going to continue to look at this carefully and make adjustments going forward that need to happen, including in this lane of termination of parental rights cases,” Manwaring said. “If we don’t have this right, we’re going to make sure we’re going to continue to review this and make those amendments going forward if we need to.”
In March, lawmakers introduced the bill. Within two weeks, it passed both chambers of the Legislature — one day before this year’s legislative session ended.
In the House’s committee hearing on the bill, Shea testified about her concern that the bill would end all right to counsel in parental termination cases.
Then the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee slated the bill for amendments. But in the final days of the Legislature, the House passed the bill without amendments. 
Asked why the bill wasn’t amended, Manwaring said lawmakers were able to address concerns among committee members about the bill in the meantime.
Less than two weeks after it passed the House and Senate, Gov. Brad Little signed it into law. The governor’s office could not be immediately reached for comment.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Republican lawmakers are introducing bills to review every statewide administrative rule and impose new limits on the rulemaking process, saying there are too many regulations currently and they put operational obstacles and financial burdens on businesses.
GOP Lawmakers have raised objections to agencies’ administrative rulemaking process — and the power of the executive branch — for many years and have taken action to exert more control over the process and to limit the authority of state agencies and the governor. The REINS Act, signed into law by former Gov. Scott Walker in 2017, for example, required lawmakers’ approval for regulations that might cost more than $10 million over a two-year period.
“A lot of what’s been done in the past has looked at when you’re implementing new rules — what is the process? Who is writing the rules?” Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee), who introduced the bill that became 2017 Wisconsin Act 57, said at a press conference last week.
“What [the] REINS Act is not able to do is go back and reset it all,” Neylon added. “We’re looking at the stack of rules that have accumulated over the years that are piling up… We need a reset.”
One of four GOP bills would require agencies to make cuts to offset the cost associated with new regulations. 
Under the bill, coauthored by Rep. Nate Gustafson (R-Fox Crossing) and Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin), agencies with a new rule proposal would have to stop work on the process until they’ve figured out how to eliminate the cost of a new regulation, or, alternatively, until a different rule reduces the costs to businesses, local governmental units and individuals over any two-year period.
Gustafson calls it a “net zero” rule process. “So if there’s an existing regulation or rule output that is of equal cost or greater, you’re going to have to cut that rule if you want to implement a new one.”
Another of the four bills — coauthored by Neylon and Sen. Steve Nass — would put an expiration date on every administrative rule seven years after implementation. Currently, administrative rules are in effect indefinitely unless repealed, amended by the agency or suspended by the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR).
JCRAR is a 10-member committee responsible for reviewing proposed administrative rules to ensure they align with state law. Lawmakers on the committee have the ability to approve, suspend, or request modifications to proposed rules.
Under the new measure, the year before a rule expires an agency would need to send notice to JCRAR about its intention to readopt the rule. If there is no objection by a lawmaker on the committee, then the rule would be considered readopted, but if there is an objection, then the rule would expire unless the agency goes through the rulemaking process again.
Neylon said the point is to create a more modern process and do away with “outdated or duplicative rules, creating unnecessary burdens on businesses.” 
Another bill — coauthored by Sen. Rob Hutton and Reps. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown) and Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) — would limit scope statements, the first step in the rulemaking process, so they could only be used for one proposed rule and would set a six month expiration date when a scope statement can be used for an emergency rule.
Currently, people can challenge the validity of an administrative rule in court. The final bill — coauthored by Rep. Ron Tusler (R-Harrison) and Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) — would award people who challenge a rule attorney fees and costs if a court declares a rule invalid. 
The bill package is based on a report from the right-wing Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL), which also launched a webpage about the effort to cut “red tape” on Wednesday.
WILL states in the report that Wisconsin is the 13th most regulated state in the country and lays out proposals similar to the new GOP bills. WILL said the actions would build off steps taken in other states, including Idaho, Ohio, Nebraska and Oklahoma, to reduce regulations.
Neylon said WILL provided research and worked with lawmakers’ offices on the legislation. But, he added, “these are issues that we’ve all worked on for a lot of years, issues that we care deeply about. This is our initiative… and nobody else’s.”
Economist on the potential flaws 
Economist Michael Rosen told the Examiner that the bills come out of Republicans’ “national playbook,” and that the research from WILL is based on the idea that “any regulation impedes economic growth.”
“It has been a cornerstone of Republican policy since the election of Ronald Reagan to deregulate, get rid of regulation, and [to insist] that getting rid of regulation promotes economic growth,” Rosen said. He calls that theory “nonsense.” 
Rosen points out that some of the most heavily regulated states — including California and New York — are also the most prosperous. He noted that the majority of the states cited in WILL’ s research are those with Republican-dominated government.
“All regulations really are the rules under which the market operates,” Rosen said, adding, “there have to be rules that govern the behavior of the buyers and sellers. That’s what regulation is. It’s very simple, and what they’re arguing is to get rid of them.”
Rosen challenges broad assertions in WILL’s research, including WILL’s finding that a 36% cut to regulations across the board in Wisconsin could grow the economy by 1 percentage point annually.
That analysis fails to take into account “negative externalities,” Rosen says — actions by companies that impose a cost on people who are not directly involved. He pointed to environmental regulations as an example of how these costs are paid by the public. 
“In economic terms, companies that pollute… part of the cost of production should be disposing of the waste that a company produces…. If there aren’t any rules, the cheapest way to dispose of your waste is to release it into the atmosphere or release it into the rivers and streams,” Rosen said. “That’s what we had in this country at the beginning of the 20th century, when we didn’t have any environmental regulations, and rivers, like the Milwaukee River, and streams and lakes were polluted by manufacturers because that was the cheapest way for them to dispose of their waste.”
Rosen said that some might argue that rules meant to protect the environment impede growth because they impose an additional cost on a company, however, he said that rules can ensure they aren’t passing on that cost to the public. 
Since passage in 2017, the REINS Act has posed an obstacle to proposed environmental protection rules in Wisconsin.
Without the regulations, Rosen said, people would have “no assurance” about the products they buy — “whether it’s a can of tuna fish, whether it’s an automobile, whether it’s a ride on an airplane.” 
“Is it impeding economic growth that we have regulations on air travel? No, because if we didn’t have the regulation of the airline industry, we would have far more accidents and many fewer people would want to travel on airplanes,” Rosen said. “These are all regulations that we take for granted,” but assure people they can trust the products and services they purchase, “and we won’t crash and die.” 
A better way to address onerous or outdated rules, Rosen said, is to take them up one at a time, rather than through the sweeping anti-regulatory bill package Wisconsin Republicans are proposing. 
“Are there some regulations that maybe are antiquated? I’m not going to sit here and tell you there might not be,” Rosen said. “But rather than pass sweeping legislation, which is ideologically driven and could have catastrophic consequences, people should raise the particular regulation.”
What’s next for the bills
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said that she is excited for the bills to go through the Assembly Government Operations, Accountability and Transparency (GOAT) committee, which she chairs. The committee was created this session, inspired by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency project, which has sought to remake the federal government by unilaterally firing employees and making deep cuts to federal agencies. 
“Excessive regulations have serious economic consequences. They slow economic growth. They increase costs for businesses and consumers and they stifle innovation, all while the compliance costs put the greatest burden on our small businesses and working families,” Nedweski said. 
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said the bills are another action from the “tired Republican playbook” and compared them to the actions being taken by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. 
“These bills are an attempt at a power grab, akin to what we are seeing from the Trump-Musk administration,” Hesselbein said. “The bills would, among other things, undermine the fundamental democratic principle of separation of powers. They are unnecessary, anti-democratic, and wholly wrong for Wisconsin.”
Republicans in the Senate and Assembly, who hold majorities, could pass the bills without support from Democratic lawmakers, however, they would need Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ sign-off to become law. Neylon conceded that it’s unlikely Evers will support them. 
“Unfortunately Gov. Evers makes a lot of mistakes,” Neylon said. “He’s showing to be a failure as a governor, and I’m not optimistic he’ll make the right decision here, but I think that we’re doing the best we can to try to reform the regulatory process, and we think that it’s time for a reset.” 
Evers’ office hasn’t responded to a request for comment.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Ryan Walters made a series of big gambles that paid off for him in spades.
Somehow over the course of the past few weeks, Oklahoma’s state superintendent bet that he could outplay his constituents, outwit Gov. Kevin Stitt’s three new education board appointees, and outlast the Republican-led Legislature that has long been afraid to stand up to him.
It all culminated last week in Walters getting exactly what he wanted: a set of controversial social studies standards, quietly altered at the last minute, limping their way across the finish line. They took effect by default with no public legislative vote.
If it sounds like a lame ending to the reality TV program “Survivor,” you’d be spot on. Walters walked away with the $1 million prize while his constituents, who wanted to exercise their right to engage in the government process, were effectively eliminated after the first round.
Backdoor maneuvering and unsympathetic shoulder-shrugging by Republicans meant the public couldn’t play their immunity idol to protect themselves from round-upon-round of incompetence. They watched as the majority of their supposed allies — the Republicans they elected — turned their backs on them and didn’t have the spine to protect them.
While it culminated in a big win for Walters, who proved he has the chops to outplay, outwit, outlast us all, this isn’t a game. Public transparency and our children are the biggest losers of this latest debacle. 
Over the course of a month, we all watched from the sidelines as the public feedback was ignored and standards that weren’t properly vetted were ramrodded through the legislative process. It will be six years before they’re due to be redrafted again.
I found myself aggravated by all the legislative shoulder-shrugging.
The Legislature’s inaction sent a clear signal that the majority of Oklahoma lawmakers were OK with the fact that Walters didn’t share the revised version of standards publicly online until weeks after they were voted on by a state governing board.
It signaled that they didn’t care that Walters insisted that what is contained in the standards, which belong to us all, is his decision alone.
It indicated that they ignored revelations that the education governing board members hadn’t read the revised standards before voting on them, and that lawmakers felt it acceptable that Walters only shared the final draft with his oversight board less than a day before the scheduled vote. They didn’t care about accusations from the board that Walters didn’t tell them that he made dozens of secret changes outside public scrutiny. 
And it showed that they were willing to ignore calls from within their own party and their constituents to return them to the board for further review.
So, here’s a gold star for every Republican who managed to set the public transparency bar to a new low.
The fact that Walters felt the need to make changes in secret coupled with the fact that many Republican legislators only felt comfortable discussing them behind closed doors raises concerns.
In a state that is struggling to set its students up for academic success, why are we not having these discussions publicly and requiring votes be taken?
The social studies standards process was a complete mess, and lawmakers should be doing some soul-searching about how to make the adoption of academic standards more transparent moving forward.
Because these should not be drafted or debated in dark, smoke-filled rooms. We should welcome and require public discussion on them. Feedback and debate is what is going to make our society and schools stronger.
It’s a bit of a headscratcher that we don’t have a law requiring that any revisions of academic standards be posted publicly online 72 business hours ahead of a public vote. I also don’t understand why we wouldn’t want any changes to be clearly denoted.
Both things seem like simple solutions to solve many of the transparency issues that plagued this process.
Because public engagement and transparency are a cornerstone of good governing. Anything else breeds suspicion and is bad for democracy.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.
In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

Kennedy Jr. testifies in January at his Senate confirmation hearing for his nomination to be secretary of Health and Human Services. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Recently, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., made some of his most callous remarks to date about the autistic community. This is particularly offensive because April was Autism Acceptance Month.
Among other things, he claimed that autistic people like me will “never pay taxes,” never hold jobs, never go on dates — comments that boil down to one message: That we are tragedies to be pitied, in desperate need of a “cure.” He also repeated the thoroughly debunked claim that autism is caused by toxins.
Others have already addressed the scientific reality: Study after study has shown there is no evidence to support these assertions. The so-called “experts” backing them are widely discredited.

And many of us will continue to point out the truth supported by decades of research: The rise in autism diagnoses stems from a better understanding of what autism looks like and improved diagnostic standards — just as has occurred with many other conditions as medicine has advanced over the centuries.
But what I want to speak to, as an autistic person, is how this rhetoric affects us.
I am autistic, and I am proud of it. My neurodiversity is not a tragedy — it is an integral part of who I am and the path I’ve taken in life.
I’m a Truman Scholar, an honors graduate of the University of Puerto Rico, where I served in student government, and a graduate of the University of Maine School of Law. Over the past decade, I’ve worked as a policy advocate and lobbyist, led a national disability justice project and directed policy for another major organization. My writing has been published in academic journals and books. Today, I serve as Maryland’s coordinator of State Autism Strategy, a position I’ve proudly held since 2023.
And, to address one of Secretary Kennedy’s claims directly: I pay taxes every year.
In my 36 years, I’ve had the privilege of meeting incredible autistic people across Maryland and the country — people who give their hearts to their communities, build fulfilling careers, and live lives of purpose and pride. Our lives are not tragedies. We don’t need a cure — we need acceptance.
Secretary Kennedy’s comments are harmful. They reinforce stigma, discourage inclusion, and send the wrong message to every parent of a newly diagnosed child. That message isn’t just false—it’s damaging to all of us.
In contrast, here in Maryland, we believe that people with disabilities deserve to thrive in their chosen communities and live full, self-determined lives. That’s why on April 23, we released a statewide strategic plan to address autism-related needs — one grounded in the values of acceptance, inclusion, and independence.
This month, the first bill Gov. Wes Moore signed following this legislation session was the Model Employer Act, improving access to state employment for people with disabilities, including autism.  I am proud to live and work in a state that celebrates all of who I am, including being autistic.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2196597652-1024x675.jpg,,,2025-05-05 07:00:52.916404

The family of a man killed in a shootout with a Thermopolis police officer who busted into his home over a misdemeanor sued in federal court.
The post Wrongful death suit challenges Thermopolis cop for illegally entering home appeared first on WyoFile .","The first police killing in the town of Thermopolis’ history started with an investigation into methamphetamine use by workers at a local McDonald’s.
It ended with a bloody, close-range shootout inside a trailer home after an officer shouldered his way inside without a warrant. The officer, Sgt. Michael Mascorro, suffered a gunshot wound that came harrowingly close to killing him. While bleeding profusely, Mascorro shot and killed McDonald’s employee Buck Laramore.
Though Laramore shot first, wounding Mascorro while the officer’s gun was still in his holster, his mother and widow sued the Thermopolis Police Department in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming this week. They allege Mascorro had no grounds to enter the trailer and that Laramore was defending himself against a police officer who was, in essence, a lawless intruder into his home. 
“This was a completely avoidable incident,” Sweetwater County District Attorney Dan Erramouspe wrote at the time, according to the Thermopolis Independent Record. The prosecutor, who conducted a criminal review of the shooting and is not involved in the civil lawsuit, ruled Mascorro entered Laramore’s home illegally. Town officials later rejected that conclusion. 
In their lawsuit, Laramore’s relatives cite self-defense laws like Wyoming’s controversial “stand your ground” statute and the castle doctrine, both of which generally allow homeowners to protect themselves with deadly force from an intruder. While Erramouspe found Mascorro had entered the home illegally, the prosecutor also found he was justified in shooting back at Laramore. The state’s castle doctrine carries an exception for when the intruder in one’s home is a police officer, and when the shooting started, Mascorro was defending himself, the prosecutor wrote. 
The family’s lawyers disagree. “It was Mascorro’s own reckless and deliberate conduct that unreasonably created his use of force,” they wrote in the complaint. 
Neither lawyers for the plaintiffs nor Thermopolis Police Chief Pat Cornwall responded to messages from WyoFile this week seeking comment on the case. 
Investigation
The violence on April 28, 2023 can be traced back to two days earlier, when a different Thermopolis police officer arrested a different McDonald’s employee who had an outstanding warrant. When the officer helped that employee out of her patrol car at the jail, she found a glass pipe on the car seat, according to a report on the shooting compiled by Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation agents. The employee had smoked meth from the pipe that morning with one of his McDonald’s colleagues, he told the officer. 
Thermopolis police officers decided to contact the area health inspector, Jamie George, for a combined investigation into meth use among the McDonald’s employees. That investigation led Mascorro and a Hot Springs County sheriff’s deputy with a drug dog to the restaurant on April 28 — where Laramore had just started his work shift. 
Mascorro found Laramore suspicious. He saw Laramore leave the men’s room, and soon afterward the drug dog detected meth hidden in containers in the bathroom’s baby changing station, according to the DCI investigation. The officer asked Laramore to take a drug test, which the McDonald’s worker declined to do. When Mascorro asked for his name, Laramore misspelled it by one letter. He also said his birth year was 1988, when it was in fact 1989.

Laramore left the McDonald’s shortly after the exchange and returned home. When Mascorro learned Laramore had given him a misspelled name and the wrong birth year, he called a Hot Springs County prosecutor, according to an interview with the prosecutor conducted by the DCI investigators. 
Kelly Owens, the prosecutor, told Mascorro they could not connect Laramore to the meth in the bathroom. The officer then said he wanted to arrest Laramore for interfering with the investigation by giving false information about himself. Owens suggested Mascorro could just write Laramore a ticket instead, according to the lawsuit. 
But Mascorro wanted to arrest Laramore, he would later tell DCI agents. 
A two-decade veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Mascorro had joined the Thermopolis Police Department eight years prior. At the time of the shooting, he was the agency’s second in command. The DCI agents who investigated Laramore’s death asked Mascorro why he went to Laramore’s home alone. The small police department was shorthanded, Mascorro told the investigators, and he did not have an option for backup. “It’s the nature of this job,” he said, according to the DCI report. 
During his tenure in Thermopolis, Mascorro had received four use-of-force complaints, according to the lawsuit. He was accused of kicking a man and knocking him to the ground while arresting him, and in another instance, of escalating an encounter into a fight at Thermopolis’s signature drinking establishment, the One-Eyed Buffalo. Just six days before the shootout, the Wyoming Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission had cleared Mascorro of any wrongdoing in those incidents. 
The lawsuit claims the department should have corrected aggressive behavior by Mascorro, and that doing so may have prevented the fatal shootout. 
Laramore’s McDonald’s colleagues described him to DCI agents as a “big-hearted” and good worker who sometimes felt down about life. When agents asked one colleague if Laramore was suicidal, she told them he would never kill himself because of his love for his wife. 
According to the DCI report, however, Mascorro learned from his dispatcher on his way to Laramore’s home that the man also had a record of assault charges. Laramore was well armed — DCI agents would recover three pistols when they searched the home after the shooting. Agents also found meth, fentanyl and marijuana.
Mascorro arrived on Laramore’s doorstep several hours after their first encounter at the McDonald’s, according to the DCI investigation. He banged on the door, which Laramore came to but did not exit. A storm door separated the two men as they spoke. Mascorro told Laramore to come outside so he could be arrested for interference. Laramore said he would not do so. 
The situation would go “one of two ways,” Mascorro suggested, according to the lawsuit. Either Laramore would step outside, or Mascorro would “break the door in.”
Laramore closed the door of his home. Mascorro opened the storm door and began to ram the main door with his shoulder. 
Shootout 
The Thermopolis Police Department released selective portions of Mascorro’s body camera footage from the incident, accompanying the footage with narration that gives the law enforcement view of the encounter. Mascorro entered the trailer because he believed Laramore could flee out the back door, the narration suggests. 
In his interview with DCI, Mascorro said he considered Laramore’s closing of the door in his face the equivalent of fleeing arrest, and felt if he left to secure a warrant, Laramore would be gone when he returned.
In the lawsuit, the Laramore family’s attorneys argue Buck Laramore couldn’t have destroyed any evidence in the interference case because he had already given Mascorro the false information. There was no threat to the officer’s safety when the two men talked in the doorway, and Laramore’s refusal to step outside was not a crime, the complaint argued. 
Laramore’s wife, Brandi, was also home. 
When Mascorro broke through the door, he found Laramore standing in a hallway, pointing a Smith & Wesson handgun at him with both hands.

Buck Laramore stands in the lower right corner pointing his .45-caliber pistol at Mascorro. The officer broke into the home in April 2023 without a warrant and the two men shot each other. Laramore died. (Thermopolis Police Department footage)
Mascorro’s gun was still in its holster, according to the DCI report. Laramore fired once and put a .45-caliber bullet through Mascorro’s right arm and into his chest, where it broke one of the officer’s ribs and passed through his lung, narrowly missing his spine. 
The shot knocked Mascorro to the ground. 
Laramore advanced toward him, and according to the DCI report, likely fired another shot, though it didn’t strike Mascorro and it’s unclear where the round went. 
Lying on the ground, Mascorro called on Laramore to “stop, stop.” 
According to the lawsuit, Laramore did not fire another shot. 
Mascorro told the DCI agents he did not know why Laramore did not shoot him again, in the head, while he lay on the ground. But Mascorro pulled his pistol and began firing, shooting seven times. 
Brandi Laramore hid in the home’s bathroom. According to the DCI report, she took the family dog into the bathroom with her. But in a frame from the body camera footage, the dog runs across the trailer floor as Mascorro, now standing, aims his gun toward Laramore.

It’s unclear if Mascorro hit Laramore during his first fusillade. Laramore appears to have retreated into another room of the trailer. According to the lawsuit, Laramore then stepped into Mascorro’s line of sight, now unarmed, and the officer fired three times. According to Mascorro’s interview with DCI agents, the officer believed Laramore was tactically peering around the corner and was still trying to shoot and kill him. 
Mascorro hit Laramore with his first shot, he believed, and possibly his second. 
This time it was Laramore who fell to the ground and yelled, “stop, stop,” according to the lawsuit.  
Mascorro, now severely weakened by his injuries, collapsed to the floor. He was able to stagger out of the home before collapsing again in the yard, where arriving officers found him. 
Inside the trailer, Laramore died in his wife’s arms, she told DCI agents. 
Medics airlifted Mascorro to a hospital in Casper, where the officer came in and out of consciousness. When Mascorro returned to Thermopolis, he did so as a hero, welcomed with a parade, according to the Cowboy State Daily. However, after Erramouspe cleared Mascorro of any homicide charges but found he should not have entered Laramore’s home, the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission again investigated the officer and considered decertifying him. 
Decertifying an officer is the review board’s strongest and rarely used sanction — it would have prevented Mascorro from working in law enforcement anywhere in Wyoming. 
POST, led at the time by former Casper police chief Chris Walsh, chose not to take that step. After a review of Erramouspe’s findings, the DCI report, state law and department policy, town officials in June 2024 decided Mascorro would return to duty. 
“The Town believes Sgt. Mascaro did not violate policy or the law,” Thermopolis Mayor Adam Estenson said in a statement announcing the officer’s return. 
“I look forward to continued conversation on what policing looks like for Thermopolis into the future,” he continued. 
Though the shootout was the town’s first police killing, according to an October 2023 statement from Estenson, a second would soon follow. In September 2024, a different Thermopolis police officer conducting a wellness check would run into a mentally ill man, Jared Gottula, who was swinging a bat wildly in his yard. Gottula advanced on the officer’s patrol vehicle and the officer struck him with it. During the tense encounter that followed, the officer and a Hot Springs County sheriff’s deputy fired more than 20 rounds, killing Gottula.
A review found the officers began shooting after Gottula advanced on the deputy with the bat raised. Both officers were cleared of any wrongdoing, and to date, no lawsuit has been filed.

Arbitrary response times, inconsistent fees and insufficient information on how to file a records request are why lawmakers should overhaul the Wyoming Public Records Act next session, guest columnist Marta Mossburg writes.
The post Time to strengthen the Wyoming Public Records Act appeared first on WyoFile .","When Lander resident Tina Clifford sent a public records request in August to Fremont County seeking more detailed election information than what was already publicly available, she wasn’t sure to whom she should send it, what it would cost or how long it would take. 

Opinion

Ms. Clifford’s grandson and my son are part of the same homeschool group and we started talking about her experience requesting records during one of our weekly school days. That conversation prompted this column, because  the information about public records requests is insufficient on Fremont County’s website. When Ms. Clifford sent her request to County Clerk Julie Freese she didn’t hear back for over three weeks and emailed her again seeking an update. County Attorney Nathan Maxon returned her email and told her that two employees had thus far spent 18 hours on her request. That time would not cost Ms. Clifford, he wrote, but the remaining work would be billed to her at $70 per hour with an estimated cost of $560. He requested that she let him know if she wanted the remaining work done. 
Clifford’s experience is just one of many examples of the arbitrary response times, lack of transparency and sparse instructions on how or where to send a public records request in Wyoming. It’s also why the Public Records Act should be overhauled during next year’s legislative session.
The current Wyoming Public Records Act requires the government to respond promptly showing receipt of the request and to release requested records no later than 30 days after sending the receipt unless good cause exists to extend the time frame. But a court ruling found that government entities may charge a “reasonable fee” for reproducing records — leaving open the possibility that different people could be charged different amounts and that counties within the state could set vastly different fees for the same type of request. 
That’s why Rep. Pepper Ottman, R-Riverton, would like to see consistency across the state with specifics on how to submit requests, what can be released and fees that are consistent across the state. She’d also like the law to clearly state who is responsible for handling requests under the Wyoming Public Records Act. Ottman is hopeful reform will be debated in next year’s shortened budget legislative session. 
Here are some of Mountain States Policy Center’s ideas to strengthen the Public Records Act:

Don’t distinguish between requesters. Bad actors exist everywhere and there should be equal treatment for everyone.
Have a set fee schedule detailed in statute for everyone.
Process large record requests in installments, and cancel requests if the fee is not paid for the first installment.
Allow requestors to narrow or refine requests if the time estimate is too long and/or fees are too large.
Use the federal definition from the National Freedom of Information Coalition research for burdensome requests. The state’s Public Records Ombudsman could then be empowered to hear concerns from a government entity if that definition has been met.
Provide Wyoming’s Public Records Ombudsman with more authority to assist and mediate disputes.

Some requests can’t be fulfilled by statute, including an individual’s income tax forms, school and medical records and government personnel files, among others. And some requests require a large amount of time to complete and may not be able to be finished within a 30-day time frame. But both government employees and those requesting information should have a clear understanding of their obligations, fees, timing and how the process is supposed to work. 
Having easily understood regulations is no guarantee that the government will comply, as evidenced by the thousands of lawsuits against the federal government for not fulfilling FOIA requests. But here in Wyoming, we can do better. Passing an enhanced Public Records Act would build trust in state and local government. In addition, state and local government agencies would do themselves a big favor by proactively posting as much information online as possible. Upfront transparency would mitigate the need for public records requests.
Strengthening the Wyoming Public Records Act should not be a partisan issue. Every resident deserves a government accountable to the people it serves. Legislators should prioritize it in 2026.

(Courtesy of the Nebraska State Patrol)LINCOLN — One state lawmaker’s continued efforts to boost benefits for Nebraska State Patrol troopers, a largely consensus issue, ignited a rare fight among legislative allies.
The fight flared up last week in the Nebraska Legislature after State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln and his ally, State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, struck a deal to add a proposal to increase survivors’ benefits in the case of a trooper’s death from 75% up to 100%. 
In the case of dependent children without a surviving parent, it would bump benefits up to 100% until the child turns 19 years old.

Bostar has said the measure addresses a “fairly cruel reality” when an officer dies and families are hurt again. He pointed to collegiate research out of Iowa and New York that troopers, because of the line of work, can have shorter life spans than spouses in different fields of work.
“It seems wrong to ask folks to do a job that will reduce their longevity while then punishing their family financially,” Bostar told the Nebraska Examiner last week.
‘Piece of that puzzle’
Ballard, who chairs the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee, called the measure “common sense” and said it was “weird” that public safety officials weren’t fully compensated for their work. 
Ballard said Bostar’s measure is a “piece of that puzzle” to recruitment and retention. The State Trooper Association of Nebraska and multiple retired troopers supported the measure.
Bostar’s Legislative Bill 76, as introduced, would also have raised maximum annual cost-of-living adjustments for Patrol members’ retirement benefits. A narrower version, just related to survivors’ benefits, was amended into Ballard’s Legislative Bill 645, related to school retirement, on April 24 in a 39-0 vote, without issue. At that time, the increased benefits would have taken effect this July 1.

But four days later, Ballard filed an amendment struck with Bostar to kick the benefits bump two years out, moving it out of this already difficult budget cycle.
An actuarial study estimated a $3.3 million annual cost, which Bostar has denied is the true amount and is the largest estimate he’s ever gotten in pushing similar legislation. Even so, the amendment was adopted 41-0, and LB 645 moved on once again.
‘It doesn’t add up’
The flare-up came last Wednesday after Ballard rose on a procedural motion to say that, absent any other legal changes, the provisions of Bostar’s measure could not apply retroactively to existing spouses. He cited his committee legal counsel, the legal counsel of the related retirement state agency and the actuarial report.
“Any surviving spouse currently receiving 75% survivors’ benefits will continue to receive 75% survivors’ benefits,” Ballard said, withdrawing his motion, thus ending debate on LB 645.
Without an immediate chance for anyone to respond, LB 645 passed 45-2.
Bostar confronted Ballard after the vote, saying it was “bull—” that an average loss of four troopers a year could lead to such a high price tag.
“How much you think their pensions are? $10 million?” Bostar told Ballard off the side of the floor near a table where reporters regularly sit. “It doesn’t add up.”

Bostar told his colleague that it was the legal counsel or actuaries “lying to your f— face, and it means you lied on the mic, and I’m going to say that.”
The Retirement Committee legal counsel, Ballard and Bostar moved a few feet away to a side corner off the legislative floor where a reporter could hear the counsel tell Bostar that the state could be “f— sued” if Bostar rebuffed Ballard and said his interpretation was the law was retroactive, possibly muddying the waters on the legislative intent if later challenged in court.
‘A wrong we need to right’
But Bostar got on the microphone 10 minutes later and told his colleagues that he “fundamentally” disagreed with the legal interpretation that Ballard cited.
“Because there is no other way for the math to work on the numbers that were handed down by the actuaries, by NPERS [Nebraska Public Employee Retirement Systems], it must apply retroactively,” Bostar said. “Otherwise, the number wouldn’t be $3 million. There is no other mathematical way for this to make sense.”
“While we’re putting things on the record,” Bostar continued, he said he believes that all surviving spouses should “rightfully” have their benefits increased to 100%
“That is what we paid for. That is what the actuaries clearly calculated,” Bostar said.

The actuaries wrote that their understanding of legislative intent is that the changes would not apply retroactively, to which Bostar said the math still didn’t pan out and that it was “text on a page.” He said if the law wasn’t retroactive, he could have made the change to do so, but that it has always “100%” been his intent and understanding for the change to apply to all families.
An average of four troopers will unfortunately die in a year, Bostar said, but at least one won’t be married, and another might die after their spouse has already passed.
That would require annual retirement benefits for the remaining two troopers to be more than $6 million each year, Bostar said, but they’re just “not that generous.”
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who has not always seen eye-to-eye with Bostar or Ballard, praised Bostar as debate continued on a different underlying measure. She said she could not express her gratitude “sufficiently” for Bostar’s leadership in helping first responders not only have fair wages but also a “dignified and appropriate retirement.”
Ballard had no immediate comment on the disagreement with Bostar, though both indicated they would continue to work on the measure.
“I’m committed to doing everything that I can to ensure that this gets implemented,” Bostar said. “It’s a wrong that we need to right.”

[…],"A veteran attends a county fair. (Jena Ardell/Getty Images)LINCOLN — For-profit consultants make millions each year charging veterans for help in filing benefits claims. Nebraska is moving to crack down on what some call “predatory claim sharks.”
It is already against federal law for companies not accredited with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to charge veterans fees for help in claiming benefits. But in 2006, a “clear enforcement method” vanished from federal law, State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst told the Nebraska Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee in March.
New York, New Jersey and Maine are among states that recently passed protections against “claim sharks,” who McKeon said use “aggressive tactics and false promises.”
“Our veterans who have sacrificed so much for our nation deserve better than this,” McKeon, a veteran, said at the hearing for his Legislative Bill 693. “We owe them a duty to protect them from being defrauded.”
Broad state support
LB 693 would change state law so that anyone receiving compensation for preparing, advising or consulting someone for earned veterans’ benefits or making referrals for such services would commit a “deceptive trade practice” unless otherwise allowed by state or federal law.
Attorneys, agents or companies properly accredited by the federal VA, for instance, would not be impacted by LB 693, according to the Nebraska chapter of Veterans of Foreign Wars.

A previous version of the bill was introduced in 2024 by former State Sen. Tom Brewer of north-central Nebraska, a decorated veteran and former Government Committee chair.
Brewer’s bill did not move forward. This time, McKeon’s LB 693 has advanced unanimously from the Government Committee but hasn’t yet been scheduled for debate. It is McKeon’s personal 2025 priority bill, increasing the likelihood it could be scheduled.
Attempts to regulate the for-profit industry have stalled in Congress.
Among those supporting the Nebraska legislation are major veterans service offices that offer free services, including:

AMVETS.
The American Legion.
Marine Corps League.
Veterans of Foreign Wars.
Nebraska Veterans Council.
Disabled American Veterans.
Paralyzed Veterans of America.
Military Order of the Purple Heart.
County Veterans Service Officers Association of Nebraska (including those from Lancaster, Dawes and Sioux Counties).

Choice or exploitation?
At the bill’s hearing, Ray Colas of Veterans Benefits Guide and John Blomstrom of Veterans Guardian opposed LB 693. Neither service is accredited with the VA.
Colas said LB 693 could create unintended consequences. He said many veterans are unaware of free services that exist but Veterans Benefits Guide tries to publicize those options.
“They still sign on the dotted line because they know they need help or, for purposes of convenience, prefer to use our services fully,” Colas testified.
Blomstrom, a Marine Corps veteran for Veterans Guardian, said he was concerned LB 693 would limit an “option” that he said should be protected under the First Amendment. He said his organization ensures veterans “have an option” amid the VA’s “very archaic, broken system.”
Colas said his organization could support LB 693 if it more closely mirrored federal law for accreditation. Blomstrom said consumer protections were a better route than accreditation.

Ken Yount, state commander for the Nebraska chapter of Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner that organizations like his have met with lobbyists for the out-of-state companies in “good faith.” However, such companies have refused “to be held to the same ethical standards” of VA accreditation or accept a reasonable fee cap, he said.
“They claim to give veterans ‘another choice,’ but what they’re really offering is exploitation,” Yount said. “Veterans deserve better — and Nebraska has the chance to stand up for them.”
‘Our heroes deserve better’
Mike Sheets, on behalf of the Military Order of the Purple Heart in Nebraska and the Great Plains Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, said his organizations provide services at no charge while still advocating for veterans beyond one-on-one services
Sheets said veterans swear their oath to protect the country, “knowing that we would be protected by lawmakers, ensuring that we are not preyed upon by for-profit companies.”
Spike Jordan, a county veterans service officer in Dawes and Sioux Counties, said veterans “who put life and limb on the line” for the county often exit with physical and mental wounds that will follow them for the rest of their lives.
“We owe our heroes more than the symbolic debt of our gratitude,” Jordan said in a statement.
McKeon, one of three veterans on the Government Committee, said the status quo is unacceptable and that LB 693 is about doing “the right thing.”
“Protecting our veterans must be our top priority that shouldn’t be delayed,” McKeon said last month. “Our heroes deserve better than to be continued to be taken advantage of by the scammers.”

Druzin’s investigation into Christ Church and its leader Doug Wilson’s growing influence in the community was highlighted in his podcast’s second season, “Onward Christian Soldiers,” which has reached over 1 million downloads.
According to Druzin, Wilson runs the Community of Reformed Evangelical Churches, a nationwide Calvinist church group, along with an education network of 500 classical Christian schools. While Wilson has gained national attention in Christian nationalist circles, his church members have not found success in local political offices.
The upcoming “United in Community” event will include organizational presentations, discussion groups and collaborative planning for community action. It will be from 1-4 p.m. at the 1912 Center in Moscow.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)On April 1 Wisconsin voters decisively voted against unprecedented, massive outside interference in our state Supreme Court election by the nearly $30 million from the richest and second (to Donald Trump) most egotistical person in the world – Elon Musk.  In handing Musk’s endorsed candidate, Brad Schimel, a more than 10 percentage point, 269,000-vote drubbing, Wisconsinites rendered the nation a great service by humiliating Musk here and thereby driving him from the corridors of power and influence in Washington D.C. where he has been  savaging vital U.S. government services and programs that helped the poorest people in our nation and in the world.
Wisconsin also opted to preserve recent democracy reforms in our state by maintaining the current 4-3 progressive majority on the Court.  Fairer and more representative state legislative voting maps and the restoration of the use of secure ballot drop boxes for voters will be preserved and the possibility of new and enhanced political reform is possible in the years immediately ahead either through upholding reforms passed legislatively, through court action, or both.
But what can be done about the obscene amount of political money raised and spent to elect a new Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice in 2025 – as much if not more than $105 million – by far the most amount ever spent in a judicial election in the history of the United States?  Wisconsin faces new state supreme court elections every April for the next four years and a continuation of such frenzied and out of control spending for the foreseeable future seems both unbearable and unsustainable.
Voluntary spending limits for Supreme Court candidates with the incentive of providing them with full public financing if they agree to statutory spending limits is a possibility.  Wisconsin actually had such a law in place for exactly one Supreme Court election in 2011.  The Impartial Justice Act was made possible by passage with overwhelming bipartisan majorities in the Wisconsin Legislature and enactment into law in 2009.  In 2011, both candidates for a seat on the high court agreed to the voluntary spending limits of $400,000 each and received full public financing. That campaign was robust, competitive and the result was close, which is what you would expect in Wisconsin.  And it cost just a tiny fraction of the more than $100 million that was spent in 2025.
Unfortunately, later in 2011, then-Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature defunded the Impartial Justice Act and all other public financing for elections, Four years later, Walker and the GOP completely eviscerated and deformed Wisconsin’s campaign finance laws. They did away with limits on what political parties and outside groups can raise and spend in elections, increased individual campaign contribution limits and, most alarmingly, legalized previously illegal campaign coordination between so-called issue ad spending groups and candidates, which greatly increased opportunities for corruption and undue influence through campaign spending. Disclosure requirements were weakened and, in some instances, dismantled altogether.
In just four short years, Wisconsin was transformed from one of the most transparent, low spending and highly regarded election states in the nation to one of the worst, least regulated special interest-controlled political backwaters in the nation, akin to Texas, Louisiana or Florida.
This current corrupt status quo will remain in place for the upcoming state Supreme Court elections in 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 unless the governor, Legislature and the Wisconsin Supreme Court take action and do the following:

Re-establish an “impartial justice” law for the public financing of state Supreme Court elections modeled after the 2009 law which was in place for only one election before it was repealed. Update and revise it to better fit current times and circumstances including more realistic spending limits and higher public financing grants.
Establish clear recusal rules for judges at all levels in Wisconsin that clearly decree that if a certain campaign contribution is reached or surpassed beyond a certain threshold amount, then the beneficiary of that contribution (or of the expenditure against her/his opponent) must recuse from any case in which the contributor is a party before the court.
Restore sensible limitations on the transfer of and acceptance of campaign funds and make illegal again campaign coordination between outside special interest groups engaged in issue advocacy with all candidates for public office — particularly judges.
Petition the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the disastrous 2010 Citizens United vs F.E.C. decision which ended over 100 years of sensible regulation of unlimited corporate, union and other outside special interest money in federal and by extension state elections, unleashing the torrential flood of campaign cash drowning democracy today.

These are common-sense, achievable reforms that, if enacted into law, would go a long way toward restoring desperately needed public confidence in the fairness, impartiality and trust in Wisconsin’s courts and in particular, our Wisconsin Supreme Court which was regarded as the model for the nation and the best anywhere a quarter century ago. But it will take determined action by all three branches of Wisconsin’s state government working together with the voters to uphold election integrity and curb corruption in a way all of us can embrace.
Ultimately, of course, it’s up to us, the voters, to hold our governmental institutions accountable and ensure that they work for us instead of for their own narrow interests  and those of the donor class. In this critical season of resistance and defiance against tyranny — speak up, make noise and ensure that your voice is heard.  Demand real reform and an end to the corruption of our representative government.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Getty Images)To victims and survivors across North Dakota,
As the news reveals more about Ray Holmberg’s decades-long abuse and exploitation of men and boys, we — the undersigned advocacy and service organizations for survivors of sexual and domestic violence, child abuse, neglect, and human trafficking — want to speak directly to you.
We know this is a difficult time. The graphic details emerging through the news cycle, social media, and local discussions have created a wave of renewed pain and trauma for many. If you are feeling triggered, anxious, angry, heartbroken — or simply numb — you are not alone. These are normal reactions to traumatic events, and you do not need to walk through this alone.
For many survivors, hearing stories about violence and abuse can reopen old wounds or create new ones. It can feel as if your own experience is being dragged back into the light, without your consent. We want you to know: Your reaction is valid. Your experience is valid. Your pain is real. And your story matters.
You are not responsible for what happened to you. You are not defined by the choices of the person who hurt you. What someone did to you does not diminish your worth. You deserve safety, dignity, and love in every relationship you have — always.
If the headlines have felt like too much, it’s okay to step away. Turn off the news, unfollow triggering content, and log off social media if you need to. Taking a break is not avoidance; it is an act of self-preservation. Protecting your mental and emotional health is a powerful and necessary form of self-care.
Speaking of care — know that help is available across our state. There are advocates, counselors, and therapists trained in trauma-informed care who are ready to listen without judgment and support your healing journey. Whether what happened to you occurred last week or decades ago, whether you’ve told your story before or never shared it with anyone — you matter. And we are here for you.
If you’re not ready to reach out to a professional, consider talking with someone you trust. Conversations with supportive people — friends, family, community members—can be a great way to de-stress and work through what you’re feeling. And if someone you speak to isn’t able to offer you the care or understanding you need, it’s OK to set boundaries. You deserve to feel safe and supported in your relationships.
Finally, we want you to know you are not forgotten. Our organizations exist because we believe in a better world for you. We fight every day to end the cycles of violence and exploitation that have caused so much harm. We advocate for justice, for change, and for compassion—not just in times of crisis, but every day. And we will keep showing up, because your life and your healing are worth fighting for.
In solidarity,

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Both chambers of the Colorado Legislature approved a bill that would give incarcerated people the right to see their families and community, ending the current policy under which visitation can be withheld as a form of punishment.
Current Colorado Department of Corrections policy says “inmate social visiting” is a privilege that can be “approved, denied, suspended, or revoked” by the head of a facility. House Bill 25-1013 would still allow the department to “adopt rules to govern the administration of social visitation,” but it cannot restrict visitation beyond “what is necessary for routine facility operations” or safety purposes. In-person visits, phone calls and video visits would become a right that cannot be taken away as punishment for an incarcerated person’s actions.
The Colorado Senate gave final approval to an amended version of the bill Friday in a 22-12 vote along party lines, with Democrats in support of the measure. The House later voted 43-19 to accept the Senate’s amendments, sending the bill to Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ desk to be signed into law.

“Families are where we find strength, healing, and support. But for too many families, the criminal justice system creates barriers that fracture these bonds,” Senate President James Coleman, who sponsored the bill, said in a statement. “Regular visits, phone calls, and moments of connection empower families to support their loved ones’ journey toward rehabilitation. This bill helps to make our justice system a tool for repair and recovery, not a weapon of division.” 
Coleman sponsored the measure alongside fellow Denver Democrat House Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, as well as Rep. Regina English and Sen. Tony Exum, both Colorado Springs Democrats.
Colorado bill would establish right to family visitation for incarcerated people

All visitors and incarcerated people must still comply with department rules related to visitation. People in CDOC custody could file a grievance with the department if they are prevented from visitation under the requirements of the bill. 
Bill sponsors offered an amendment in the Senate on Thursday to make changes negotiated with CDOC, clarifying that the department can limit visitation for people confined in restrictive housing with certain high-level violations. CDOC will be able to limit visitation to comply with court orders related to victim safety and to prevent communication between co-defendants. The amendment also said the department will take “reasonable measures” to increase access to telephone calls and non-contact visits for people in restrictive housing. 
Those in support of the measure have said it will help incarcerated people maintain relationships with loved ones and ensure they have a better chance of stability once they are released. 
“Ensuring that people who are incarcerated have the right to connect with their loved ones makes all Coloradans safer,” Exum said in a statement. “It reduces recidivism, supports rehabilitation, and eases the transition back into our communities after incarceration.”
Democrats control strong majorities in both chambers of the Legislature.
The 2025 legislative session ends on May 7.

(Getty Images)School district budgets are a maze of numbers and jargon that most citizens cannot understand. Even some lawmakers have difficulty concluding if a school district is spending money properly.
Idaho’s largest school district, the West Ada School District, has a budget that can be found online, but it is hundreds of pages long and includes six different funds and 36 different programs. In Montana, the Billings Public School district is the state’s largest. Finding its budget on the district’s website is nearly impossible.
Transparent Idaho now offers public education data

That’s why Mountain States Policy Center is proud to release the nation’s first Public School Transparency Index. This tool — available online, via download or even print on Amazon — will allow citizens, taxpayers, elected officials and more the opportunity to compare and contrast key data from school districts in the state of Idaho.
Other versions featuring data from school districts in Montana, Wyoming and Washington will also be released.
Transparency doesn’t mean much if it’s not understandable. Parents and taxpayers may see this data and conclude their school districts need more resources. Others may see it and believe that not enough is being done to spend money in the classroom. Regardless, the community will have a broader sense of the results being achieved, and what – if any – changes need to be made.
One of Mountain States Policy Center’s key recommendations is for lawmakers to adopt a Public School Transparency Act a law that would require all public school districts, both on the first page of their budget and also on the front page of the district’s main website, report key financial data, including:

Amount of total dollars (all funds – local, state and federal) spent by the district that year;
Amount of total dollars spent per student, per year;
Amount and percentage of total dollars allocated to average classroom;
Average administrator salary and benefits;
Average teacher salary and benefits; and
Ratio of administrators to teachers to students.

Education leaders, including Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield, have told Mountain States Policy Center they support the concept of a Public School Transparency Act.
“It’s a positive for our schools if the communities they serve understand how tax dollars are being spent,” Critchfield said. “Let’s face it, school budgets tend to be complex and this is a step that helps simplify the way they’re communicated publicly.”

Rosita Hansen was working an evening shift at a tubing factory in 2023 when a sheriff’s deputy showed up and handed her a court summons. She was being sued for failing to pay off a loan of $2,050. What confused Hansen was she had already paid a couple thousand more than she borrowed. But now the company, Advance Financial, said she owed more. Between what she’d already paid the company and the lawsuit, Advance stood to receive over $12,500 from Hansen, records show.
Hansen, 57, had taken out the loan in 2021 after her mortgage company threatened to foreclose on her modest three-bedroom house outside Morristown, a small city in East Tennessee. Hansen made enough money to support herself, but after taking in her four grandchildren, she struggled to cover the costs of extra food and school supplies, and she stopped paying her mortgage. That’s when she turned to Advance. 
“I was providing for all of them,” Hansen said. “Financially, it was rough.”
Like most borrowers, Hansen could not afford an attorney to handle the suit, but she hoped to work out a payment plan with Advance. When she arrived at the Hamblen County courthouse in Morristown in May 2023, she was directed to a line of half a dozen people waiting to meet with an attorney representing the company. 
Across Tennessee, Advance has sued over 110,000 people since 2015, significantly more than any other payday lender, making it one of the largest plaintiffs of any Tennessee-based company collecting debt. In Hansen’s Appalachian county of 66,000, where nearly half the households make less than $50,000, the company has filed one case per every 32 residents over that time, the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica found.
Advance began filing thousands of lawsuits soon after Tennessee lawmakers approved the Flex Loan, a product pioneered by Advance in Tennessee. The loan’s $4,000 cap is nine times higher than the limit for most payday loans, and the company charges the equivalent of a 279.5% annual interest rate. Before Flex Loans became legal in 2015, payday lenders could only lend $425, and the borrower could never be required to pay back more than $500. Since then, those protections have been eliminated and thousands of borrowers have been defaulting. 
Flex Loans only stop growing when they’re completely paid off, when a flex lender declares the loan is in default or when it sues the borrower. If the loans do end up in court, the law allows lenders to recoup attorneys fees — which can’t be done with payday loans — a practice that can add up to a third of the loan amount. Court judgments against customers are often thousands of dollars, with some exceeding $10,000, records show. About 40% of all cases end up with a wage garnishment, court records show. 
The consequences of Flex Loans were predicted when the Tennessee legislature legalized them 10 years ago, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wanted to regulate products like Flex Loans when Congress created the agency in 2011. The Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the CFPB are currently being reviewed by the courts. 
Advance has argued that the new product would help consumers by offering them loans that are technically cheaper than a payday loan. It downplayed concerns from consumer advocates that these high-interest loans targeted and trapped low-income borrowers in debt they could never pay off. The company’s leaders made their case just as federal regulators planned to crack down on other Tennessee lenders for making different high-interest loans to people they knew could not pay them back.
After just a few years, evidence started mounting that the loans were exacting a high toll on low-income borrowers while generating huge profits for lenders. Since then, the Flex Loan has buried tens of thousands of Tennesseans such as Hansen in a deep financial hole.
Gabe Kravitz, a consumer finance researcher at The Pew Charitable Trusts, said loans above $1,000 paired with triple-digit interest rates are hard to pay off. 
“It gets very expensive very quickly,” he said.
Only a few other states have approved products similar to the Flex Loan but, unlike Tennessee, when other states saw problems with the loans, they acted to rein them in. 
Virginia allowed banks to make line-of-credit loans but had never seen the need to cap interest rates as banks competed for customers. But soon after Advance showed up, regulators noticed the company filing thousands of lawsuits. The state attorney general’s office investigated the company for deceptive practices in 2020, ultimately labeling the company as “predatory” and helping to pass legislation to shut down Flex Loan-like products in the state. Advance declined to answer a question about the Virginia attorney general’s investigation. California and North Dakota also passed bills capping interest rates on open-ended lines of credit after Advance and other companies began to operate in those states. 
The Lookout and ProPublica sent Advance Financial detailed questions about its operations, including each of the cases cited in the article. 
Cullen Earnest, the senior vice president of public policy at Advance Financial, declined to answer specific questions and said he could not discuss individual cases due to privacy concerns. Earnest said in an email that the company has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. He added that the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions has received just 91 complaints on flexible credit lenders since 2020, representing less than 0.001% of all new flex loan agreements, and that this data reflects the satisfaction of the vast majority of Advance’s customers.
Company records show Hansen made her twice-a-month payments on time, paying over $6,600 in 10 months. The required minimum monthly payments are supposed to act like a safety net, ensuring borrowers pay enough to cover the interest, fees and 3% of the principal. 
But many times after Hansen made a payment, the company allowed her to immediately borrow the principal back, which she often did, extending the time it would take to pay off the loan. After almost a year of payments, she still owed more than $3,000.

Hansen said she knew the loan was costly — every loan statement warns, “This is an expensive form of credit. Only borrow what you can afford to pay back” — but she didn’t realize how hard it would be to keep up with the interest and fees. 
The loan from Advance only made Hansen’s financial situation worse. As the payments became too much to handle, she lost the house. But the Flex Loan continued to grow, almost doubling in size by the time she received a court summons a year later. 
Who Is Advance?
Michael and Tina Hodges started their payday lending business in the 1990s with a few stores in Nashville. 
The company, then called Advance Pay Day, steadily expanded, making payday loans and offering products like bus passes, check cashing and money transfers. In 2009, the Hodges told a local news outlet that they wanted to shed the image of a “simple payday advance company,” so the company took on a new name, Advance Financial. 
By 2010, Advance had generated a modest $15 million in revenue from about two dozen stores, according to statements it made in news reports at the time.
Not long after, the growing business collided with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal regulator Congress created after the banking crisis. The CFPB had started to take aim at high-interest payday lenders, releasing a 2013 report on the dangers of the loans as debt traps. A subsequent agency report found that payday lenders, particularly in Tennessee, relied heavily on offering loans to those who couldn’t afford them. Advance declined to respond to a question about the CFPB report.

Looking for an alternative product that wouldn’t fall under the CPFB’s looming regulations, Advance turned to Tennessee lawmakers, who have power over statewide interest rates. The company hired Earnest, the former top aide for the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, which regulates payday lenders. It also opened up a political action committee and began to push lawmakers to allow it to create the Flex Loan. 
In a hearing discussing the Flex Loan legislation before its passage, Earnest told a Tennessee Senate committee the new loan was like a line of credit you could get at a bank, acknowledging it would be “a little bit more expensive.”
But the proposal added significant potential costs. To allow lenders to circumvent the state’s interest rate cap, the legislature simply called the interest something else: a “customary fee.” The law would permit flex lenders to charge 24% interest plus a daily fee until the loan is paid off. The fee is calculated by multiplying the loan amount by 0.7%. Over 365 days the fee adds 255.5% to the cost of the loan. Advance’s own documentation tells borrowers that although the state and Advance call it a fee, the federal government sees it for what it is, an interest rate. 
The bill passed the state Senate without opposition. In the House, only Democratic state Rep. Mike Stewart spoke against the bill, which passed overwhelmingly and was later signed by Republican Gov. Bill Haslam.
Stewart pointed out the new law allowed companies to recoup attorneys fees in court, something payday lenders had not been allowed to do, and a practice he knew as a lawyer would likely increase the number of lawsuits. 
“The legislation was structured to maximize the amount of money they could extract from these debtors,” Stewart, who has since left the legislature, said in an interview. 
After legalization of the Flex Loan, Advance Financial’s business boomed. The company expanded to all corners of Tennessee, growing to 105 locations by the end of the 2010s. 
As a private company, Advance is not required to release financial information. But Advance and the Hodges were vocal about their success, at least at first. The company self-reported to the Nashville Business Journal in 2019 that it made $392 million, quintupling its revenue from the year before it started offering the Flex Loan, and making more than 25 times as much as it had at the start of the decade. Advance’s revenue no longer appeared on any of the business journals’ lists after 2019. 
Those numbers parallel the growth of the flex loan industry in Tennessee. By 2019, all flex lenders across the state had generated about $730 million in operating income, a number that has continued to grow, according to state records. In 2022, the latest available year of data, flex lenders earned $880 million in operating income. 
The company is one of the top campaign donors to Tennessee politicians, having spent roughly $2.5 million since 2014. Advance has also spent over $3 million lobbying state lawmakers over the past decade. 
The Hodges have also made roughly $10 million in political donations to federal candidates since 2014, including over $3 million to support President Donald Trump’s campaigns. In a 2019 recording obtained by The Washington Post, Hodges told a payday lending industry group his political donations granted him better access to Trump. Hodges told the Post he was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump and never used his status to ask the Trump administration for help.
A Trump-appointed CFPB director rescinded most of the payday lending regulations in 2020. 
The new Trump administration has tried to gut the CFPB, but an appeals court on April 28 upheld a lower court ruling preventing the acting CFPB director from firing about 90% of the department’s employees.
Today, Advance’s only product is the Flex Loan.
A Wave of Lawsuits
Before the Flex Loan, court records show that payday lenders like Advance rarely took borrowers to court. The low $500 cap on loan amounts and the prohibition on collecting attorneys fees often made suing people unprofitable. 
The Flex Loan law changed all that, unleashing a wave of lawsuits. 
Across the 59 counties where electronic court records are available — home to over four-fifths of the state’s roughly 7 million people — Advance has brought one lawsuit for every 50 residents since 2015, according to a data analysis by the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica. 
For Tonya Davis, a single mother who works at a local hospital, Advance waited six years to sue. Tennessee’s debt collection law allows lenders to file a suit within six years and, if the company wins a judgment in court, to pursue the debt for another decade. 
Davis lives in Davidson County, where Advance operates more stores than in any other county in Tennessee. Advance has filed over 22,000 lawsuits in Davidson over the decade since it began offering Flex Loans, its highest county total. Its stores in Nashville, which is located in that county, are generally in neighborhoods where households have lower incomes. 
Davis said Advance contacted her in 2018, claiming she owed money on a Flex Loan taken out the previous year. Davis said she never borrowed the money and was the victim of identity theft, a claim the company told her it would look into after she told Advance in a phone call that the Social Security number on the account wasn’t hers.
The company never reached back out to her, she said, and for years, she heard nothing from Advance, but in 2024, she received a summons declaring it was suing her for almost $4,800.

At the time Davis was caring for her dying mother and missed her court hearing. Because she didn’t appear, Advance won a default judgment against her for the full amount. 
Davis could not afford an attorney, so she filed an appeal on her own, but she never got a chance to challenge the judgment. Soon after the hearing began, attorneys for Advance noted that Davis had filed her appeal one day past the filing deadline and the judge denied her appeal. 
The company’s default judgment means Davis is required to pay Advance $175 a month.
“I’m not a lawyer,” Davis said in an interview. “I’m trying to do the best I can with what I have. I don’t know anything about this, or I would have paid, but they didn’t even give me the opportunity to present my information.”
Challenging Advance in court can be daunting. When Advance goes to court for a Flex Loan, it wins a majority of the time, in part because borrowers often fail to show up and in part because the company has more legal resources. The company has won over $200 million in judgments since the start of 2015. 
Mandy Spears, the deputy director of the Tennessee-based think tank The Sycamore Institute, said in court that lenders have all the advantages because they have lawyers with vast experience in the system. 
“It’s just complicated for the average person versus a more sophisticated business or law firm,” she said. “It’s really a gap in knowledge and expertise.”

Many defendants don’t realize that when they fail to appear in court, the company doesn’t have to provide detailed documents proving what a borrower owes. 
Tessa Shearon, a 27-year-old mother in McMinnville, thought she paid off her loan with Advance Financial in 2020. When the company sued her almost three years later, she missed her court hearing because she was eight months pregnant and on bed rest. A judge ruled her in default and Advance won a judgment for $4,700.
Shearon didn’t keep any documentation after paying off her loan, but she said she reached out to Advance’s lawyer to dispute the lawsuit. The company has not sought to garnish her wages. But she remains in limbo: Under the law, the company can choose to file a wage garnishment any time in the next 10 years to recover the judgment amount. 
“My only worry is them attempting to collect,” Shearon said. “I don’t have anything.”
Marla Williams, a consumer law attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee, is one of a handful of lawyers who’ve helped defend borrowers against Advance.
In several cases, Williams has been able to block wage garnishments and reduce the customary fee the company charges.
Williams said that in a 2024 case, she was able to lower the payments from an unaffordable several hundred dollars a month to around $50 per month, which her client could afford. Advance fought the reduction, but a judge ruled in her favor. 
In another case, Williams said Advance tried to charge a borrower thousands of dollars in additional fees months after he stopped paying the loan. After a hearing, which most borrowers without lawyers don’t ask for, a judge reduced the fees, calling the added charges “unconscionable and unjust,” court records show.

Williams said the company often uses aggressive tactics in court, something that she’s observed over the past decade. 
“This is their business model,” she said.
Advance declined to discuss its business model or legal strategy.
Sometimes Advance has already made money off the borrower before suing them, as in the case of Hansen. Over 10 months, Hansen paid Advance nearly $2,200 more than she borrowed, records show.
She still owed almost $3,000 when she stopped paying Advance. The company waited around three months before declaring her in default, letting her debt grow before it sued her several months later. With the addition of attorneys fees and court-added interest, the company sued her for $6,000. 
Hansen, who asked to use her maiden name because she’s no longer married, lost her home in 2022, moving into an apartment, which she said costs more than her mortgage had.
Hansen said she plans to pay Advance by the summer. A February bonus check, which the company garnished 25% of, has helped. 
“I understand it’s every person for themselves, and they’re out to make a buck,” Hansen said about Advance. “But you know what, people out there are struggling every single day, and that’s what they take advantage of.”

How We Tracked Advance Financial’s Lawsuits



For this story, the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica used online portals to find civil cases in Tennessee General Sessions Courts for the 59 counties where electronic court records are available. More than four-fifths of the state’s population lives in these counties. Our analysis included cases filed and uploaded to the online portals from 2009 through 2024. We filtered the data for cases brought by payday lenders in Tennessee, using company names, and found that Advance was filing significantly more suits than any other payday lender, according to court records. 
Advance Financial often uses a related company called Harpeth Financial Services to file lawsuits against borrowers. Not every case listed the type of loan behind the lawsuit, but a pattern emerged: After Advance started offering Flex Loans in 2015, the number of lawsuits it filed significantly increased.
Of the cases in our data that were filed by Advance, over half had a judgment amount awarded, indicating the company won its lawsuit. About three-quarters of the cases filed had information on whether a wage garnishment was or wasn’t filed against a borrower. Our analysis found that among cases where that information was available, 40% included wage garnishment.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tennessee-Flex-Loans-3x2_preview-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-05 07:00:52.916404

WEST MICHIGAN — Proposed federal budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could pull the plug on a vital data network for Lake Michigan, impacting everything from boater safety and fishing forecasts to beach monitoring and drinking water intakes. 
The Great Lakes Observing System, which supports the management of over 77 buoys, meteorological towers, and high-frequency radar units specifically on Lake Michigan, faces a potential shutdown of its real-time data collection if proposed cuts of roughly $1.6 billion to NOAA in the fiscal year 2026 Trump Administration budget go through.
This network provides continuous, real-time information on critical conditions such as wind speed, air temperature, wave height, water temperature at various depths, and water-quality parameters. This data, freely accessible to the public on GLOS’ data platform Seagull and other apps, is essential for a wide range of users.
“If the funding cuts zero out costs, we know a number of buoys won’t be going out on the water,” said Shelby Brunner, Science and Observations Manager for GLOS. “We would have to fundraise and see how to support them. There could be a number of downstream effects that we don’t really know.”
 Safety and recreation at risk

The real-time data is crucial for recreational boaters and commercial freighters navigating Lake Michigan, helping them make safe and efficient decisions based on up-to-the-minute conditions.
A seemingly small difference between a 1.5-foot wave and a 4-foot wave can be critical for vessel safety. The information also aids the National Weather Service in refining regional forecasts based on actual, localized conditions.
“It can make a big difference on the safety piece,” Brunner said. “Being able to deliver that data helps marinas and harbors improve the experience for their guests and safety.”
The U.S. Coast Guard also utilizes this information in search and rescue operations.
Recreational activities like fishing and swimming also heavily rely on GLOS data. Charter fishermen use water temperature profiles to strategically locate fish, while the network monitors for harmful algal blooms and E. coli outbreaks that can close beaches and threaten water supplies. GLOS data supports the water treatment plant in Green Bay, Wisconsin,  for example.
Lake Michigan’s high recreational use makes this real-time monitoring particularly important. The lake is among the most popular boating destinations in the Great Lakes.

 Environmental monitoring in jeopardy

The potential loss of GLOS funding would also severely hamper the ability to monitor and respond to environmental emergencies.
The total amount of money at risk for GLOS core operations in fiscal year 2025 is $2.3 million, with an additional $3 million for equipment upgrades also being held back. The proposed federal cuts raise serious concerns about the future of this critical data network and its ability to serve the millions who rely on Lake Michigan.
High-frequency radars located at the Straits of Mackinac, a vital waterway connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, provide detailed information on water movement. This is critical for tracking the potential spread of oil spills, allowing coastal managers to take timely action to protect beaches and water intakes.
“If there is an oil spill, we want to know which way it’s going and tell coastal managers to close beaches and try to mitigate and contain the oil the best we can,” Brunner said. “The high-frequency data may not be available or may not have anyone to maintain it. If anything happens, we don’t get that chance back. You can’t just undo.”
 Impact on research, long-term understanding

The GLOS network in Lake Michigan also supports numerous long-term research projects in partnership with academic institutions.
Buoys deployed by researchers contribute to understanding the lake’s complex ecosystem, including water quality, fish populations, and the impacts of invasive species like zebra mussels, which have dramatically altered the lake’s ecology. Continuous monitoring helps track these changes and maintain crucial baseline data.
The Ann Arbor-based Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, a key data partner of GLOS, also faces potential disruptions due to the proposed cuts. GLERL conducts extensive research on Lake Michigan and operates research vessels essential for data collection. Loss of funding or a change in GLERL’s focus could significantly impact research and monitoring efforts on the lake.
 Broader regional implications

The data collected by GLOS on Lake Michigan is also interconnected with broader monitoring efforts across the Great Lakes region, providing valuable context for understanding nutrient loading and watershed changes that can impact the lake.
The potential shutdown of the network would not only affect Lake Michigan but could also have ripple effects across the entire Great Lakes ecosystem.
“If we experience a loss of funding for GLOS, we anticipate decreased certainty of safety and decision-making data for everyone from the hundreds of thousands of tourists to the businesses who live there, to the maritime economy — fishing and charter fishermen,” Brunner said. “The information we provide benefits everyone and has wide-reaching implications around safety, economy and water quality.”
As the Great Lakes regional association for the Integrated Ocean Observing System, GLOS serves as the central hub for data and information in the region.
Although officially recognized, GLOS heavily depends on a wide network of partners — including municipalities, universities, research groups, and businesses — who manage and deploy their own observing assets, some with GLOS’s financial or procurement support.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NOAA-pic.jpg,,,2025-05-05 06:01:28.634090

(AmeriCorps photo)West Virginia has declined to join states suing the Trump administration to block the cancellation of AmeriCorps programs.
Federal officials abruptly slashed $440 million in funds for the long-standing volunteer service program and put most of its administrative members on leave. 
More than 200 AmeriCorps members have already lost their jobs in West Virginia, and the program’s budget reduction will affect the state’s workforce development, after-school programs, housing construction through Habitat for Humanity and more. 
About two dozen states, including Kentucky and Pennsylvania, said in a lawsuit filed April 29 that President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency illegally gutted AmeriCorps. 
“If the Defendants’ actions are permitted to stand despite their statutory and constitutional defects, then the gutting of AmeriCorps will inflict immediate and irreparable harms on the Plaintiff States, their residents, and the public at large,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed in Maryland federal court.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Attorney General J.B. McCuskey didn’t sign on to the suit. A spokesperson for McCuskey’s office didn’t return a request for comment. 
A spokesperson for Morrisey said on Friday that, “The governor believes most matters can be solved through collaboration and communication rather than lawsuits. The governor will continue to fight to protect all West Virginians and will work diligently to help all those impacted.”
While serving as attorney general, Morrisey took on numerous fights against the Biden administration, including lawsuits fighting air quality rules and the former president’s border policy. 
The White House has pointed to improper payments and failed audits as justification for the cuts. “AmeriCorps has failed eight consecutive audits and is entrusted with over $1 billion in taxpayer dollars every year,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the Washington Post.
AmeriCorps oversees a number of programs that dispatch hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of people to service opportunities around the country. 
“In an attempt to dismantle the agency, the Trump administration and its DOGE demolition team made abrupt and drastic cuts to staff and volunteers and terminated grants,” said Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser in a statement. “We are suing to stop this illegal dismantling of AmeriCorps and preserve the spirit of community service in our state and nation.”
Last year, the program connected nearly 3,000 AmeriCorps members with project opportunities in West Virginia. The lawsuit listed several cities where Americorps volunteers are currently serving, including Charleston, Fairmont, Weston and Wheeling. 
U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, now a high-ranking member of the Senate, told MetroNews that the news was of great concern to her.
“There’s no doubt that the core functions that AmeriCorps is performing in a state like ours are pretty critical to fill gaps where we cannot fill them on our own,” she said. “So, I would say this is new news, and we’re going to help them work through this.”

(Photo by Kirsten Strough/USDA)Since March, Gov. Josh Shapiro and the Trump administration have been sparring over the cancellation of a program that provides millions in funding for Pennsylvania farmers who provide products for local food banks. There have been threats of a lawsuit, letters and public comments by state and federal officials.
“This isn’t some hope of mine that we would fund our farmers and our food banks,” Shapiro said during a press conference on April 21. “We had a three-year contract that the federal government broke in month four.”
The deal, the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA), was established in 2021 under President Joe Biden’s administration in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The latest contract was renewed in the final months of Biden’s term. However, Trump’s administration confirmed in March that the program was ending, impacting farmers and food banks across the nation.
Shapiro described LFPA as a “really successful program” through the Department of Agriculture that supported nearly 190 farms and 13 regional food banks across the state. On March 25, the governor said his administration sent an appeal to get the money they were supposed to be awarded, as well as a letter to the Trump administration. He reiterated that stance late last month and said the state is waiting on a response from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
“I know I’m a former (state) attorney general and a lawyer, but you don’t need a law degree to know the ancient legal doctrine of a deal is a deal,” Shapiro said. “They made a deal with Pennsylvania. They’ve got to honor that deal. And I’m fighting for every dollar that’s owed to Pennsylvania.”
Shapiro’s comments on April 21 were the latest in the back-and-forth between his administration and the federal government as farmers and food banks wait for a resolution.

How have farms and food banks been impacted?
A letter from the Shapiro administration lists all of the farms and products that are made available through the program. Feeding PA, which partners with farmers, released a sheet detailing LFPA’s impact. 
“I want to be able to continue the impact that I’ve already had,” said Amy Brickner, a third-generation dairy farmer in Cumberland County who has participated in the LFPA program, during a press conference on March 25. “And that is from these grant programs for dairy farmers to help me cover the expenses and give back to my community.”
Logan Brace, owner of Brace’s Orchard, is a ninth-generation farmer in Luzerne County. He highlighted the relationship they’ve had with the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg NEPA Regional Food Bank as a result of the program, saying it has been “a tremendous help for our business.” 
“Since LFPA funds have been available, we have worked together the past three seasons and look forward to continuing the relationship in 2025,” Brace wrote. “The food bank places regular orders and purchases some extra skids when we have surplus. These orders help cover the costs for harvesting and storing produce throughout the winter and spring.”
Food banks are also concerned their shelves will take a hit, and hurt people who rely on their services.
Joe Arthur, CEO of the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank, which serves 27 counties and more than 253,000 people each month, was appreciative of the Shapiro administration for bringing the issue to the public.
“For our food bank alone, that cut means losing $1.8 million over 15 months — that’s $120,000 a month and 500,000 meals that won’t reach the children and adults who rely on us,” Arthur said. “It also means fewer resources for our local farmers, who supply the fresh, nutritious food that makes this program so impactful. This isn’t just about meals—it’s about families, communities, and our local economy.”

Rollins: ‘They don’t have their facts right’
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins made a trip to central Pennsylvania on April 14 to tour multiple farms. She promoted the Trump administration’s focus on agriculture and defended the tariffs recently put in place on foreign products as a move to “save America.”
While speaking with reporters, she appeared to take issue with the statement from Shapiro’s administration that the USDA was canceling $13 million over the next three years in funding for that program.
Rollins said she respects Shapiro, but claimed that they “don’t have their facts right, or they’re playing games.”
“They’re trying to make this a political issue,” Rollins said to reporters at Martin’s Family Farm in Myerstown, Lebanon County. “The money is there.”
Rollins claimed that USDA has “released almost $1 billion dollars to food banks” nationally since she became secretary and added there was money sitting in state accounts to support food banks.

Pa. agriculture secretary disagrees: “This is incorrect’
Just a few days after Rollins’ claim, Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding penned a letter to her and the state’s congressional delegation refuting that claim that there are tens of millions in a bank account anywhere.
“To the contrary, Pennsylvania uses its own funds to operate the program, and seeks reimbursement from the USDA after those funds have been spent,” Redding wrote.
Redding said the previous rounds of funding via the LFPA program, prior to the cancelled contract, had totaled nearly $30 million in Pennsylvania and said that the state’s agriculture department has been “proud” to partner with USDA on the initiative. 
Of that $30 million, he noted the state has received reimbursements of $17.8 million for money it has spent under the program thus far, and has already submitted a reimbursement request for an additional $9.1 million, which was approved for payment recently. This means that approximately $2.9 million is the remaining balance from the previous agreement.
The funding represented as much as 15% of the food banks’ purchasing budget, “a significant amount that provides millions of meals to hungry Pennsylvanians,” according to Redding.
“The Commonwealth looked forward to building on the success of these prior rounds of funding, and was grateful when the USDA committed an additional $13 million to Pennsylvania through the LFPA25 allocation,” Redding said, referring to the money that was slated to be allotted to the state under the most recent contract signed in December.
“Through the end of July, we will continue to spend all remaining program dollars under the second round of funding, as required by the terms of our cooperative agreement,” Redding wrote.
Redding said he has still not received a response from the USDA from his initial letter on March 25 and asked that the USDA reconsider its decision to terminate the most recent contract, which would provide $13 million for the program over the next three years.
“Pennsylvania has held up its end of the bargain. LFPA funds have been used by food banks across the Commonwealth to buy food directly from Pennsylvania farmers, in furtherance of the program’s essential goals,” Redding wrote.
The USDA did not respond to a request for comment from the Capital-Star about Redding’s letter. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Food banks hold out hope
As food banks wait to see the outcome in the ongoing saga, they tell the Capital-Star that they are already being impacted by this decision.
The Central Pennsylvania Food Bank said they are “leaning heavily into getting as much help as possible from donors right now.”
“There is no way to make up the gap, but we are working harder than ever to do what we can,” Lisa Rashid, Central Pennsylvania Food Bank Senior Development Manager said. “Our neighbors looking for assistance will also likely get less, as we try to stretch what we have among even more people needing our help during this difficult hunger crisis we are in, with the cost of food rising and people struggling to make tough financial choices.” 
The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank said the LFPA funding and TEFAP CCC bonus helped them source 6.3 million pounds of food annually, which accounts for 13% of the total food they are currently distributing. 
“The reduction in USDA commodities, combined with potential cuts to SNAP, could make it more challenging for the Food Bank to get food to our neighbors who need it most,” said Colleen Young, Director of Government Affairs for the Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank.
Both food banks aren’t giving up hope just yet though and offered a few potential solutions, in addition to reversing the decision to cancel the LFPA program, that would assist them. One would be for the legislature to pass Shapiro’s funding proposal for both the State Food Purchase Program, also known as SFPP, and the Pennsylvania Agricultural Surplus System, referred to as PASS.
SFPP provides cash grants to counties for the purchase and distribution of food to low income individuals and is intended to supplement the efforts of food banks and other similar organizations aiming to reduce hunger.
PASS allows the state’s agriculture industry to donate food products to the non-profit sector who assist Pennsylvanians at risk of hunger. Through this program, the agricultural industry is reimbursed for the costs associated with donating these foods.
The other suggestion from the food banks would be for people to reach out to their elected representative.
“To make sure they understand the severity of food insecurity in our region and the importance of food resource programs,” Young said.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s state environmental police force has been troubled by vacancies for at least 20 years.
But not for much longer. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Division of Law Enforcement is poised to reach its full 32-person staff for the first time since Deputy Chief Mike Schipritt began working there in 2005.
Schipritt, who was promoted to deputy chief in 2024, will get a break from the endless hiring paperwork. More importantly, he wont have to struggle so much over how to deploy critical environmental guardians across the sprawling landscape of state-owned land and waters. 
“Life safety will always take precedence,” Schipritt, 46, said. “When we’re down to two or three officers working a night shift, I can’t staff two boats on patrol. Or, we might have to sacrifice staffing a boating ramp during the day watching fishermen.”
It’s mostly thanks to better retirement benefits extended to state public safety workers under the state’s fiscal 2025 budget. The state has also eased degree requirements and increased pay for its environmental police division in recent years.
Recruitment efforts took a dive in 2020 as public perception of law enforcement dimmed. Schipritt struggled to recruit and retain environmental officers while other local police departments offered better retirement packages, and game wardens in other states earned higher salaries.










When we’re down to two or three officers working a night shift, I can’t staff two boats on patrol. Or, we might have to sacrifice staffing a boating ramp during the day watching fishermen.


– Mike Schipritt, deputy chief, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Division of Law Enforcement


As of Jan. 1, more than 340 state public safety workers within the state pension system, including with DEM, Rhode Island Capitol Police and campus police officers, can now receive the same benefits as municipal police and firefighters under changes enacted by the Rhode Island General Assembly as part of the state spending plan.
The pension reforms including a lower retirement age and higher retirement allowance, partially reverse the 2012 pension cuts led by then- General Treasurer Gina Raimondo. To account for the estimated $17 million increase in accrued liability, the state is expected to put $3.8 million more per year into the pension system for the next 20 years, Wil Arboleda, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Office of the General Treasurer, said. 
“That number is — however — an estimate, particularly as it relates to out-years and will fluctuate based on factors like salary increases, inflation, and system experience,” Arboleda said in an email.
The state’s pension fund for state employees faced a $2.1 billion unfunded liability as of June 30, 2024, according to a Dec. 19 actuarial report by national consulting firm Gabriel, Roeder, Smith & Company. The fiscal 2025 budget included a $222 million  payment to the state employee pension fund, expected to rise to $243.3 million in fiscal 2026.
The pension costs are a small price to pay, says Michael Woods, chair of the New England chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Woods advocated for the pension changes for environmental police during the 2024 legislative session, stressing the importance of more competitive benefits to protect state lands and waters.
“This is our first line of defense against wildlife and environmental violators,” Woods said in a recent interview. “They are the ones out in the field, catching people who abuse public resources.”

Big job in a small state
The DEM police provide 24/7 patrols and protections for state waters and parks, enforcing environmental protections, public safety and regulations governing marine activity and commercial and recreational fishing and wildlife. More than 66,000 hunting and fishing licenses and permits are sold in-state each year, according to DEM’s website. And across the 40,000 acres of state-owned land, environmental police are charged with stopping criminal activity such as vandalism, larceny, assault and motor vehicle restrictions.
When a small passenger plane missed its landing, crashing into waters off Quonset Point in North Kingstown in March 2024, DEM police were first on the scene, quickly deploying four of its marine officers based out of nearby Wickford, according to news reports. The DEM officers pulled the man and woman in the plane crash from the water; they were subsequently taken by local police and fire crews to a local hospital. 
It’s hardly the Ranger Rick or Smokey Bear fantasy many imagine when they think of division, said Schipritt.
“We break up domestic fights, criminal activities, everything like actual police,” he said. 
And yet, “It’s not uncommon to hear, ‘Oh, you’re not a real cop, you can’t arrest me.’”










This is our first line of defense against wildlife and environmental violators. They are the ones out in the field, catching people who abuse public resources.


– Michael Woods, chair of the New England chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers


Misunderstanding of the duties of DEM’s law enforcement division plagued recruitment efforts too, with many potential recruits not realizing that the job required a bachelor’s degree in an environmental field.
“A lot of people who wanted to be environmental police didn’t realize what our degree requirements were,” Schipritt said. “They would get a criminal justice degree, then find out they couldn’t apply.”
He added, “the people we were able to hire were fantastic candidates, but the pool was very limited.”
Retirements and resignations worsened the shortage; the division has advertised to fill open officer positions 20 times in the last five years, Schipritt said.
Two years ago, the state agreed to the agency’s request to ease degree requirements for entry-level environmental police officers, accepting a bachelor’s degree in either environmental field or criminal justice. At the same time, reclassifications approved in 2023 boosted starting salary ranges for environmental police officers by up to 20%, from a $61,460 to $70,983 initial offer, to a range of $73,517 to $82,725.
‘Now it makes sense to stay’
Money and retirement benefits weren’t what attracted 26-year-old Lucas Walter to a job with DEM’s law enforcement division. The University of Rhode Island graduate and Army National Guard officer always wanted a career that would let him spend time outdoors. He decided to follow in the footsteps of both his forestry major parents as a state environmental police officer.
But the boost to retirement and salary make Walter more apt to make his career at DEM a permanent one.
“Before, the benefits plan was pretty weak,” Walter said. “Now it makes sense to stay in this job for the long term and do the whole stint with the pension and everything.”
Walter joined the U.S. Army to ensure he had a way to pay for his college education. Walter graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 2023 with a bachelor’s degree in conservation biology, after which he completed his training with the state’s municipal police academy. He’s still a member of the Army National Guard.
Walter is expected to complete his training in the next month, at which time his conditional hiring with state environmental police will become permanent — something both Walter and Schipritt are eagerly anticipating.
Schipritt relishes his job for the balance between fast-paced police work and the tranquility of time in nature.
“The police side is exciting, but when you get sick of that, you take the boat out or the ATV out to go check on the hunters,” said Schipritt.
His favorite work post is Point Judith. The so-called “Calamari Capital” of the East Coast makes the southern Rhode Island landing area a popular spot for commercial fishermen, and for environmental police to check their landings.
Lucas also said working with commercial fishermen is one of his favorite parts of the job so far.
“With the amount of money involved, it’s a big deal, so you can really make a difference if someone is doing something wrong,” he said of policing the fishing industry.

Always “an organized person,” Harrison “knew something was wrong” when, in 2018, she started feeling confused and lost at work. 
Waking at 5 a.m. for work, the Nicholasville woman, 65, said she eventually “made an index card to tell me every step I had to take every morning: brush my teeth, floss…put your makeup on. I had to write it all out, because I would just stand in front of the mirror not knowing what to do.” 
Harrison is one of the more than 80,000 Kentuckians aged 65 and older living with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis as reported in the 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures Report, released by the Alzheimer’s Association last week. 
Her husband, Joe, is one of the 160,000 Kentucky residents that the new report says provide unpaid care for a loved one with Alzheimer’s. 
Alzheimer’s disease, which falls under the umbrella of dementia, is characterized by memory loss and is incurable, though treatments exist. 
One of those treatments underwent clinical trials at the University of Kentucky, Lecanemab (brand name Leqembi). This is an antibody that targets — and in some cases, removes — amyloid plaques from the brain, and has shown some success in slowing cognitive decline. Amyloid plaques are proteins that formin the brain and are believed to be a significant driver of Alzheimer’s. Lecanemab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2023. 
Referring to lecanemab, Mackenzie Wallace, the director of public policy at the Alzheimer’s Association in Kentucky, told the Lantern that this “is an exciting time” for treating the disease. 
In March, Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, announced Kentucky invested $300,000 into space research that will allow the Louisville nonprofit National Stem Cell Foundation to continue researching the way brain cells behave in microgravity in the hopes of finding better treatments — and cures — for Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s. 
The money — which was allocated in the 2024 legislative session’s Senate Bill 1 — is a 10% match for a $3.1 million NASA grant. 
Scientists hope that research can result in a cure. Meanwhile, this is “the first time in more than 20 years that we actually have a treatment now that is effective at slowing the progression of the disease, and it’s also the first treatment that actually addresses the underlying biology of the disease,” Wallace said of lecanemab. 
It’s key to start Lecanemab in the early stages of the disease, making it unsurprising that Tuesday’s report showed most — 79% of Americans surveyed — want to know if they have Alzheimer’s early. 
“I think Americans want to know now that it’s becoming less of a taboo or less of a stigma to talk about brain health, and Americans want to know about it, and they want to talk about it,” Wallace said. 
  Most — 79% of Americans surveyed — want to know if they have Alzheimer’s early. (Facts and Figures Report)
 By the numbers: what does the new report show?  
Shannon White, executive director of the Alzheimer’s Association’s Greater Kentucky and Southern Indiana chapter, called the Tuesday report’s findings “profound.” 
“Now more than ever, we need to work to advance disease research and treatments that can slow the current trajectory and help all Kentucky families affected by Alzheimer’s and other dementia,” White said in a statement. 
The 2025 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures Report shows, among other things, a serious need for more geriatricians and more personal aides to care for the 80,500 senior Kentuckians who live with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. 
There were 48 providers with geriatric certificates in Kentucky in 2021, according to the Facts and Figures report. It estimates Kentucky will need 393 by 2050 to care for all Kentuckians 65 and older and at least 144 geriatricians to care only for those with Alzheimer’s or dementia. 
“To meet the increased need and the demand by 2050 we’re going to need a 200% increase in geriatricians,” Wallace said. “And that’s just … almost unfathomable.” 
The number of diagnoses are expected to increase as the Baby Boomer generation continues to age. It’s also worth noting, Wallace said, that not everyone who has Alzheimer’s has a diagnosis. 
“We know that, still, early detection and diagnosis is a challenge. Even disclosure of diagnosis is still a problem, stigma, denial, etcetera — all of those still impact or affect the ability or desire of people to be able to get a diagnosis. And so the fact that we’re already at 7.2 million people with a diagnosis (nationally) definitely makes you wonder like, wow, how much would that number increase if we kind of thought or were able to measure the people that are at risk, or that have mild cognitive impairment but have not yet been diagnosed?” Wallace said. “I think that’s pretty shocking.”

The report also showed: 

There are 80,500 Kentucky residents aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer’s. 
10% of adults 65 and older live with Alzheimer’s. 
In 2022, 1,509 Kentuckians died from Alzheimer’s. 
In 2024, there were 160,000 Kentucky residents serving as unpaid family caregivers. 
Those Kentuckians provided 307 million hours of unpaid care worth $4.9 billion. 

Among other policies Wallace wants Kentucky to implement, she’d like to see an incentive program for caregivers, similar to the Credit for Caring Act that was introduced in Congress in 2024 that would give eligible caregivers a $5,000 tax credit. 
“The cost of this disease is really just staggering,” Wallace said. When it comes to unpaid caregivers, she said, “these are family members, friends, neighbors, loved ones, that are trying to provide care for individuals, for their loved ones.” 
If those Kentuckians who are receiving unpaid care were to have to live in nursing homes, Wallace said, “that’s at a great cost to the state” and it’s not as good for the patients. 
Meanwhile, Wallace said, unpaid caregivers carry an “all consuming” responsibility. 
“If caregivers are out here providing care to their loved one in the home, what does that mean for their own financial well being? Are they dipping into their own retirement funds and savings? Are they having to leave the workforce entirely to provide more care? Are they having to drop down to part time?” Wallace said. “It’s a huge economic toll on caregivers financially, and then on the other side of the coin, it’s a massive toll on our caregivers for their own well being.” 
‘You can’t see Alzheimer’s.’

It took Reda Harrison two years to “wrap my arms around” her Alzheimer’s diagnosis. She credits her Christian faith with helping her learn to cope with it and, ultimately, share her story with others. 
Harrison, who no longer works, attends a support group in Louisville, founded one in Lexington and volunteers with the Alzheimer’s Association. 
“Everybody’s case is different. It affects you differently. For me, it was more confusion,” Harrison said. “Since I left work, what I’ve noticed is my short term memory is really bad. I can do something and, a minute later, I can’t remember if I did it or not.” 
In addition to attending support groups and volunteering, Harrison fills her time with “anything I can to improve my brain.” She takes piano lessons, studies Spanish on Duolingo, a language learning app, practices yoga, quilts and does beadwork. 
Her service dog, Dolly Parton — named after the musician and philanthropist because of the poodle’s “poofy hair” — helps her cope with the depression that comes with her diagnosis. Dolly Parton, the dog, can also help direct her home if she goes for a walk and gets turned around. 
“She has really been a lifesaver for me,” Harrison said. “The way she helps me, mostly, is emotional. If I’m having a tough day, she just knows. She’s very comforting, because with this disease, you have a tendency to get depressed. And she helps me.” 
Poodle Dolly Parton runs all Harrison’s errands with her as well and loves to be in the car. 
“She’s just my companion,” Harrison said. “She keeps me independent.” 
Harrison, who is taking Leqembi infusions now, isn’t sure what the future holds for her, or how her Alzheimer’s will progress.

“People decline so differently. Some of the ones that I used to have conversations with can’t even talk anymore. But for me, I really haven’t declined that much. I think it’s just my relationship with God, but I don’t know — there’s no science behind that,” she said. “I’m happy. I have learned to embrace my disease and I don’t run from it. You can’t run from it. You can’t hide from it.” 
She wants more people to research Alzheimer’s and educate themselves on it, she said. She believes that’s the key to defeating societal stigma around it. 
“People say, ‘Oh, you don’t look like you have Alzheimer’s. You look normal,’” Harrison said. “They don’t know what Alzheimer is. You can’t see Alzheimer’s until you’re far into it.” 
Since her diagnosis, she’s lost friends who just felt too uncomfortable with the disease to be around her, she said, saying it felt like “leprosy in the Bible times.” That hurts, and she wants to change negative perceptions of the disease. 
“I am still Reda. I am the same person I’ve always been. I’m probably a nicer person now, more caring,” she said. “We still want to be treated for who we are.”

Enrollment in Head Start has dropped from a decade ago, but the waitlist for the early childhood education program remains long, according to the latest Rhode Island KIDS COUNT Factbook released Monday. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Data-crunching policy and advocacy nonprofit Rhode Island KIDS COUNT presents what it does every year in its 31st annual Factbook scheduled for release Monday: scores of charts, graphs and numbers to illuminate how things have changed for the babies, kids and teens of Rhode Island in the past few years.
But as the executive summary for this year’s Factbook notes, things are not the same as last year. The new report highlights what could be at stake for kids within the context of sweeping proposals to cut federal social services and programs, like Medicaid, SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Head Start, and programs promoting child immunizations and healthy school meals
Nearly 50,000 Rhode Island schoolchildren could no longer be eligible for breakfast and lunch at no cost during the school day. The wait list for Head Start early education programs could grow even longer. And the percentage of children living in poverty who visit a dentist each year, already alarmingly low, could continue to drop.
“We must ensure that families will be able to access the programs that help them thrive,” the executive summary states.
More than 44,951 children in Rhode Island were on SNAP as of October 2024, with a family of three receiving an average monthly food stamp benefit of $766. Of these SNAP households, 70% made under the federal poverty level of $25,820 for a family of three. 
National school meal programs are another source of nourishment for kids. In December 2024, 35,314 Rhode Island kids received free breakfast at school, and 75,933 ate free lunch. 
But the executive summary notes that a Congressional GOP proposal to retool the Community Eligibility Provision would reduce the number of eligible schools in the state, as it would require schools to have a higher percentage of low-income students to qualify. Raising that threshold from 25% to 60%, as the House proposal in February suggested, would reduce the number of students in Rhode Island eligible for free school meals from 98,092 to 49,155.
Advocates are also concerned about federal budget proposals targeting programs like Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which together enrolled 117,890 Rhode Island children through the managed care health insurance program RIte Care at the end of 2024. Finally, there’s the early education program Head Start, which has shuttered five regional offices, generating unease amongst providers. There were 1,438 children enrolled in Head Start in Rhode Island in October 2024, with 493 children still on a waitlist.
In an email Sunday ahead of the report’s release, Paige Parks, the executive director of Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, emphasized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as also being “under attack from the federal government despite the persistent and unacceptable disparities in child well-being by race, ethnicity, income, disability, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, neighborhood, and zip code.”
“These disparities will continue to persist among children and families if equity and equitable policies and investments are removed and if federally collected data becomes less available,” Parks said. “We must use data as our compass to address disparities and to ensure all children have the opportunities needed to thrive.”
The report adds three new “indicators” this year — family structure, maternal health and mental health — for a total of 67 categories of insight into the state’s youth population. Those indicators are grouped into five major areas of family and community, economic well-being, health, safety and education. 
The report also breaks down data at the community level, with specific stats for indicators as observed in Rhode Island’s 39 communities. 
“Communities and neighborhoods do matter — the actions of community leaders, government leaders, elected officials, businesses, faith organizations, and parents greatly influence children’s chances for success and the challenges they will face,” the Factbook reads.
This year’s report clocks in at 198 pages, and as in past editions, spotlights continuing disparities linked to race, income and geography. 
One example: Rhode Island’s racial demographics are gradually becoming less homogenous, and in 2020, about 47% of Rhode Islanders under 18 were people of color, compared to only 28% of adults. Those figures may not represent the state’s entire population of children of color either; the Factbook notes that the 2020 Census undercounted the demographic even more than it did in 2010.    
But poverty, a perennial concern of the Factbook, continues to disproportionately affect this growing segment of the population. While only 7% of Asian/Pacific Islander and white children lived in poverty between 2019 and 2023, 25% of Hispanic children and 24% of Black children lived in poverty. Among American Indian and Alaska Native children, that figure rose to 29%, and 28% among children who identified as “Some other race.”
“Children in poverty are most at risk of not achieving their full potential,” the introduction states.
Between 2019 and 2023, Rhode Island had a 13% child poverty rate, which equated to 27,224 children living in families with incomes beneath the federal poverty threshold.  
Other data points forming this year’s Factbook:

Homelessness is up again, as it was last year. Public school officials noted 1,966 children as homeless during the 2023-2024 school year. Since the 2021-2022 school year, the number of students identified as homeless has risen by 35%. Additionally, In 2024, 951 children stayed in shelters or hotels funded by the state’s child welfare agency, and 100 children were reported sleeping outdoors for at least one night during January 2025.
In 2023, 78% of children were fully immunized by age two — a slight decline from 82% in 2013, but still above the national average of 67%. Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions are rising: 185 kindergartners and 382 seventh graders received exemptions during the 2024–2025 school year, with over 90% citing religious reasons in both grades.
Only 47% of children with Medicaid visited the dentist for preventive care in 2023, while 65% of children with private insurance did. That same year, 413 children were treated for dental issues in ERs, and 69 were hospitalized with dental problems.
During the 2023–24 school year, schools issued 219 disciplinary actions to kindergarteners, with 182 of them given out-of-school suspensions. Of 9,208 out-of-school-suspensions across all grade levels that year, 54% were for nonviolent offenses. 

New indicators in this year’s Factbook are family structure, maternal health and infant health, which consolidate or replace some previous metrics, including children in single-parent families, grandparents caring for grandchildren, preterm births and low birthweights.
The 2025 Factbook is set to debut Monday morning with a breakfast event at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Warwick. U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Reps. Gabe Amo and Seth Magaziner are slated to attend, and Patricia Silva of the futurism-focused nonprofit FutureGood iss scheduled to give the keynote address. Classical High School student Mariah Ajiboye, who is also board co-chair of youth advocacy group Young Voices, is scheduled deliver the youth keynote.

On Wednesday, the Virginia High School League (VHSL) Executive Committee will meet for the first time since voting nearly two months ago to limit competition in girls’ sports to students assigned female at birth, following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. 
Previously, VHSL policy allowed transgender students to compete on teams aligning with their gender identity, though under specific conditions. The expected would formalize changes to the league’s handbook and policy manual.
“It is not too late for the Virginia High School League to find clarity and courage and to return to an inclusive policy that is sound, both ethically and legally,” said Auden Perino, senior counsel for LGBTQI+ equality at the National Women’s Law Center.
Perino said the February decision has caused “emotional harm” to students and their families. While the change impacts only a small number of students, they emphasized that does not make the issue any less important. 
The push for the policy change has largely been driven by concerns around fair competition.
In February, Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the committee’s decision “just common sense” after appearing alongside Trump when he signed the executive order threatening to cut federal funds for those that don’t comply.
“Biological boys should not be competing against girls,” Youngkin wrote on social media.

Victoria Cobb, president of the conservative group Family Foundation, said in a statement that it’s “high time” for the Virginia High School League to do right by girls and protect their safety. 
“Participation in sports develops girls into confident leaders,” Cobb said. “When girls step away from the arena because biological boys steal their titles and scholarships, everyone loses.”
However, Perino also pointed out that the “real threat” to high school sports is the chronic underfunding of women’s athletics and the widespread, often unreported harassment and assault cases affecting athletes — issues the NWLC has been tracking for over 50 years.
“These are the real threats to girls involved in school sports,” Perino said. “Obviously, trans youth are responsible for creating zero of these problems, and in fact, are harmed by all of them, just like cisgender youth.” 
Perino said if Virginians want to address and prevent sex discrimination in women’s school sports, they should focus on these “real and urgent threats where the gender justice movement has correctly maintained its focus, and we see from far right policymakers only a resounding silence on these topics and a truly creepy fixation on the bodies and lives of a few trans girls and women being scapegoated for political gain.”
Other advocates in Virginia are objecting to the changes and hope the committee will reconsider the action taken in February. Some view the vote as a harmful message — one that affects not just transgender athletes but Virginia’s broader reputation, undermining being “fair,” “inclusive,” and providing “opportunity for everyone.”
“Our hope is that maybe there is a world where they would reverse and go back to the original policy, but if anything, we want to send a strong message to them that they’ve made the wrong decision,” said Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, a LGBTQ rights advocacy group. “This is impacting community members, and it’s going to impact more than just transgender student athletes, who want to play.” 
Rahaman said the committee’s February decision overturned a decade-long policy that was working, noting that the league had initially told the Richmond Times-Dispatch it did not plan to make any changes in January. 
Since the policy’s establishment, Rahaman said, Virginia has allowed 42 transgender athletes to play on sports teams matching their identity over the past 10 years.
During the last legislative session, bills proposing to require K-12 public schools and higher education institutions to label each sports team as either boys, girls, or coed — based on the biological sex of the players — failed in the General Assembly. 
Del. Delores Oates, R-Warren, and Sen. Tammy Mulchi, R-Mecklenburg, who carried the proposals, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
“Protecting fairness and safety in girls’ sports is a commonsense principle supported by the majority of Virginians,” Oates said in a statement to The Mercury. “I commend the Virginia High School League for taking action to ensure female athletes compete on a level playing field. 
This is about preserving the gains made under Title IX — making sure girls have the same opportunities, scholarships, and team experiences that generations fought hard to secure. We stand with parents, coaches, and students who want to preserve those opportunities, and we will continue working to uphold them.”

(Getty images)We knew this was coming. The moment the political tides shifted, the backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) ramped up. 
Executive orders are gutting funding, corporations are quietly scrubbing their DEI commitments from their websites, and entire programs are disappearing overnight. This isn’t just about politics. This is about power — who gets access to opportunity, who gets to build wealth, who gets to lead. This is about dismantling progress, piece by piece, while telling us it was never needed in the first place.
For the next four years, DEI will remain a target. The question is: What are we going to do about it? Because if we’re not intentional, if we’re not strategic, if we don’t move quickly, we risk letting the forces of regression undo everything we’ve fought for.
I’m not here to argue why DEI is important. We’ve had that conversation a thousand times. We’ve cited the research, we’ve made the business case, and frankly, if people still don’t get it, they never wanted to. There’s nothing left to debate. The data is there. The proof has been there. Companies with diverse leadership perform better. Equitable hiring practices create stronger teams. Inclusive workplaces retain top talent. Communities thrive when opportunity is shared. But here we are again, watching corporations retreat at the first sign of pressure, watching funding dry up, watching commitments disappear overnight.
What we need now isn’t another defense of DEI. We need a plan.
First, we have to stop waiting for permission. For too long, DEI work has relied on institutional approval — on budgets that could be cut, on leadership buy-in that could shift with the next election cycle, on policies that could be reversed with the stroke of a pen. And now we’re seeing exactly what happens when that permission is revoked. Organizations that claimed to be committed to equity are quietly stepping back, and those of us who have been doing the real work are being told to “scale down” or “adjust to the new climate.”
If companies won’t fund DEI, we find funders who will. If existing leadership pipelines shrink, we create new ones. If corporations walk away, we build stronger partnerships elsewhere. If we’ve learned anything from history, it’s that movements don’t die just because the people in power decide they should. This work doesn’t end just because someone in an office decides it’s no longer “a priority.” The need doesn’t go away because a company’s PR team stopped talking about it. The systemic issues we’re fighting aren’t paused just because an executive order says they don’t exist. So why should we pause?
Second, we need to stop centering the acronym and start centering the work. Right now, DEI is politically toxic. That’s by design. It has been turned into a villain, a scapegoat, a convenient way to stir up fear and resentment. But equity doesn’t disappear just because the language shifts. If calling it “diverse hiring” gets you defunded, call it “leadership development.” If supplier diversity initiatives become a target, call them “economic growth programs.” If grants supporting Black and Latino entrepreneurs are suddenly under scrutiny, reposition them as investments in business innovation. The name is not the goal — the outcome is.










The systemic issues we’re fighting aren’t paused just because an executive order says they don’t exist. So why should we pause?


This doesn’t mean we stop talking about equity. It means we get strategic about how we keep these initiatives alive. It means leaders stop hiding behind fear and start getting creative. It means instead of retreating, we double down. It means embedding equity so deeply into business operations that it can’t just be removed as a budget line item. If you truly care about equity, you don’t need a DEI department to do the work. You don’t need a dedicated initiative. You need action, built into the way your business, your nonprofit, your institution operates — day in and day out.
Third, the private sector can’t sit this one out. Government funding is drying up. Corporate DEI programs are being slashed. But businesses still hold an immense amount of power in shaping the economic future of marginalized communities. And if businesses step back now, if they allow this moment to pass without resistance, they will have chosen the side of regression. Because make no mistake — this is a choice.
If you’re a business leader, this is the moment to step up. Fund grassroots organizations that have lost federal support. Increase investments in minority-owned businesses. Look at your hiring pipelines and make sure you’re not just talking about inclusion but actively building it into your recruitment and retention. If you made commitments in 2020 and 2021, now is the time to make good on them. Because if your support for equity only existed when it was easy, when it was trending, when it made for good PR, then you were never actually committed in the first place.

Joe Feagin had to swear an oath he was not a communist to land his first university teaching job in 1966.
Feagin, 86, received his bachelor’s degree in Texas during McCarthyism and the viciously oppressive Jim Crow era.
The ’60s were turbulent, Feagin said. Vietnam War and Civil Rights protests were frequent. Demographics were shifting as more Latinos and Asians arrived under liberalized immigration laws.
“Everything was looking up at that point,” Feagin said. “Jim Crow laws were being crushed, Black folks were finally making it into the mainstream white universities where they had been rare or nonexistent.”
But Feagin, who spent nearly 60 years in higher education, believes progress is slipping.
President Donald Trump is publicly threatening to withhold federal funding for schools over anti-war protests and diversity initiatives that took root decades ago. A less-visible battle is being fought in over half of all states, including Virginia, to remove protections for professors, independent curriculum control and university-shared governance.
Educators warn changes are part of a conservative blueprint, and academic freedom is at stake. Conservative leaders say they will foster intellectual diversity, create more career pathways and bolster the marketplace.
 Faculty control wanes in Virginia, nationwide

Faculty have traditionally held power over university curriculums, but that eroded significantly over the years, according to leading Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth.
Holsworth, also a former Virginia Commonwealth University professor and board of visitors member, said Gov. Glenn Youngkin is exercising a much heavier hand through his board appointees.
Boards create university budgets, hire and fire presidents, appoint faculty and rubber stamp curriculums created by faculty. But, their decisions have become increasingly intrusive and politicized, according to Holsworth.
While the deterioration of independent governance and hiring of tenured faculty has been ongoing for decades, it has been exacerbated by recent politics and the rise of Trump.
Students and faculty at VCU and George Mason University spent years drafting new learning requirements to teach topics such as systemic racism, gender studies and workplace inequity. Some of the content paralleled the wake from 2020 and its summer of protests against police brutality.
The new initiatives — called “racial literacy” at VCU and “Just Societies” at GMU — were set to be implemented in 2024. But Youngkin’s education secretary requested to view the syllabi, and soon after both universities canceled the requirements.
Christian Martinez, Youngkin’s former press secretary, called the course requirements a “thinly veiled attempt to incorporate the progressive left’s groupthink on Virginia’s students.”
“That’s a step beyond what we’ve ever seen,” Holsworth said.
 Launching the blueprint

The blueprint for the board interference was first tested in Florida, according to Amy Reid. She taught at the New College of Florida, one of the Sunshine State’s few public liberal arts schools, until Gov. Ron DeSantis made moves in 2023 to remove the gender studies program she directed.
DeSantis appointed six new members to the college’s board of trustees in 2023, the majority of whom lived outside Florida and were conservative activists, according to Reid.
DeSantis’ appointees voted to end the school’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Office, according to Reid. They also removed university officials and faculty who didn’t fit their vision of the school, including the president, provost, some LGBTQ+ employees and a Chinese adjunct professor seeking asylum from his home country.
Reid now works at PEN America, a free speech organization that pushes back against what it calls educational gag orders.
Officials increasingly use indirect tactics to achieve censorial goals, Reid said. Coordinated attacks have shifted from K-12 to higher education in recent years.
 Spike in bills targeting higher-ed

Over 90 bills to reform higher education at public universities, and some private ones, have been introduced across 26 states in the past three years, according to PEN America data. At least 16 have become law as of March 6.
The highest number of bills were introduced after Trump’s reelection.
Almost half of the legislation focused on eliminating or preventing DEI initiatives that promoted concepts related to race, color, religion, sex, ethnicity or national origin — from curriculum to faculty training. But other legislation challenges traditional higher-ed structure by putting university governance, the decision-making power given to student and faculty bodies, on the chopping block.
Several bills seek to eliminate or weaken tenure status for faculty, which was created to safeguard academic freedom from politics. Others strip universities of independent accreditation standards, which certify the quality of education at colleges.
Some bills break tradition by giving states authority to establish programs and curriculum where American values and ideas, or Western civilization, are predominantly taught.
Even if legislation fails, governors can censor higher education through their appointed board members, Reid said.
Although there is a government push for free speech, students need an education free from their censorship, Reid said. This is precisely why academic freedom, shared governance and institutional autonomy are needed.
 Project 2025, Heritage Foundation take aim at Virginia

Conservative groups such as the Claremont Institute, Manhattan Institute and the Heritage Foundation are coordinating efforts between states, Reid said. Members push initiatives and propose candidates for university boards. The Heritage Foundation created the almost 1,000 page Project 2025 blueprint to reshape the American government.
Trump denied his involvement with Project 2025 while campaigning, but immediately began enacting parts of the plan once in office, including efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.
The Heritage Foundation’s influence has increasingly grown in Virginia. Youngkin, who has deep ties to the foundation, has appointed Project 2025 authors to the boards of visitors at GMU and the University of Virginia.
Virginia universities have complied with Trump and Youngkin’s efforts to cancel racial learning requirements, dissolve DEI programs and instate new campus speech policies that limit protesting. Medical centers at UVA and VCU also stopped providing gender affirming care for people under age 19, per an executive order from Trump.
Trump has threatened to cut federal funding for research and student financial aid for schools that do not comply. Virginia ranks 13th in research and development performance, according to the Virginia Mercury. UVA received $549 million in research awards in 2024, according to their report. VCU received $200.1 million, according to spokesman Brian McNeill.
 Universities are bloated, Heritage Foundation says

The Heritage Foundation aims to wind down federal involvement in higher education, which it says has a monopoly on accreditation standards and student loans, according to its policy analyst Madison Marino Doan. The foundation wants more privatization on those fronts.
Additionally, it believes university administrations are bloated bureaucracies that must be held accountable for increasing tuition and pushing DEI, Marino Doan said. Reform efforts are a result of Americans’ dissatisfaction with costs and the diminishing value of career paths in the humanities.
“Institutions have increasingly prioritized what we would say is ideological activism and oftentimes bureaucratic bloat over academic excellence and student outcomes,” Marino Doan said.
The plan is to remove federal funds and accreditation standards and transfer power to individual states. Those moves would make way for more specific standards per industry, and emphasize alternative postsecondary education options such as trade schools and apprenticeships.
“I will fire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics,” Trump said while campaigning.
Trump directed the secretary of education to deny accreditation to agencies that use DEI-based standards, in an executive order released April 22. Universities must be accredited by nationally-recognized agencies to be eligible for federal aid.
Higher-ed groups warn the accreditation order could give Trump more power and threaten academic freedom, according to the publication Inside Higher Ed.
 America moving ‘rapidly backwards’

Feagin, who recently retired from Texas A&M University, believes America has been “zigzagging” toward progress since the ‘40s, up until President Barack Obama was elected. Conservative demographics lashed back at Obama’s victory by forming populist factions like the Tea Party, utilizing political redistricting and eventually electing Trump.
Feagin said that with attacks on higher education and the destruction of federal programs with “no apparent purpose,” America is back to where it was in the early ‘60s and moving “rapidly backwards.”
Gutting research is economic suicide in the face of China’s faster development, Feagin said. Cutting diversity will only make universities unpleasant. Efforts to stop the diversification of America will only be temporary victories.
“You can slow it down. You can make it miserable,” Feagin said. “That’s what Trump is doing.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)I received an email about an event happening on May 17, 2025, at Virginia Commonwealth University, marking the 71st anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, which dismantled segregation in schools nationwide, hosted by the Virginians for Reconciliation Project.
What struck me immediately — and not in a good way — was that the panel consisted entirely of white men. It stopped me cold. Everyone on the email thread I was on was outraged too.
  A flyer promoting a May 17 panel event commemorating the 71st anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case that struck down segregation in schools.
That is, until I realized that the panelists were all former governors of Virginia. And in case you didn’t know, Virginia has only ever elected one Black governor, L. Douglas Wilder, in 1989. Every other governor since the 1600s has been a white man.
My initial reaction was to criticize the lack of diversity on the panel, which seemed ironic since they were supposed to be discussing one of the most pivotal moments in American history that diversified classrooms in Virginia and beyond. Why not include former Gov. Wilder, now in his 90s? Or the current Black Speaker of the House? Or the Senate Majority Leader, a Black woman? Or the sitting Lt. Governor, a Black Republican woman? The only Black woman involved is the moderator — a sitting state delegate from Richmond — but she’s not on the panel itself.
Let’s be honest: A panel of all white men cannot reflect the full breadth of Virginia’s past — or its future. But these men did hold the highest office in the commonwealth. They shaped Virginia’s policies, laws, and institutions, for better or worse. And if we are serious about reconciliation, we must be willing to hear from those who held power, even when that power excluded us.
This is not about agreement — it’s about accountability. We can’t change the systems we don’t understand. These governors can offer insights into what shaped Virginia, where it failed and where we must go.
Reconciliation is not passive. It is active, inclusive and uncomfortable. It requires listening — even when what we hear doesn’t reflect our values or experience.
We are in a moment of necessary tension in Virginia and across America, vacillating between reverence and reckoning,  history and hope.
This upcoming panel brings together seven former governors from both parties. Yes, they are all white. Yes, they are all men. The concerns raised about the lack of racial and gender diversity they represent are valid. In a nation still reckoning with the legacies of segregation and systemic exclusion, representation is not just symbolic; it’s substantive. Diversity brings perspective. It brings the lived experience of those long shut out of decision-making rooms.
So why bring these seven men together now?
Because this is not a celebration of the past — it’s a confrontation with it. Some of these governors resisted change. Some enabled it. All of them governed during periods of transformation or stagnation. If they are honest, their reflections can illuminate the forces that shaped us, and the courage or silence that defined their terms.
This is not the end of the conversation. It’s the beginning.
I hope this panel helps Virginians become bridge builders and legacy leaders. Seventy-one years after Brown, we don’t need self-congratulation, we need truth-telling. We need space to ask: What did we get wrong? What must we do differently? Who do we still leave behind?
In November, Virginia will elect a woman as governor — no matter who wins. That’s never happened before. That’s not symbolic. That’s transformational. That’s the arc of history bending,  finally, toward equity.
Her time has come: Virginia will, after four centuries, have a woman governor

The panel is only one piece of a broader program. And to VCU’s credit, the commitment to reconciliation is real. But reconciliation must be rooted in honesty. It must reflect the fullness of who we are and who we aspire to be.
So, if I may offer some unsolicited advice to enhance this program:

Add current Black leaders to the event. That could include the Black female Lt. Governor, the Black Speaker of the House, or former Black statewide officials.
Don’t frame their inclusion as an afterthought. Make it clear they are essential to the vision of this event.
Emphasize that their leadership represents the future of Virginia. Not just diversity for diversity’s sake, but the new center of power, voice, and vision.

To honor Brown, we must amplify those carrying the torch forward, not just those who held it in the past. We must widen the circle, deepen the dialogue, and ensure that reconciliation includes truth, representation and responsibility.
Reconciliation, after all, is not a moment — it is a movement. It calls us to listen across difference, to learn from power and to lift the voices long silenced. We are building a new bridge for Virginia, one strong enough to carry us all.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio wanted to slip a sweeping measure into a spending bill that would gut the Federal Trade Commission. Critics say it’s no coincidence that the FTC is suing mammoth health care conglomerates and tech giants like Amazon.
Jordan is chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee. Last week, it released a version of a bill that included tax cuts, federal spending cuts and more spending at the border.
It also contained provisions that would give Trump sweeping new powers to gut government regulations. It would also transfer funds and personnel currently controlled by the FTC to the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department — without the FTC’s unique enforcement authority going with them. 
The measure was abruptly nixed, but it would have effectively killed antitrust powers Congress created more than a century ago.
The FTC history
Amid abuses to consumers by big corporations, the Federal Trade Commission Act was passed in 1914. Antitrust enforcement by the Department of Justice dates back further, to 1903.
But the Justice Department is overseen by the attorney general, a presidential appointee. Attorneys general traditionally have had a high degree of independence, but Trump is said to be politicizing the Justice Department at a breakneck pace.
The FTC was created in part to be more independent. It’s governed by commissioners from both parties who are appointed to fixed terms that can be renewed.
Earlier this year, Trump tried to fire the two Democratic commissioners, but they say the move was illegal, and they’re fighting it in court. Antitrust advocates said Trump was doing that as a favor to his billionaire supporters such as Elon Musk.
The two Democratic commissioners, Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter, acted to block the Kroger-Albertson’s mega-merger, and they voted to sue Amazon, saying it is “illegally maintaining monopoly power.” 
Under Jordan’s leadership, the Judiciary Committee in 2023 attacked the FTC on behalf of Musk. He’s the world’s richest man, whom Trump is allowing to make deep cuts to federal programs for the elderly, veterans, the poor, and agencies that promote science and health.
“THE WEAPONIZATION OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: AN AGENCY’S OVERREACH TO HARASS ELON MUSK’S TWITTER,” read the all-caps title of the Jordan-led committee’s report. 
A year earlier, the FTC had charged Twitter with using deceptively gathered data from users to target ads at them. If true, it would be added to the fact that an unofficial, Musk-run entity is now collecting much more sensitive government data. It’s raised concerns among several federal judges who said such collections invite abuse and likely violate the law.
“One of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency lieutenants working in the Social Security Administration has been pushing dubious claims about noncitizens voting, apparently using access to data that court records suggest (the so-called Department of Government Efficiency) isn’t supposed to have,” NPR reported earlier this month.
The proposal from Jordan to gut the FTC could have halted major initiatives to regulate giant health conglomerates that own powerful pharmacy middlemen, said Bedoya, one of the commissioners Trump is trying to fire.
Jordan’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on this story.
PBMs
Each of the three conglomerates — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts — is among the 15 largest corporations in the United States. Each owns a top-ten health insurer and each owns a pharmacy middleman known as a pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM. 
Combined, the PBMs control nearly 80% of the insured drug transactions in the United States. They decide which drugs are covered and use that power to extract rebates from drugmakers. They also determine varying reimbursements to pharmacies — including ones owned by their parent companies as well as the pharmacies with which they compete. Critics — including four-fifths of state attorneys general — say they have a conflict of interest under the arrangement, and that they abuse it.
Last October, the FTC sued the conglomerates, saying they used their dominance in multiple parts of the marketplace to illegally jack up the price of insulin — a drug millions of diabetics need to survive.
The lawsuit comes after the agency in 2022 undertook a major investigation of the health conglomerates. In January, it released an interim report accusing the PBMs of using their dominance to instigate wild price hikes and possibly steer business to affiliated pharmacies.
Politico recently reported that Jordan said his move to consolidate the FTC into the Justice Department was meant to “address the cost of over-regulation.”
“Part of our jurisdiction in Judiciary deals with regulatory concerns and so we are looking at … spending and costs associated with certain regulations. That’s why that language is written the way it was,” Politico reported him as saying.
Many businesses facing regulation — and their advocates in government — have long focused only on the costs. But government regulation can also protect health, safety, the environment, economic stability and competition. Some researchers have said regulation can always be smarter, but its benefits far outweigh the costs.
In a social media post last week, Bedoya, the FTC commissioner, said Jordan’s proposed changes to the agency served another agenda. 
“This will gut the FTC,” Bedoya wrote. “FTC is trying to finish a study that already showed how pharmacy middlemen mark up cancer drugs by up to 4,000%. It’s also suing them for allegedly competing to raise insulin prices. If this passes I have no idea what’ll happen to that study and lawsuit.”
Bedoya added, “Take the lawsuit. The draft bill purports to transfer FTC lawyers and lawsuits to DOJ — but it doesn’t transfer the laws that FTC enforces, or authority to enforce those laws. Look (at) page 98 — employees, assets, funding — but no authorities.”
Bedoya also said that when it created the FTC, Congress meant to augment the government’s antitrust powers. Jordan’s changes would remove the government’s ability to police “unfair methods of competition,” Bedoya said, implying that Jordan was trying to slash the government’s power to police wealthy corporations in an era when the political influence of the mega-rich is exploding and the wealth gap is yawning. 
“The purpose behind the FTC’s creation in 1914 was to supplement the existing enforcement mechanism (and enforcement gap created by) the Department of Justice,” Bedoya said on X. “When FTC was created in 1914, it alone was authorized to stop something called ‘unfair methods of competition.’ DOJ did not get this” under Jordan’s proposal.

(Screenshot from DES report)Legislation spurred by failures to properly manage “trash juice” at several of the state’s landfills hangs in uncertainty after a Senate committee vote last week.
The state already requires landfill applicants to create plans for managing leachate, the liquid pollution created when precipitation mixes with waste. House Bill 566, which is backed by bipartisan sponsors and moved easily through the House, would require more details from new landfills and those seeking to expand about the treatment of that liquid pollution and transportation for facilities that treat it off site. 
But the legislation hit a hurdle April 29 in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where members voted, 3-2, to recommend the bill be rereferred to committee, leaving its fate for the session unclear. Backers of the bill expressed surprise at the vote — and wished that concerns about it had been aired more publicly. They pointed to leachate management issues around the state, including some in April around the time the bill was first heard in the Senate.
Before the vote, Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican, said he was “just not quite convinced yet that this is right.” He said he wanted “the opportunity just to look at this and see if we can resolve” what he saw as issues in the bill “before we moved it forward.” He did not specify what those issues were.
“I’m not necessarily opposed to the concept of it,” Pearl said. “Just the workability of it — I’ve had some conversations since our hearing that seem to be very problematic, and I would not want to put something in place that … was going to create problems, unintended consequences.”
Pearl did not respond to a request for comment from the Bulletin asking who those conversations were with and what parts of the bill he found problematic.
Rep. Nicholas Germana, the Keene Democrat leading the bill, said he had gone to “great lengths to reach out to the industry and to (the Department of Environmental Services) to make sure that this was workable.”
“It was surprising,” Germana said of the vote, “and I wish there was more of an opportunity to try to address those concerns, but it’s hard to address them when they’re not raised in a public setting.”
Germana said he hopes he can clear up concerns with senators on the committee to “see if there’s any chance that we might be able to change the outcome in the Senate.” If not, “this fall, when they take up retained bills again, hopefully there’s an opportunity for a discussion about … what the issues are.”
Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, said before the vote that besides a technical change Germana had planned to suggest, “I’m not clear … what the issues are.” 
“This is one where we know … there’s been spills, there’s been problems, there’s been overflows,” Watters said. “And so while I think it’s always good to keep working on things, I think at this point I’d like to vote against rerefer, because I think it might be possible for us to get a bill done.” 
The other Democrat on the committee, Sen. Cindy Rosenwald of Nashua, joined him in opposing the motion. She said leachate management problems seemed to be getting worse because of “more intense rainfall.”
Adam Finkel, a Dalton resident and former federal regulator who has advocated in the Legislature for more protective landfill standards, said he’s starting to see “that fewer and fewer opponents of legislation, at least in the environmental area, are bothering to come to hearings and give their opinions on the record, because they don’t have to.”
“It’s a win-win for them,” he said, “if they can not have to make their arguments in public, where they’re weak and can be refuted, and they get to make them in private, in a setting where they’re more important than anything the public says.”
Harmful chemicals from trash seep into leachate, meaning its mismanagement can pose serious environmental and public health risks. This risk was brought into the spotlight by the recent management problems, including hundreds of leachate-related violations at Casella Waste Systems’ landfill in the northern town of Bethlehem. (The company is now locked in a legal battle with the state over its bid to build another landfill in the nearby town of Dalton.)
Germana said “the day after I introduced that bill to the Senate, they had a problem at Bethlehem” with leachate.
In April, Casella was doing maintenance on its leachate collection system at the Bethlehem landfill, said Jeff Weld, the company’s vice president of communications. 
Michael Wimsatt, DES’ waste management division director, said the department had been notified of this maintenance, which was likely to increase the level of leachate on the liner, since the pump could not be operated during the process. 
On the morning of April 23, operators at Casella’s Bethlehem landfill noticed a leachate pump in one of the pump stations was not working, according to a memo from DES waste management specialist Austin Mills. Weld said the company “immediately investigated and began monitoring the (affected) pump house and manually pumping, pending repair the following day.”
The morning of April 24, an electrician made repairs, “restoring normal operation to the pumping system by 10:30AM,” per the memo. 
A company official, Lindsey Menard, told Mills that the transducer level “read 100+ inches when the operation was restored,” according to the memo. At the time of the phone call with the department that afternoon, Menard said the level was at 14 inches.
Leachate levels are not supposed to exceed 12 inches on the liner of a landfill. But Wimsatt said the 100-plus-inch reading on the transducer wasn’t equivalent to the level of leachate on the liner. If the transducer reading was accurate, the amount on the liner was probably “3 feet less than the 100 inches,” he said. The department was still reviewing the incident, and it was not yet clear what the highest leachate level on the liner had been, he said.
In the department memo, Mills said he reminded the Casella representative that the state “requires the permittee to notify the department as soon as practicable and that we were over 24 hours since they were first aware of an issue.” Menard said “she would remind the operations staff” at the landfill, the memo said.
There had also been exceedances days before this incident, resulting in leachate levels reaching just over 63 inches and 46 inches on the liner system in two pump stations, according to an incident report. Weld said the exceedances were “reported in a timely fashion verbally and in writing,” and said pumps had to be shut off while cleaning was being done.
HB 566 would not affect the Bethlehem landfill, but its handling of leachate has been cited frequently as proponents of the bill have made their case for it. Asked for the company’s stance on the bill, Weld said there was already “significant oversight” for leachate management in the state, and that the “ability to predict the future of leachate technology, availability of disposal sites, transportation options, etc. at the time of permit application for the lifespan of a landfill is not realistic.”
The bill would put the existing requirement for leachate management plans into statute, in addition to setting more detailed standards. It would include language that requires DES, before issuing a permit, to make a positive determination that the permit application includes a detailed leachate management plan. 
The state currently requires landfills to: have at least two locations for leachate disposal; estimate how much leachate they will generate; and describe how leachate will be handled at the landfill before being shipped somewhere else for disposal, according to DES. They must also have procedures in place to bring down leachate levels to a foot or lower within a week of a 100-year storm event. Regulations also include details about on-site leachate management systems.
Eliot Wessler, a Whitefield resident involved in solid waste advocacy, said this bill does “a lot more, in my opinion, than what’s in the existing DES rules.”
“It makes very, very clear that a solid waste permit applicant has to provide detailed information about their leachate plans,” Wessler said in an interview, “and not only in the short run, but in the long run, including what happens, you know, at the point of closure and even in the post-closure period.”
He had been surprised by the vote, he said, telling senators in testimony before the bill hearing that he “fully expected” them to recommend it for passage. 
“How can you be opposed to trying to require … new landfills and expansions of landfills to be more concerned about how they manage leachate,” Wessler said, “and to give DES more opportunities to correct any problems with their leachate management plan before the permits are issued?”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-11.38.33-AM-1024x767.png,,,2025-05-05 06:01:28.634090

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.












There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company




23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Erika Bolstad/Stateline) BOISE, Idaho — The day the flag bill came up for a vote in the Idaho Senate this spring, state Sen. Melissa Wintrow had no plans to speak against it. As the top Democratic leader in her chamber, she had already spent the legislative session in constant, vocal opposition to the Republican-dominated legislative agenda.
“I thought: ‘Oh, this stupid flag bill once again,’” Wintrow said. “I’ll just vote ‘no’ quietly because I’ve just really been in people’s grille about things.”
But then the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Ben Toews, began passing out flyers about the legislation, one of two proposed bills to limit which flags can be flown at schools and on state and local government property. The only photos on the handout were of rainbow-striped Pride flags flying in Boise: one on a flagpole in front of City Hall, and then others on light poles along Harrison Boulevard, two blocks from Wintrow’s home.
“When he sat that picture in front of me on that desk, I thought: ‘That’s enough. Just always picking and bullying,’” Wintrow said. “The state’s going to tell us what to do, when they can’t even address the larger problems like affordable housing? That’s what’s on people’s minds. A good working wage, health care. It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.”
In recent weeks, both Idaho and Utah have enacted bans that prohibit Pride flags from being displayed on government property, pitting lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislatures against the more progressive capitals of Boise and Salt Lake City, where the flags are often flown at city hall.











It’s as if they don’t know how to govern. So they just pick these culture war things.


– Idaho Democratic state Sen. Melissa Wintrow



In Utah, the law allows the state flag, the U.S. flag, U.S. military flags, the POW/MIA flag, local government flags, tribal nation flags, university and school flags and Olympic flags. Idaho’s list is similar, but includes a provision in the school flag law that prohibits flags with political viewpoints, “including but not limited to flags or banners regarding a political party, race, sexual orientation, gender, or a political ideology.”
Lawmakers in Florida, Texas and at least 13 other states are considering similar flag prohibitions, said Logan Casey, director of policy research with the Movement Advancement Project, which studies LGBTQ+ rights. The flag bills go beyond symbolism, Casey said. Rather, they are part of a broad and coordinated legislative attack on LGBTQ+ people that seeks to strip them of rights and erase or make difficult their participation in public life.
“Sometimes those attacks are very material, like denying access to health care or the ability to participate safely in public life and activities,” Casey said. “Sometimes they’re a little more symbolic, like these flag bills.”
‘Get rid of everything’
The rainbow-colored Pride flag was conjured up by artist and drag queen Gilbert Baker in 1978, at the suggestion of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, as a symbol of progress and pride for that year’s San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade. Since then, the rainbow-colored flag and its many design iterations have grown into worldwide emblems of solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights.
Although the laws in Idaho and Utah don’t ban Pride flags specifically, bill sponsors and their supporters made it clear they want to see such flags removed from city halls, schools and state buildings. Idaho state Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican who sponsored the bill limiting which flags can fly at schools, said in an interview that Pride flags are disruptive to classroom learning because discussion about them takes up “an amazing amount of political bandwidth.”
“The best way to do it is to get rid of everything,” said Hill, who represents Eagle, a suburb northwest of Boise. “So the only thing you have in the classroom is the American flag, the state flag. And people will say inclusivity and all this. Well, the American flag is as inclusive as it can get.”
Despite the new law, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean, a Democrat, continues to fly a Pride flag in front of City Hall, just below the city’s own and adjacent to poles flying the U.S. and state of Idaho flags. The Pride flag’s presence, within view of the state Capitol, elicited a sternly worded letter from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a Republican.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

Idaho’s law, which went into effect April 3, has no penalty for local governments or officials who fly flags in defiance of the ban, an oversight lawmakers told Labrador they’ll rectify in subsequent legislative sessions. Instead, the law relies on “the good will of elected officials for its enforcement,” Labrador wrote, warning McLean that she should “comply with the law out of a sense of duty to your oath of office.”
He threatened, too, that lawmakers could “deny state tax revenues and other appropriations to the City of Boise or any other governmental entity that does not follow state law.”
McLean countered that the new law is unconstitutional, and that the city will challenge threats to withhold funding. Pride flags have flown in Boise for a decade, she told Labrador, and represent a commitment to “a safe and welcoming city where everyone means just that — everyone.”
“The Constitutional rights of our residents are not subject to — cannot be subject to — the political whims of legislative disapproval,” McLean wrote, “and we will not step back from them simply because the principles our community cherishes make some in state government uncomfortable.”
Boise’s city council is considering a resolution confirming that any flags it flies, including Pride flags, are official city flags — a move the council says will ensure it is complying with state law. In the meantime, the city will “continue to fly the flags on City Hall Plaza that represent our community and speak to our values of caring for people and welcoming all,” McLean said in a statement.
Early on Easter morning, several people climbed a ladder propped up next to the city’s flagpole to cover the Pride flag and a separate flag (honoring organ and tissue donation) with trash bags. They also raised the Appeal to Heaven flag, a Revolutionary War-era flag that has come to represent sympathy to the Christian nationalist movement and to President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A few hours later, the mayor lowered the flags, which are on a locked halyard, to remove the trash bags and the Appeal to Heaven flag.
It capped a challenging sequence of events in Boise and nearby Meridian, which drew national attention this spring when school officials ordered a middle school teacher to take down a sign with the phrase “Everyone is welcome here” from her classroom. Amid the backlash, people in Boise printed T-shirts and yard signs in support of the teacher and the sign’s message.

Similar signs emerged in Boise and surrounding communities this spring after school officials told a middle school teacher to take down a sign in her classroom containing the phrase.

The mayor’s response to the flag law and the support for the classroom message aren’t directly connected, but both reflect how many in the community insist on sending a welcoming message at this moment in American history, said Christina Bruce-Bennion, executive director of Boise’s Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which helped coordinate support for the teacher.
‘It is very targeted’
In Salt Lake City, the flag ban threatens to end a long-standing annual tradition. Typically, the mayor’s office kicks off Pride Month festivities in June with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall, said Chad Call, executive director of the Utah Pride Center, which puts on the state’s annual Pride festivities. Events include a parade through the streets of Salt Lake City with a 200-foot Pride flag — which remains a legal form of First Amendment expression and has taken place most years since 1997.
“We have a city council that wants to celebrate Pride month,” Call said. “They want to celebrate the queer community in the month of June. And then we have a state government that does not want that happening in our capital city. And so it is very targeted.”
‘It was the life raft’: Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida’s capital city

One of the flag bill’s sponsors, state Rep. Trevor Lee, said in an interview that his legislation was prompted by constituents who told him they’re “sick and tired of seeing a political agenda being pushed in their face” on government property, particularly with flags featuring transgender representation.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable if it’s something they don’t agree with,” said Lee, who represents a district north of Salt Lake City. “And so we’re trying to keep it very specific and let schools focus on teaching the things that they need to, and let government buildings just fly their city flag for heaven’s sakes, or the state flag or the American flag.”
One Utah parent, Republican activist Aaron Bullen, said he began objecting to Pride flags several years ago after one of his children, then a fifth grader, was “visibly upset” after school one day. Bullen said his son told him he’d seen what’s known as a Progress Pride flag, a newer iteration of the original rainbow-striped flag. It includes an arrow on the left side composed of pink, blue and white stripes to represent transgender people, as well as brown and black stripes to represent queer people of color. The flag was in the school’s computer lab.
Bullen said he complained to school leaders at the district, south of Salt Lake City, and the flag came down. But Bullen felt as though the flag’s presence undermined what he and his wife teach at home and model to their children as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly how they interpret the church’s stance on transgender people and marriage for same-sex couples.
“It says, basically, ‘we approve of gay marriage’ when that flag is up,” Bullen said. “And that’s something that my religion is explicitly against. And so you have a teacher of my son, a person in authority that they’d like to be able to trust and to follow the instructions of, but they’re saying, ‘your parents who taught you this other thing, they’re wrong. Your religion is wrong.’ That’s what that flag means.”











It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would.


– Aaron Bullen, a Utah parent and Republican activist



He added: “It’s not the job of a school to try to teach morals differently than parents would. Parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to rear their children. And it’s not a school’s place to oppose the religion of the parents or the teachings of the parents.”
Unlike in Idaho, Utah’s flag ban carries a $500 fine per day for failure to comply with the law. But in Utah, the law took effect without Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’s signature. The governor declined to sign the bill into law, saying the state’s residents are “tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix.”
Call, of the Utah Pride Center, said that while it’s discouraging for LGBTQ+ people to witness their representation further erased in public spaces, they refuse in Utah to allow the flag law to diminish the spirit of their Pride events, among the largest in the nation.
“Our counterculture here is really, really strong,” Call said. “And I think the thing that probably defines our Utah Pride as being kind of unique is the incredibly strong community that it brings together. There’s tens, hundreds of thousands of people that come out to support it.”

Like many seemingly inexplicable practices that just sort of happened over time, designers of our state government could probably never have imagined something like “crossover week” at the North Carolina legislature.
“Crossover” is an artificial semi-annual deadline by which bills must be approved by at least one body – the Senate or the House – in order to remain eligible for passage that year. This year’s deadline is this Thursday May 8.
While the reasoning behind crossover deadline –to  cull hundreds of bills and spur lawmakers to action – probably makes some sense, the practical result is that scores of bills will be approved this week in an absurdly rushed fashion.
Indeed, large numbers of dramatic state law changes will be brought closer to enactment with, quite literally, just a few minutes of discussion and scarce – if any – public input.
The bottom line: The crossover deadline has become obsolete. In a large, diverse and fast growing state of 10 million people, lawmakers ought to be serious and disciplined enough to get their work done without having to cram like college students.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Voting legislation is advancing in the Ohio Senate. Last week, a committee approved a measure prohibiting ranked choice voting and heard from proponents of a plan to require proof of citizenship for voting.
Both bills are retreads of proposals that didn’t make the cut last session.
Ranked Choice
The measure banning ranked choice voting, Senate Bill 63, has the backing of well-known conservative lobbying outfits like the Heritage Foundation and a few lesser-known ones, too.
Honest Elections Project Action is one of a several a 501(c) organization connected with former Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo. The Opportunity Solutions Project is a Florida thinktank that lobbies state and federal governments on issues like restricting food assistance and loosening child labor laws. When state lawmakers proposed raising the threshold for approving constitutional amendments, OSP was the only group to show up.
Opportunity Solutions Projects’ parent organization got more than $2 million from Leonard Leo’s Concord Fund.
But for all that conservative backing, the measure itself is bipartisan. State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, is co-sponsoring the bill, calling ranked choice a “disaster waiting to happen.”
Supporters believe ranked choice will give voters more options, but that’s precisely the problem for DeMora. He warned about races in Oregon with 50-plus candidates for city council and described a hypothetical four-person race where the top two finishers got 45% and 30% of the vote.
“I’d expect each of us to agree that the first candidate with 45% of the vote won — that’s a clear victory,” DeMora argued. “No one here today would be upset if they won their next election by 15%, but using ranked choice voting, that candidate could very easily lose.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDenise Riley from the organization Rank the Vote Ohio, pushed back on DeMora’s horror stories. Making an allusion to Baskin Robbins, she argued DeMora and other supporters want to reduce voting to a binary choice — chocolate or vanilla.
“I’m here to tell you that the public really wants and likes more choices and having more say in their government,” she wrote. “You should give them that say. It is your job to represent the people you serve.”
The measure also got pushback from the conservative perspective as well. Marcell Strbich is a retired Air Force veteran and grassroots “election integrity” activist. He regularly testifies in favor more restrictive elections policies, and submitted testimony in opposition of the bill in March along with 60-plus others.
He noted — as several others have — that lawmakers actually can’t ban ranked choice voting. The state supreme court determined more than 70 years ago that local elections are a local matter. The sponsors attempt to sidestep that ruling by withholding state funding if a municipality approves a ranked choice voting system.
“If Ohio’s Republicans and Democrats want to ban RCV, amend the Ohio Constitution,” Strbich argued. “That’s the transparent, democratic way to respect our legal framework. Instead, S.B. 63 takes a shortcut, using state funds to coerce counties and granting the Secretary of State vague, unchecked power. This isn’t reform — it’s a power grab.”
Last week, though, the Senate committee approved the bill as-is. It’s awaiting a floor vote.
Proof of citizenship
The Senate measure, S.B. 153, would require every voter to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. Under current law only citizens may vote, and officials regularly comb through the rolls looking for individuals improperly registered. The only deterrent against registering and voting illegally is the threat of prosecution. That’s worked remarkably well.
Nearly every registration flagged by the secretary of state has turned out to be a false positive. A rigorous review by the attorney general found just six cases of illegal voting. In an electorate of 8.1 million voters that’s .00007%, or less than one ten thousandth of 1%.
The bill, sponsored by state Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, and Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, tosses in a few other conservative wish list items alongside the citizenship provisions. They place new strictures on the petition process, including requiring paid canvassers wear a badge identifying themselves as such, and they eliminate the use of ballot drop boxes.
The only group to show up in support of the idea was the Foundation for Government Accountability Action — the new name for Opportunity Solutions Project. The organization submitted testimony under both names for the ranked choice measure. Rather than sending their own staffers, the organization hired local lobbyists like Harrison Siders.
Siders praised the measure for closing a “loophole” when it comes to potentially illegal registrations — already a felony offense — and the requirement of monthly voter roll audits — a likely violation of federal law prohibiting any systematic removal of a voter within 90 days of a federal election.
He argued the bill “respects the rights of lawful voters while putting in place practical, achievable safeguards that will fortify our election system against fraud.”
Notably, University of Maryland researchers have found more than 21.3 million Americans — more than 9% of voting age citizens — don’t have ready access to the documents required under the bill.
DeMora pressed Siders on the ballot drop boxes and he brought up highly publicized fire-bombings in the Portland, OR area, but acknowledged no ballots in Ohio have been compromised.
“If someone wants to fire-bomb a ballot drop off box, they can fire-bomb a post box,” DeMora continued. “How is this going to protect the integrity of ballots, of absentee ballots and stuff, when if someone wants to bomb something, they’re going to bomb something?”
Siders said a ballot drop box likely has more ballots he argued than a home or public post box and lawmakers should focus on “critical points” in the voting system.

Early voting is already underway. Depending on where you live, you may have city council seats, judges or a school levy. But every ballot across the state will have Issue 2.
It is a constitutional amendment meant to support local infrastructure projects, which many voters have said they want to see started expeditiously, since Ohio roads are no joke.
“You got to keep swerving around all these potholes, the second you take your eye off the road, you’re setting yourself up for danger,” Akron resident Eric Makowski said.
Issue 2, on the ballot on May 6, is meant to fix the problem and make the roads safer.
Every 10 years, voters choose whether or not to renew the state’s ability to issue billions in bonds for the State Capital Improvement Program (SCIP) and the Local Transportation Improvement Program (LTIP).
“We have lots of discussions about what we should spend money on, obviously, but almost all Ohioans agree on roads and bridges and infrastructure,” Huffman added.
This year, Issue 2 is the bond package paying for local infrastructure, roads, bridges and other things.

These grants cover roads, bridges, water supply, wastewater treatment, stormwater collection and solid waste disposal. These bonds must be used for these projects.
Read the full ballot amendment here.
State Sen. Kent Smith (D-Euclid) explained that this money can only be used for general government infrastructure. The money would not be able to be used for other types of projects, like for entertainment.
“The Browns issue has percolated at the same time this issue has come up,” Smith said. “The two issues are not related whatsoever, but there is some confusion because of that.”
To be very clear — this bond issue is unrelated to the Cleveland Browns’ request for $600 million in bonds. This money would not be able to go to them.
Issue 2 has wide bipartisan support, from the Ohio Chamber of Commerce to each trade union. There seems to be no official, active campaign against it, but a couple of lawmakers are against it.
In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, state Rep. Jennifer Gross (R-West Chester) argued that Issue 2 isn’t helpful when Ohioans are already struggling with inflation.
“I encourage you to consider voting no on Issue 2… Did the state deliver income tax reform? Have we delivered property tax reform? Do we need more of your money? Vote accordingly,” she wrote.
Tim, a Cuyahoga County voter, saw and was convinced by Gross’s tweets, saying he didn’t think the state or cities deserved more.
“My taxes just go up every year and I think, ‘You know what, we can allocate some of that money towards the infrastructure we need,'” he said.
Huffman said that Ohioans should have safe roads – ones where you don’t need to swerve to avoid craters.
“Even if you’re not driving a car, you benefit from safety services who use the roads; you benefit from things that are delivered to your house,” the speaker said.
In short — voting yes would renew the public works project. Voting no would stop the program.

A record-high number of people in Franklin County experienced homelessness earlier this year, according to a new report. 
Franklin County’s annual Point-in-Time Count identified 2,556 people experiencing homelessness — a 7.4% increase from 2024. 
Point-in-Time counts are one-night estimates of sheltered and unsheltered people experiencing homelessness that are conducted nationwide in partnership with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Franklin County’s count took place on Jan. 23.

“When you are not building out enough infrastructure and diversity of infrastructure as you’re growing … or if the planning isn’t being caught up to that economic growth, to that population boom — what ends up happening is that housing becomes a commodity,” said Shannon Isom, executive director of the Community Shelter Board.  “With all commodities, when you have a scarcity, it also allows for prices to go up. When prices go up, people are literally being priced out, which is exactly what’s happening right now.” 
Individual sheltered homelessness went up by 14% compared to 2024 while the number of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness decreased by 12%, according to the report. 
A little more than half of people experiencing homelessness were men (57%), 42% were women and 1% were non-binary. 55% were Black, 33% were white and 3% were Hispanic, according to the report. 
There was a 31% increase in unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness, a 14% increase in single adults experiencing homelessness, and a 7% increase in veterans experiencing homelessness, according to the report. 
There was a 21% decrease in people with severe mental illness experiencing homelessness, a 31% decrease in the number of domestic violence survivors experiencing homelessness, and a 2% decrease in the number of people experiencing chronic homelessness, according to the report. 
Franklin County is Ohio’s most populous county with 1,356,303 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the region is projected to experience 16% of overall homelessness by 2028, Isom said. 
Ohioans need to be making at least $20.81 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to a report last year by the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio.
Forty percent of people experiencing homelessness are employed, Isom said. 
“There’s just not enough homes, there’s just not enough real estate,” she said. “It’s difficult to live here within this region, again, because of the commodification of housing.”
There were 11,759 people experiencing homelessness in Ohio last year, according to HUD’s annual Homelessness Assessment Report.

(Photo by Jill Nolin/ Georgia Recorder)Shelby Hutton was a biologist studying sexually transmitted diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was planning to expand her gonorrhea research by starting doctoral studies in the fall.
But in early April, Hutton found herself suddenly unemployed and applying for a job at Starbucks.
As a scientist, Hutton said she had not expected to find herself among the legions of federal workers abruptly fired as part of the Trump administration’s plan to shrink the federal government through mass firings.
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to slash 10,000 job in late March, including 2,400 jobs at the CDC.
“Hundreds of good scientists and subject matter experts were among the cuts to federal employees,” Hutton said while standing outside the CDC in Atlanta. “This is the exact opposite of what RFK said would happen. I’ll be the first to say that there is a lot of improvement to be had in terms of government efficiency, but I really can’t picture a functional CDC without laboratorians.”
Hutton said she was in the middle of validating tests her team had developed for the molecular surveillance of gonorrhea that is resistant to antibiotics – work she said she doesn’t know of other labs doing – when she received the email dismissing her and her entire laboratory branch.
They didn’t have time to properly store specimens that Hutton described as “priceless.”
To Hutton, it feels like the deep cuts at the CDC are part of a backlash to the COVID-19 pandemic and lingering anger among some over shutdowns and other safety measures taken to control the spread of the virus.
“It absolutely feels like we’re the scapegoats. It feels like we’re being attacked,” Hutton said. “And I don’t think people realize how important the work that we do is and how much we care about the work we do in public health.”

Tuesday marked Trump’s 100th day in office, but the president has already seen his approval rating suffer in Georgia – a state he won last year after narrowly losing here in 2020.
Trump’s approval rating among Georgia voters is at 43%, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and conducted by the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs.
Anger over the cuts to the CDC has shown up at town halls, protests, press conferences and rallies outside the center’s Atlanta campus. Navy blue signs saying “Save the CDC” and “Save Public Health” can be seen in Atlanta front yards.
And signs of dissatisfaction with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal government are also reflected in the AJC’s poll.
A slight majority of the poll’s respondents – 51.5% – said they disapprove of those efforts to reduce the size of the government, many of them saying they strongly disapprove. Only 44% said they approved, with 4.5% unsure. The cuts were not popular with the independent voters polled, with about 55% of them frowning on the efforts.
But 74% of Republican voters surveyed said they enthusiastically back the cuts.
 ‘Everybody knows that you need CDC’

Sarah Boim, a former communication specialist at the CDC, says she is trying to remain hopeful that the wave of legal challenges in response to the cuts to the federal workforce will lead to her and many of her colleagues getting their jobs back.
But Boim is also not waiting around to see if that happens.
She and other CDC workers who lost their jobs have formed a group called Fired But Fighting. What started out as a newsletter to disseminate accurate information to workers trying to figure out their next steps has quickly evolved into a broader effort to push back on the cuts through spirited advocacy.
“We just need people to know how important it is to have public health managed at a federal level,” Boim said. “You cannot privatize public health. You need the money that a government has. You need the money of a country – we’re talking about B with billions – and you also need to be able to coordinate across the states. And you just can’t do that in a private company or an organization.” 
Fired But Fighting made a splash at Sen. Jon Ossoff’s recent town hall in Marietta, where they pressed the senator to do more to push back on the Trump administration.
The Democrat responded by saying the future of the nation’s public health infrastructure ultimately hinges on whether the American people “see and understand that they’re being put at risk” – and vote accordingly.
Republican state leaders have expressed at least tepid support for the cuts, though one said he was uneasy about the pace.
After the first round in February, Gov. Brian Kemp said “government can stand a little right-sizing.” Suwanee Republican U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick said he asked the White House to slow the pace of the firings after being caught in the crosshairs of an angry town hall, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in February that “I think we’re just moving a little too fast.” Congressman Mike Collins, a Jackson Republican, told WABE in February that the fired workers could go find other work in Georgia.
Boim, who was fired in February, said she is trying to find another job, broadening the search to even “health adjacent” roles.
“I have applied to 127 jobs,” she said. “I keep a spreadsheet. I’ve had two canceled interviews, both because they’re worried about federal funding, and a lot of thanks, but no thanks, because the job market is just saturated with people like me.”
She said she hopes the state’s Republican leaders will come around.
“I think they’re scared. If you’re not on Trump’s side, you’re against him, and I think that they’re scared of getting on his bad side,” Boim said. “I’m sorry, but people need to start being brave. I feel like CDC is a bipartisan issue. Everybody knows that you need CDC.”
 ‘Not going quietly’

Jill Daugherty said she knew the CDC’s injury center she worked at was likely poised to lose staffers, but the extent of the cuts left her stunned. The injury center was gutted after last month’s round of cuts, with Daugherty’s traumatic brain injury team wiped out. She thinks the goal is to dismantle the CDC.
“We really didn’t know which teams were going to get cut, so we were just kind of waiting around the whole week before, like, ‘Is it gonna be us? Is it gonna be us?’ And then it was everybody,” Daugherty said.
That’s how Daugherty found herself on the other side of the CDC’s entrance on a recent Tuesday afternoon holding a sign that said, “Firing experts… Ignoring science… CDC deserves better.” She stood on the curb as the passing vehicles – including her former colleagues leaving work for the day – honked their horns at the group of demonstrators.
The Tuesday rallies, organized by retired CDC staffers, have become a ritual since the mass firings started.
“You’re not just standing up for yourselves. You’re standing up for our country and the best that America represents,” U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, told fired CDC workers during a visit to one of the rallies in April.
Even when facing the prospect of unemployment and an uncertain future, many of the fired CDC workers still focus on the loss to the programs they had dedicated their careers to advancing when they talk about the mass firings.
Aryn Backus was a health communication specialist at the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health until Valentine’s Day, when hundreds of workers were swept up in the first round of dismissals. She said she remained hopeful that the firing would be reversed until her entire office was cut in April.
“So, I knew that even if I were to get my termination rescinded, there would be no job to go back to,” said Backus, who is the mother of a 1-year-old.
But even then, when standing at a microphone in front of reporters recently, Backus wanted to talk about the work her office did to curb smoking rates – and all the work left to do.
“The impact of these CDC cuts will be felt in public health for years to come. They’re not going to help make America healthy but will decrease public health programs that help save lives,” said Backus, who is also part of Fired But Fighting.
“That’s why the CDC employees are not going quietly. We are fighting back to not only protect civil service, but to protect public health.”

(Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Ohio weight-loss clinics continue to be disciplined over alleged unsafe practices and false claims that they pass regulatory muster. 
The actions come as demand skyrockets for drugs similar to those that go by the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro.
The Ohio Board of Pharmacy notified Slimbolic Weight Loss and Med Spa in Beavercreek that its license to distribute dangerous drugs was summarily suspended. The notice was accompanied by a 29-page document listing scores of alleged violations.
They included naming as the person responsible for the clinic a Maine doctor who had never been there, improper recordkeeping, storing adulterated drugs with those that weren’t, and improperly labeled drugs. Pharmacy board inspectors said workers at the clinic were also compounding drugs without the proper supervision and that they were doing so in a non-sterile environment.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe order said “there is clear and convincing evidence of a danger of immediate and serious harm to others due to Slimbolic’s method used to possess or distribute dangerous drugs, and the method of prescribing dangerous drugs used by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe drugs who holds a terminal distributor license or practices in the employ of or under contract with a terminal distributor.”
A call placed to the clinic was not returned.
The board of pharmacy has been cracking down on weight-loss clinics as the clamor for GLP-1 drugs has risen. They facilitate weight loss by slowing gastric emptying. The resultant weight loss can ease impacts of obesity, including diabetes and heart disease.
But the pharmacy board has reported numerous abuses by Ohio spas and weight-loss clinics over the past year. 
In January, the board suspended licenses to distribute dangerous drugs held by clinics in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus. It accused them of giving patients weight-loss drugs that were labeled “for research use only” and that came from “an unlicensed out-of-state-seller.” 
In March, it suspended the license of Rejuv and Renew Wellness Spa, which has clinics in Maineville and Franklin, both in Warren County between Cincinnati and Dayton. The board said the spa was injecting patients with “counterfeit” Botox that the operator said she’d gotten from a California dentist she wouldn’t identify.
In a related matter, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost recently warned 14 spas “to stop making false or misleading claims about their versions of popular weight-loss drugs.”
“People deserve clear and accurate information about the medications they’re putting in their bodies,” Yost said in a written statement. “We’re reminding businesses that being truthful isn’t just a good business practice — it’s the law.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)In an alternate universe, an unnamed news weekly runs the following, laudatory op-ed from a Kansas politician.
As a humble U.S. senator from Kansas who is definitely not Roger Marshall or Jerry Moran, it fills me with ecstasy to write a column commemorating the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second, but hopefully not last, administration.
Yes, I understand that more than 40% of Kansans supposedly voted for Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris. I’m assuming that was fraud. The actual residents of our state knew what they were supporting in November 2024: using tariffs to choke off the world’s agriculture markets and plunge the economy into a recession!
Wait, did I get that right? Let me check. I am being told I did.
Rest assured, we here in Congress are 100% behind the president’s agenda, whatever that might be at the moment of this writing. Sure, it’s hitting folks back home. Institutions they depended on — from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to higher education — are being gutted by children supervised by the world’s richest man. Again, though, that’s definitely what Kansans wanted from our president. I support every bit of it, so please don’t criticize me on X, Elon.
Sure, some sticks-in-the-mud claimed that wasn’t what they wanted. They showed up en masse at a town hall to tell me so. Don’t worry, we fixed that problem. My staff declared they aren’t real Kansas. We can’t open the detention centers soon enough!
Real Kansans crave poverty. I mean, think about it. What do you think about when you think of Kansas? The Wizard of Oz. The movie version was filmed during the Great Depression and portrayed Kansas as a sepia-toned hellhole. That’s what folks want for our great state! Child labor, a gutted National Weather Service that can’t warn us about tornadoes, the Dust Bowl. Classic Kansas.

Again, let me check my notes on this. I just want to triple-check I’m getting it right because it sounds like political suicide.
No? This is really what I’m supposed to be suggesting? Hoo boy.
Now, you might wonder about the point of vast economic and societal disruption. I think I speak for everyone in Congress when I say enthusiastically: I don’t know! Neither does anyone in the White House. However, the president has informed us that it’s all going to work out great — as everything he’s ever done has always worked out great — and that doesn’t make me nervous at all.
Are we worried about broken promises? Of course not! This president has always delivered on his promises. Remember the amazing Obamacare replacement plan? Remember infrastructure week? Remember how he ended the Russia-Ukraine war on day one of his second term? Remember how he said that Mexico would pay for a border wall, and Americans would never pay the cost of tariffs?
I rest my case. Promises made, results delivered.
A few in the chattering class have said otherwise. They point out that the U.S. Congress actually has the power to levy or lift tariffs. They point out that the U.S. Congress actually has control of how the government spends money. They point out that the president can be restrained by Congress if we just get off our duffs. But do they realize how boring that sounds?
It’s all going to be fine! Folks need to realize they can go work in the new factories that are sure to dot the landscape in just a few months, or possibly weeks, if the president has suggested that. Because that’s definitely how big business and industry works — the president enacts incomprehensible, quickly reversed policies and reality changes around us. Instantly!
These same communist critics say that as a U.S. senator I should be spending more time sticking up for Kansans rather than licking the boots of a would-be tyrant. But I ask you, have you actually tasted the boots? They’re quite delicious!
Plus, this means I won’t get yelled at online by Elon, who I don’t mind telling you is A LOT. I can refuse to meet with the people who yelled at me in Kansas. Have you tried ditching Elon? Even Trump can’t get rid of him.
Please remember that anyone who says or thinks otherwise has Trump Derangement Syndrome. TDS! They’re the ones who are totally deranged and have no idea what’s going on, not the administration that accidentally texted war plans to a journalist. We’ve all butt-dialed someone who’s not our spouse with secret war plans, right?
All in all, I would say this has been an amazing first 1,000 days. Whoops! I mean 100 days. I’m absolutely not at all nervous about what the president is doing — trashing export markets that farmers depend upon, slashing services that Kansans at home expect, and generally turning our economy into smoldering wreckage. 
If I were you, I’d be worried! But I’ll be fine. My seat is guaranteed! Sometimes I wonder why I even campaign.
In conclusion, Trump has been fantastic! And I’m sure that after the second 100 days his total mastery of our political system will be even clearer. That, or we’ll be in some sort of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome situation.
If not, at least I won’t have debased myself quite as badly as Roger Marshall did. Did you see his Newsweek op-ed? He didn’t mention tariffs once.
I’ll be fine, though.

This is an AmeriCorps program that places qualified full-time volunteers in schools to support teachers and the development of children.

By the end of the day, an announcement was made to the school: Columbus City School’s 30-year relationship with the City Year program was over. This was a direct result of the federal Department of Government Efficiency’s decision last week to cut 41% of the AmeriCorps program budget.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAmeriCorps was the beginning of my career. I enrolled as a full-time volunteer a few months after graduating from Denison University and was selected to serve as a community organizer supporting neighborhood associations for the mayor of Omaha, Nebraska. At the same time, my mother, back in the workforce with her three children out of high school, enrolled in AmeriCorps to evaluate literacy instruction programs for young children.
In 2020, my firm Scioto Analysis conducted a cost-benefit analysis of AmeriCorps programs in Ohio. We found that the programs have significant impacts on the trajectory of participants. People who enroll in the program have much higher future earnings and lower chances of criminal justice involvement. The best evidence available tells us cutting AmeriCorps will result in lower wages and higher crime rates for Ohio. We found that the net benefits of the program in Ohio range somewhere from from $1 million to $30 million and that expansions of the program could push net benefits into the nine-figure range.
It seems that the decisions being made at the federal level are blind to one side of the accounting ledger. In the fervor to reduce spending and cut administrative offices at the federal level, DOGE leader Elon Musk and other decision makers are failing to consider the benefits of programs they eliminate. I have no doubt in my mind that there are reasonable cuts that can be made to federal programs. The problem is that the current approach is not reasonable: it is the public finance equivalent of conducting open-heart surgery with a chainsaw.
The sad thing about this from the perspective of the fiscal hawk is that these cuts will have very little effect on the federal debt. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, even a spending cut 1,000 times the size of the AmeriCorps cut last week would only reduce the federal-debt-to-GDP ratio by one percentage point in the next decade. Cutting AmeriCorps is a drop in the bucket in the context of U.S. debt.
The benefits of cutting Americorps funds are hard to divine. Its costs are clear. In the meantime, volunteers will be lost and children from low-income families in a high-poverty school district will have one less resource available to them in their already under-resourced classrooms.

The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.













There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company





23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Whenever Ed Spencer sees a forecast for northeasterly wind, he and his wife brace themselves. Often, the winds carry the smell of rotting waste from Juniper Ridge Landfill, which sits less than two miles from their home. 
The odor is a reminder of the fight Spencer, other environmental advocates, and members of the Penobscot Nation have found themselves in for the past two decades over the landfill that they say is polluting local waterways and causing other harms to environmental and public health without accountability. 
That’s why Spencer joined more than 50 others for a rally Sunday afternoon in Old Town to not only voice their concerns about expanding the state’s largest landfill, but also to ask the lawmakers who represent them in Augusta to back bills that could address the contamination and injustice they feel local communities have endured. 
  Advocates and members of the Penobscot Nation gathered in Old Town to protest Juniper Ridge expansion. (Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)
Juniper Ridge, which straddles Old Town and Alton, is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of the waste management company Casella. 
For Penobscot Nation member Charlene Francis, it was only fitting that the demonstration, which included a traditional water ceremony along the banks of the Penobscot River, took place under relentless rain. Because water is so sacred to the tribe, Francis said Juniper Ridge is a sore spot for her.
Locals have argued that there has been insufficient treatment of landfill leachate — water that collects chemicals after passing through the waste — which runs into the Penobscot River. They are specifically concerned about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals, which are linked to a number of negative health effects like some cancers, high cholesterol, reproductive and fetal development issues, and more. 
The Penobscot Nations’s reservation at Indian Island, which includes portions of the Penobscot River, is located five miles downstream from the landfill.
While Francis said she tries to do her part to address the mounting trash problem by pledging to not buy anything new that isn’t a necessity, others are calling on elected officials to do more.
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028. The state has signaled its support for expanding the facility despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation.
Spencer, who is now part of the grassroots movement Don’t Waste ME, which advocates for policies to protect the health of communities at risk of disposal operations, said he was almost “forced” into the fight against Juniper Ridge when he attended a city council meeting in October 2003. Having lived in the area since 1977, at the time he shared his opposition to opening the landfill. 
Almost 20 years later, Spencer said the efforts of his group, the Penobscot Nation and others is “reaching a critical mass,” in part because of what he sees as progress on the legislative front. Spencer attended a public hearing with the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee last week about a slate of bills related to the state’s largest landfill. 
He also pointed to steps the Government Oversight Committee and the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability have taken to investigate concerns with the landfill. 
While Spencer and others at the event support some of the proposals on the table this session, including one that would require legislative approval for contracts to operate Juniper Ridge, there is concern about one related proposal that would allow more bulky solid waste to be imported to the state’s landfills. 
With waste issues piling up, Maine Legislature weighs more oversight of Juniper Ridge

As Spencer sees it, LD 297 would complicate the definition of what constitutes waste generated in Maine, opening the door for more out-of-state waste that would fill the landfill even faster. Proponents argue this is necessary to bring in more bulky waste to stabilize the sludge that is disposed of at the facility. 
Alternately, he’s hoping lawmakers move forward with two proposals from Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), whose district covers the area. 
One bill, LD 1604, seeks to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters. 
A representative from the Department of Environmental Protection said the agency understands people’s desire to address PFAS, but opposed that bill arguing it isn’t the best approach. Since the bill would require “technically complex and challenging rulemaking,” the department said a better alternative would be to wait for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to develop pretreatment guidelines for landfills that discharge leachate. 
Under Tipping’s other bill, LD 1349, two-thirds of the Legislature would need to approve future operating contracts or contract renewals for Juniper Ridge, something currently handled by the executive branch.
If passed, this would be critical to the discussion about expanding and extending the life of the landfill. The environment committee is scheduled to have a work session on the bill Wednesday during which it could vote to recommend the Legislature pass the measure.
The Bureau of General Services has not submitted an application to expand the landfill, but Deputy Commissioner Anya Trundy told the Legislature last week that it intends to.
Trundy said that building out the landfill to its maximum capacity should allow it to operate until 2040, which would also necessitate extending the contract with Casella so that both line up with the 2040 timeline. 
Though the Department of Administrative and Financial Services would normally advocate for contracts to go out to bid, Trundy said doing so could sever the indemnification clause in the existing contract. Rather than giving Casella a “sweetheart deal,” Trundy said continuing the agreement holds them accountable to that clause that would leave them responsible for financial and environmental liability down the road. 
Spencer said that argument “shows how irresponsible the state was in the first place.” He believes involving the Legislature would lead to more responsible decision making in any future contracts for Juniper Ridge. 
Otherwise, he said, “Old Town becomes a sacrifice zone.”

Agriculture is Georgia’s top industry, and broilers are the state’s top farm product.
But the mess that large-scale poultry farming causes can create tensions between residents and corporate owners. And that is playing out in a northeast Georgia community, where a proposed poultry rendering plant has residents up in arms about the potential fouling of the Broad River, a source of water and recreation for Royston and nearby communities.
And if Pilgrim’s Pride decides to bypass Franklin Springs as a site for its processing plant, the company says it’s sure to pop up somewhere else in Georgia’s chicken farm territory.
For now, the Franklin Springs locals are the ones in the crosshairs.
Franklin Springs resident Magan Crump recently received jarring medical advice from her doctor: He advised her to move away from her hometown in case a new wastewater treatment and poultry byproduct processing plant opened in her community.
After the 40-year-old was diagnosed seven months ago with pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure within the lungs, her doctor recommended against Crump living close to a planned large wastewater treatment plant or a poultry rendering plant where the odors make it hard to breathe.
Rumors on social media escalated a public uproar in early March regarding the possibility of a poultry processing plant coming to Franklin Springs, a rural community about two hours northeast of downtown Atlanta.
Critics say they’re worried local officials will try to attract another animal rendering plant that would rely on the new treatment plant to discharge millions of gallons of wastewater into the Broad River.
“Franklin Springs has a population of about 1,100 people so there is absolutely no need for a wastewater treatment plant that size and that massive to be in this area,” Crump said. “What we are all concerned about is the industrial waste that goes along with that and how the poultry plant waste would impact the river.”
A Madison County Journal open records request in early April uncovered emails last year between Pilgrim’s Pride officials and Franklin Springs mayor about whether the size of the city’s planned wastewater treatment plant could sustain the company building a poultry rendering plant in Franklin.
A chicken rendering facility re-purposes animal byproducts such as bones. feet, oils and fats into other goods such as animal feed and fertilizers.
A common disposal method for the remaining sludge involves companies getting permission from farm owners to dump the “soil amendments” fertilizer onto their land.
The uproar was intense enough that Pilgrim’s Pride publicly announced last week that it would not build a chicken rendering facility in Franklin Springs and would explore alternative locations in Georgia.
The news about the prospective poultry plant has now placed Franklin County commissioners under pressure from several residents to rescind a wastewater plant agreement with Franklin Springs.
The new wastewater treatment plant is still in the works – and poultry waste could still one day end up at the facility, says Franklin Springs Mayor Lee Moore.
Moore has said that no contract has been signed with Pilgrim and that the city intends to fund the water treatment project primarily through bonds. Moore has also doubled down on his intention to entice another poultry company to a county that is among the top producers for the chicken industry.
Moore said he will continue pursuing new industries to the county.
“No industry is coming at this time, and there is no Pilgrim’s Pride plant of any type coming to Franklin Springs, period,” Moore said.
“Anything that we can do to make our agricultural county greater, I’m all in favor of it. If it’s anything that deals with poultry or cattle, I’m all in favor of that. But you know, once again, if something like that comes, it’s got to be built correctly. They have to be a good industry. They have to be good neighbors, and they will be held accountable by the city of Franklin Springs”
Community pushback 
Members of local movements like “Save Broad River” and “Stop the Rendering” have been leading the opposition against Pilgrim’s Pride.
Franklin Springs residents have started a petition to remove Moore from office over his handling of the Pilgrim’s Pride and wastewater plant issues.
The project faces strong opposition from the Broad River Watershed Association and local residents due to concerns about water pollution and the facility’s proximity to Emmanuel University and residential areas.
Tonya Bonitatibus, executive director of Savannah Riverkeeper, said if Pilgrim’s rendering plant is built somewhere, it would likely be the largest of its type in Georgia.
One of the major concerns is about the environmental impact of a proposed rendering plant producing more soil amendments from animal byproducts, she said.
  The Broad River Watershed Association said the river is in better condition than a lot of Piedmont rivers. However, pollution threats are not taken lightly by its residents. Photo submitted by the Broad River Watershed Association
Soil amendments are commonly used on farms to improve certain physical characteristics, such as water retention or reducing compactness.
Bonitatibus said Pilgrim’s plant would not only increase the millions of gallons of leftover waste that would become soil amendments, but it could also result in vast amounts of industrial sewage being treated and discharged into waterways, she said.
The leftover chicken parts processed at a wastewater facility will include significant amounts of fats, oils, and greases that can harm water quality and aquatic life if not properly treated, Bonitatibus said.
“When an animal goes into an animal processing facility, they’re going to use the big chunks of the meat, right?” Bonitatibus said. “But you’re going to have feet and beaks and feathers and fat left over and at the end of that, that waste can’t go to a wastewater treatment plant or a landfill.”
This year isn’t the first time there has been controversy in Franklin County over a proposed Pilgrim plant. In 2021, the county would withdraw plans following protests over a proposed $70 million pet food ingredient and rendering plant near Carnesville.
“I have a grandchild with compromised lung issues who was born premature,” Franklin Springs resident Donna Bennett said. “I’m also a real estate agent so the environmental, private property impact is a huge concern. It’s infuriating that this has been going on behind our backs for three to four years in this city, and no one had any knowledge until about three months ago.”
Franklin County officials have joined several neighboring counties to express opposition to having the poultry plant built locally.
At a workshop meeting held Tuesday, Franklin County Chairperson Courtney Long read a statement indicating the board’s desire to protect the river and its surroundings.
“Many of those being targeted had absolutely no hand whatsoever in creating this situation and threatening them we feel like only weakens the cause that we’re all trying to fight,” Long said at the meeting, which was livestreamed.
“When we entered into the intergovernmental agreement, we did so by following the direction set by the previous board,” Long said. “As stewards of your tax dollars, we made that decision because it saved our taxpayers millions of dollars.”
On Tuesday, Royston resident Kay Williams criticized county commissioners for entering into a water treatment agreement.
“When you say you love us and you love the river, there is no earthly way you love anything, to let a poultry place come here and contaminate what we love and live with (like) our drinking water,” Williams said.
Moore disputes claims that an animal processing facility’s waste would be harmful after the animal byproducts and other contaminants are properly removed by wastewater treatment plants.
“Anything that would come to Franklin Springs would have to be treated by that industry’s own wastewater treatment plant, then it would have to be sent to Franklin to be treated before it would be emptied into the Broad River,” Moore said. “It would be a tremendous gain for the Broad River to get some clean water in it.”
Poultry industry critical to state
Northeast Georgia is a hotspot for the state’s prized poultry industry.
But other rural areas of the state are home to various poultry and other animal byproduct processing plants.
Mike Giles, president of the Georgia Poultry Federation, said for the poultry industry to continue to grow in Georgia, plants like Pilgrim’s rendering facilities are important.
Giles has defended the poultry industry when it allows chicken processing byproducts to be properly injected into the soil instead of being haphazardly dumped on top of land.
Rendering plants like the one apparently now scuttled in Franklin Springs are important since only two-thirds of each broiler chicken is for human consumption, Giles said.
Environmental groups in Georgia and other states have long voiced concerns about the odors and the potential for the waste to reach waterways that residents rely on for drinking and recreational activities.
“I would say that any community that is considering this type of a rendering facility needs to immediately go visit one first and try to understand how they can put the proper protections in place for their community before they allow the company to come in,” Bonitatibus said.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)While the country’s chattering class buzzed about 100 days in office, lawmakers in the Nebraska Legislature passed that apparently important milestone several weeks ago without a blip of notoriety. Nose to the grindstone … as it were.
Its work continues until early June, so state senators are entering the home stretch. Whether their remaining days will be a slog, a sprint or something in between remains to be seen as an eclectic array of issues from food to finances still await them.
A sampler platter of policies passed, passed over and proposed reveals the “vibe” of the 108th Session, a 90-day variety. A trio of subjects are instructive:
Food answers
While a bill to certify the origins of your cheeseburger is working its way through the Unicameral — with some in that august body rightly wondering why — a recent, far more important discussion took place: Should Nebraska be using access to food as a behavior modification tool?
To their credit, senators have moved forward State Sen. Victor Rountree’s Legislative Bill 314, a proposal to lift the ban on access to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for certain former felons who have served time on drug convictions. 
To date, proponents have been on the money in support of LB 314, arguing that addiction is not a moral issue but rather a disease. Plus, using food as a cudgel would continue the punishment of a crime for which offenders had already paid their debt to society. Rountree’s bill appears to be heading for final passage, a welcome turn for the 1,000 or so Nebraskans affected by the current ban.
How all Nebraskans pay for the food they put on their tables has also been a topic of discussion as it relates to the Legislature’s charge to carry out the will of the voting public who decided to increase the state’s minimum wage a couple of years ago. 
Minimum wage fight
The debate over State Sen. Jane Raybould’s LB 258 has been wide-ranging, rife with weedy details and occasionally personal, the overarching question here is just because the Legislature has the authority to alter what was decided at the polls, should it?
LB 258 changes the rate at which the minimum wage would rise starting in 2027 from the cost of living to a set percent each year. There are some exceptions for younger workers. The details are numerous and devilish, but the debate tone took an unfortunate turn last week. 
That’s when several senators argued that the solution for those earning a minimum wage was to forego dependence on government largesse and instead work harder, improve themselves, get an education or start their own business. The implication was that minimum wage earners are not hard workers, uninterested in self-improvement, uneducated and somehow in a position to open their own businesses. 
“Inexplicable” comes to mind when distilling such comments, but I’d question that. I think it explicable: Being woefully out of touch with all wage earners across the state dealing with high prices, stubborn inflation and the nation’s chaotic economic future. 
King’s words
State senators work hard and surely had Nebraskans’ best interest at heart when they raised their right hands on January 8. While a serious and sometimes difficult task, all Nebraskans live by the Legislature’s decisions. It is incumbent on them … indeed on all of us as voters, too … to have an understanding of not simply how legislation affects our lives, but also the lives of those with whom we have little or nothing in common, aside from geography.
Speaking of economic futures, now is a good time to remind ourselves of the words of Martin Luther King Jr. who said, “a budget is a moral document.” Debate begins this week to address the state economic forecasting board’s recent revision that adds $190 million over two years to the budget deficit. For an excellent primer on the details, read the Nebraska Examiner’s Zach Wendling’s piece here.
The sledding will be tough. That’s because as we see on our nightly television news and in our morning papers, some are selling a rosy, tariff-driven future, but few economists and business leaders are buying. 
Chaos and doubt have replaced certitude, a priceless commodity when paying for today, investing in tomorrow or both. The result? Roiling markets, talk of recession and a vague economic malaise among buyers, sellers and, most importantly, consumers. All of which affects Nebraskans and those with whom we have entrusted the state’s financial plan.
To wit: Any budget discussion, debate and eventual decision seen through King’s observation and ye shall know them by … how they spend our money.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”



Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.



Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Cutting services or raising taxes: State lawmakers weigh how to fill big budget gaps

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

I recently celebrated the Passover holiday, commemorating the deliverance of my people from slavery to freedom. Yet at numerous times in history since our deliverance from the Egyptians, we Jews have been anything but free. 
I am descended from a people who have been denied free speech and freedom of religion. We have been persecuted and murdered in the millions for pursuing the same. The message of Passover is that having known the bitterness of this oppression ourselves, we Jews must recognize and are obligated to fight oppression wherever and whenever it may raise its ugly specter.
This is the very reason why I believe deporting students who exercise their First Amendment rights is not only unconstitutional, it is antisemitic. It is oppressing individuals by suppressing their constitutional freedoms, ironically and erroneously in the name of combating antisemitism. 
But let’s be crystal clear: having been denied these rights ourselves, Jews must see abrogation of free speech rights of any group or individual in the same vein as having those freedoms denied to each of us. I see the faces of Jews ripped from their homes by the Gestapo in the terrified face of the young Tufts University student accosted on the street by unidentified ICE officers. As due process was withheld from us in Hitler’s Germany, we cannot abide circumventing due process for anyone.
What is done to one, is done to all.
 Moreover, claiming unlawfulness as an exercise on behalf of the Jewish people brands us as “the problem” once again. The danger is that, as in Hitler’s Germany, this will be extrapolated to mean that America’s democratic system is at risk because of the Jewish people. 
There is enough real antisemitism and historical precedence to go around without pinning on us the deportation of people who are speaking their conscience with no evidence of criminal wrongdoing and without due process.
Protest and free speech are guaranteed to anyone and everyone on United States soil. My father was a Jewish attorney who, as a manyfold decorated WW II bomber pilot, risked his life to protect those freedoms. From my youngest recollection he instilled in me the belief that despite its flaws and those of its authors, the U.S. Constitution was without peer in modern government frameworks.
 So many years later I still hold that belief. As a Jew, I receive it as the deepest insult and injustice, that defiance of our Constitution, that denial of First Amendment rights, that persecution of people because of their beliefs, should be declared to have been carried out in my name; in the name of the Jewish people. 
Combating antisemitism? Bah, humbug! No, not a war on antisemitism by any means. Deporting students for speaking their personal truths is the same war on free speech and withholding of due process we Jews have experienced time and time again. It is the petri dish in which antisemitism flourishes.
Never, never, in my name.

Many will picture beautiful estates, country clubs, and extreme wealth. Connecticut is home to some of the wealthiest towns in America. But it’s not all perfectly manicured lawns and waterfront properties. The stark reality behind this picture-perfect reputation that Connecticut has earned is a shocking divide in wealth, a growing poverty rate, and a housing system that is, frankly, a mess. 
It’s glaringly obvious to anyone who’s driven across different parts of Connecticut. Neighborhoods are largely segregated by income and race. It’s time we pay attention to impoverished residents who have been neglected and left out of the picture.

Kayla Bell
Connecticut is one of the most racially and economically segregated states in the country. In particular, Bridgeport and Hartford “remain among the most segregated in the nation in terms of race and ethnicity and among the highest in income inequality,”  reports Jacqueline Rabe Thomas of the Connecticut Insider.
Lawmakers have not adequately addressed the stark economic divide which disproportionately impacts people of color and other marginalized groups. Historically, policies systematically excluded Black families from equitable housing. Redlining was a discriminatory practice where financial services from banks or insurance companies denied services to predominantly Black communities. 
This left entire communities without the opportunity for upward mobility. These policies have left a dark legacy, continuing to create racial divides between neighborhoods, with families of color more likely to live in neighborhoods with low-quality housing. 
While redlining is illegal today, there have been many more discriminatory practices since. For example, reverse redlining aimed to fortify conditions of poverty. Segregated neighborhoods that were previously denied credit, became targets for predatory lenders who sold subprime loans at extremely high interest rates. These lenders knew that many families would never be able to pay off the debt, leading to bankruptcies and foreclosures that disproportionately impacted people of color. The division is a direct result of exclusionary zoning and discriminatory practices. It is imperative that we name this issue for what it is: Racism.
Connecticut lawmakers have a responsibility to serve their communities, and they have not done an adequate job when it comes to housing. A 2020 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition expressed that Connecticut has a severe shortage of affordable rental homes. 
Exclusionary zoning and lack of affordable housing have prevented many families of color from moving into upper-class neighborhoods, which also, in turn, impacts the quality of education their children receive. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated housing inequality. Rates of eviction skyrocketed, and marginalized communities took the brunt of it. 
It’s clear that housing impacts so many other facets of life. Where a person grows up is a defining factor of life expectancy and a determinant of overall health and well-being: “Those growing up just a few blocks apart in different municipalities have drastically different outcomes in life,” Thomas reported. For example, children who grow up in segregated neighborhoods have higher rates of incarceration and teenage pregnancy and are more likely to work in lower paying or minimum wage jobs. It would cost, on average, 3.5 times more to live in areas with ‘well-resourced, high-performing schools in Connecticut, one of the largest disparities in the country,” Thomas wrote. Connecticut’s House Majority Leader, Jason Rojas of East Hartford, expressed that “There are serious ramifications for people, for communities, and for our state to continue to not address this issue.”
I’m calling on Connecticut lawmakers and representatives to advocate for an expansion of affordable housing, especially options that are integrated in wealthier neighborhoods. It should be noted that there is much controversy over this. Many members of affluent neighborhoods are opposed to the integration of affordable housing. There is an attitude present that the suburban utopia will be “tainted” by apartment buildings and low-income housing. This perspective has inherent undertones of white supremacy.
Tackling this issue requires bold action. I’m also calling on local governments to invest into their low-income neighborhoods, rather than contributing to gentrification, which increases costs of living and displaces families, some of whom have been living in their homes for generations. 
Housing is part of a much larger issue, as is education, crime, health, etc. To tackle any and all of these issues, we must look at the broader picture. I am calling on all legislators to advocate for any policies or initiatives that allow low-income families to build wealth and provide a path to economic stability.

 Senate Bill 1349 offers a chance to reimagine school choice not as a partisan flashpoint, but as a path to equity, excellence, and opportunity for all students and their teachers.
In Connecticut, choice is not a threat to public education. It is a tool for ensuring public education fulfills its constitutional promise: that every child, no matter their zip code, has access to a great school.
We know this from experience. Connecticut has long invested in diverse public school models —magnet schools, inter-district programs, charter schools— that provide families with options that supplement district offerings. These are public solutions to public challenges, born out of our state’s commitment to fairness and innovation. The landmark Sheff v. O’Neill decision led to bold experimentation that continues to benefit thousands of students across our state. We must do more and better.
Senate Bill 1349 builds on this legacy. It expands access to high-quality public education by giving more families a say in where and how their children learn —while ensuring that transparency, oversight, and public accountability remain central. This is not about shifting public dollars to private systems. It is about expanding public school options to reflect the diverse needs of the students they serve.
When families are empowered to choose, students thrive. Research and real-world results show that the presence of high-performing, non-traditional public schools can help raise the bar for entire systems. Teachers gain the freedom to work in schools aligned with their values and methods. Communities are strengthened by responsive, student-centered learning environments. The whole district benefits. We know it works—because it’s already working here in Connecticut.
Yet far too many families still face barriers. They wait on lottery lists because choice is a chance they are willing to take. While we’ve made progress, inequities persist—especially for children of color, multilingual learners, and students with disabilities. If we want every student to succeed, we must support a system that adapts to the learner, not the other way around.
As Frederick Douglass said, “Once you learn to read, you will be forever free.” Every child who succeeds becomes a raindrop in the river toward freedom.
Connecticut can lead better. We are not here to dismantle our public system. We are here to improve it, to expand it, and to fulfill its mission with integrity. The choice we face is not between tradition and disruption —but between stagnation and progress. If we fail to act, we deny generations of children the chance to thrive in a system that sees them, supports them, and adapts to their needs.
This is the moment to be bold. To insist that school choice and public education are not enemies, but allies in the urgent work of opportunity and success.
When choice comes to town, let it come with purpose, with partnership, and with the promise of freedom through learning, to ensure that public education truly belongs to all of us—and works for every child.
Instead of running to catch up, let’s choose to do better.

An apparent immigration enforcement action by agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency early Sunday morning in Nashville resulted in the detentions of area immigrants, officials said. 
According to a press release from state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat, “Witnesses reported multiple drivers pulled over and detained, including mothers driving to work, allegedly leaving children in vehicles by themselves. Videos, photos, and firsthand accounts point to ICE working in tandem with the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) to carry out what can only be described as a dragnet.” 
A Tennessee Lookout photojournalist on Sunday documented buses leaving a U.S. Department of Homeland Security facility in Nashville. Family members of the alleged detainees were also present, protesting the alleged detentions.

“Arbitrarily rounding up parents on their way home and workers traveling to their jobs does not make Nashville safer or stronger,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition in a statement. “Instead it shatters families, erodes trust in law enforcement, and leads to fear, trauma and isolation that weakens the collective fabric of our community.”
“This is yet another unconscionable act of cruelty and abuse of power by ICE collaborating with state law enforcement that will have a devastating impact on families throughout Nashville and beyond,” Luna said. 
In a statement posted on social media, Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell said, “This type of federal enforcement action is not focused on making us safer and leaves people in our community fearing any interaction with law enforcement when there is a crime occurring. We will be seeking the names of those detained.”
At publication time, the Lookout had not received responses to requests for comment from ICE or the Tennessee Highway Patrol.

There were no public defenders available to represent the defendant. (Photo by Jake Parrish/InvestigateWest)While Washington state lawmakers’ budget more than doubles funding for public defenders, those attorneys say the sum is still woefully inadequate to meet the needs of local courts. 
Unlike most states, Washington does not bear the burden of funding the constitutional right to counsel. Instead, the onus is on local governments with the state historically only funding less than 3% of overall costs. 
“They were paying such a small portion of the cost that the increase was going to look large,” said Derek Young, interim director of the Washington State Association of Counties. “In a session where they had budget frames and were making cuts to other important programs, I saw this as a really positive first step, recognition that something has to change.” 
The new budget, awaiting the governor’s signature, would increase the state’s contributions to public defense to around 6% of total funding during the next biennium, 2026-2027. The funding boost is not guaranteed after that.
“This is a great start,” said Katrin Johnson, deputy director for the state’s Office of Public Defense, which provides supplemental representation to indigent defendants and disburses the state’s funding to counties and cities. “It’s about collaboration and education to help the Legislature understand the local difficulties and challenges counties have in funding public defense.”
For years, public defender offices across Washington have been struggling to recruit and retain attorneys. It’s a taxing job with a high workload, and not many law school graduates are inclined to relocate to rural areas, leaving these jurisdictions especially susceptible to a shortage. 
Without an adequate pool of public defenders, defendants in places like Yakima County are left waiting weeks, sometimes months, to resolve their cases. 
The people most vulnerable to the state’s shortage of public defenders are disproportionately people of color, said Pierce County Executive Ryan Mello, who testified before the Legislature in favor of increasing state funding for public defense. 
“Poor folks, people of color, sit in jail longer,” Mello said. “The longer they sit in jail, not adjudicating their case, the more likely they are to lose their job, to lose their family, to lose their housing, and things spiral out of control.”
Local jurisdictions provide the majority of funding for public defense, about 97%, often leading to public defense programs having to negotiate with county commissioners to increase funding amid inflationary costs for court services.
“It’s inappropriate to rely just on local revenue to fund a constitutional right,” Young said.
The state’s Office of Public Defense administers the limited state funding given to counties and cities through a grant program. Since 2017, funding has remained stagnant — not surpassing 2% of the overall money spent by courts to provide public defense services, according to data from the Office of Public Defense. The funding is dispersed to counties in varying amounts based on population and caseload size.

County revenues collected from property and sales taxes make up the remaining funds, but in Washington, local governments can only increase their property tax revenue by 1% without voter-approved ballot measures, failing to keep pace with the rising costs of running a court.
“The money we get [from the state] wouldn’t even pay for one attorney,” said Jeremy Ford, director of the Chelan County public defender’s office. “The problem is that the millions of dollars that gets spread out proportionally based on the size of your county or city… means us rural counties get less resources, which is always the case.”
Last year, the Chelan County public defender’s office received $81,000 from the grant, amounting to just 2.2% of total costs. 
“The money they’re passing through isn’t really enough to do any substantial help for anybody,” Ford said.
Two identical House and Senate bills related to public defense funding died this session. Over a rolling basis, those bills would have made the state responsible for 50% of the costs associated with public defense services. 
“Budgetarily, I knew it would be a big ask,” said Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds and prime sponsor of the House bill, citing the state’s multibillion-dollar budget deficit. “I’ve been in the Legislature for 11 years and always kind of knew about the shortfall in public defense funding, but I didn’t quite realize how acute it was.”
Neither bill made it out of committee, but those involved say there was more support for public defense this year than previously.
“There has been proposed legislation for many years to increase the amount of state funding for local public defense, and this is the first time we’ve received more,” Johnson said. “It’s a constitutional right. We want to make sure it’s being done well no matter what jurisdiction it falls under.”
Peterson said he will continue to work with the Legislature to secure public defense funding across the state. 
“We can’t just pay for more police officers,” Peterson said. “We need to pay for the whole system to make sure it works.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson has until May 20 to sign or veto the new budget. If there is no action by then, the budget will become law.
“I think the governor, being the former attorney general, has a really good understanding of the criminal justice system,” said Mello, the Pierce County executive. “He understands the need for access to justice … which really increases our chances at this part of the budget being signed into law.”

(Submitted photo)The Indiana Capital Chronicle took home seven awards from the Society of Professional Journalists’ annual Indiana chapter banquet Friday evening — including a top recognition for Senior Reporter Casey Smith, who was honored as the Journalist of the Year.
SPJ board members cited Smith’s accomplishments as an education writer while announcing the award, as well as her investigative work into Jamey Noel, a disgraced former sheriff now serving time in prison for misusing public funds for private gain.
Judges also recognized Smith as likely being the first reporter to witness a state execution. Smith earned the trust of Joseph Cochran’s defense team and was invited as part of Cochran’s personal guest list.

That work earned Smith — and ICC Editor-in-Chief Niki Kelly — a first-place nod in the criminal justice category. Kelly has covered Cochran’s case since the beginning, when she was a courts reporter with the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette.
Smith also won a second-place finish for her environmental reporting on a 2024 bill seeking to exempt certain products from being defined as toxic PFAs “forever chemicals.”
The ICC’s four-person team won five other awards on Friday, including first place for best journalism website and third place for the publication’s daily newsletter, Fast Break.
Senior Reporter Whitney Downard nabbed a first-place win for her personality profile of Abbey Hall, a Hoosier who traveled to Illinois for an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a detrimental birth defect. Downard also won second place in the Medical and Science Reporting category for her story about transportation troubles for adult day care recipients following a transition to managed care.

Larry Rhoden, points toward the property line of land in rural Lincoln County that had been surveyed for the purpose of constructing a men's prison. (John Hult/South Dakoa Searchlight. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)When the South Dakota Department of Corrections announced the site where it hoped to build a 1,500-bed men’s prison in 2023, it told the public it was the only usable site available.
The state had sent a request for information months earlier, hoping someone would offer up land for the project. No one who was willing to sell had exactly what the state was after, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said. 
This week, department spokesman Michael Winder again wrote that “no formal submissions” met the criteria for the prison.
“The state continued to do outreach, get referrals, and conduct research” after the request was placed, Winder wrote, but “in the fall of 2023, the other sites the state was pursuing declined to sell.”
So the department transferred $8 million to the state Office of School and Public Lands, laying claim to 320 acres of farmland a few miles south of Harrisburg that had been leased to farmers for years. The lease proceeds were used to fund the state’s K-12 schools, and the $8 million went into the trust fund into which those lease payments had flowed. 


 The locations of potential men’s prison sites submitted to Project Prison Reset.
The site was a “gift from God,” Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden would later say. But its selection sparked fierce opposition, political activism and a lawsuit from neighbors. It also contributed to the Rhoden administration’s failure to push the $825 million project across the finish line during the 2025 legislative session. 
In March, the state sent out another request for information, this time as part of an effort to “reset” discussions on a correctional facility to replace the state penitentiary. 
In less than a month, more than a dozen options emerged. 
One of them, the former Citibank campus in northern Sioux Falls, was apparently available as an option back in 2023. 
Citibank had built a new headquarters on the south end of Sioux Falls in 2019. A representative for the company selling the land said they didn’t submit it as a possible prison site in 2023, but said the state didn’t reach out during the “outreach” phase of its site search.
“I don’t know what happened the first time around,” said Troy Fawcett of NAI Sioux Falls Commercial Real Estate.
New process wider in scope
Rhoden’s office wouldn’t comment on whether the former Citibank campus just north of the state penitentiary was under consideration in 2023, but spokeswoman Josie Harms did note its size in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. 
In the first request for information, the state sought at least 100-200 acres of land or more for a 1,500 bed facility, based on a consultant’s report.
“The Project Prison Reset task force isn’t looking back — we’re moving forward,” Harms wrote to Searchlight. “With that said, the Citibank building is only 70 acres.”
South Dakota corrections work group formally backs need for new prison

Ryan Brunner, a policy adviser for Rhoden, presented the new options to members of Project Prison Reset during the group’s second meeting on Tuesday in Springfield. He told Searchlight after the meeting that several options may not have been for sale in 2023, and that the market in Sioux Falls has changed.
“We’ll have to do some analysis on these sites to see if they’re a fit or not,” Brunner said.
The parameters for a potential site are less restrictive this time around. 
The governor’s work group is exploring all options, including smaller facilities, multiple facilities and locations outside the Sioux Falls area. There’s a preference for sites within 20 miles of Sioux Falls in the newer request for information, but that’s not a requirement.
That easing of requirements made it possible for the state to field offers from Big Stone City, Aberdeen, Huron and Mitchell. Big Stone has an empty cheese plant on more than 100 acres. Huron has 100 acres in an industrial park. Mitchell has more than that, on land south of town near its landfill. Aberdeen has two options on two ends of the Hub City.
The newer parameters also put the Citibank site, with its 70 acres, in the running. That offer is the spendiest option by asking price, at $33.8 million, and the one with the smallest footprint.
It does offer some enticements the others do not, though. 
It has buildings that could be refurbished, rather than built from the ground up. It’s connected to water and sewer, and is less than a mile from the current penitentiary campus. The minimum and maximum security units on the current penitentiary grounds will remain, regardless of the future of the 1881 main penitentiary.

More options offer more wiggle room
Sen. Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, told South Dakota Searchlight that the work group’s Springfield trip, with its tour of the medium-security Mike Durfee State Prison and rundowns of the multiple vocational programs offered there to more than 1,000 inmates, was illuminating. It solidified his skepticism on the need for 100 acres or more.
The Mike Dufee campus, formerly a university, is smaller than 70 acres. The penitentiary in Sioux Falls is overcrowded by medium security inmates, Karr noted, not maximum security ones. The 1,500-bed proposal and its 100-plus acres were designed around maximum security housing units.
“I’m not convinced we need 100 acres,” Karr said. “I don’t think anybody is at this point.”
Karr’s not fully sold on any of the new proposals – there isn’t space at any of them for the ideal security perimeter, for example – but said the idea that Citibank is “almost turn-key” is appealing. 
Karr said the state should have worked harder to find sites back in 2023, instead of requesting information and waiting for offers. The work of site selection may have been more fruitful if it had included the kind of public forums now taking place with Project Prison Reset, he said.
“This is getting vetted and discussed the way it should have been the first time around,” he said.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

Other options include multiple undeveloped properties with 100 acres or more in the Sioux Falls area, most presented for sale on a per-acre basis. 
There’s land at the intersection of interstates 29 and 90, a plot near Amazon’s Sioux Falls distribution center, and another near the Department of Correction’s West Farm site, home to a facility for juveniles in state custody.
The Sioux Falls Development Foundation has offered land near Worthing as another Lincoln County option, and the city of Canton pointed to tracts of land west of town.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen leads the Project Prison Reset work group. During the initial site discussions in 2023, he was still a Republican state representative for District 13 in Sioux Falls. 
He’s pleased to have so many offers, noting that the publicity surrounding the work group may have drawn more attention. 
Even so, he said, “we need to be realistic” about how the potential sales might go over with neighbors. The site obtained in 2023, he said, is still an option.
“I don’t find it particularly surprising that we have owners of land in some of these communities who are willing to offer it,” Venhuizen said.

(Photo by Julie Gammack)My mother loved pink azaleas. They had to be a particular shade of pink to be just right. Kind of a salmon color — not too pinky. On her birthday and holidays, Boesen’s the Florist would deliver just the right plant, with just the right color — unless there was a new clerk handling the order, someone who didn’t understand that the pink had to be exactly right, or there might be tears.
Growing up in Iowa, we couldn’t grow our own azaleas. They couldn’t withstand the frigid winters. So when I moved to Washington, D.C. and experienced spring — real spring, where azaleas bloom with abandon, or neatly trimmed, along sidewalks and in the yards of old neighborhoods — I was stunned.
They were everywhere. White. Deep red. And my mother’s favorite: a light coral pink.
As an aside, when I was a talk radio host, I once interviewed a U.S. senator and asked — just making small talk during a commercial break — if the azaleas were in bloom in D.C.
He fumbled. Didn’t know what an azalea was. Tried to fake it. Hysterical.
Right now, we’re in Annapolis, Maryland, living on a boat for a couple of weeks. I’m driving around running errands in this magical geography, where spring arrives earlier than it does in Des Moines. I’ve seen iris. Dogwood. And yes, azaleas — loads of them.
And in between stops, I found myself caught in the middle of a breakdown between two friends — longtime friends — and tried to mediate a fragile, unraveling relationship.
I failed.
They’re in different zones.
According to the 2023 USDA Hardiness Zone Map, Des Moines is in Zone 5b, where winter temperatures can dip to -15°F. That’s a harsh climate. Only the hardiest plants can survive there.
Annapolis, by contrast, is in Zone 8a. Here, the winters are softer. The growing season is longer. The soil more forgiving. Azaleas — my mother’s coral-pink azaleas — thrive here.
  (Photo by Julie Gammack)
Some relationships are like that. They need the right climate: the right light, the right soil, the right rhythm of warmth and cold. And some, like azaleas in Iowa — just won’t survive. You can try, but they won’t thrive. Not really.
Then sometimes, you move — or life moves you — and what once took great effort now grows all on its own. You look around, and love is blooming in yards and along sidewalks. It feels natural.
And sometimes… sometimes, you’re watching something wilt. A relationship struggling to survive the cold. The arctic blast of fierce emails sound colder than they were meant to. The texts land wrong — stripped of tone, they feel abrupt. Frigid.
Too frigid to survive.
I told one of them, “I wish I had a magic wand. I wish I could wave it and make peace between you.”
But I don’t. I just know what it’s like to experience life in both zones.

Demand for electricity in the Northwest could double by 2046, according to a new energy forecast from regional experts.
During the next two decades, demand could increase by between 1.8% and 3.1% annually, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council heard Tuesday. The projected growth will come primarily from companies building more data centers in the region, more electric vehicles on roads, electrifying buildings, computer chip manufacturing and the production of “green hydrogen” created by running an electrical current through water to split the molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
 

Council staff presented the 20-year forecast for electricity demand in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana Tuesday to the council’s eight, governor-appointed members. Each state’s governor gets to appoint two representatives.
“The data centers, naturally in our forecasts, are the very early load growth driver here. They’re the big driver of near term demand,” Steven Simmons, senior energy forecasting analyst, told the council. Energy demand from data centers and from all electric vehicles in the region are expected to be equal by 2046, and demand from EVs is likely to surpass data center demand after 2046, Simmons said.
Residential and commercial demand, which includes forecasted energy demand for electric vehicle charging at homes and buildings, but does not include data centers, is expected to grow more gradually. Demand for residential and commercial energy in Washington alone will equal the combined demand from those sectors in Oregon, Idaho and Montana during the next two decades.
The energy forecast, part of the council’s forthcoming 9th Northwest Regional Power Plan to manage demand, does not yet include some possible variables that could reduce future demand, such as improved energy efficiency in cars, buildings and some industries as a response to demand, as well as growing adoption of rooftop solar on residential and commercial buildings.
But rapidly growing demand now means electricity grids in the Northwest and across the U.S. are encountering transmission constraints, and scaling infrastructure to meet demand has been slow due to supply chain delays and issues, staff said.
  Data centers 

Council staff expect the biggest growth in data center and computer chip energy demand will occur in eastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and the Portland and Boise metro areas, based on historical trends and announced projects.
There are more than 100 data centers in Oregon, according to the company Data Center Map, and there are more than 5,000 data centers throughout the U.S. according to Statista — the most in any country.
Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville.
  What’s next 

To develop its next power plan, the council will evaluate supply side resources, including the potential for more regional windfarms, utility-scale and small-scale solar installations, better battery storage and more geothermal and fracked gas sources, among other options.
The council has published regional power plans about every five years since 1983, to lay out how the region will maintain an affordable and adequate power supply. A draft of the plan, an update from the last one that was published in 2021, is expected to be ready for public review and input by July 2026 and would be finalized by late 2026, according to council spokesperson Peter Jensen.
The Northwest Power and Conservation Council was formed in 1981 following passage of the federal Northwest Power Act. That act directed the four states to work collaboratively on regional energy planning and to stop the decline of native Columbia Basin fish species that have suffered massive population losses during the last century, primarily from the development of hydroelectric dams in the region.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek in February appointed two new Oregon representatives to the council: Margaret Hoffmann, of Bend, and Chuck Sams, of Pendleton. Hoffman is the former Oregon director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program and energy adviser to former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown.
Sams, former executive director of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, was most recently director of the National Park Service. Sams briefly served on the council in 2021 before he was appointed to run the Park Service.

(Photo provided by Dan Hougentogler)When a poultry farm tests positive for bird flu, the clock starts.
Within the first 72 hours, farmers start depopulating, an industry term for killing contaminated flocks.
Despite the sweltering heat inside the barns, hired workers wear gloves, face masks and other protective equipment and repetitively pick up flailing, sick chickens and place them into a metal container filled with carbon dioxide. In a few minutes, the chickens are dead.
In other cases, workers seal the barn doors and crank up the temperature, causing the birds to die from heat stroke, or flood the barn with a suffocating foam. In a few hours, most of the chickens are dead and workers begin to haul thousands, if not millions, of lifeless caracasses out to dump trucks.
The stench of death seeps into workers’ clothes, sweat and even the water they’re supposed to shower in.
This is the business of killing chickens during the ongoing bird flu epidemic. And business is booming.
As the virus spreads and drives up grocery prices by shrinking the nation’s supply of eggs and meat, bird disposal companies, environmental waste businesses and large poultry producers have received millions of federal dollars to kill flocks, compost their bodies and clean barns across the country.
However, the scale and urgency of these recent depopulation events have left room for worker protections to fall through the cracks, Investigate Midwest has found.
A review of thousands of pages of state depopulation inspection records and conversations with dozens of people who work behind the scenes has revealed:


Underage workers, in some cases, have been hired to kill poultry flocks, handle dead carcasses and clean industrial poultry farms.
Workers sometimes lack personal protective equipment or receive damaged gear, despite the risk of the virus jumping from animals to people.
Dealing with a federal backlog, some farms have used killing methods considered inhumane because it can be quicker and cheaper.


“The biggest factor in agricultural safety is the urgency,” said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health for the National Center for Farmworker Health, a Texas-based nonprofit that advocates for worker safety and health. “Everything has to get done in a short amount of time and that really can be problematic because there’s not the same amount of time to adequately train workers.”
The current bird flu outbreak is also the first time in the nation’s history that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has put a single federal contractor in charge of responding to outbreaks when a business or state agriculture department can’t handle a farm’s depopulation request.

In the past, the USDA would train emergency response contractors across the country to deal with outbreaks in their state and region.
This practice changed with the most recent outbreak when the USDA awarded a contract to Patriot Environmental Services to be the single provider of federal depopulation services.
The use of a single federal contractor has caused delays when a farm requests assistance from the federal government to depopulate a flock, according to depopulation consultants, veterinarians and state agriculture agencies interviewed.
  An excerpt of an email exchange between reporter John McCracken and CDPHE spokesperson David Ellenberger regarding the results of a CDPHE farmworker survey.

No interpreters. No PPE. Just blood stains and feathers.
In July 2024, hundreds of workers descended on two poultry farms in rural Colorado, an hour northeast of Denver, to kill over 3 million egg-laying chickens.
Two of the state’s largest egg companies had tested positive for bird flu and their flocks needed to be destroyed.
Officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control were onsite at both outbreaks to monitor for symptoms of human exposure to the virus and to spot behavioral health concerns — that is, the psychological impact of performing high-volume animal killings in hazardous, often distressing conditions.
CDPHE forms obtained by Investigate Midwest through public records requests show agency workers interviewing primarily Spanish-speaking workers. A behavioral health worker wrote in a daily report that USDA staff approached farm management and asked if they could meet with full-time farm employees to discuss working conditions, to which management said “absolutely not.”

“They did not have the ability to go to the workers with us and did not have anyone who could be an interpreter for us,” the behavioral health worker wrote in a report, referring to USDA employees onsite.
A separate behavioral health official wrote that they witnessed workers with torn or missing PPE, PPE not being utilized, and saw “animal matter, including blood stains and feathers” on workers’ torn PPE.

The same behavioral health official noted that culling and disposal workers were required to shower at the entrance and exit of the barn, but workers said several people were not showering because the “water has a dead chicken smell” and “the horrible smell stays on the skin.”
One of the July 2024 outbreaks was at an Opal Foods commercial egg facility in Roggen, Colorado, where 1.8 million egg-laying hens were killed. Opal is a private company headquartered in Neosho, Missouri, and partially owned by Indiana-based Rose Acre Farms, the nation’s second-largest egg production company.
Opal Foods has received $24 million in payments from the USDA to cover the cost of the lost flocks since 2022, a federal response known as “indemnity payments.”
The other outbreak occurred at Morning Fresh Farms, half an hour away in Platteville, Colorado, where 1.2 million egg-laying chickens were killed. Morning Fresh is a subsidiary of Versova Holding, the nation’s fifth-largest egg-production company, which employs more than 2,000 people and purchased Morning Fresh in 2023.
Morning Fresh received nearly $7 million in indemnity payments in 2022 and 2023, but federal data does not list them, or their parent company as a recipient of funds in 2024.
Depopulation workers on both farms spent hours each day picking up chickens, putting them in metal rolling carts and filling the carts with carbon dioxide.
This process subdues and kills the birds in a few minutes but poses a danger to workers because of the repeated exposure chicken handlers have to sick birds, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, a nonprofit that set guidelines for depopulation methods with the USDA in 2019.

Underage labor flagged during bird flu response in Colorado
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment employees surveyed contract workers at both Colorado facilities to monitor for symptoms of bird flu and in a subsequent report, the Centers for Diseases Control showed workers self-identifying as young as 15.
The Colorado Youth Employment Opportunity Act prevents workers under 18 from performing hazardous work such as euthanasia and disposal of animal carcasses unless performed in certain programs, such as student-learning initiatives, agricultural education opportunities like 4-H, and work apprenticeship training, according to a department spokesperson.
The Colorado health agency confirmed with Investigate Midwest that workers under the age of 18 were present based on self-reported answers to survey questions and conversations with farm staff. The department did not provide the specific ages of workers, citing state privacy records laws.
Investigate Midwest also received records through the Freedom of Information Act for Occupational Health and Safety Administration, or OSHA, inspections done at both facilities in July and August 2024.
The records included the names of four contract labor companies interviewed by OSHA, two of which matched company names provided by the Colorado Department of Public Health.
All four contract labor companies denied using employees under the age of 18.
Aaron Garcia, owner of Atlas Labor and Staffing Solutions, which was hired during the Colorado outbreak, said his company and other contractors were working at both egg farms around the same time, given their proximity to each other and similar outbreak timeframes.
Garcia said he has heard of agriculture contract companies hiring underage workers throughout the bird flu epidemic, but his company has not done so.
He said his company, based in Iowa, was paid to provide laborers who cleaned and disinfected barns and provide laundry services for workers’ uniforms. For a few days, his crew picked up dead birds and placed them in disposal trucks. He said all of his workers’ ages were verified through federal E-Verify services.
“It’s illegal, in the first place, and it does affect the reputation of the guys that are actually trying to do it right and follow the laws,” he said.
Brian Mouw, a manager with D&H Poultry Services based in Sibley, Iowa, who was contracted to work at Opal Foods during the July 2024 outbreak, said all of their employees’ ages are verified before being hired.

“The other 200-275 people were with three other contractors hired by Opal, it could’ve been them,” he said in an email to Investigate Midwest. “They didn’t work under us.”
Khali Depardo, chief operating officer at 5280 Staffing, a Colorado-based staffing agency listed on OSHA documents as a contractor for Morning Fresh Farms, said his company “does not hire anyone under the age of 18, at any time.”
A spokesperson for Express Employment Professionals, an Oklahoma-based staffing agency also listed as a contractor in OSHA documents, said its Greeley, Colorado, office does contract work with Morning Fresh Farms but was not contracted to provide labor related to bird flu depopulation.
“Express Employment Professionals of Greeley, CO., has not employed individuals under 18 years old at Morning Fresh Farms,” the staffing agency spokesperson said in an email.

Investigate Midwest provided its findings of potential underage workers and their tasks to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. An agency spokesperson said it was unaware of any underage labor working on commercial egg farms.
“Without a full investigation, we are unable to definitively determine whether the work at issue was ‘hazardous’ under Colorado law, and if so was otherwise permissible, and we cannot opine on federal law as that is outside of our authority,” the spokesperson said.

Asked about the Colorado case, a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said it “is not clear” whether the specific case violates federal laws.

Federal child labor regulations prohibit workers under the age of 16 from conducting certain hazardous tasks while working on farms, such as working with pesticides and chemicals, but makes no mention of the gases and tactics used to kill poultry during depopulation.
The commercial egg companies behind culling events in July of 2024 denied the use of child labor as well as the hiring of contractors who used child labor.
“Morning Fresh Farms holds the highest standards for ensuring all employees are eligible to work,” a company spokesperson said in a statement provided to Investigate Midwest. “Our company has no awareness of any underage labor issues by contracting companies working on our farm during our response to highly pathogenic avian influenza.”
Versova Holdings, parent company to Morning Fresh Farms, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
“Opal Foods, LLC is a separate, independent company in which Rose Acre Farms has partial ownership,” said a spokesperson for Rose Acre Farms, parent company of Opal Foods. “We do not know all the details nor can we speak to Opal Foods’ internal operations, but Rose Acre Farms is not aware of any instances of underage hiring at Opal Foods, LLC. You should however direct your questions regarding this issue to Opal Foods.”
Opal Foods did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The USDA’s one-contractor system. Efficient or overloaded?
Over 168 million birds have been depopulated in the U.S. since early 2022, the majority of which have been at commercial operations. When a flock is killed, the USDA can compensate producers for the loss of revenue and the cost to depopulate.
Currently, operators are paid a flat fee for depopulation and disposal fees, regardless of whether the farm handles the killing on their own or hires a contractor. Producers are reimbursed $1.62 per bird for egg-laying chickens, $2.95 per meat chickens, $4.50 for turkeys and just over $5 per duck, as of February 2025, according to USDA documents.
When a farm doesn’t have the resources or money to kill a flock on its own, the state’s agriculture department is contacted. If the state does not have access to equipment or labor, a USDA-approved contract company steps in and kills the birds.
Patriot Environmental Services is the nation’s only federal contractor able to provide depopulation services when requested by the USDA.
The company is a subsidiary of the national environmental cleanup company Crystal-Clean and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with 18 locations across the country.
Parent company Crystal-Clean works with oil spills and waste management and is owned by the private equity firm J.F. Lehman & Company. Crystal-Clean was fined $1.1 million in 2023 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for failure to have proper permitting and handling of hazardous waste materials.

Patriot Environmental Services has received more than $18 million in USDA poultry depopulation contracts since the beginning of the most recent outbreak, a figure that accounts for nearly a quarter of all depopulation contracts, technical assistance payments, research and grant funding related to bird flu funded by the federal government.
This money has been paid to private companies, state agencies, universities and research groups related to poultry depopulation.
Federal contracts and grants related to poultry depopulation during the ongoing outbreak have exceeded the total amount spent during the 2014 to 2015 outbreak of bird flu, from $68 million to $73 million and counting.

In some states, poultry producers receive technical training from the state department of agriculture on proper depopulation methods and previously, the USDA would train emergency response companies across the country to handle outbreaks, according to Dan Hougentogler, an emergency response and depopulation consultant with nearly two decades of experience in the animal disease outbreak and research industry.
This practice changed with the most recent outbreak when the USDA awarded a contract to Patriot Environmental Services to be the single provider of federal depopulation services.
Hougentogler said this switch has caused a bottleneck when multiple farms need access to the federal services at the same time.
A common depopulation tactic is to fill barns with suffocating foam and Patriot Environmental Services is the only company that can access the federal foaming equipment, he said.

A state agency located in the same area as the national equipment has to wait for Patriot Environmental Services to deploy a team and use the equipment, even if they have staff trained to operate the equipment, he continued.
“Not having an expansive, trained network to operate this federal equipment, or allowing states to utilize the equipment that’s just sitting here with minimal people to use it, does cause some concern,” Hougentogler said.
The nation’s largest poultry companies do not typically use a third party for depopulation services, according to a spokesperson for the National Chicken Council, an industry advocacy group whose board members include executive leaders of several major poultry processors.
The U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, whose members include leadership at Rose Acre Foods, Versova and Cal-Maine Foods, said its members follow all guidelines set by the American Veterinary Medical Association and referred questions to the USDA.
The USDA, Patriot Environmental Services and Crystal-Clean did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
In some cases, the backlog has caused companies to use more controversial methods of depopulation because they do not have the equipment or labor on hand to complete the killings in the needed time frame.
Hougentogler said he was aware of turkey farms that used “less appropriate methods” when they couldn’t access the federal contracts in time. He noted an example where a turkey farm used ventilation shutdown and heat, referred to in the industry as VSD+, to depopulate a flock of commercial poultry.
VSD+ is a controversial method of killing animals, but is currently accepted by industry standards set by the American Veterinary Medical Association.
The USDA and the AVMA note that VSD+ is to be used only in “constrained circumstances,” but the majority of birds killed during the ongoing outbreak have been killed using ventilation shutdown.

Workers close off the circulation of air and seal entrances to barns with ventilation shutdown, oftentimes adding extra heating units to increase the temperature.

“Ultimately, the goal is to have the production system and the state veterinarian agree on what is best for both the production system and animal welfare,” Hougentogler said. “We are depopulating the animal regardless, but until they are unconscious, we should still take as much care for them as possible.”
Utah state veterinarian Amanda Price told Investigate Midwest that the state was able to receive help from the federal contractor Patriot Environmental Services when requested, but some instances were delayed by a few days. This resulted in farms using ventilation shutdown in an effort to stay within target time frames meant to prevent virus spread.
Crystal Heath, a California-based veterinarian and co-founder of Our Honor, a nonprofit group of veterinarian members that advocate against using ventilation shutdowns in the U.S., said that ventilation shutdown is a cruel method to kill flocks.
The practice is banned in the European Union and has been criticized for its cruelty to animals in both commercial pork and poultry depopulation.










“If producers are going to get bailout money, they should put plans in place to depopulate with less cruel methods.”


– Crystal Heath, veterinarian and co-founder of Our Honor


“If (producers) are going to get bailout money, they should put plans in place to depopulate with less cruel methods,” Heath said.
The American Veterinary Medical Association is currently reviewing proposals to update its depopulation guidance and is expected to announce changes later this year. The AVMA did not respond to a request for comment.
McDonald’s egg supplier kills millions of birds in Michigan with VSD+
Once a farm has depopulated its flock, the work isn’t over.
Carcasses, feed, eggs, manure, and other organic materials are gathered and composted or disposed of, a process that requires a fleet of equipment and workers.
Michigan, a state with 31 confirmed cases of bird flu in dairy cattle herds, has had 16 commercial poultry farms infected with bird flu since 2022, with more than 7 million birds killed.
Most birds killed in Michigan were at egg-laying commercial farms using the ventilation shutdown method, according to USDA data.
“Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) isn’t going to discuss details about the responses done on individual farms as most of that information is protected by Michigan law,” MDARD Director Tim Boring said in a statement provided to Investigate Midwest in response to questions about the use of ventilation shutdown.
“At every facility, we are balancing multiple priorities; including, but not limited to, stopping the spread of the disease, animal welfare, practicality given the structure, and of course safety of the people involved,” the statement continued.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development HPAI activity logs obtained via public records requests.
Documents obtained through records requests from the Michigan Department of Agriculture show Herbruck’s Poultry Ranch, the state’s largest egg-producer and supplier of eggs to McDonald’s, disposing of dozens of dump trucks filled with chickens by the day during a depopulation that occurred in April 2024.
Records referred to Herbruck trucks hauling caracasses to be composted at an outbreak site named “IO 02,” which is a reference to “Ionia 02.” This was the site of an April 2022 depopulation event that killed 2.1 million egg-laying chickens.
Herbrucks used ventilation shutdown to kill the flock, based on USDA depopulation data and references to renting and using “heaters” made in the daily logs filled out by staff on site.
Daily worker logs describe days where 55 loads of dead chickens and other material were hauled off the farms to be composted or sent to a landfill.
Contracted environmental waste companies, composting companies, labor and disinfecting crews hauled dead birds and contaminated materials to nearby landfills as well as composted the dead carcassess.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development HPAI activity logs obtained via public records requests.
Composting the bodies of birds infected with bird flu is a common practice in disposal and requires all organic material to reach an internal temperature of at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit for three days in order to kill the virus and other pathogens.
Contaminated feed, manure, bodies, eggs and other waste are stacked into large mounds, monitored for internal temperatures and eventually spread back onto land as fertilization.
Herbruck, which received $89 million in indemnity payments for the flocks killed by VSD+, was part of fast-food giant McDonald’s push for cage-free eggs and the decision to “prioritize the health and welfare of the animals,” according to a 2024 company press release.
Herbruck announced it was laying off hundreds of workers in Michigan a month after its 2024 bird flu outbreak.
Mohamed Mousa, Herbruck vice president, declined to answer questions about the company’s depopulation events and bird flu outbreaks. In an email, Mousa said the company does not have a media contact and is trying to “move on.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.

“I urge Nevadans to access their accounts on 23andMe’s website and consider deleting their shared genetic data in order to ensure their privacy. 23andMe has indicated they will continue to honor such actions, and users should make use of this option as soon as possible.” – Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, in a statement on March 26

23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
States Battle Big Tech Over Data Privacy Laws

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Nevada, Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“I urge Nevadans to access their accounts on 23andMe’s website and consider deleting their shared genetic data in order to ensure their privacy. 23andMe has indicated they will continue to honor such actions, and users should make use of this option as soon as possible,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
DNA Databases Are Boon to Police But Menace to Privacy, Critics Say

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.

“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”










It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the proposal would go to the richest people in the state.


–  David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute analyst


Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 ‘Generational change’ to taxes

While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”

This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead

Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 An uneven tax burden

Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Child tax credits, long a liberal priority, find favor in Republican states

Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

DemasMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office made nearly 2,000 pages of election documents public Friday after providing them to a legislative oversight committee.
The Michigan Department of State materials include training newsletters sent to clerks, the clerk training accreditation manual and the Election Day “flip chart” manual used by election workers at the polls.
Combined with documents previously released to the committee, there are now more than 3,000 pages of election documents available on the department’s website.
A press release from the department said it will continue to release additional materials after reviewing them to redact any sensitive information that it says could compromise election security.
“Everyone at the Michigan Department of State is committed to transparency and openness to the people we serve,” said Khyla Craine, the department’s chief legal director. “We are also committed to protecting sensitive information which, if publicly released, could be used by bad actors to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day.”
But Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), who chairs the House Election Integrity Committee, said the documents provided so far have primarily been newsletters that do not match the training materials requested by legislators.
“Leave it to our Secretary of State to ‘transparently’ dump 1,900 pages of the wrong stuff on a Friday afternoon,” Smit said. “We will conduct a thorough review of everything her department released today. But, after sifting through the information for several hours, we’ve yet to see much of the substantive training materials we requested. Secretary Benson knows what we are asking for, and she [is] refusing to give us access anyway.”
Benson’s office says reviewing the documents has “required hundreds of hours and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to review and produce.”
While the House Oversight Committee voted last month to issue a subpoena for the documents, the department says it will “continue to release additional materials to the Committee and on the public site once the department’s legal and election security teams are able to review them and redact any sensitive information that could compromise election security.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_0978-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

If you’ve ever heard someone make a flippant joke about not wanting their headstone to read that “she kept a clean house,” it may have gotten you thinking. You probably never have, on visits to a loved one’s monument, found references to a person’s career, hobbies or habits. Instead, it’s the human qualities within us that are cherished and remembered. This week’s featured poet, Ev Tower-Pierce of East Burke, celebrates the everyday moments of kindness, rather than the grand gestures, that bring us all together.Kindness, accidentallyEv Tower-Pierce, 17, East BurkeI did not know kindness isn’t always loud,not the grand gestures, not thethrow-the-coat-over-a-puddle –because sometimesit is simply someone sitting on the ground just because you did, even though there’s a perfectly good chairand they’re wearing white pants.Sometimes,it’s the way they swing your hand while walking, no rhythm,just something they can’t help, or it’s the way someone grabs your arm mid-laugh, like the joke was too big for one body,like joy needed somewhere else to go.Someone spinning while they’re waiting for the microwave,skipping stairs just to feel a second of flight,swaying in the kitchen with you,arms around your ribs, like there’s musiconly you can hear.It’sthe breath someone takes at an open window,like the sky has said their name.The way they pull their chair closer to yours,not because they can’t hear you,but because they want to.Someone waiting for your laugh before they keep talking,letting you hum, letting you be,someone asking if you’re okaywhen you’re crying on the phonein the middle of the street,reminding you you’re not invisible.It’s no big deal, just a hundred tiny thingsthat say, I see you, I see you, I see you,without making it a thing.And maybe you don’t notice at first,maybe you’re still unlearning how to flinch –but something in youstarts to relax.And suddenly,you’re laughing with your whole body,spinning in hallways,breathing deeper at windows,pulling your chair closer too.Maybe that’s the point.Maybe kindness isn’t the starring role –just the reasonthe story gets to keep going.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Young Writers Project: ‘Kindness, accidentally’.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ywp-Digger-5.5.25.jpg?fit=984%2C703&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

The effort to make Canada the 14th colony had proved a failure. Although it was never a colony, Vermont, not Canada, would become the 14th state.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Ethan and Ira’s Canadian debacles.","American General Richard Montgomery was honored with poems, pamphlets, monuments and paintings after his death at the Battle of Quebec in 1775. John Trumbull’s romanticized depiction of Montgomery’s death is in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery. Photo via Wikimedia CommonsIf Ethan and Ira Allen had their way, Canada would have been America’s 14th colony. The Allen brothers were hardly alone in pushing to have Canada join the United States. In 1774, delegates to the First Continental Congress, including Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, published an open letter to the Province of Quebec, urging Canadians to join their struggle against the British government. All they heard back was crickets.So the following year, the Allens joined more than 3,000 other colonists to try a different approach with Canada — invasion. The belief was that if the colonists made a show of force, then French Canadians, who represented a majority of European settlers in the region, would rise up against their British overlords. This Canadian-American alliance would deprive Britain of a staging area for invading the United Colonies. (This was so early in the war that the name “United States of America” hadn’t yet been coined.) It would also significantly expand the landmass and population of the Colonies. The invasion, however, would turn disastrous for the colonists, and Ethan in particular. Ethan was full of confidence in 1775 — when was he ever lacking in confidence? — because in May he had led troops in America’s first offensive victory of the war by capturing Fort Ticonderoga on the New York shore of Lake Champlain. Actually, he jointly led forces that night — working beside Benedict Arnold, who was perhaps America’s most effective officer before turning traitor. Also, the fort was crumbling and only lightly defended by British troops who had no warning an attack might come. Still, this was an important American success and made the 37-year-old Ethan Allen a household name. After capturing the fort, Arnold acted on news that a British sloop was anchored at the north end of the lake near Saint-Jean (St. Johns), Quebec. He hoped to seize it before news of Ticonderoga’s fall spread. Boarding a schooner stolen from a prominent Tory, Arnold and his crew captured the sloop without firing a shot. For good measure, they burned several smaller boats and raided supplies from the fort at Saint-Jean. Arnold declared, “At present, we are Masters of the Lake.” As the main route between British Canada and the Colonies, the lake was strategically invaluable.Sailing south with their prize, Arnold’s force encountered a group of four boats paddling north. The 100 weary men aboard the boats had been hurriedly organized by Ethan, so hastily, in fact, that they lacked sufficient rations. Nevertheless, Ethan seemed eager to outdo Arnold, announcing that his motley crew would take the town of Saint-Jean. Arnold tried to talk Ethan out of this rash plan. He failed.“100 mad fellows are going to take possession of St. John’s,” Arnold later wrote in his journal. “… A wild, impractical expensive Scheme. Of no Consequence.”And little chance of success. Ethan’s flotilla reached Saint-Jean after dark. The exhausted men secured their boats and promptly fell asleep on the riverbank. By then, 200 British soldiers had reinforced the town. At dawn, Ethan’s men were jolted awake by the sound of cannons firing from the opposite shore. Clearly outnumbered and outgunned, Ethan and his men retreated, hastily. Leaping into their boats and paddling out of range, they abandoned three of their compatriots, one of whom was captured. The other two walked the 100 miles south to Ticonderoga. Ethan Allen, here depicted in a sculpture at the U.S. Capitol by Vermont artist Larkin Mead, was captured in 1775 while trying to seize Montreal with a small force. Photo via Wikimedia CommonsThat summer Ethan returned to Canada, this time as a scout for the American army. His Green Mountain Boys had transformed into the Green Mountain Rangers, a regiment in the Continental Army. As part of the reorganization, troops elected the level-headed Seth Warner to lead them. Perhaps fearing Ethan’s recklessness, they opted not to give him a leadership role. His brothers Ira and Heman, however, were named as officers.  Ethan proved effective as a scout, moving freely behind enemy lines, recruiting French-Canadians and members of the native population to fight the British during the coming American offensive. “I … have two hundred and fifty Canadians under arms; as I march, they gather fast,” Ethan reported to invasion commander Gen. Richard Montgomery. He sent most of the men to Montgomery, but still had nearly 100 with him when he decided to improvise — he would lead the capture of Montreal. Working with Major John Brown, who had about 200 recruits of his own, Ethan devised a plan to use their forces to simultaneously attack Montreal from opposite directions, even though Montgomery had given no such orders. In fact, the general thought Saint-Jean a more valuable target. The assault was a fiasco. On Sept. 25, Ethan’s force descended on Montreal from the north, but the signal from Brown indicating that his men were in position to the south never came. Gen. Guy Carleton, the governor of the province of Quebec, rallied a force of Canadian, British and native fighters and advanced on the invaders. Ethan and 38 of his men were captured. He would spend the next two and a half years a prisoner of war. “I thought to have enrolled my name in the list of illustrious American heroes,” Ethan later wrote of that day, “but was nipped in the bud.”Earlier that month, Ira Allen attained a position of trust, when Gen. Montgomery selected him to serve as a lieutenant on his staff. Ira was only 24 years old. At the time, Montgomery was beginning a siege on Fort Saint-Jean. Critical to the operation’s success was keeping Carleton’s forces trapped in Montreal, a task that fell partly to the Green Mountain Rangers. The commander of Fort Saint-Jean, realizing that reinforcements from Montreal would never arrive, surrendered on Nov. 3. The Americans quickly moved on to their next target, Montreal. Believing the town undefendable against this larger force, Carleton withdrew his troops and headed to Quebec City and its imposing citadel, located some 150 miles to the northeast. This time, the Americans took Montreal without a fight. Next, they would seize Quebec City.Ira traveled with the Continental Army to Quebec City along the St. Lawrence River. There Montgomery planned to rendezvous with Benedict Arnold and 1,100 Continental Army troops who were trekking to Quebec through the woods of what is now northern Maine. When Montgomery’s troops reached Quebec City on Dec. 1, a shocking sight awaited them. Having marched, rowed and portaged all the way from Boston, Arnold’s force was a shadow of its former self. Desertion, disease and death had thinned its ranks to about 600. Those remaining were ragged, hungry and desperately short of supplies. Anticipating that Arnold’s men would need resupplying, though perhaps not to this extent, Montgomery had brought winter clothing and provisions. Despite the poor condition of the troops and having only about 1,200 men to the Quebec citadel’s 1,800 defenders, Montgomery and Arnold stuck with the plan. When Carleton rejected a call to surrender, the Americans bombarded the town with the few mortars and cannons they possessed. Montgomery knew he couldn’t mount a successful siege; he lacked sufficient artillery and the frozen ground made it impossible for his men to dig trenches. So he planned an assault.Ira Allen, depicted here later in life, was a 24 year old when he served as an officer in the Continental Army’s invasion of Canada in 1775. Photo via the Silver Special Collections Library, University of VermontThe Americans wanted to attack on a snowy night to conceal their approach. But the weather refused to cooperate. Finally, on the night of Dec. 27, it began to snow. As the Americans assembled for the assault, however, the sky cleared and the moon lit up the night. Montgomery postponed the attack, but he had only days to act. Arnold’s troops’ enlistments were due to expire at midnight on Dec. 31, leaving the men free to return home and effectively cutting the American force in half.  It must have seemed a good omen when it began to snow on the afternoon of Dec. 30. At 2 a.m. on Dec. 31, the Americans gathered for the assault. By this point, however, the snowstorm had become a blizzard, with snow drifting to two and three feet. Ira Allen was one of two officers leading an attack on Cape Diamond, the southern corner of the town’s wall perched atop a steep bluff. But this was just a diversion. When his unit began its attack, Ira lit rockets to cue the main strike force, led by Montgomery, to launch its attack on fortifications in the Lower Town. After helping carpenters cut through a wooden palisade fence, Montgomery led his men forward, breaking into a run with his sword drawn. As the group rounded a turn in the street, the town’s defenders fired a cannon loaded with grapeshot at the attackers. A dozen men were killed by the hail of small iron balls, including Montgomery. One of the few members of the storming party to survive was Capt. Aaron Burr.With their leader dead, the Americans fell into disarray and retreated. The battle was a rout. Against the 19 British and Canadian casualties, the Americans had 60 men killed or wounded and more than 400 captured. The Americans hunkered down outside Quebec’s walls and waited through the bitter Canadian winter in hopes that the Colonies were sending reinforcements. Ira Allen remained in the American army camp until February. Then, seeing the futility of the situation, he began the trek home. Reinforcements arrived in May, but they were British troops. Their arrival persuaded the remaining American soldiers it was time to head home. They carried with them memories of a scarring defeat and a raging epidemic of smallpox that had erupted in the camp. The effort to make Canada the 14th colony had proved a failure. Although it was never a colony, Vermont, not Canada, would become the 14th state.Gen. Richard Montgomery’s death made him an international hero. Congress commissioned a memorial in his honor, pamphleteer Thomas Paine and poet Anna Eliza Bleecker wrote of him, and members of the British Parliament even praised his valour. In Vermont, Ira Allen honored him by successfully lobbying for a town to be named after him.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Ethan and Ira’s Canadian debacles.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The_Death_of_General_Montgomery_in_the_Attack_on_Quebec_December_31_1775-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

The Legislature is maintaining its self-imposed climate obligations while simultaneously acknowledging that their proposed solutions are both impractical and too expensive.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sec. Julie Moore and Commissioner Kerrick Johnson: Unfunded laws have only theoretical benefits.","This commentary is by Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, and Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service.Vermont’s Global Warming Solutions Act and Climate Superfund Act (Act 122) have created legal mandates, but — so far — the Legislature has not provided the necessary funding for this work. Without action from the Legislature in the near term, it is not clear how these laws can be implemented effectively, with potentially costly consequences. It is simply unwise to take a wait-and-see approach, as has been suggested by several legislators, knowing full well that more resources are needed to successfully execute the ambitious vision of these acts.In 2020, the Vermont Legislature passed the Global Warming Solutions Act over Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. This significant legislation created legal mandates to reduce climate pollution and established a “right of action” allowing special interests to sue state government if Vermont fails to meet these self-imposed obligations.Over the last two years, the Legislature identified two different policy approaches to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to meet the mandates of the GWSA and directed the evaluation of both: a clean heat standard and a cap-and-invest framework. Unfortunately, independent, nonpartisan analyses found both schemes to be administratively complex, ill-timed and expensive.Given these concerns, legislative leaders have understandably been reluctant to move forward with implementing either policy. However, legislators have also not advanced — or even discussed — other approaches to supporting the work needed to meet the GWSA’s mandates. A bill, H.289, would have helped with these challenges, but has not been meaningfully addressed by the Legislature. In other words, the Legislature is maintaining its self-imposed climate obligations while simultaneously acknowledging that their proposed solutions are both impractical and too expensive.A similar pattern is evident with the Climate Superfund Act passed in 2024. This legislation was designed to allow Vermont to recover certain climate-related costs from oil companies. As required by the act, the Agency of Natural Resources and state treasurer delivered a report in January detailing the resources needed to advance this complex work: $1.2 million in contracted support and two additional staff positions dedicated to the work and anticipated legal challenges.Gov. Scott allowed Act 122 to become law without his signature and specifically acknowledged the report-back and the ability to reassess based on the feedback provided by ANR and the Treasurer’s Office. Despite receiving this report and supporting testimony, the House-backed budget did not include critical funding for this work.It is imperative that the Legislature either prioritize the full funding to complete necessary technical studies or repeal the mandates in Act 122. To date they have done neither, perhaps believing that funding this work is somehow optional. It is not.Failing to fund the work required by the GWSA and the Climate Superfund Act makes it more difficult to achieve the goals of the legislation. It also undermines confidence in public policy, increases climate anxiety, can lead to burnout, and diverts scarce resources from reducing climate pollution and improving resiliency to extreme weather to responding to litigation — litigation that has already begun.We are sympathetic to the position lawmakers are in — this was a bold approach and it’s hard to acknowledge that plans pushed through over a gubernatorial veto were too ambitious in schedule and unaffordable to implement.The principles that underpin GWSA and the Climate Superfund Act are important, and it is in the best interest of Vermonters to ensure that this work is successful. Realizing these outcomes, however, requires more than simply enacting idealistic laws — it requires working together to design achievable, properly funded initiatives rather than marching toward impractical requirements.Importantly, there are many concrete actions — including maintaining current, unprecedented levels of investments in things like weatherization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure — that can and should be undertaken this session. Action on these measures keeps Vermont at the forefront of climate action while avoiding the pitfalls of unfunded mandates, including those that leave space for unnecessary and counterproductive legal challenges.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sec.

But right now, we are facing a crisis that could upend the lives of hundreds of local families — and leave an already stretched community reeling. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating all federal funding for Head Start in its 2026 budget. If this budget moves forward, it will not only devastate Rutland County Head Start — it will also trigger a ripple effect across countless essential services in our region. Let me be clear: Head Start is not “just child care.” It is a lifeline. Our program currently serves 69 of Rutland’s most vulnerable infants, toddlers and preschoolers — all from families living at or below the poverty line. For $1.9 million in federal support, Rutland receives a comprehensive, wraparound support system that includes: • Family stabilization — Rutland County Head Start Director Donna Barrow has told me that 25% of our families are homeless and 50% are navigating mental health needs. • Developmental screenings — Barrow also says that 25% of children we serve receive special education support because we caught early warning signs. • Health and nutrition — Many of our children would not eat consistently without the meals and snacks we provide daily. • Job security for parents — Without our program, working parents — mostly in low-wage jobs — would lose their ability to earn an income. We’ve spent over 30 years building a program that works. It’s efficient, effective and deeply rooted in the needs of this community. If the proposed cuts go through, this entire system collapses overnight. And not just ours. Other local programs — those that support domestic violence survivors, provide mental health services, house the unhoused and deliver early intervention care — are also dependent on fragile federal and state funding streams. Many are already stretched to the breaking point. If one piece falls, others will be forced to fill the void with fewer resources and greater need. The cost will not only be measured in dollars, but in the toll on families, frontline workers and the long-term health of our city.We’re already seeing the warning signs: Families living in cars and tents. Parents with not enough food for their family. Children poisoned by lead, left untested until they show signs of learning delays. Teachers and staff — some of them parents themselves — facing the threat of losing their homes if our program disappears. This is not hypothetical. This is already happening. And without action, it’s about to get much worse. It doesn’t have to be this way. Rutland has the power to respond — together. We need our elected officials, local leaders, business owners, nonprofit partners and neighbors to come together and push back. We must tell our stories. Write letters. Make calls. Organize. Show the state and the country that Rutland will not stand by while its most vulnerable residents are abandoned. This is not just about Head Start. It’s about every program that helps keep our community whole. It’s about the belief that every child, regardless of ZIP code or income level, deserves a fair start. The attack on Rutland’s Head Start program is close and personal to us. However, we need to understand that this is taking place across our country. Programs intended to help our most vulnerable, children, families, the disabled and our elderly, are being defunded and strategically destroyed.Programs intended to benefit America’s middle-class — i.e. Pell grants so high school students who wish to can afford to go on to college, and, yes, Social Security — are being stripped and sold for parts. And the list goes on. The eroding of our institutions and programs that support the health and welfare of all Americans has but one objective — to weaken them until they ultimately collapse, taking our federal government with them, opening the door to an oligarchic dictatorship, erasing everything America has stood for over the past 250 years. Rutland has to speak out, opposing the elimination of our Head Start program, so essential to our community. However, we also have to recognize the danger to our country as a whole, and make our voices heard while we can. The kind of future those currently in power have for America will find us in a country we no longer recognize and don’t want to live in. We must speak out now, before we lose the rights we take for granted and our voices are silenced.This is not just about Head Start. It’s about every program that helps keep our communities and our country whole. It’s about the belief that every child, regardless of ZIP code or income level, deserves a fair start and that every American deserves a fair shake. If you’re reading this and wondering how to help — start by speaking up. Talk to your neighbors. Share this story. Contact your representatives. Demand that programs like Head Start, and the many others serving families in crisis, be protected and fully funded. Rutland is stronger when we stand together. Let’s raise our voices before it’s too late.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Leslie Burg: Rutland can’t afford to lose Head Start, or the programs that keep us together.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenThis story by Ian Kreinsen was first published in The Citizen on May 1.Marianna Holzer leafed through a carefully bound photo book that tells her family’s story.On one side of her family, her Swiss grandfather passed the bookbinding tradition on to his son, who passed it on to her. On the other side, her German mother’s family resisted Hitler’s regime.Today, Holzer and her husband, Rik Palieri, run the Holzer Book Bindery from their basement in Hinesburg. For Holzer, bookbinding is more than just a business — it’s a bridge to the past and a way to safeguard a legacy of activism.“Preserving books means preserving our history, so it all ties together,” she said.Her Swiss grandfather, Ulrich Holzer, learned the trade in Italy. But during his time there, a wave of disease and anti-foreigner scapegoating forced him to flee.Ulrich fled on a boat bound for the Holy Land, but when disease broke out onboard, he was cast ashore along with the dead in Gibraltar. A passerby heard him crying for water, and he wound up on a different ship bound for Boston.Without speaking English or having any documentation, he gravitated toward a community of Italian speakers, who helped him establish a book bindery in Hyde Park. His son, Albert Holzer, later took over the business. Marianna Holzer spent her early childhood in the shop.Marianna Holzer presses gold onto a bookmark. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenWhen the bindery closed in the 1960s, the family ended up in Putney. Then, Albert Holzer died when Marianna was just 11.Still, her mother understood the craft and helped pass it on to her daughter.“She started in a walkout basement, like this, binding books for friends,” she said. “She taught me some basic things.”Her mother, Christel Holzer, came from a family of Nazi resisters in Germany. At one point, soldiers burned her grandfather’s books on his lawn. She believes that her aunt — a fierce anti-Nazi — was murdered for helping her husband escape from a concentration camp.During that regime, Christel Holzer learned bookbinding as an act of resistance.“She decided to go into something that maybe Hitler couldn’t twist around. So, she studied arts and crafts,” Marianna said. “While she was doing that, she learned bookbinding.”After immigrating to America, Christel Holzer was hired by Albert Holzer’s bindery. The two later married.Like Christel Holzer, musician Rik Palieri also got swept up in the Holzer family business.When he and Marianna Holzer started dating, Palieri spent most of his spare time with her at the Brown River Bindery, where she worked before going independent.“I realized I not only needed to be a musician, but I also had to help out to make this relationship work,” he said.Marianna Holzer looks through a family photobook. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The CitizenToday, Palieri is fully integrated into the bindery. Holzer handles the technical work — taking precise measurements and making repairs — while Palieri gravitates toward the artistic side of the trade.Holzer converted her basement into a shop in 2008 and opened the binding business in 2010. Fifteen years later, tarnished tools, sheets of gold leaf, and strips of leather clutter the workspace where she breathes new life into time-worn books.Yet, her shop is not just a curious relic from the previous century. Business is booming.“I don’t advertise,” she said. “But people keep finding me.”Customers particularly gravitated toward her during the pandemic.“People were going into their attics, finding old books, and thinking, ‘We should do something with this.’ They’d call me up, and I’d meet them outside, even in the winter,” she said.Holzer receives anything from used Bibles to cookbooks to beloved Harry Potter books. Often, they have notes scribbled in the margin, bits of food, and wine stains.“One of the weirder books I did was a mechanics manual from the sixties,” Palieri said. “It was all greasy, but it reminded him of working on cars with his father.”Rio Palieri, Marianna Holzer and their dog Dolina. Photo by Ian Kreinsen/The Citizen“Most of the books I work on are not valuable,” Holzer said. “We’re more about sentimental value.”Sentimentality extends beyond Holzer’s customers. Above her studio, she keeps a collection of professional books from her family and childhood, including a Brothers Grimm volume her father used to read to her as a child.Next to her bookcase, she keeps a sign reading “resist.” Inspired by her mother, Holzer often attends protests and voices her opinions about the current administration.For Holzer, the bind between books, memory, resistance and human connection is clear.“Books hold our history, hold information and enable people to imagine and see themselves as others when they feel isolated and alone,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Family’s bookbinding business a page turning story of resistance, resilience.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Marianna-Holzer.jpg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

Photo by Mike Stewar/APDespite many other states still lagging behind, 92% of Vermonters already have a REAL ID — which will be required under federal law for domestic air travel starting May 7.After the deadline, U.S. air travelers 18 and older will need a REAL ID or another TSA-acceptable form of identification — such as a passport or Enhanced Driver’s License — to board domestic flights or enter certain federal buildings. Vermont is one of just 12 states with 90% or more of its IDs in compliance. Meanwhile, 30 states remain under 70% compliant — with New Jersey’s rate being the lowest, at 17%, according to data collected by CBS News. Nearby New Hampshire has 62% compliance, Massachusetts has 57%, New York has 43% and Maine has just 27%, according to the CBS data. Although the REAL ID Act was passed two decades ago to set federal security standards for state-issued IDs, many Americans are still unprepared for its implementation. While the federal government says most air travelers already show compliant IDs, roughly 1 in 5 still do not, according to the Associated Press.Enforcement of the REAL ID Act has already faced multiple delays due to deadline extensions, and at least one state has requested another extension. However, Transportation Security Administration spokesperson Dan Velez told the Associated Press that he expects no further delays.Vermont has been promoting REAL ID since 2014. Because the majority of the state’s license holders are already REAL ID compliant, the department does not anticipate a large increase in appointment traffic as the deadline draws near, according to state DMV Deputy Commissioner Matthew Rousseau.To obtain a REAL ID, Vermonters must visit a DMV office in person and present proof of identity, a Social Security card, and two documents verifying Vermont residency, such as utility bills. Applying for an Enhanced Driver’s License requires proof of U.S. citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport. Copies of birth certificates are not accepted, but a certified duplicate or original is accepted. Residents who still need the upgrade can start the process early by booking an appointment to avoid last-minute issues. The process typically takes about 15 minutes, according to Rousseau. Once approved, REAL IDs typically arrive by mail within 7-10 business days but can take up to 21 days.Read the story on VTDigger here:  92% of Vermonters have REAL ID-compliant licenses ahead of national deadline.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP-REAL-ID-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-04 07:03:17.959337

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America




Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-04 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,How state law allows private schools to ‘double dip’ by using two public programs for the same students,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/04/state-law-private-schools-double-dip/,"The Mississippi Legislature’s insistence of not requiring oversight has resulted in a way for private schools to “double dip,” or receive money from two separate state programs to educate the same handful of students.","The Mississippi Legislature’s insistence of not requiring oversight has resulted in a way for private schools to “double dip,” or receive money from two separate state programs to educate the same handful of students.
There is currently no mechanism in state law to allow state officials to determine whether double dipping is occurring. More importantly, there is nothing in state law to prevent double dipping from occurring.
So, maybe the private schools are double dipping and maybe they are not. And this is not an effort to demonize private schools — many of which are doing stellar work — but to point out the lack of state oversight and to question the wisdom of sending public funds to private schools.
There are two primary programs in Mississippi that provide public funds and state tax credit funds to private schools: the Education Scholarship Account and the Children’s Promise Act.
The programs overlap in terms of the children the private schools must educate to receive the state benefits. To receive money through an Education Scholarship Account of up to $7,829 per year to attend a private school, a student must be designated as a special needs student. The special needs designation could be the result of a physical, mental or emotional issue. An attention deficit disorder, for instance, could result in a special needs designation.
On the other hand, students who make private schools eligible to receive the Children’s Promise Act tax credit benefits must have “a chronic illness or physical, intellectual, developmental or emotional disability” or be eligible for the free lunch program or be a foster child.
No more than $3 million per year can be spent through the Education Scholarship Account while the Children’s Promise Act is capped at $9 million annually.
The bottom line is that state officials do not know how many students the private schools are serving through the Children’s Promise Act state tax credits.
The Mississippi Department of Revenue, which has a certain amount of oversight of the Children’s Promise Act funds, has said in the past it knew the number of children being served in the first year a school received the state tax credit funds, but the agency does not know whether the number of students being served in following years changes.
In short, there is nothing in state law that would prevent a private school from receiving the maximum benefit of $405,000 annually while enrolling only one child fitting the definition that would make the school eligible to receive the tax credit funds.
There is a little more oversight of the Education Scholarship Account funds, though that oversight has been slow and has only occurred after a legislative watchdog group pointed out the lax oversight.
If a school has fewer than 10 students receiving the ESA funds, the state Department of Education will not release the exact number, citing privacy concerns. But the Department of Education has released the amount of ESA funds each school received during the 2023-24 school year.
According to that information, multiple schools receiving those ESA funds but educating fewer than 10 ESA students also are receiving significant Children’s Promise Act tax credit funds. According to the Department of Revenue, as of January, six schools had received the maximum tax credit funds of $405,000 for calendar year 2024.
Three of those schools also received Education Scholarship Account funds for fewer than 10 students. For instance, one private school received $16,461 in Education Scholarship Account funds, or most likely money for two students.
If the students receiving the ESA funds were the same ones making the school eligible for the $405,000 in tax credit funds, that would mean the state was paying $210,730 per student whereas the average per pupil spending in the public schools is about $11,500 per pupil in state and local funding.
Of course, state law does not prohibit private schools from educating only one child with special needs and being eligible for the maximum tax credit benefit of $405,000 annually.
Perhaps it seems far-fetched that a private school would be educating only one child to be eligible to receive up to $405,000 in tax credit funds.
But it also seems far-fetched that for years the students receiving the Education Scholarship Account funds were mandated by state law to use the money to go to schools equipped to meet their special education needs. Yet, research by the Legislature’s Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee (PEER) found the students were going to private schools that in some instances did not have any special education teachers and in some cases the students were still getting those services from the public schools.
Perhaps the Legislature’s PEER Committee needs to do some more research to determine whether double dipping is occurring.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/07060230/FVES_Classroom.jpg,,,2025-05-04 08:04:22.884405

In the face of accelerating climate change, the scale and scope of resilience work is growing far beyond what policy makers in the late 20th century thought possible. The general risk of not acting at the needed scale far surpasses the downside risk of any single action negatively impacting an ecosystem.
The post Accelerating climate change demands ‘agile s[...]","THE UPHEAVAL of federal support for climate change work could not have come at a worse time.  Communities across Massachusetts and the US are generally under-prepared to handle the current impacts of climate change, let alone the far greater challenges projected for the years ahead. Here in New England, where rates of heavy rainfall have increased by approximately 60 percent since the mid-20th century, frequent flooding threatens neighborhoods and cities. Stormwater systems are unable to deal with the increased frequency and intensity of deluge rainstorms. Other socioecological systems essential to community well-being, including food, housing, energy, waste management, and drinking water, are also vulnerable. In areas experiencing more frequent extreme storms or wildfires, insurance is becoming both harder to obtain and significantly more expensive. This unavailability or unaffordability of insurance threatens the stability of real estate markets. Even before a catastrophic storm hits, communities are already experiencing the impacts of climate change through increased property risk and the potential instability of tax revenues. The future of Massachusetts and New England depends on reconsidering regulation that stifles innovative nature-based design and projects and scaling up effective adaptation to accelerating climate change. Effective adaptation will require system agility — the forward-leaning ability to adapt continuously to changing conditions. Massachusetts and neighboring states have been taking positive steps. Over the past decade, best-practice resilience planning incorporated powerful analytical tools to understand both climate change threats and the full scope of vulnerabilities, particularly those worsened by social inequities like poverty and racial disparities. By integrating climate impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme rainfall with social vulnerability assessments and nature-based risk reduction strategies, communities can secure a thriving future grounded in greater equity and health for both people and the environment.  In coastal Massachusetts communities such as Wellfleet, Nantucket, and Plum Island accelerating shoreline loss is taking homes and threatening vital infrastructure and high value natural habitat. Massachusetts is giving our 78 coastal communities extra funding to develop risk-based coastal resilience plans. Using advanced modeling tools developed from the explosive growth of information technologies, these plans assess risks to valuable habitats, critical infrastructure, and community recreational assets. Informed by data sensing and analytical tools, the strategic placement of near-shore, habitat-friendly structures can slow erosion rates and create opportunities to avoid using hard structures that deflect energy and cause erosion elsewhere. The design process requires getting extensive site-specific data and most recently developed with the aid of artificial intelligence. But, implementing these projects requires working within the existing outmoded environmental management system that was not built to address the accelerating impacts of climate change. Procedural overload — multiple reviews, siloed rules, and an overly risk-averse perspective — undermine timely progress. For example, innovative nature-based measures like floating wetlands or naturalized reef structures that can reduce the wave energy on a shoreline face regulatory burden that is often higher than what is required for sea walls and other more traditional but more destructive alternatives. It took years for regulators to embrace green infrastructure as the better way to address stormwater pollution. Communities don’t have years for coastal regulators to embrace nature-based strategies to address coastal erosion that threatens vital infrastructure and habitat.   In the face of accelerating climate change, the scale and scope of resilience work is growing far beyond what policy makers in the late 20th century thought possible. The general risk of not acting at the needed scale far surpasses the downside risk of any single action negatively impacting an ecosystem.  Eventually a fundamental rethinking of the environmental management system is crucial for building the resilience necessary to thrive in the coming years. Unfortunately, redesigning the national environmental management system is unrealistic in this political environment. But there is way forward. Community-based public-private partnerships are a tested approach to scale the level of projects needed to meet an environmental challenge.  The ingredients for this partnership model start with a long-term source of revenue.  The second ingredient is a planning framework that defines the scope of what must be done. The next ingredient is a local or regional government that creates a partnership with private firm and an engagement program that effectively recruits the input of stakeholders.  With the promise of a large number of green infrastructure projects, the firm procures the needed design and build services at a scale necessary to meet the performance goals defined in the planning and permit framework. Most importantly the firm takes on the legal responsibility for achieving the goals of the program.    Like the challenge to build green infrastructure at scale to address stormwater pollution and flooding, using the extensive resilience planning work to create nature-based infrastructure to address community resilience challenges is a problem of scale and implementation speed. Community-based public-private partnerships offer a solution that has been endorsed by the EPA and is available to states and local governments.  However, these partnerships will only work if regulators rethink how they regulate nature-based work. Climate change is progressing rapidly and unpredictably. An environmental management system that does not acknowledge this urgency does not effectively serve governments or their citizens. By adopting a systemic approach to resilience planning and aligning our environmental management programs with the urgency of the climate crisis, we can better prepare for and mitigate its impacts. Curt Spalding is the former regional administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Executive Director of Save The Bay in Rhode Island.

Photo courtesy Vermont Historical SocietyAs Revolutionary War leader of the Green Mountain Boys militia, Ethan Allen had seemingly no sooner captured Fort Ticonderoga from British troops on May 10, 1775, when he put quill pen to parchment to chronicle his effort.“I have,” Allen wrote, “taken the greatest care and pains to recollect the facts and arrange them; but as they touch a variety of characters and opposite interests, I am sensible that all will not be pleased with the relation of them.”Two and a half centuries later, that’s the one and only thing most people can agree on.“He has been accused of ignorance, weakness of mind, cowardice, infidelity, and atheism,” Henry Hall wrote in 1892’s “Ethan Allen: The Robin Hood of Vermont,” one of many books on the state’s love-him-or-hate-him symbolic rebel. “If Vermont is careful of her own fame, well does it become the people to know whether Ethan Allen was a hero or a humbug.”Search “Ethan Allen” online today and you’ll find more assertations of the latter, be it questions about whether he enslaved Black people or stole land from Indigenous populations.“He’s become a lightning rod for everyone’s feelings about that entire historical era,” Angie Grove, executive director of the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum in Burlington, said in a recent interview. “He gets all the credit and all the blame.”Historians say that divide is complicating efforts to mark next weekend’s 250th anniversary of his crossing of Lake Champlain and capture of Fort Ticonderoga — and, conversely, offering them the opportunity to separate fact from fiction.Ethan Allen, as sculpted in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. Photo courtesy Architect of the CapitolThe 2,000-acre Fort Ticonderoga historic site in Ticonderoga, New York, is set to present a reenactment of Allen’s raid between May 9 and 11, as well as educational stops in the Vermont towns of Sudbury, Orwell and Shoreham and a flyover by the Vermont Air National Guard.“Independence was not a foregone conclusion,” organizers note on their website. “Recovering the contingency of the American Revolution helps to underscore its profound significance.”For its part, the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum will offer free admission to Vermonters on May 10 in hopes of drawing visitors, be they curious or cynical.“I know that there are people who avoid the museum because they just assume Ethan Allen was a racist, Native American-slaughtering person,” Grove said.Then again, Grove has met others who swear Allen was a trail-blazing abolitionist at a time Vermont was drafting a 1777 constitution that would make it the first state to outlaw adult slavery. (Children wouldn’t be officially protected under the provision until 2022.)“Where did you get that information?” Grove will ask people expressing commendation or complaints.“Oh, it’s just well known,” she often hears in reply.But Grove — who holds a master’s degree in history from the University of Vermont — says it’s not so simple.Allen has been the subject of a slew of books, starting with his own in 1779. Then in 2014, the now late professors John Duffy and H. Nicholas Muller published “Inventing Ethan Allen,” an exploration of the historiography behind him.“How does the memory of Ethan Allen coincide with the reality of his life as well as much repeated supplemental legends and myths composed long after his death?” Duffy and Muller write in the prologue.The book notes, for example, that past authors often have emphasized or excluded facts to fit a particular narrative.“The story of Ethan Allen has been transformed since the 1830s to present a hero configured by comedic or tearful treatments in a consistently sentimental avoidance of events and actions that could otherwise have diminished his popular appeal,” Duffy and Muller write.Ethan Allen, as presented on a towering pedestal at Burlington’s Greenmount Cemetery. Photo courtesy Vermont Historical SocietyBut that doesn’t mean historians have censored content. Although scholars have found records of other family members using Black labor — the legal status of “free” or “slave” is rarely reported — they’ve yet to find any definitive proof whether Allen enslaved people.“In the absence of positive evidence, the question, ‘Did Ethan Allen ever own slaves?’ never appears in his biographies,” Duffy and Muller write.So why do people claim Allen did? Grove cites primary sources that show American Colonial society as a whole exploited marginalized populations — a fact that can lead some to extend the generalization to specific individuals.“We can make educated guesses, but we actually know very little about Ethan Allen’s political, social and moral relationship to slavery or Indigenous people that can be backed up with real evidence,” Grove said. “You can find claims online, but nobody has any sources for them. That isn’t to say we can’t find answers to these questions, but that research hasn’t been done yet.”Study, however, takes money.“Try as I might, I’ve found it challenging to convince people that research in general, and on Ethan Allen in particular, is worthy of investing in,” Grove said. “Anytime I mention anything about Ethan Allen, everyone says, ‘Nope, we don’t want to hear about him, we want to hear untold stories.’”Increasingly that’s leaving the internet to spin its own speculation.“In today’s climate, it doesn’t matter how much evidence or lack of evidence you have, people are going to feel the way they feel,” Grove said. “I always hope people are inspired by the idealism of the American Revolution — fighting for equality for all people, even though it didn’t give equality to all people. But I think it’s easier for some to blame certain figures of the past than to reckon with entrenched prejudices and inequalities in our society that have been passed down generation to generation.”The historian stresses she’s not taking sides, just in search of a truth not yet fully found. She hopes people will discover the homestead and its work — if only to take in one of the state’s oldest farmed areas, with a documented history dating back 600 years.“For better or for worse, Ethan Allen is the figurehead of Vermont,” Grove said. “It would be most responsible to invest in further research of him, particularly to see how well he represents the diverse state of today.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ethan Allen has an image problem.

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses. 


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
  HIPAA doesn’t help 

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)A surprise amendment to what was a simple bill caused an appreciable rift among Republicans in the Louisiana Legislature this past week, but it might have helped advance Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature legislation to address the state’s insurance crisis. 
House Bill 148, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wiley, R-Maurepas, began as a measure to require insurance companies to tell customers what their previous billing amount was whenever sending out a coverage renewal notice. Wiley said it would simply let customers quickly see whether their insurance rates have gone up or down. 
However, the legislation underwent significant changes Wednesday on the House floor. 
Wiley accepted an amendment from Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, that effectively combined his bill with some of the major provisions from a separate proposal from Democrats Robby Carter of Amite and Chad Brown of Plaquemine. Their measure, which has the governor’s backing, would give the state insurance commissioner the power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered “excessive” or unreasonably high. 
Currently, the commissioner can only exercise that power after holding a public hearing in which someone proves the state insurance market lacks competition. 
The amalgamated bill was advanced to the Senate on a 68-34,

The Carter-Brown bill had opposition from several Republican lawmakers and Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, who some speculate could become the governor’s scapegoat if the latest efforts to reduce coverage prices fail. 
The proposal would have also backed the commissioner into a corner, forcing him to choose between rates based on real market conditions and rates that are lowered as a form of political favors, Temple has said in previous interviews. 
Some Republican lawmakers made similar arguments Wednesday and challenged whether Glorioso’s amendment was germane to Wiley’s original legislation. Legislative rules forbid members from hijacking a colleague’s bill with changes that differ dramatically from the purpose of the original proposal.  
One opponent, Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, asked House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, to decide whether the Glorioso amendment departed radically from the Wiley bill. After consulting with the chamber’s parliamentarian, DeVillier said both proposals are related to the cost of insurance premiums.  
Rep. John Wyble, R-Franklinton, criticized the amendment for its lack of specificity in how the commissioner is supposed to determine whether a rate is unreasonable.
“So what’s an unreasonable profit — a 6% profit, a 4.5% profit, a 20% profit, a 100% profit?” Wyble asked.
Republicans Jay Gallé of Mandeville, Josh Carlson of Lafayette, Paula Davis of Baton Rouge and Chance Henry of Crowley also argued against the proposal, voting against the Glorioso amendment and the updated bill.

Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, who chairs the House Insurance Committee, also voted against both measures. He said he believes Glorioso’s amendment helped ensure the passage of the key provisions the governor wanted. 
Landry turned heads last month when he sat shoulder to shoulder with Brown at a committee hearing in support of the Democrat’s bill. The governor even drew praise from some of the state’s most liberal politicians after he railed against large corporations and called for stricter regulations on the insurance industry.
The Carter-Brown bill “was problematic for some Republican representatives,” Firment said in a phone interview Friday.
Moving the major provisions from that bill into a Republican-backed proposal was a way to try to ease the “heartburn” some conservatives were having, Firment said. 
The insurance commissioner is still lobbying against the revised bill. 
“I can’t speak to anyone’s motivation, but the only additional power this legislation gives me is the authority to deny rates for political, personal and other subjective reasons,” Temple said. “I’ve made that clear to the legislature and will continue working to help them understand what the bill does and why it is harmful to our insurance market.”
Wiley said he supported the amendment because of the special circumstances of the state’s insurance crisis. 
“I can just tell you that tough times call for tough decisions,” Wiley said.

March 4, 2025: Qatar to Connecticut 
In early March, sitting in his sister’s West Haven apartment, Sayed Rahim Rahim opened the small leather backpack where he carries his family’s documents for safekeeping. He pulled out certificates printed with Afghan and American flags that he received during the 12 years he worked as an automotive mechanic for the U.S. armed forces. 
On the rug, he spread out the Qatar Airways tickets and stack of passports that had helped get him, his wife, their son and four daughters across the Atlantic in a hasty departure less than a week earlier. 
The family’s arrival in Connecticut coincided with a chaotic new chapter for refugees coming to the United States, as the Trump administration halted new arrivals and began dismantling the services that once supported them. Funding cuts, an end to Temporary Protective Status for immigrants from countries like Haiti and Venezuela, and growing uncertainty for others about their future on U.S. soil have since become features of the national news cycle. 
In Connecticut, that chaos has shaken the refugee communities that have called the state home — and the resettlement agencies that have historically contracted with the federal government to lay the groundwork of a successful life in the United States.

Rahim’s family’s crisis-driven arrival may be a harbinger of how the new reality looks for refugees and Special Immigrant Visa holders like him, as support flounders and resettlement groups increasingly turn to private donors and volunteers to fill the gaps left behind.
The uncertainty began for the family in January, when they were readying to fly from a refugee camp in Qatar to the U.S. Along with more than 1,600 other Afghans, the family learned their flight had been abruptly cancelled, an action taken by President Donald J. Trump on Jan. 21, the day after he signed an executive order to indefinitely pause refugee resettlement.
The United States has ushered 200,000 Afghans to safety since the Taliban took control of the country after U.S. forces left in 2021, in what was widely considered a tragically botched exit. Afghans like Rahim, who had worked for the U.S. forces despite risks of retribution from the Taliban, had been promised a safe haven here through the pathway of Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) for him and his family. In Rahim’s case, the cancelled flight came after an eight-year wait for his visa to go through, during which time the radius of his life constricted to keep him and his family safe. For a year, he and his family lived in a hotel room. 
Meanwhile, in West Haven, Rahim’s brother-in-law, Noorjan Omerkhel, was shocked when he learned the flight was off. The family began scrambling for a solution.
Rahim and his family were still approved to come to the U.S. as SIVs, and the short-term passports they’d been issued for the trip were valid for a few more weeks. They just needed plane tickets. Omerkhel had lost his job a few months before, but he logged on to Qatar Airways and emptied most of his savings — $6,845.07 — on seven plane tickets. 
It was a blow, but Omerkhel had reason to believe that, once the family arrived, they’d be greeted with the same robust support he’d received when he came to the U.S. nine years earlier. He remembered how New Haven-based Integrated Refugee and Immigration Services (IRIS) had taken care of everything, from preparing an apartment, to cooking a first Afghan meal, to enrolling his kids in school and scheduling medical appointments. 
But when Rahim’s family arrived on Feb. 26, they met a different reality. 
IRIS was in crisis. Omerkhel alerted the group that Rahim and his family were planning to come, but just a few days before they arrived. 
Omerkhel brought them back from the airport and took them into his small home with his wife — Rahim’s sister — and their three kids for the first few nights. But he was worried. 
“There’s no case manager for (Rahim), he’s seeking help for transportation, his wife is pregnant, and his daughter is having a dental issue.”
He wondered if buying the plane tickets had been a mistake. 
“Now it fills me with upset, too much upset inside,” Omerkhel said. “I’m not a governor or mayor … simply put, I’m not (a) financially stable person. I lost my job, and still I’m struggling to find a job.” 
Back in January, IRIS had planned to help the family. But those arrangements were made before the organization was thrown into turmoil: Federal contracts worth $4 million were abruptly cancelled, the group was laying off dozens of employees and making the painful decision to give up its primary physical office. 
“We were in the midst of heartbreaking meetings,” said IRIS Executive Director Maggie Mitchell Salem.
IRIS was struggling to make sense of its new reality. Over the years, the group had co-signed leases on over 100 apartments. But with the funding to help pay for those apartments gone, they were searching for new housing for clients and working with landlords to transfer the leases to their clients’ names. 
Anxious phone calls flooded in from families who had fled war and violence in their home countries, then spent years painstakingly building new lives: learning English, going back to school, finding jobs and friendships in a wildly unfamiliar place. But without citizenship, what might become of those lives? Many of their case workers had lost their jobs and could no longer give them answers. 
Amid these calls and meetings, a group of core IRIS staff met in Mitchell Salem’s office in late February to talk about Rahim and his young family. 
“I think initially I said, ‘No, we can’t help,’” Mitchell Salem recalled. Their remaining staff was spread thin, and much of their funding had been wiped out. But as they talked, Mitchell Salem began to question herself. This work, she reasoned, was what IRIS had been built to do. 
“It’s like — we can still do this. It is absolutely right to do it,” Mitchell Salem said. “The community will have our back, regardless of whether the federal government does.”
The mood seemed to lift. More Afghan families arrived — a total of four families and a single man — and the group put out a fundraising call.
Hewad Hemat, manager of resettlement services at IRIS, and Rona Rohbar, the head of the IRIS health team, were assigned to help the family. 
“It was kind of shocking, difficult,” said Hemat, who also came to the U.S. as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2014. “A family with five kids, no credit history, the mother is pregnant and the children are so young! And there is no government help. We were very worried.”

March 7, 2025: Where would they live? 
It had been nine days since the family had arrived in the U.S., and they had moved from Omerkhel’s home to stay with Rahim’s brothers and cousin in a cramped two-bedroom apartment in West Haven. 
Rahim had met with IRIS earlier that day, and he had signals that the organization was trying to help him, but the predominant emotion was still anxiety about a stack of unsolved problems. Most important among them: Where would they live? Rahim’s relatives had been generous, but it was a lot to ask the three men living on their own to take in a family of seven. 
Whatever the obstacles of the day, Rahim’s children always gave him and his wife, Madina, some comic relief. His youngest daughter, Asna, was still working on her walking skills, and she stumbled across the carpet and into his lap. She babbled, then giggled at the tired smile Rahim pasted across his face. 
Asra, 3, curled up on a cushion, peering into a YouTube video on a cell phone. Asia, 4, circled the small apartment, on the hunt for something to busy herself. Serwat, 11, and Alia, 6, sat quietly with calm smiles on their lips, listening to their uncle translate questions to their father in his native Pashto. Rahim was beginning to learn English, but he couldn’t speak fluently like his brothers, who had served as translators with U.S. armed forces. Without being asked, Serwat and Alia pitched in, putting away visitors’ shoes or distracting the baby when she cried. 
Rahim had met with IRIS for an intake interview. When he went to their office, they gave him a couple of books for the children to explore — a pop-up book with pictures of trucks, another with games and pages of butterfly and princess stickers. At the apartment, the younger kids pulled the books from each others’ hands, anxious to look through them. Asra peeled the bright stickers off the page and pasted them up and down her arms. 
It was Ramadan, and the adults were fasting until the evening. Rahim’s wife Madina, who asked not to be photographed, had been feeling weaker than she had during previous pregnancies. Rahim urged her to break the fast and eat during the day, and sometimes she did. 
So far, the family hadn’t seen much beyond the walls of their relatives’ apartments. It was chilly out, in the 40’s. In typical New England fashion, the sky vacillated from a blanket of gray to light blue. “They’re too naughty” to take outside, Rahim said of his children with a smile, through his brother’s translation. As in, he wasn’t up for venturing into the unknown with five young kids. 
The family had practice hunkering down together in a small space — they had spent an entire year living in a Kabul hotel before getting to the refugee camp in Qatar, confined to the room for their safety.
March 11, 2025: Signs of progress
A few days later, progress: The family had doctors’ appointments, and Rahim and Madina now had their own cell phones, given to them by IRIS, so they weren’t dependent on borrowing relatives’ phones to communicate. IRIS was pulling together money for a few months’ rent, plus the deposit, so they’d be ready when they found an apartment. 
His brothers drove for Uber, and the noise of the children sometimes kept them awake. It was time to get their own place. 
“IRIS should help us,” Rahim reasoned. His wife was pregnant. Who knew how long it would be before he’d be able to start working? 
But his brothers agreed that Rahim’s career as a car mechanic was a stroke of good luck under the circumstances — that particular set of skills transcended borders and language. First, he’d need a driver’s license and an automotive repair license. It was another set of bureaucratic hills to climb. 
Rahim spent hours cooking a meal of kabuli pulao, the Afghan national dish of lamb and rice with spices, to break the daily Ramadan fast. Once the family ate, the children curled up together in the corner of the living room, watching videos on his phone.

March 12, 2025: Setbacks and opportunities 
Rohbar was in charge of getting the family medical care. Just a few months before, she would have had 11 team members working for her.
“The whole team is gone. I’m the only one left,” Rohbar said. 
It was lucky for Rahim and his family that Rohbar was the one left. She was from the same city in Afghanistan — Khost — and she spoke the same dialect, a version of Pashto she said can be unintelligible to people from outside that region. 
Rohbar helped the family schedule their medical appointments, but she was spread too thin to stay while a registered nurse checked their hearing and drew blood. Instead, she showed Rahim the number to dial for an interpreter. The connection faded in and out — “Hello? Are you there?” — the nurse asked the voice on the other end of the line. Sometimes, she was. 
The kids explored the beds, the walls, the medical supplies, as two nurses examined them one by one. Everyone remarked on the large family — so many kids! Madina stayed at home, resting before her prenatal appointment later in the day. Asra, the 3-year-old, smiled through a hearing test. And somehow Alia, 6, smiled through her blood draw.

W hen all of them had been poked and measured, a weary Rahim led the children to the front of the clinic. Within 15 minutes, Rohbar had pulled up in a minivan to take them back to Rahim’s brothers’ apartment.
Rohbar was doing what she could for the family under the circumstances, but she understood the chasm between these services and what she did for refugees just months earlier. In fact, Rohbar herself came as a refugee from Afghanistan 22 years ago as a teenager, and those first moments of welcoming live as vivid scenes in her memory. At the airport, they got off the long flight and were fingerprinted by immigration authorities. “You cannot trust any stranger,” in those early days, but there was a representative there from the International Organization for Migration who helped them through the paperwork, and then gave them bus tickets and guided the exhausted family to their bus. In New Haven, IRIS staff greeted them as they walked into the dark September night.
“The case manager was there with two or three cars, and the apartment was ready. The lights were on. Our favorite meal — the Afghan traditional meal — was on the table. The feast was ready, you know, the Afghan feast. The fridge was loaded with food. I don’t have words to explain the excitement.” 
Rohbar kept walking around from one end of the apartment to the other. The beds were made, and the closets were full of clothes. She was fascinated by the food in packages. Back in Afghanistan, they shopped in markets — she’d never seen the boxes and clamshell plastic that fills American supermarkets. “To me that was so interesting! I couldn’t believe it was real.”
And the dish they’d prepared amazed her. It was kabuli pulao. Rohbar had spent years learning to make the recipe from her mother, but her attempts were met with criticism. She never got it quite right. Yet somehow, these strangers across the world knew how to make the dish. 
That night still ranks as the happiest of Rohbar’s entire life. 
“Whenever I’m upset, these memories keep me alive,” Rohbar said. “I can still feel the joy from that night.” 
When Rohbar looked at Rahim and his family — one man, one boy, a woman and four girls with another baby girl on the way — she felt a responsibility, and an excitement, to lead by example.
As a woman, “it’s so shocking to them that I’m speaking in English, I’m working, I’m driving and showing them places,” Rohbar said. In Afghanistan, girls are not allowed to go to school beyond sixth grade, women are generally not allowed to work, get driver’s licenses or even spend time in public spaces. When they do, they must fully cover their bodies and faces. 
Rohbar gives the same pep talk to all of the women she resettles from Afghanistan.
“I tell them, ‘You came this far, you better pick up all the goody bags from here. You came for education, work, and it will be useless if you don’t do anything, if you just do what you did back home. If you don’t take advantage after sacrificing everything — your home! — it will all be in vain for you.’”
In time, Madina would be able to participate in the women’s groups that Rohbar organizes. She could get help learning English and even enroll in adult education if she wanted to. But not yet.
“In the beginning, when they arrive, it’s overwhelming,” Rohbar said.

April 4, 2025: A new home — but what happens next? 
A little over a month since the family arrived in the U.S., they finally had their own apartment. It was a walk-up on the second and third floors of a house in New Haven, near the idyllic Westville neighborhood. IRIS helped them find the apartment with four small bedrooms, overlooking a cemetery, just a few blocks from Edgewood Park. 
Madina had pains in her belly the night before. They still had no furniture, just a few rugs and cushions for the living room floor and the hallway.
But the family seemed lighter. Rahim’s English was improving, and he could express himself without a relative at hand to translate. 
“Right now, I’m good. The only problem is work, my wife is sick, my daughters, my son (needs to) go to school,” Rahim said. He couldn’t get his family around without a driver’s license. “I have appointments … if some people is not busy they coming (to drive me). My brother, my cousin.” 
Mostly, the family stayed inside. 
But today, with the sun out, Rahim decided to take them to the playground while Madina stayed with Asma, the youngest, at home. Rahim wrapped Asia and Asra in thick black parkas. Serwat and Alia, the oldest, helped their siblings tie their shoelaces. Finally, the kids jumped down the stairs and onto the sidewalk. Serwat retrieved a double stroller, and Rahim convinced the youngest girls to ride.
Daffodils and the pink cherry blossoms, the first of the season, opened their faces to the sun. Suddenly, desperate tears were rolling down Alia’s face. She wanted to climb out of the stroller and pick flowers from a manicured bed. She quieted when her father handed her a small, purple flower.

May 1, 2025: First day of school in four years
Serwat got up early. He took a shower and sprayed himself with cologne, gelled his hair and combed it neatly to the side. Today would be his first day in a brick and mortar school in four years. 
After the exit of U.S. armed forces from Afghanistan in 2021, the region of Khost where the family lived fell to Taliban control. Rahim decided to keep Serwat, then 7, at home. His school was 10 kilometers away, and the route between had become too dangerous to risk the journey. He was able to take classes during the few months the family spent at the Qatar refugee camp, but today was different: a new desk all to himself in Lauren Bitterman’s fifth-grade classroom at the Mauro-Sheridan Interdistrict Magnet School in New Haven. 
Serwat had visited the school the day before with Alia, who would start one day after her brother. They’d met all of their teachers and brought home the red shirts that are part of the school’s uniform.

Serwat walked into school with Rahim and Jennifer Huebner, the volunteer who gave them a ride that morning. The students received breakfast as they walked through the door, and Serwat grabbed a box of soy milk. Perhaps he was nervous, but he said only that he was happy. 
At his desk, Bitterman explained the day’s schedule in English, and Serwat mostly didn’t understand. But by a stroke of good luck, there was another Afghan boy, also from Khost, who would be seated next to Serwat. Once he arrived at school, he helped translate. To speak to Serwat’s parents, Bitterman would use a translation app.
Soon they’d leave for French class (“Oh great, another language!” Huebner exclaimed), and later Serwat would get a Halal lunch in the school’s cafeteria. 
Rahim and Huebner said goodbye to Serwat and left the classroom. There were still big milestones to come. Rahim had gotten his driver’s license, and the interfaith group of volunteers Huebner was part of, Shoreline Refugee Resettlement, which works with IRIS, had gotten the family a used Honda, which mechanic Peter Palumbo volunteered to fix up, as he had for other families. Palumbo was also searching for a job for Rahim.
“It makes me really happy to know there are people that are helping, even though they don’t have to do it,” Rahim said through a translator.
Rahim borrowed $800 from the Afghan community in New Haven, a collection of families who help one another through difficult times, to buy a rug and the flat cushions, or toshaka, to furnish one room of the apartment. The contours of their life in this place — where they would live, work, study — were finally visible.

Even so, the new country around them was in a moment of deep uncertainty, economically and politically. Congress was weighing cuts to the programs helping them, like SNAP and Medicaid. On April 11, thousands of Afghans learned that their Temporary Protective Status would not be renewed. That didn’t apply to Rahim and his family as SIVs, but it did impact other IRIS clients.
Rohbar, the IRIS worker who helped them arrange medical appointments, imagined that the future would not be easy for the family. Usually, a single member of IRIS would be assigned to check in with them daily, to make sure they had anything they needed. But there weren’t enough staff to go around any more. Her thoughts centered on Madina, who was due at the end of May. She was having another girl. 
Madina knew what hospital to go to for the birth, but what would happen next? How would their life look in a few months if Rahim found work and Madina had six children at home? Back in Afghanistan, the family would have lived in a compound where aunts and cousins would have lent a hand supervising the kids. 
“Here, it’s gonna be a new life for her,” Rohbar said. “She’s gonna be taking care of a newborn, herself. She’ll have to manage to get her kids to bus stops for school and have a little baby with her,” along with the three other girls who hadn’t yet reached school age. 
After he dropped off Serwat, Rahim went back to the apartment to help Madina. He’d clean up, send Asia and Asra to different corners of the room when they argued. He’d make Asma giggle as she followed him around the apartment. He’d cook a meal. Then, he’d walk back to the school to pick up Serwat and hear about his first day.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0307_SR_RahmanFamily_007-edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-04 06:00:28.736479

The 42-year-old mother was lured from her residence in Pittsburg to an immigration office in Kansas City under the pretext of an interview for a green card application. Accompanying Alvarado to that April 23 appointment was her husband, a recently naturalized U.S. citizen, and their 20-year-old daughter.
The daughter, Carina Moran, said in social media posts that Alvarado — who has deep ties to her southeast Kansas home — was tricked by ICE agents.
“I am the daughter of two immigrants,” Moran posted. “My father was born in El Salvador and my mother was born in Guatemala. My dad recently became (a) citizen after a decade of hard work and multiple long drives to interviews and today was my mom’s turn to present herself for her first interview. For an entire week leading up to today I cried and prayed that my mom would stay home and that she was going to a routine interview, but unfortunately we were lied to.”
The family had brought with them documentation to show Alvarado’s life in Pittsburg, including testimonials from community members. Her husband, Nixon Moran, had been a citizen since March. They expected Alvarado, too, would eventually become naturalized, and they hoped the spousal interview would be the first step.
Instead, officials at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Office asked Nixon Moran, 44, to step outside. Alvarado was taken into custody. The family learned that Alvarado had a deportation order from failing to appear in court when she was a youth, in the 2000s, and another issued that morning.
Alvarado, who suffers from diabetes and hypertension, was soon on her way to the Chase County Detention Center at Cottonwood Falls, two hours away in east-central Kansas. It’s a town of about 900 in a pastoral county known for its historic courthouse. The entire population of Chase County is only around 2,600. It’s the kind of place known for its history, Friday night jam sessions at the local cafe and postcard-perfect prairie vistas.
So why are detainees sent to Chase County?
Because for years the 148-bed detention center, owned and operated by the county, has been a major source of revenue. Under a contract with ICE, the jail is filled mostly with foreign nationals from Mexico and Central and South America. When I wrote about the jail in 2021, county officials said the jail was self-sustaining and helped ease the local tax burden. Back then, the jail averaged 70-75 inmates a day, and received $62 for each from ICE.
Now the jail has 143 inmates.
Of those, 119 — or 83% — are listed as “deportable alien,” according to the detention center’s online roster as of April 30. The remainder are either held on unspecified charges or on charges unrelated to immigration, such as assault or robbery.
The entry for Rosemery Alvarado included her mugshot and the two deportation counts. No other charges were listed.
The separation has torn the family apart, Carina Moran said in a post.
“I will not get to hug my mom or say goodbye, my siblings won’t get to either and my dad has to take on all of her responsibilities alone,” she said. “I am heartbroken that she will not watch us graduate, she won’t be there during the most important moments of our lives and I won’t get to share my first experiences with her anymore.”
There’s an online video of the March 19 naturalization ceremony in which Nixon Moran became an American citizen, held at Johnson County Community College. He was among 352 candidates for citizenship presented to U.S. Magistrate Judge Angel Mitchell, who noted that most Americans are either immigrants or descended from immigrants.
The event was both joyful and solemn.
It included the singing of “God Bless America” and a PowerPoint showing the countries of origin of the applicants who, among other requirements, had successfully passed a citizenship test. An oath required the newly minted citizens to renounce foreign princes and potentates, to support and defend the Constitution, and to take up arms for America when required by law.
“We should never take these freedoms for granted,” Mitchell advised, “lest we lose them someday.”
Perhaps Rosi Alvarado was inspired to begin a path to citizenship because of the unabashedly patriotic ceremony. She may have been frightened by stories of other undocumented individuals and even international students being taken from the street and placed in vans. Or she may have just delayed taking the necessary steps for so long because of her poor English skills, as noted by her daughter in a social media post: English proficiency is a requirement for most applicants under the age of 50.
It is unclear from statements made by the family why Alvarado had not obtained a green card, which grants foreign nationals the right to live and work in the United States. But what is abundantly clear is that Alvarado had made a home in Kansas, that she has a family that took their responsibilities to America seriously, and that she had resolved to do the right thing under the law.
The amount of resources ICE invested in removing Alvarado from her family and whisking her away to the detention center at Cottonwood Falls seems disproportionate to any offense she appears to have committed. In a reasonable and just society, the fact that Alvarado was married to an American citizen and had a family here should have moderated the response. But we no longer live in a reasonable or just society, and people living peacefully but without authorization in the United State have become the victims of a thirst for misguided vengeance.

This kind of hatred of others is not new.
It’s been with us in one form or another since the founding of the country, but every lifetime or so the old poison is channeled anew. Slavery could not exist unless it was doctrine that Black people were racially inferior, antisemitism was fueled by lies about secret cabals for world domination, and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community persists because of fear, lies and hatred. We have entered a new era of government-sponsored bigotry in which even the mention of equity, diversity, and inclusion is being scrubbed from the official record.
Part of the effort to whitewash America is the campaign against migrants who lack necessary documents to remain here legally. As a nation, we have always been more than happy to exploit their labor as farm workers and housekeepers. Now, by government decree and action, we are unwilling to treat them as human beings worthy of respect, a living wage, or a secure place to call home.
Where is Rosi Alvarado tonight?
Not in Kansas, unfortunately.
As of April 30, she was no longer listed on the Chase County Detention Center online roster. The same day, I filed a media request for her location with ICE officials. If the agency couldn’t tell me her exact location, I asked, could they at least confirm she was still in the United States? So far, I’ve received no response.
Carina Moran, however, posted Wednesday the family had received word Alvarado had been transferred to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center awaiting deportation. Carina has set up a GoFundMe account to help with legal and medical costs related to her mother’s deportation. As of Friday, it had raised $18,430.
That Louisiana facility has become notorious in recent weeks as the location where Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk was held after being snatched by immigration authorities. Ozturk was accused of supporting terrorism by co-authoring an opinion essay in a student newspaper asking Tufts to “recognize Palestinian genocide.”
The Louisiana holding facility is also a for-profit prison, run by Geo Group.
The Marion County Record reported Thursday that Jay Whitney, the director of the Cottonwood Falls jail, said ICE had ordered her removed from the facility. He said he didn’t know the context of Alvarado’s arrest or “how this lady’s getting all this attention.”
A small group protested outside the detention center Sunday.
“I just have a contract to house her,” Whitney told the Record. “I don’t ask questions of how come you’re detaining her or how you’ve come to the conclusion to detain her. That’s on their end.”
It’s difficult to believe Whitney is unaware of Rosi’s case, considering 10 people were holding signs outside the facility over the weekend. But what is more disturbing is his lack of curiosity about the charges against those in his care.
Every jail — even a revenue-producing, tax-lowering enterprise like the Chase County Detention Center — has an obligation to ensure that inmates it is holding are not being denied basic constitutional protections. American law makes little distinction between citizens and noncitizens when it comes to basic rights such as free speech and due process.
Who is in jail and why is at the core of our system of law.
Habeas corpus is an ancient and foundational legal principle that means a person must be bodily presented before a judge on demand. It ensures that individuals are afforded due process and not illegally confined, held in secret prisons, or simply disappeared. While Congress and the courts have narrowed in recent years the ability of those in federal custody to seek relief under habeas corpus, it remains an essential safeguard to civil liberties.
I don’t know what Rosi Alvarado’s legal status is, whether she was given a chance to appear before a judge to protest her deportation, or why she had a failure to appear on her record. The family’s social media posts have been unclear and Carina, her daughter, has not responded to requests for an interview. Frankly, I’m not sure the family understands exactly what is happening. But if what Carina has posted is true, that her mother was lured to an immigration office in expectation of a green card interview and then whisked away in a white van, it raises disturbing and fundamental questions about ICE deportations.
In other cases, the government appears to be playing a sort of shell game with detainees, moving them quickly to jurisdictions far from their places of residence and then putting them on planes without sufficient due process. In at least one case, that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the government appears to be defying a Supreme Court order to facilitate the individual’s return from a notorious El Salvadoran prison.
The toll of the second Trump administration’s first 100 days is long and loud. It includes economic chaos, civil unease, the unraveling of the federal government, our diminished standing on the world stage and a threat to the rule of law at home.
I have seen no evidence that Rosi Alvarado was a threat to her community. Judging from her daughter’s comments and social media posts, she seems to have been the kind of mother most of us knew, precious to her children, one who held her family close and who enjoyed simple things like watching her kids play football. I think of Rosi and it brings to mind my own mother, long dead now, but still vibrant in memory.
The story of Rosi Alvarado is a story not just of her home, but ours.
It is a snapshot of America in 2025, a glimpse of the place where we live now. Don’t like the surroundings? Then act to change them. As citizens, we have a duty to our neighbors to make sure the Constitution, the supreme law of the land, is observed. If we don’t, home will start to feel like less like a castle and more like a dungeon.

Sage advice on any topic, but especially when it comes to coverage of transportation.  A couple of recent stories illustrate my point.
Improved cell service on Metro-North
Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto held a media event recently in Stamford to promote the fact that AT&T has improved its cell coverage along the New Haven line.  


That telephone company spent $60 million installing 30 high-powered macro towers and small cell nodes, some of them on CDOT land, in a public-private partnership. Many are specifically aimed at dead spots in service on the trains.
This is good news… if you are an AT&T subscriber.  If you use Verizon or T-Mobile and find an area with no cell coverage on your commute, this won’t help you.  The AT&T enhancements are for its customers only. That means only about a third of cellphone using commuters will benefit by this enhancement.
There is no word from the other companies on how they might be filling holes in their service.  But… it’s a start.
However if you read the media coverage, you’d think every commuter’s cellphone coverage had been improved!  “Cellphone service to get upgrade on Metro-North rail line,” proclaimed the Hearst papers.  “Wireless service upgrades coming to New Haven line for CT commuters,” said WSHU public radio. “Gov. Lamont and AT&T launch $6M infrastructure project to improve wireless cell service for Metro-North commuters,” reports News12 TV.
Improved cell coverage is a crucial issue for commuters looking to be more productive during train-time.  But attention-grabbing headlines such as these may lead to a perception of better service.  The more you’re told “cell service is getting better” the more you’ll think it is.  Or so the pols hope. 
But… don’t believe the hype.
Faster than Acela?
In April another media event, this time at Grand Central, celebrated faster train service from New Haven:  three early morning (5 – 7 a.m.) super-express trains, one of them cutting ten minutes off its old running time, making that single train “faster than Acela.”
Great news… if you’re a pre-dawn-commuter from New Haven.  Again, kudos to Metro-North for much needed signal and infrastructure improvements.  But has the average commute to Grand Central really improved?  Not really.  The exception is not the rule.
With limited stops these super-express trains still average only 52 mph.  Regular express trains get about 46 mph and locals run just 38 mph.  Remember: the M-8 cars on Metro-North are capable of 80 mph.
How did the media portray these improvements?
“New Metro-North schedule, with shorter trips on New Haven line, now in effect,” trumpeted the Hearst papers. “Metro-North Is Faster Than Acela,” promised Bloomberg (quoting MTA chairman and CEO Janno Lieber).
The “faster than Acela” claim is technically true… for one Metro-North train.  Keep in mind that New Haven to Grand Central Terminal is 73 miles, but to Penn Station (on Amtrak) is 75 miles.  But not wanting to always sound like a grouch, I say good for Metro-North.
What worries me is the media coverage which over generalizes and lacks the caveats I’ve cited.  Telling commuters repeatedly that their trains are running faster, when they are not, may be persuasive, but it is not accurate.
So, take media coverage of transportation with a grain of salt.  The headlines don’t always tell the full story.  And don’t believe the hype.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)A lone legislative race and a smattering of local tax referendums around the state were put before Louisiana voters Saturday, when a sparse ballot had to compete with the usual spring schedule of festivals and events throughout the Bayou State
In East Baton Rouge Parish, a special election was held to fill the vacancy in Louisiana House District 67. The position became open when Larry Selders won a February election for the state Senate seat vacated when Cleo Fields won the 6th Congressional District race last year.


One notable item on Saturday’s ballot was the Lake Charles mayoral race, with Republican incumbent Nic Hunter losing to independent challenger Marshall Simien Jr.
Other highlights from Saturday’s results included a rejected property tax referendum for the East Baton Rouge Parish district attorney’s office. DA Hillar Moore had said the new millage was needed to bring his agency up to par in staffing and compensation with comparably large prosecutorial districts in Orleans and Jefferson parishes.
The 4-mill levy was projected to raise $24 million annually, with Moore projecting there would be enough revenue generated for his office to return millions to the parish government general fund. With the new tax failing, resources for the district attorney will continue to come from parish government.
In New Orleans, voters narrowly approved a property tax for the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, which has the primary task of operating the city jail. The final vote tally saw the measure prevail by a margin of two votes out of more than 25,000 ballots cast. The results still have to be verified by the Secretary of State.
Although the sheriff’s tax has already been in place for years, opponents leaned into a “no new taxes” message in their campaign against the 2.46-mill, 10-year collection. The tax is expected to generate nearly $14 million in revenue for the sheriff’s office.
St. Tammany Parish voters approved a bond sale for its public school system with a ceiling of $325 million. The debt is not expected to result in an increase to existing property millages dedicated to the school district.
A property tax in Livingston Parish public schools was renewed for another 10 years. The 7 mills will generate nearly $5 million a year for the district.
Rapides Parish voters also renewed two property taxes for their public school system, totaling 9.58 mills combined, for the next 10 years. They’re forecast to generate more than $10 million annually.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers adjourned early Saturday after approving a total state budget of $20.3 billion for 2025-27, with investments including a historic property tax package for homeowners, a new State Hospital and funding to address overcrowding at jails and prisons.
The overall budget, which includes federal dollars and other special funds, is a 3.5% increase over the current two-year budget cycle.
“We managed to address all of our needs and some of our wants, and we did it without raising any taxes. We did it without borrowing any money, and we provided record (property tax) relief,” said Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot.

The preliminary two-year budget for general fund spending for 2025-27 is $6.25 billion, an increase of 2.6% over 2023-25.
Though legislators started the 2025 session with excess revenue, they’re keeping a cautious eye to the future with the state’s growth projected to slow amid lower oil prices, declining oil tax revenue and uncertainty about tariffs. Lawmakers also funded investments that aim to spur new oil production and diversify the state’s economy.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said he’s excited the Legislature passed a property tax package that includes a $1,600 primary residence tax credit and provisions to limit future property tax increases, an idea he pitched at the start of the session. Armstrong said he’s also pleased lawmakers adopted a “bell-to-bell” cellphone ban for public schools, another idea he championed.
“I think those two things will have an immediate impact,” Armstrong said early Saturday.
The property tax package is funded with earnings from the state’s $12 billion Legacy Fund. Armstrong said if lawmakers allow the fund to continue to grow, it could put most homeowners on a path to paying zero property taxes within a decade.
“What a legacy for our kids and grandkids, to be able to have a significant amount paid toward their property tax,” said House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson.
House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, told his colleagues he’s glad they spent more time on the “real issues facing North Dakotans” this year than they had in recent years, referring to culture war issues that dominated much of the 2023 session.
“Let that be the start of a positive trend for our body, and let us commit to resisting the pull of polarization and extremism,” Ista said.

Some, including Armstrong, said the Legislature missed an opportunity to do more to address the state’s housing and workforce needs.
“But those are tough issues, so we always have more time for that,” Armstrong said.
State hospital, behavioral health
Legislators approved $300 million to construct a new State Hospital in Jamestown, which will replace an outdated facility. The project will provide 140 beds to serve people in need of acute mental health services. 
Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, who chaired the division of the House Appropriations Committee that handled the budget for Health and Human Services, said that project is critical for the state. Lawmakers had considered reducing the funding to $285 million, but ultimately approved $300 million. The Office of Management and Budget will oversee construction of the project.
“It was our highest priority in our section with the Human Service budget,” Nelson said.

Lawmakers approved other investments in regional behavioral health services, including nearly $13 million to create 24 new in-patient acute psychiatric beds in Grand Forks and $1.5 million for 10 beds in Williston.  
Legislators also fully funded the Free Through Recovery and Community Connect programs that help people with recovery support.
Prison overcrowding
The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation budget includes $28.4 million for payments to county and regional jails, which are housing inmates due to crowding at state prisons. The department is looking to staff and operate unused space in Grand Forks County’s new jail expansion for some state prisoners. Armstrong’s administration secured a letter of intent from the Grand Forks County Commission to enter into an agreement, with terms still being finalized.

The budget also includes more than $35 million to complete the Heart River Correctional Center in Mandan, the first state prison designed for women. Another $8 million is dedicated for a temporary facility to add beds for the Missouri River Correctional Center and $20 million to design and plan a new medium-security prison that’s proposed to be built next to the State Penitentiary.
A group of three bills backed by the corrections department aims to keep people out of the criminal justice system and lead to a lower recidivism rate after inmates are released. 
The recidivism rate was a point of discussion as Attorney General Drew Wrigley backed what he called a truth-in-sentencing bill. Senate Bill 2128 sought to make sure inmates in the state prison system spend most of their sentence behind bars, but it was defeated in the House.
Education funding
K-12 education was a major topic for lawmakers, but proposals to establish private school vouchers or Education Savings Accounts did not survive the session. Armstrong vetoed one bill because it only affected private school students, and lawmakers defeated a more comprehensive bill, in large part due to the high price tag.
Lawmakers did approve a bill establishing public charter schools in North Dakota for the first time.
Legislators voted down proposals to provide free school meals to all students, an idea that was strongly supported by the public. 
Lawmakers did include $7.3 million in the Department of Public Instruction budget to make free lunch available to students from families within 225% of the federal poverty level. That’s an increase from 200% of the poverty line that was funded in the 2023 session. It means a family of four with an income of about $72,000 would qualify for free school lunches.
Free school lunch advocates call on Legislature to act 

The Together for School Meals coalition has said it’s deeply disappointed the Legislature did not pass universal school meals.
“Free school meals is a policy supported by 79% of North Dakotans and championed by over 80 local organizations committed to ending child hunger,” said Amy Jacobson, executive director of Prairie Action ND and a member of the coalition. “This bill had the power to put real money — an estimated $850 per child per year — back into the pockets of hardworking parents.” 
The overall Department of Public Instruction budget contains a 2.5% increase of the per-pupil payment for each year of the biennium, raising it to $11,349 in fiscal year 2026 and $11,633 the following year. The Senate advocated for 3% each year.
Legislation signed by Armstrong will make public K-12 schools phone-free, requiring personal electronic devices to be stowed and inaccessible during instructional time. The law takes effect Aug. 1.
Culture war bills
Lawmakers debated several controversial issues that ultimately failed. A resolution urging an end to same-sex marriage passed the House but later was defeated in the Senate.
Lawmakers also defeated a bill to require the display of the Ten Commandments in schools and public colleges and rejected a resolution that declared the kingship of Jesus Christ.
The Legislature spent a considerable amount of time on policing the content in public libraries and bathrooms at public schools. 
North Dakota governor vetoes controversial library content bill

Armstrong vetoed a bill that addressed content in public libraries and K-12 schools, which expanded on legislation approved two years ago. Failure to comply could have cost the library or school state funding and resulted in criminal charges. 
“The bill imposes vague and punitive burdens on professionals and opens the door to a host of unintended and damaging consequences for our communities,” Armstrong said in his veto message.
Armstrong signed a bill that prevents K-12 public schools from building new all-gender, multistall bathrooms. Lawmakers added an exemption for existing restrooms after schools complained they would have to spend millions to bring their facilities into compliance. Schools could be fined if they don’t comply with the bathroom policy and other regulations in the same section of code, including a requirement for schools and teachers to inform a students’ parents if they learn the child is transgender. 
The governor also signed a bill that amends Century Code to state “words used to reference an individual’s gender mean the individual’s sex,” a proposal some critics called discriminatory to transgender and intersex North Dakotans. 
Property rights
Landowner groups and local government officials argued with lawmakers this session to maintain local control, though frequently ended up on the losing side of the debate. 
House Bill 1258 gave the Public Service Commission more authority over setback rules on large electrical transmission lines, taking away authority from townships and counties.

Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, represents an area where a large power line is planned. A township created a half-mile setback from residences, and Wanzek said such rules hinder the project and threaten others like it across the state. 
House Bill 2321, which aimed to strengthen the position of landowners in negotiations with oil and infrastructure developers by helping them recoup legal fees, had support in the Senate but ultimately failed in the House. 
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, who represents an area where the controversial Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is routed. His other bills to strengthen landowner rights and limit carbon capture development made little headway. 
On the final day of the session, lawmakers approved a bill that aims to keep North Dakota on the forefront of rare earth mineral development. The Northwest Landowners Association argued the bill is unconstitutional.
Loss of lawmaker
During the session, House members mourned the loss of Rep. Josh Christy, R-Fargo, who died in February at age 43. 
Last week, Armstrong signed two bills sponsored by Christy, who had developed a niche in the Legislature on the subjects of artificial intelligence and technology.

“While we continue to mourn, we celebrate the achievements he made and the legacy he left with his service,” Ista said.
As lawmakers closed out the session they also acknowledged Rep. Jim Kasper, R-Fargo, who was hospitalized late in the session.
Special session?
Lawmakers adjourned on day 74 of the session, which means they have six days remaining of their 80-day limit. 
Several expressed a desire to save days in case lawmakers need to return to address impacts on the state from cut federal funds.
“It’s highly likely that we’ll need to get called back,” said Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo.
Lee, who chaired the Senate Human Services Committee, said she’s watching potential cuts to Medicaid or other human services funding that could require the state to respond.
“Without the money, the state has to be able to step up,” Lee said. “And we’re lucky to be in a position to know that we’re probably going to be able to do that.”

The state Democrats issued a statement warning of “misguided and chaotic national policies” that threaten local impacts. 
“Already we’ve lost promised funds for rural infrastructure, mental health care and even the care of disabled persons,” Ista said.
The governor can also call a special session, which would not have a time limit.
“We’ll wait and see where we’re at,” Armstrong said Saturday. “It costs money to bring everybody back. Obviously, if there’s a real reason to do it, we will do it.”

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives passed a bill Saturday to expand the state’s existing protections for immigrants and further limit how local law enforcement can interact with federal immigration authorities.
Senate Bill 25-276 passed on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The Senate, which approved it in April, needs to sign off on changes made in the House before the bill heads to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk.
“There is clarity in place of what happens when an (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) action takes place. Notice that I’m saying ‘when,’ because everyone here knows that there is zero sense of false hope, especially in our immigrant population. They know more than anyone here in this room that they are not living risk free,” Rep. Lorena Garcia, a bill sponsor and Adams County Democrat, said ahead of the vote.
“This bill is a declaration to our commitment to civil and constitutional rights in this state, for everyone who calls this state home,” she said.

The bill would prohibit local government officials and employees from sharing personal identifying information about immigration status with ICE and would also limit where ICE can go within a public school, child care facility, hospital and library without a warrant signed by a judge. A House amendment removed the inclusion of “surrounding areas” to those banned spaces.
Public officials who intentionally violate that data sharing provision would be liable for a $50,000 civil fine, which would go to the state’s immigration legal defense fund.
The bill would also prevent local sheriffs from delaying a person’s release from jail for the purpose of immigration enforcement, get rid of certain affidavit requirements for immigrants seeking in-state tuition or a drivers license, and allow immigrant defendants to ask that a guilty plea is overturned if they were not aware of immigration consequences of that plea when they made it.
“This bill does not provide immigrants with more rights than citizens, but it ensures equal treatment under the law,” bill sponsor Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat, said.
Democrats framed the bill as a response to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts and increased detentions of immigrants without legal status, which they said are often imposed without the due process the bill tries to protect.
“When we violate due process, we violate justice,” Garcia said.
An Aurora apartment building was the site of a chaotic immigration raid earlier this year, and dozens of international students in Colorado have had their visas revoked. There have also been coordinated drug and immigration enforcement efforts at unofficial nightclubs in Adams County and Colorado Springs, and it is unclear whether the people detained in those actions have a criminal history warranting arrest.
“One of the reasons why I appreciate this bill so much is that it is one of few that is really taking seriously the crisis that the federal administration poses for immigrants in particular and for marginalized people generally,” Rep. Yara Zokaie, a Fort Collins Democrat, said.
Republicans, during the initial debate on the bill and on Saturday, argued that the bill could provoke the Trump administration to target Colorado and withhold federal money. On Friday afternoon, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Polis, Attorney General Phil Weiser and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston to invalidate the type of “sanctuary” laws that prohibit coordination and information sharing between local officials and immigration authorities.
“This is super-sizing sanctuary policy,” Rep. Max Brooks, a Castle Rock Republican, said. “When we consider this bill, we ought to be looking at the downsides, not just the emotional stories to be able to support it, but we need to look at what could potentially be the harm and the downstream negative impact.”
Eric Maruyama, a Polis spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday that the “Governor’s office has expressed concerns about the original version of SB25-276, and has been working with legislators, as well as stakeholders, including law enforcement, throughout the process on amendments that would help gain the Governor’s support. Colorado is not a sanctuary state, and Governor Polis continues urging Congress to secure the border and do their job and pass comprehensive immigration reform.”
Once the bill is sent to Polis, he will have 30 days to sign or veto it. The legislative session ends Wednesday.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — While most of Churchill Downs’ spectators watched thoroughbreds race the track, jockeying of a different kind unfolded in the stands.
The Kentucky Derby — the most famous sporting event annually held in the Bluegrass State on the first Saturday in May — draws a spate of celebrities and business executives. With the amount of influence in attendance, it’s no wonder Kentucky politicians come out to the races. 
Despite Saturday’s rainy weather, horse racing fans gathered at the track early to take their seats and place bets in ticket booths. Some high-profile guests, including Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and his family, walked a red carpet to talk with local and national media outlets about the Derby. Others, like Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman and  Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer shared photos from the red carpet and grandstand online.
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said on X he planned to attend the Derby with his wife, Kelley, on Saturday. 
“While you’re enjoying mint juleps and hot browns like we are, remember to thank all of those working to make the Derby possible!” Paul said, referring to a classic Derby cocktail and a dish that orignated in Louisville.
Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky said “there’s so many reasons” a politician may want to be seen at the Kentucky Derby. The event historically attracts many of the state’s power brokers, giving candidates and elected officials a chance to network “in a way that’s festive with the people whose support they need.” 
Beshear, the state’s top Democrat, said during his Thursday press conference that the Derby is “our premier day for talking to businesses that either are looking at Kentucky or could potentially look at Kentucky.” The governor added that the event brings a boost of tourism to the state. 
“I typically see about two races on Derby day — one if I’m just lucky enough to be standing next to the window and one, the Derby race itself,” Beshear said. “But I mean, this is a date where we don’t just see celebrities and athletes, which are great, it raises the profile of the event, but we see international CEOs enjoying the best of the best of hospitality.”

Beshear himself had a viral moment from during an interview he did at Churchill Downs earlier in the week. He told Louisville TV station WDRB that running for president in 2028 is “something I would consider” if he could be someone who could bring the U.S. together. That quote was picked up in national media reports. 
Ahead of the main race, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman shared on X that the Derby is a “a tradition that brings the eyes of the world to the Commonwealth.”
“The Derby is more than a race. It’s a symbol of our history and culture,” Coleman said. “From the thundering hooves to the hats and hospitality, this day reminds us—there’s  no place like the Bluegrass.” 
Voss said one advantage for politicians who make news at the Derby is that media coverage of the event “reaches a lot of people who do not like politics and who basically avoid political news.” 
“This is a chance for those politicians to get name recognition with people who are usually very difficult or expensive to reach, and they’ll be reaching them for free. Well, minus the cost of attending,” Voss said.  “As political ads go, that’s cheap. What’s not to love, right? They get to go to this event, have a good time and they’re probably doing more for their political careers than they accomplished at the average boring or riskier outing.”
Former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican who is now seeking to replace Mitch McConnell in the U.S. Senate in 2026, made an appearance at Churchill Downs Thursday — also known as “Thurby.” While the Kentucky Derby is the last race on Saturday, horses run the track throughout the week at Churchill Downs. 
Politicians even celebrate the Derby outside of the Bluegrass State. On Thursday, McConnell held his annual Pre-Kentucky Derby Luncheon in the U.S. Capitol with a menu that included Kern’s Kitchen Derby-Pie, fried chicken and biscuits, fried okra and corn pudding. 
President Donald Trump issued a statement Saturday calling the Derby “an iconic American institution and an elegant celebration of our culture, customs, and unwavering competitive spirit.” The Republican last attended the races in 2022. 
The Derby also is an opportunity for politicians to be seen in a personable way, Voss said.  
“Sometimes we talk about it as the ‘Which candidate would you want to have a beer with?’ but it’s more general than that,” Voss said. “People trust more the representation they’ll get from a politician who seems more like them in certain ways, seems to have common sense, and being seen having fun, doing something like going to the Derby, makes the politician seem like less of a politician. Seems more like someone able to deliver the sort of representation a regular voter would like.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3954-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-05-03 18:06:15.634988

Nikema Williams. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder Charlie Bailey, the former attorney general and lieutenant governor candidate, was elected as chairman of the Democratic Party of Georgia Saturday, replacing Atlanta U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams.
Bailey becomes the Georgia Democrat’s first full-time chair as the party intensifies its efforts to fundraise and campaign for candidates, and reenergize a base after setbacks following the 2020 historic elections for U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.
President Donald Trump’s return to the White House looms large as Georgia Democrats look ahead, which fueled questions about the role of party leadership in winning close elections. Trump’s narrow Georgia win played a key role in his return to the White House this year.
In the runoff election to lead Georgia Democrats, Bailey won 53% of the votes, with a margin of 116 votes to 98 votes over Wendy Davis, a former Rome City Commissioner and 2022 candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives.
Bailey was the Democratic nominee for attorney general in 2018 and lieutenant governor in 2022.
Top Georgia Democratic Party officials have endorsed Bailey, including U.S. Sen. Ossoff and U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath, a Marietta Democrat who delivered Bailey’s nomination speech on Saturday.
The new chair said he plans to hit the ground running by raising money for key races this year, and in next year’s election when Ossoff will be on the ballot. He’ll also need to focus on races for state legislative and statewide constitutional seats including governor.
Bailey will need to unite progressive and more moderate wings of Georgia’s Democratic base to get the party back in the win column.
“I only ask to be judged on my heart and on my work, and I think my work as a lawyer and in politics shows I’ve got a heart for democratic values,” Bailey said following the election. “We’re  going to support all of our people and get as many Democrats elected across the state as humanly possible.”
During his campaign for party chair, Bailey has cited his experience as an attorney who represented local officials seeking to stop last-minute rule changes made by the State Election Board that might have prevented the certification of the presidential election.
Bailey finished first among a field of party chair candidates that also included Gwinnett County state Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, former Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis, Nakita Hemingway of Atlanta, a former Democratic nominee for Agricultural commissioner and District 1 chairman Jay Jones from coastal Georgia, who finished third in Saturday’s election.
Bailey said that the state Democratic Party will have to win over voters by following the party’s long-held ideals for improving health care, education and the economy inequality.
Bailey said Georgia’s Republican Party is failing residents because of the closure of rural hospitals after the state GOP’s leadership resistance to full Medicaid expansion and lagging public school ratings.
“That is what they have given us, the people of Georgia,” Bailey said. “Democrats, independents, Republicans, they got full cause to be angry about that, and we’re going to make sure that they know what the Republicans have done, the choices they make, and what we stand for
  U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath delivered Charlie Bailey’s Democratic Party of Georgia chairperson nomination speech Saturday. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder
McBath said Bailey is the right person to lead the party because he knows the ins and outs of politics while also being able to raise the millions of dollars needed for campaigning.
“I’m not going to mince words about what’s happening in D.C. right now,” McBath said. “Our democracy is truly on the line, and it’s time that Georgians stand up. It’s time that we say enough is enough.”

Former Sen. Lee Bright of Spartanburg County came in second with 41%, followed by Denny Floyd, longtime treasurer of the Anderson County GOP, at 3%.
“We’ve proven we know how to win in South Carolina,” McKissick told delegates gathered in South Carolina’s capital.
Chairman since 2017, McKissick has presided over a red wave that has given the Legislature its biggest Republican majority since Reconstruction.
A Democrat hasn’t won a statewide office in South Carolina since 2006, and Republicans hold six of the state’s seven U.S. House seats.
Nominating McKissick was 7th District Rep. Russell Fry of Murrells Inlet, who in November won his second term in the seat anchored by fast-growing Horry County.
“We need to keep mobilizing the grassroots and there’s no stronger person to do that than Drew McKissick,” said Fry, a former state legislator.
In the last eight years, 20 elected officials have switched parties from Democrat to Republican. The latest was Solicitor David Pascoe —chief prosecutor for Calhoun, Dorchester and Orangeburg counties since 2004 — who’s considering a 2026 run for state attorney general.
Others include freshman state Rep. Harriett Holman, who changed parties in 2022 while she was on the Dorchester County Council. She ousted a 20-year Democratic incumbent in the Statehouse last year — among 11 House seats and seven Senate seats flipped since 2020 — to become the Legislature’s only female Black Republican.
Holman, of Ridgeville, said she never would’ve been able to flip the seat held by Rep. Joe Jefferson for two decades if not for McKissick.
Other freshmen flipping a seat in November include state Sen. JD Chaplin of Hartsville, whose ousting of 22-year incumbent Sen. Gerald Malloy stunned even political observers. If not for McKissick, Chaplin told the crowd Saturday, that seat would still be blue.
“If it wasn’t for the support that Drew McKissick gave me, we would not have a supermajority in the Senate,” he said to applause.
But both Floyd and Bright, a firebrand former senator, argued the state has become too liberal. They argued the party needs to elect Republicans further to the right on the political spectrum.

The vote showed most of the party faithful disagreed.
Bright, a Freedom Caucus-like legislator before the hardline Republican caucus existed, lost a bid last year to regain the Senate seat he lost in 2016.
“One thing that’s so discouraging: People are so trusting that if I elect a Republican, I’m going to get conservative government, and we don’t,” he said.
McKissick was the national Republican Party co-chair for more than a year before announcing his resignation in February 2024.
His decision came as then-former President Donald Trump called for new leadership on the national level. Though he had not yet become the party’s official nominee, he’d won every state contest, including a 20-percentage-point win against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in her home state.
Trump’s picks as the new co-chairs of the Republican National Committee were Michael Whatley, chair of the North Carolina GOP, and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.

As McKissick was announced Saturday, one delegate in the crowd shouted, “He was fired by Trump.”
But McKissick said the suggestion that he has anything but a good relationship with Trump is false.
“People will try to mislead and lie to some folks about people coming into our party — trying to make it to be that they are more MAGA than someone else or they are more America First,” McKissick said to the SC Daily Gazette, referring to Trump’ Make America Great Again slogan.
Trump carried South Carolina by 18 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris.
“Everybody in this room supports Donald Trump. Everybody in this room voted for Donald Trump,” McKissick said. “Anybody here claiming they are more this or more that — makes no difference.”

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
States Battle Big Tech Over Data Privacy Laws

A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
DNA Databases Are Boon to Police But Menace to Privacy, Critics Say

As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.

It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A stripped-down campaign finance bill failed in the Senate early Saturday morning after a prolonged disagreement between chambers.
House Bill 1377 was the last bill on the House and Senate floor for the 2025 legislative session. Some lawmakers hoped it would be a vehicle for ambitious changes in campaign spending transparency, as well as for streamlining financial disclosure regulations for candidates.
It would have taken effect at the same time as the launch of the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office’s new campaign finance system.
“We had a real opportunity this year with the new software coming in to take a big step forward in our campaign finance transparency and unfortunately, we failed,” said Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, who sat on the conference committee appointed to workshop the bill.
North Dakota Legislature adopts ‘historic’ property tax bill on final day of session

A conference committee of six lawmakers met several times throughout the day to work out differences over the bill. The committee ultimately decided against including a handful of transparency-related proposals in the legislation.
Dissatisfied with what the committee advanced to the floor, Roers ultimately asked the Senate to reject the proposal when it got to the floor about 3:45 a.m. Saturday. It failed 5-39.
The House, meanwhile, gave the bill a favorable 65-25 vote. Rep. Dan Ruby, R, Minot, who sponsored House Bill 1377, said the bill deserved to pass even if some lawmakers wished it had done more for campaign finance transparency.
“This is still a good bill,” he said.
House Bill 1377 sought to incentivize campaign reporting compliance by increasing late fees and making info about late filers public online.
“If you are late with fines or amendments in the future, that information will be posted on the Secretary of State’s website,” said Rep. Vicky Steiner, R-Dickinson, who carried the bill on the floor Saturday morning.
Other changes highlighted by Steiner included inflationary adjustments to campaign contribution reporting thresholds, and updating state law to reflect an Attorney General’s Opinion related to federal political action committees.
The bill sought to revive some components of Senate Bill 2156, which failed upon its second visit to the Senate floor earlier this session after significant amendments by the House.
A Senate committee led by Roers had voted to fold elements of Senate Bill 2156 into House Bill 1377 — causing consternation among some lawmakers in the House. The Senate approved the changes, though the House voted last week not to concur with the amendments.
The conference committee discussed, though ultimately rejected, several transparency-related provisions.
One was to publicize candidates’ beginning and ending campaign fund balances. Lawmakers also considered making itemized campaign expenditures available to the public. North Dakota already makes campaign contributions above $200 public.
Some legislators on the committee were skeptical the additional information would be useful.
Steiner said during a Friday meeting that full campaign spending information should not be publicized because it can be weaponized against candidates  — especially in small communities.
“My rural legislators are concerned about someone saying, ‘You bought from Joe and you didn’t buy from me, Bill,’” she said during the meeting.
Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, said he doesn’t think the public is interested in a higher level of detail.
“Nobody’s asking to know which vendors I’m working with or those types of things,” Vetter said.
Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, told her colleagues on the House floor she was disappointed with the direction the bill had taken. She said she didn’t understand why some lawmakers are reluctant to make more campaign finance data public.
“No one should have to ask,” O’Brien said.
Bill would require more frequent financial disclosure reporting from North Dakota officials

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who spoke with reporters early Saturday about some of the final bills of the session, said he doesn’t think citizen lawmakers should be required to report the same level of financial disclosures as congressional candidates. But he said the items in House Bill 1377 seemed reasonable.
“I don’t think asking for beginning fund balances and ending fund balances and itemizing your expenses in a campaign are too much to ask of elected officials,” said Armstrong, a former state senator and U.S. House representative. 
“I think the more transparency you have, the more trust you get from the public,” he added. 
Armstrong last week signed a separate bill that will require North Dakota officials to file financial disclosure forms annually, rather than only when they are appointed or file to run for office.  House Bill 1469 also requires the secretary of state to publish the forms online.

U of M Health-Sparrow serves as the Office of the Medical Examiner for several counties in mid-Michigan, including Eaton, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, and Shiawassee counties, annually compiling a drug report tracking trend in drug-related deaths.
In 2024, drug-related deaths fell to below 130 deaths in the five counties, a steep drop from the more than 180 drug-related deaths seen in 2023, according to the U of M report. Clinton and Livingston counties, which are also served by U of M Health-Sparrow’s medical examiner, saw declines in drug deaths as well.
Though the report remarks that most drug-related deaths recorded are due to more than one substance, year after year opioids, particularly fentanyl, are involved.
Statewide, Michigan’s state health department has remarked that efforts to reduce drug-related deaths, particularly fighting the opioid crisis, are working, with Michigan seeing a decline in overdose deaths from 2021 to 2023 that was almost five times greater than the decline seen nationally.  
2024-annual-ome-drug-report
President Donald Trump first declared opioid overdoses to be a public health emergency in 2017, after overdoses began to accelerate in the 1990’s.
The U of M report found that drug deaths peaked in 2018 in mid-Michigan counties, reaching more than 200 deaths, largely attributed to a stark increase in fentanyl-related deaths, with 27 more deaths being related to the opioid than in 2017.
Between 2023 and 2024, fentanyl-related deaths were cut nearly in half, the U of M report found.
Last week, in an effort to curb the distribution of fentanyl in Michigan, lawmakers in the Michigan state House bipartisanly passed legislation to set mandatory minimum prison sentences for those found distributing heroin, fentanyl or carfentanil.
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport) who is a sponsor on the legislation, House Bills 4255 and 4256, said in a statement last week that the package, which raised concerns with some over increasing incarceration, that it’s time for Michigan to get serious about getting drugs off the streets.
“Fentanyl has destroyed families, overwhelmed first responders, and turned every corner of our state into a potential crime scene,” Lightner said in the statement. “With this legislation, we are putting traffickers on notice: If you push this poison in Michigan, you will face serious time — no deals, no loopholes, no leniency.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Two bills originally designed to protect Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen from losing office if he’s suspended for disciplinary conduct failed to pass the Legislature, one in the House and one in the Senate.
Knudsen is facing discipline for statements he and lawyers under his supervision made that disparaged the court and for defying a court order in a legal standoff in 2021.
House Bill 856 and Senate Bill 49, in its initial draft, offered different ways to shield the attorney general from a proposed punishment some viewed as unfair.
Lawyers since have indicated the attorney general may not need protection, but a decision on discipline is pending with the Montana Supreme Court, and Republicans in the Montana Legislature have been critical of the judicial branch.
Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, carried one of the bills, HB 856, in the Senate, and she said Friday she was disappointed fellow Republican senators didn’t lend enough support for it.
“They did not use the tools at their disposal to protect their Republican attorney general,” McKamey said.
McKamey also said she suspected some of the opposition might have been payback from Republican leadership in the Senate — an allegation the president and majority leader disputed.
Republicans in the Senate were split this session, and McKamey is among a group who has at times bucked leadership.
“It certainly appears to be some sort of retribution,” McKamey said.
One day earlier, Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said he had opposed the bill because he felt uncertain about its impact, and Friday, he responded to the allegation of possible retribution.
“That’s absolutely false. Sen. McKamey has no influence on my vote either way,” Regier said.
In 2023, the Office for Disciplinary conduct alleged Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct for lawyers in connection with the standoff. The office oversees discipline against members of the bar.
The Montana Supreme Court is considering a unanimous recommendation from the Commission on Practice that Knudsen be suspended for 90 days for multiple violations of rules.
HB 856 and SB 49 presented different methods to protect the attorney general from disciplinary consequences.
HB 856 would have ensured Knudsen wouldn’t be at risk of losing office if he faces the full recommended suspension of 90 days.
Montana law states that an office becomes vacant if an incumbent generally fails to discharge their duties for three consecutive months, and HB 856 would have extended the period to four months.
In committee, sponsor and Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, said he thought the idea that Knudsen could get thrown out of office if he ended up suspended for 90 days was unfair, so he proposed HB 856.
Fitzpatrick said the people of Montana had just elected Knudsen, and he had won by a large margin. Knudsen, a Republican incumbent, took 60% of the vote in November 2024.
“It didn’t seem right to me that a disciplinary official would be able to basically override the will of the people,” Fitzpatrick said.
Since then, Fitzpatrick learned that even if the Supreme Court imposes a penalty of 90 days, it may not translate into a loss of office.
At a hearing in March before the Montana Supreme Court, lawyers for Knudsen and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel agreed such a penalty doesn’t mean he needs to lose his elected office.
For example, the 90 days, if imposed, don’t need to run consecutively, or they can be counted inside of a three-month period.
Knudsen’s team made other arguments as well, including that the Montana Constitution allows for the removal of a judge, but not an officer of another branch.
In the legislative committee hearing, Fitzpatrick said he didn’t know if the bill would have any impact on the attorney general’s situation, but he viewed four months as more appropriate than three months regardless.
The bill made it through the House, and the second to last week of the session, it passed a significant vote in the Senate, 28-22, without debate.
However, three days later, it failed on a final 22-27 vote.
Some Republicans who have been critical of the courts voted against it on second and third reading, and some changed their votes from yes to no.
Thursday, Fitzpatrick described the result as “confusing.”
McKamey said Fitzpatrick asked her to carry the bill in the Senate, and she tried her best with it.
She said the Knudsen family is clearly important to Republican leadership, and she described the lack of support for the bill as “short sighted.”
Austin Knudsen is the attorney general, and his mother, Rhonda Knudsen, is a former Republican legislator who served as an advisor to Regier during the session.
Regier and Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, were among the senators who voted against it, both consistently, and Regier said he wasn’t certain the bill was even relevant by the time it ended up on the floor.
McGillvray said he didn’t find it to be a significant bill, proposing a shift from three months to four, he found the speech McKamey made on the floor “pretty weak,” and he cast his vote accordingly.
“I don’t speak for how other people vote, but I don’t do retribution,” McGillvray said.
McGillvray also said if the Montana Supreme Court wanted to impose a penalty that sought to push Knudsen out of office with a suspension, it could simply extend the penalty to five months if the legislature changed the duration to four.
On the floor, McKamey had said the bill initially came about because of news reports that said Knudsen might lose his office if he was suspended for 90 days, but she said supporters of the bill later learned that might not be the case, and the law might not apply.
“Nonetheless, four months is a more appropriate timeframe than three months and provides approximately 120 days before a person loses a job that they were elected to do,” McKamey said on the floor.
Senate Bill 49 failed earlier in the House.
Sponsored by Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, SB 49 would have granted immunity from discipline to lawyers who are also elected as Constitutional officers, such as the attorney general or governor.
An original draft protected only the attorney general.
A subsequent amendment, supported by Usher, moved the implementation date so it was not retroactive, a provision described as a “get out of jail free card” for the AG.
Usher was among the legislators who initially supported HB 856 in the Senate, but subsequently opposed it. He could not be reached for comment Friday.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Capitol_Night-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-03 13:09:15.909140

Gov. Kelly Armstrong had proposed $2.9 million in his preliminary budget for the 2025-27 biennium, with $1.7 million in one-time funding to assist with transmitter maintenance and replacement.

The Senate vote allowed lawmakers to restore funding in House Bill 1015. Some senators, however, advocated for cutting back on the Prairie Public appropriation. 
The bill was amended in the Senate to provide $850,000 for Prairie Public, but did not restore its $1.2 million base funding. A conference committee this week cut the funding to $400,000 for infrastructure. 
John Harris, president and CEO of Prairie Public, testified in a hearing that Prairie Public would be spending $4 million to $7 million in the next 18 months to upgrade facilities and buy transmitters. 
Prairie Public leaders testified that the organization could survive without state funding, but that it will mean less local programming. Other funding sources for Prairie Public include charitable gambling, endowment funds and investments.

(City of New Orleans livestream)NEW ORLEANS – When Congress passed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in March 2021, it allocated $350 billion in assistance to state and local governments – providing the largest infusion of cash to local governments since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. For New Orleans, that money represented a desperately needed lifeline.
The city had been hit particularly hard by COVID-19. It was an early hotspot for the virus. And Black residents, who comprise about 60% of the city’s population, were disproportionately impacted, accounting for more than 75% of COVID deaths in the first few months of the pandemic. As New Orleans went into lockdown, the city watched its economy grind to a halt. Festivals were canceled. Hotels emptied out. Restaurants closed their dining rooms. Thousands were laid off.
For the city government, this represented a multi-pronged disaster: With tourism all but halted, the city was receiving dramatically less from sales taxes than usual, straining its finances. At the same time, the needs of its citizenry were at an all-time high. The city took out a certificate of indebtedness, which basically provided a $100 million line of credit, and partially furloughed its entire workforce.
But shortly after Congress passed ARPA, city leadership expressed cautious optimism.
“This is by no means a silver bullet or a panacea, but this funding will literally buy us time,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a March 2021 press release.

New Orleans would go on to receive nearly $388 million in ARPA funds – among the largest allocations in the country for a city of its size. The money was directly given to local governments and came with few strings attached. The recipient governments had to obligate all of the funding by the end of 2024 and spend it by the end of 2026.
The Cantrell administration would use that money not only to plug substantial holes in the city’s revenues and build up its financial reserves, but also to fund a variety of initiatives across the city – from public safety to health to economic mobility.
Cantrell will leave City Hall next year after nearly eight years as mayor. And a big part of her legacy will be about how she handled the pandemic. Not just the lockdown months, the mask mandates and the various phases of reopening, but the huge opportunity that this federal windfall represented for the city, and whether she took it.
“ARPA funds were absolutely transformational for New Orleans,” a spokesperson for the city of New Orleans said in an email, pointing to a slew of programs the city funded, from catch basin cleaning to workforce development to technological upgrades.
But not everyone agrees.
Nellie Catzen is the executive director of the Committee for a Better New Orleans, a nonprofit focused on civic engagement, especially regarding the city’s budget. She said that federal pandemic aid could have been transformational for New Orleans in meaningfully addressing inequities across the city, but city leadership decided to go another way.
“For me, the overarching legacy is one of missed opportunities,” Catzen said.
Helping city workers
About $187 million, or nearly half of the $388 million the city was allocated, went to “revenue replacement,” a purposely flexible spending category authorized in ARPA, which allowed local governments to shore up departments and services while tax revenues were down.
Dave Kamper at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank in Washington, D.C., said that for cities of New Orleans’ size, spending approximately half of ARPA money on revenue replacement is fairly typical.
“One of the great successes of ARPA is that they just let the local authorities make the decisions that made the most sense to them,” Kamper told Verite News.
Kamper noted that money used for revenue replacement was probably most impactful in its ability to maintain or even build the public sector workforce.
New Orleans City Councilman Joe Giarrusso, who chairs the council’s budget committee, agrees that revenue replacement played a key role in helping city workers.
Under the furloughs, enacted in late 2020, most city employees were being sent home without pay for one day per pay period. Some of them — political appointees often in managerial roles — were made to work through their unpaid furlough days.
“So, we were dealing with two issues: the tangible one of [city employees] making less money and then morale issues on top of that – because [employees] are being asked to work under psychological pressure, making less money and being in the pandemic, and being asked to serve the public while doing all of those things,” Giarrusso said.

The city used $32 million in ARPA money to unfurlough workers and pay them back for their lost wages, according to a 2022 report by the Bureau of Governmental Research. The money also allowed the city to raise the wages for city workers.
But Catzen said that far too much of that money went to the New Orleans Police Department, which, as it turned out, didn’t need it.
“I think the city of New Orleans, like many municipalities, leaned too hard on revenue replacement, specifically revenue replacement for the police department,” Catzen said.
In 2021, more ARPA dollars flowed to the New Orleans Police Department than any other city department, BGR found. The money allowed the city to increase the NOPD budget by $17 million, to $181 million from $164 million. The following year, $22 million in ARPA funds initially brought the department’s budget above $200 million, though it was later adjusted to about $170 million.
But the department, which had been bleeding employees and was at its lowest officer count in decades, ended up spending far less both years: $155 million in 2021 and $161 million in 2022, according to city budget reports.
Public safety
Catzen noted that the police department didn’t only receive federal money through revenue replacement. It also received tens of millions more for things like officer recruitment and police cars, all of which fell into the “public safety” ARPA expenditure category.
“We did not then – and I’m not even sure that we do now – have the officers hired to drive these vehicles,” Catzen said.
In fact, public safety was the city’s second most-funded category of ARPA expenditures — behind only revenue replacement — at  $95.29 million, or about a quarter of the city’s ARPA money. This was largely on account of some capital-intensive initiatives, including nearly $30 million toward the modernization of technology in the criminal justice system.
“The Sheriff’s Office was literally running their programs on MS-DOS,” Giarrusso said, referencing an operating system released in the early 1980s. “I think somebody said it was the same programming that gave us Donkey Kong.”
Giarrusso also noted that the city allocated about $26 million in ARPA funds for public safety vehicles, which paid not only for the new police cars, but also new ambulances.
“So many times, people focus on NOPD, but EMS really got a bunch of money for ambulances, like their fleet was in need of upgrading,” Giarrusso said.
The Mayor’s Office defended the decision to dedicate so much money to public safety.
“These investments are vital to ensuring that public employees can efficiently and effectively do their jobs,” a city spokesperson said. “Upgraded equipment, facilities, and vehicles directly impact their ability to respond quickly, operate safely, and serve the community, leading to better outcomes for residents and safer working conditions for frontline workers.”
Kamper, who has studied how different cities and states have spent ARPA money, said that, in his opinion, cities may have chosen to direct their money towards public safety and policing because that is where they are used to directing money.
“To spend it on public safety strikes me as a small-c conservative measure that probably doesn’t have as much of a return as getting money in the pockets of working families through housing help or premium pay or through things like setting up community grocery stores or assisting tenants or building housing,” Kamper said.
Addressing inequities
Getting money into working families’ pockets is precisely what a group of local nonprofits asked the city to do in April 2023.
At the time, the city had yet to allocate about $55 million in ARPA money. It was also sitting on about $300 million in surplus funds.
So three nonprofit groups — the Vera Institute of Justice, the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center and the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice — came to the council with a plan: They wanted the city to spend $147 million to build thousands of units of affordable housing, expand youth programming and offer free public transit, among other items.
“This was an opportunity cities could use to be inventive and transformative, to do things that they always had on their to-do list and never had the resources to do,” Kamper said. “I think upgrading vehicles and building new law enforcement facilities isn’t particularly inventive.”
Kamper pointed to a handful of examples elsewhere that he thought were particularly inventive uses of ARPA money. He said that Charleston, West Virginia, opened a community-run grocery store to address food insecurity. A county in Massachusetts used the federal money to make bus transit free, doubling ridership and cutting complaints in half. Austin, Texas, spent more than $100 million of its ARPA funding addressing homelessness and housing.

In New Orleans, the City Council did not adopt the groups’ $147 million plan.
However, the city did fund a number of equity-minded projects across the city, providing funding for community solar panels and batteries, guaranteed income pilot projects, free transit for youth, and medical debt relief, among other projects. City leaders also dedicated at least $5 million to reducing homelessness in the city, providing funding to close encampments, support low-barrier shelters and rapidly re-house individuals.
And the City Council made substantial investments in affordable housing. The council created a $30 million housing trust fund to help provide gap financing for affordable and workforce housing developments, using $8 million of ARPA money. Voters later approved an amendment to the city charter that made the housing trust fund permanent, this time using money from the general fund, not ARPA.
Despite the many wins, which Catzen happily acknowledges, she still thinks that the city didn’t do enough to involve residents in decision-making and address their fundamental needs.
“We had an opportunity to really flip that script and say in response to the major desperation that Black and brown people and working people were facing that we are going to invest in equity and choose to put our money towards lessening that disparity,” Catzen said. “They had the mandate in the federal policy to do that, and they had the data behind that. And the fact that they really didn’t do that meaningfully is a real missed opportunity.”
But Giarrusso added that everyone wanted a piece of the ARPA pie, and the City Council worked hard to include many different projects in its annual budget. He said that the council was hearing from people on all sides who had big ideas for the money, from poverty reduction to housing to infrastructure to even support for religious communities.
“[ARPA] felt like the Stanley Cup in that we had this money and it passed from stakeholder to stakeholder, because everybody had an interest in it,” Giarrusso said.
The legacy of ARPA
The impact ARPA had on New Orleans might be a little boring, Giarrusso admits, but it was still a boon for the city: Not only did the city avoid financial catastrophe, but it also managed to build up its financial reserves and bonding capacity.
“My view is that the city is as financially healthy as it’s ever been,” Giarrusso said, “which then for the next administration gives them way more runway to do bigger, more visionary capital project things and even nuts-and-bolts projects that just need to be done.”
But Rebecca Mowbray, president of the Bureau of Governmental Research, cautioned that some of the ARPA spending may have given residents the wrong impression about the state of the city’s finances. While she acknowledged that the city did avoid financial catastrophe, she said that it also used ARPA money to fund things it should’ve already been funding, like catch basin cleaning. And by funding so many new initiatives, the city may have created more financial obligations in the future, Mowbray cautions.
“It’s interesting that this program, which was supposed to give money out to local jurisdictions to help them stay liquid and insulate governments and residents from some of the risks of the pandemic, could actually end up creating some financial risk if we’re on the hook for new programs even if the city doesn’t have the money on a recurring basis,” Mowbray said.
But as New Orleans prepares for a number of challenges, including the potential withdrawal of federal funding by the Trump administration and threats of further attacks by the state government, Catzen said she hopes residents still feel empowered to advocate for how they want the city to spend the money it does have.
“This period of austerity means that what we do with our money that we raise here – and that we can do whatever we want with – will be all the more important,” Catzen said. “And so it is within the jurisdiction of the city and within their responsibility to spend the money that we have to meet the needs of the people.”

Rain is pelting the cherry orchards at Wunsch Farms on the Old Mission Peninsula.
Michal Peterson is wearing a full suit of rain gear. On the back of a flatbed truck are bee hives, stacked two or three high and dripping wet in the downpour. Peterson uses a Hummerbee forklift — “pretty much a forklift on steroids” — to offload them and drop them off around the rows of budding cherry trees.
He hands me a veil so I don’t get stung.

Peterson works for Hilbert’s Honey, Co., distributing beehives on orchards across northern Michigan, work he’s been doing for 18 years.
“The wild honeybees aren’t really around much. You got some butterflies, the monarchs and the bumble bees, but it’s just another extra pollination to insure the farmer,” he said.
Pollination is an essential part of many farming operations. That’s because pollinators — from bees to bugs to birds — are crucial for plant growth and reproduction.
Cherry trees, for example, need pollination in order to develop: More pollination means more fruit.
And the honeybees Peterson is setting up in northern Michigan are actually from Florida.
Commercial honeybees are considered livestock by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and shipping colonies to different crops around the country is a common practice. For instance, hundreds of thousands of colonies were sent to California’s almond orchards in 2017.
But the process comes with complications and concerns.
European honeybees are not native to North America, and can disrupt ecosystems and out-compete native species for resources. Non-native bees face a number of threats as well: pesticides, diseases and parasites, and weather. Some years have seen high mortality rates, including this year, when some commercial operations reported high losses.
Peterson said they coordinate with those running the farm to reduce their bees’ exposure to pesticides.
“He tells me when he’s done spraying, and I can put the bees in,” said Peterson. “Right now, they’re probably going to spray after it stops raining, for fungicide or whatever. That don’t really hurt the bees. It’s the poisons that they put out.”

Tens of thousands of bees teem inside one of the hives. Hilbert’s hives usually have between 30,000 and 100,000 bees. They generally try to place the hives in the orchards when it’s cool out — early morning or late evening — so the bees are less active. On a chilly, rainy day that’s less of a concern.
The cherry trees aren’t yet in bloom.
“By next week, you’ll start seeing them kind of popcorn out of their shell and have white buds coming out,” Peterson said. “So this is about the right time, as you can see, the rain don’t stop me. [The bees] have to go in a certain time so they can get acclimated to their surroundings.”
When Peterson began, he was in between jobs, and knew he wanted to work outside. His brother-in-law, a fifth generation beekeeper, reached out to ask him for help.
“I learned from the best, I feel,” he said.
Peterson clearly loves his job. “The view is amazing,” he said, though we couldn’t see much in the downpour.
“While I’m putting in bees, it’s really beautiful out here,” he said. “I always get excited when I have to put bees in the cherries.”

Hilbert’s Honey is based in Traverse City and LaBelle, Florida, and Peterson is trying to get back down to Florida to make a second trip — his second this season.
He and his family rear queen bees in Florida and help pollinate watermelon crops there as well.
“I have a list of pollinations to do, and I’m almost done with this one,” he said. “We do pollination up [US-31] and all the way up north of Northport. We try to stay local, try to help the local farmers. We also do almond pollination in the wintertime in California,” he said.
“The bees travel more than we do.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bee-hive-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-05-03 12:10:05.167085

Missouri may become the first state with an income tax to exempt capital gains, but several states have considered tax cut proposals that would benefit the wealthy during this year’s legislative sessions. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri Republicans may take their tax-cutting efforts to new heights this year as lawmakers consider exempting profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate from state income taxes.
Part of a broader push to eliminate the state income tax altogether, legislation making its way through the Capitol would provide an unprecedented benefit to the wealthy by excluding capital gains, the long-term earnings from the sale of assets. If approved, tax experts say, the legislation would mark the first time a state with an income tax has eliminated capital gains tax.
The Republican sponsors say the move would make the state more attractive for businesses and families.
“This bill is intended to energize Missouri’s economy,” Republican Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins said upon introducing the measure.
But state Democrats — and even some of their GOP colleagues — have criticized the measure as being overly favorable to the wealthy. Most states’ tax systems already put a higher tax burden on lower-income households. That trend only accelerated in this year’s legislative sessions, worrying advocates who want to see the rich pay a larger share.
“It is so egregious in just how grossly concentrated the benefits of the [Missouri] proposal would go to the richest people in the state and shift the state’s tax system to really privilege the owners of wealth over people who are earning a regular paycheck,” said David Cooper, an analyst at the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The institute advocates for progressive state taxes — those that put the proportionately largest tax burdens on the highest earners. While Cooper advises against eliminating state income taxes, he said the Missouri move would be more harmful than eliminating the income tax outright.
“If you’re wiping away the income tax altogether, there’s at least some tax benefit going to lower-earning folks who are still paying income taxes,” he said. “If you’re just eliminating capital gains income taxes, you are just giving away money to the wealthiest people in the state, period.”
Some Democratic-led states, including Maryland and Washington, have moved to increase taxes on the wealthy this year. But several states — including Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi — have made more regressive tax changes.
Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that states still prioritize progressive spending through social service programs aiding the most vulnerable residents.
He said states compete against each other for business and residents in much more immediate ways than the federal government competes against other nations.
“So states are very focused on the competitive advantages associated with a pro-growth tax regime,” he said, “and that has led to less of an emphasis in many states on achieving progressivity through the tax code.”
 
‘Generational change’ to taxes
While several states have enacted high-profile tax cuts this year, the momentum is actually slowing, Walczak said.
With booming economies and an influx of federal cash in recent years, conservative and liberal states alike passed significant tax cuts. Of the 43 states that have some sort of income tax, 28 have made rate reductions since 2021, Walczak said.
“In many states, lawmakers simply accomplished much of what they had set out to do,” he said.
Economic uncertainty and the prospect of reduced federal aid also have made many lawmakers more cautious this legislative season, he said.
But lawmakers in several states — including Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia — have continued their march to eliminate state income taxes.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers, a Republican, said this month in support of a proposed income tax cut, the Oklahoma Voice reported. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
This session, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed a bill cutting the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%. Republican lawmakers have been slashing rates for years with the ultimate aim of eliminating the income tax altogether, despite concerns that more reliance on sales tax would disproportionately burden the poor. To partially offset the income tax reduction, the legislature expanded sales taxes to more services in 2018.
And Republican lawmakers in Kansas overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to move away from the state’s graduated income tax toward a flat tax of 4% that will mostly benefit the highest earners.
Last month, Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation granting another cut in the state income tax. Officials there aim to phase out the income tax altogether over the coming years with gradual rate reductions, which Reeves characterized as “a generational change” for the state.
The Mississippi law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and increases the gas tax. Though the governor is already celebrating the end of state income tax, the law provides for incremental reductions in the coming years only if the state hits certain revenue targets.
Republican state Rep. Trey Lamar, a legislative sponsor, said income taxes disincentivize work — a particular problem for the state with the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate.
“A tax on work is a tax on productivity,” he said.
The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says the law will make the state’s tax system more inequitable. Its analysis found that when fully implemented, the top 1% of households, who have average annual incomes of $1.4 million, will receive an average cut of $41,420, or roughly 3% of their annual income. But the bottom 20% of earners, who have average annual incomes of $13,400, would realize a tax cut of just $42 per year.
Lamar noted the legislation did not increase sales taxes across the board. With average sales tax burdens already lower than neighboring states like Alabama, he said the income tax elimination will only help Mississippi workers.
“We need more people working,” he said. “So if helping the working man is somehow seen as regressive, then I’d have to say I don’t fully understand that.”
Walczak, of the Tax Foundation, said the state can afford the initial rate reduction. But it’s unclear whether state revenues will hit the targets needed — and whether lawmakers will reassess the aim of eliminating income taxes.
As one of the nation’s poorest states, Mississippi is heavily reliant on federal funding and would be particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn.
“There’s not a guarantee that the state could afford that in the future, and Mississippi does not have a large budget to begin with, so that would be harder than in most other states if the economy slid,” he said. “It does require a willingness on lawmakers’ parts to be honest with themselves if the economy changes and decide whether a pause might be necessary.”
 
An uneven tax burden
Economic uncertainty and slowing revenues have put many states into budget holes this year, forcing lawmakers to consider spending cuts or tax increases.
To close budget gaps, some conservative and liberal states have considered new or higher taxes on marijuana, tobacco and soda.
But some liberal-led states are looking to taxes more focused on the wealthy. In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee has proposed a 10% tax on digital advertising revenue.
In Washington state, lawmakers approved raising capital gains taxes and business taxes to close a looming deficit, though it’s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who has voiced skepticism, will sign off on those measures.
Maryland lawmakers, facing a $3 billion deficit, recently approved $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees. That includes two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on information technology and data services.
Moves like those that ask more of the wealthy could make some state tax systems more progressive, said Aidan Davis, the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. But most state tax proposals approved this year have primarily benefited the highest earners.
That’s particularly concerning because most state systems already favor the wealthy. In 41 states, the top 1% of earners pay a lower effective tax rate than any other group, according to an institute study.
In Missouri, the fate of the first-of-its-kind capital gains tax elimination remains up in the air.
Though versions of the proposal have passed both chambers, there are differences between the Senate and House legislation. That means the bill could go back to conference committee for further negotiation or go on to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has identified capital gains among his tax cut priorities this year.
Missouri’s Department of Revenue estimated the exemption could cost $111 million per year. But an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis of IRS data projects the change could cost $600 million or more.
If approved, the top 5% of Missouri households — those making more than $273,000 per year — will receive more than 80% of the benefit from capital gains exemption, Davis said.
“Doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while you’re continuing to tax middle class workers and people with savings,” Davis said. “It’s just a really extreme proposal.”

(Photo by Kreg Leymaster/Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture)It’s December 20th. And this story took place when my husband and I lived in town, but wanted to experiment with farming. So, we partnered with Joe and Lonna, a farming couple that lived just outside of Ames, Iowa at Onion Creek Farm. We decided to go all in and raise a handful of sheep together.
You know, Joe and Lonna have a history of putting up with crazy young people who want to experiment with different farming ideas. So, we thought, let’s do this.
And we decided to rent a ram, like we had done a couple winters in the past. We didn’t keep a ram year-round to breed our ladies. We just wanted to rent one for a few weeks every December, so we’d end up with lambs the next spring.
Joe is the DIY type of dude. He built his house with his own two hands. Joe and Lonna are vegetable farmers by trade, but they were really into the idea of letting livestock graze their veggie fields at certain times of the year to get that fertility, build up the soil, et cetera. It was a great partnership. It had gone smoothly for several years.
Well, this year, Joe and I took a livestock trailer, hauled it down to another farmer’s place to pick up this ram that we were renting. And, you know, hauling a livestock trailer is a whole feat in itself. And, honestly, the day had gone super smoothly. We were really proud of ourselves.
We dropped off some sheep at another farm on the way, and here we are picking up this ram to take back to Joe and Lana’s farm. Great, wonderful. It all went super smoothly.
By the time we got back, it was almost dark. And we backed the trailer up into the fenced-in pasture. The ladies are there waiting for their fellow. And we’re just so, so happy the day has gone really well.
We get out of the truck. As we open the back door to the trailer, this ram — whom I’m convinced has springs built into its hoofs — this ram soars over the fence that we have set up, disregarding the females waiting there to be bred.
No, it doesn’t matter. This ram soars over this fence like a reindeer pulling Santa’s sleigh.
It’s dusk. And luckily, the ram was white because we could see the white speck running into the woods, just getting further and further away from us. So, of course, I take a bucket of grain, but then again, these are grass-fed animals. They’ve never been trained to pellets or grain of any sort, but I do what I can.
I take a bucket of grain into the woods. I try to call this animal. I’m running through the woods at night. There’s no way. I cannot find this animal at all, so I decide I’ll be back first thing in the morning, crack of dawn.
And let’s hope that the ram is just standing at the fence line, smells the ladies ready to get back in, or better yet, has already jumped back in with the ladies. That’ll probably happen. I’ll come back in the morning.

After a sleepless night I show up, crack of dawn. There’s no ram in the pasture. There is no ram to be seen. This is when we realize, okay, this is going to be a little bit more serious of a situation than your average.
Like I said, this is right before Christmas. For the next six days, we are just on edge with trying to track this ram down. We do everything someone does when an animal escapes.
You call all the neighbors. You call the animal control of the county we were in and the next county over. We don’t know how far this thing’s going to get. We check Ames Facebook group incessantly to see if anyone’s had a ram sighting.
You know, we call our friends. We’re going to call the sheriff. We’ve got to report this animal so we can get this thing back. We spend our days searching through cornfields and forests around the farm, looking for this animal to see if we can find any sort of clues.
And then by the time night falls, we decide, all right, we can’t really look much more.
Let’s retire for the night, see what happens tomorrow. Maybe we’ll get a call.
Christmas carols don’t ease missing-sheep anxiety
A couple days before Christmas, we get invited to go over to sing Christmas carols in front of a fireplace at a friend’s house. And we thought, you know what, let’s get our minds off of this. This will be really nice to just go sing some Christmas songs.
So we get there. We’re drinking hot cocoa. We’re doing the things. We’re trying to forget about the circumstance. And we’re singing these songs and I realized that there’s like multiple Christmas carols that have the lyrics, shepherds watching o’er their flocks.
And I am like, okay, this isn’t helping and I need to leave. This is not fun for me anymore. So that didn’t work out.
We also realized family Christmas is canceled. Like we can’t get out town now. We have to stay. Can’t visit the family because we got this ram on the loose, and we don’t even own the ram, right? If we owned it, different story, I wouldn’t care as much, but we’re borrowing the ram.
Okay, so then we get a call. We get a call on December 23rd, a couple days before Christmas, that the ram has been spotted on a golf course north of town. Hallelujah, we drive straight to the golf course. Wonderful.
Ram plays through
And it’s great that this ram’s on the golf course. There’s still some grass to graze.
All the ponds are aerated, so the ram has water to drink. And I’m like, you know, it could live its whole life there, I guess.
We’re going to figure out how to get it. And so, of course, what do we do?
We call our friends. We get people to help us. We go get our mobile netting, like all of our rolls of net fencing. We’re just going to fence this ram and get it into the trailer and that’ll be it.
All right. We start to execute this plan and we realize that this ram has like the largest flight zone of any livestock I’ve ever worked with in my life. Usually a flight zone should be, oh, let’s say, 10 to 20 feet. This thing’s like 300 feet. And it is so skittish.
And there’s no way. There’s no way with a wall of human people. Are we going to get this ram? There’s no way with putting fencing around this animal.
The golfers on the golf course, on the other hand, they all think this is hilarious. They’re like, this is a new challenge for us. This is hilarious. We get to golf with the sheep and they’re laughing and they’re like, oh, are you the owners of the sheep?
And you know, I was not feeling the holiday spirit like these people were, but I’m glad it could provide some entertainment.
Then this is really when the spiral and the mad madness begins.
Lasso’s a no-go
I call the ISU rodeo Club. Iowa State University Rodeo Club.
Of course, they’re on Christmas break, okay? No one’s there to help lassoing.

Then I we have a friend who says, you know what, my dad grew up on a ranch in Colorado. He is a lasso master.
He dusted off his old trusty lasso and he came out to the field and we’re like, okay, this is it, this is it.
He said, “Let me go by myself. Let me try this.”
He’s very calm.
I am not calm at this moment.
So I stay in the parking lot.
He walks out with his lasso and he comes back very quickly after and says, “There’s no way I’m getting close enough to lasso this ram.
Okay, so that’s out.
Then I’m making a call to the sheriff, asking the sheriff if he can tranquilize this animal.
Sheriff tells me, sorry, ma’am, but if the ram is not deemed a danger to society, we cannot tranquilize within city limits.
Okay. So then the tranquilizer gun is that the top of my Christmas list? Didn’t expect that, okay? And they’re expensive. I’m looking into what I need to do to buy this tranquilizer gun.
Okay. So none of that worked.
Here we are Christmas Day. We do our thing in the morning. We celebrate Christmas, still don’t have this ram.
We get through the holiday and then the breakthrough happened, December 26th.
Ram busts into church
We get a call that the ram has now been spotted at the mega church across the street from the golf course.
We get the call and so does Joe, the farmer, who lives closer to the church.
We’re both on our way to the church.
Joe, somewhat unfortunately, gets there before us because we had just gone to the airport to pick up a friend who’s visiting us. We’re getting there as quick as we can.
And the janitor at this church day after Christmas is cleaning up. They had a bunch of people there the night before.
This is a huge church, so there’s these massive windows and massive glass doors.
And the janitor hears boom, boom, boom. And he thinks someone’s breaking into the church. I got to go see what’s going on. But it’s like morning time, daylight. He looks out the window and there’s a ram ramming its reflection in the window, probably about to bust through this window.
Turns out this holy lamb of God had been across the street at the golf course. Full-sized window there. He’d walked through a glass door there, completely shattered it already.
And this is the true Christmas miracle.
The janitor is also a farmer and somehow he goes outside and manages to hog tie the ram up. This ram is tied with its hoofs with some twine and rope, and it is now ready for pickup.
Joe, the farmer, gets there before we do, like I said, and he loads the ram up in the back of his truck and goes back to the farm.
Okay.
Visiting pal pukes
We are driving as fast as we can back from this airport with this friend. It is important to mention who the friend is. The friend is a photographer from LA. Artsy type. He is an Iowa boy, but he doesn’t spend much time on farms anymore. So, you know, he’s not used to chasing a ram on a farm.
We go directly from the airport to the farm as we’re speeding and bumping down the gravel road. We start to see Joe standing there next to a fence, and then we see the ram scaling the fence and starting to fly over it, and escape again.
And this time he’s running off towards the same woods with a rope dangling from the back of his hoof, and that’s when my husband just throws the car in park, and runs out sprinting.
I’ve never seen this guy run this fast, sprinting as fast as he can to capture by hand this ram, so he doesn’t escape again after he’s been on the loose for six days.
And then Rob, the photographer, decides to help, what else can he do? He starts sprinting. And okay, luckily, there was a loose piece of old barbed wire and the ram got caught up in it.
And at that moment, my husband Omar was able to just manhandle the ram, just lay flat his whole body weight on the animal, and then grab the rope and start tying him up again.
And we look back, Rob, the photographer, he’s vomiting. He’s puking all over the field because he didn’t expect this. I’m just standing there like I can’t quite see what’s happening in the woods with the ram and Omar.
I don’t know what to do.
Anyway, Omar emerges from the woods, carrying a ram who is squirming and trying to get away.
I will tell you that the heroes of this story are Omar and the janitor.
I have no idea what happened between the pick up at the mega church and the escape back at the farm. That doesn’t matter anymore. These details don’t matter. What matters is that we obviously realized that we’re not going to use this ram for breeding.
We’re not going to spread those genetics on.
Then we put that ram immediately in the back of the truck and we drove it back to its home farm. We returned that ram never to see it again.
And I do just want to say that, you know, it’s a true Christmas miracle that we got that ram back in one piece.
We did not have to sacrifice its life during this process.
And I also want to thank Joe and Lonna for allowing us to bring this madness to their farm.
And I want to thank all farmers who are willing to put up with a little bit of madness from young beginning farmers.

John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, speaks with another lawmaker on the House floor during the Governor's Budget Address on Dec. 3, 2024. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota citizens have had the right to petition issues on to the ballot since 1898. Some legislators would like to put an end to that. 
The prevailing wisdom in the Legislature seems to be that voters here are suffering from “ballot fatigue.” They claim voters are just sick and tired of all the initiated measures and constitutional amendments on the ballot. 
In reality, “ballot fatigue” is just a legislative code phrase for “let’s make it so tough to get an issue on the ballot that citizens will just give up.” That was the impetus behind House Joint Resolution 5003, a constitutional amendment that’s already on the ballot for 2026. 
The measure was sponsored by an irony-impaired Republican representative from Sioux Falls, John Hughes. Hughes didn’t think it was at all odd to say that voters were “fatigued” by the seven 2024 ballot issues, all the while sponsoring his own constitutional amendment for the 2026 election. 
Lawmaker assertions about voter fatigue don’t stop them from sending four measures to the ballot

Hughes’ ballot measure calls for constitutional ballot issues to need 60% of the vote to be enacted. Currently those measures have to get just more than 50% to become part of the constitution. (There’s more irony to go around. Hughes placed his 60% amendment on the ballot in chambers where all he needed to do was convince just more than half of his colleagues it was a good idea. In 2026, if the 60% threshold is approved by voters, it will need just more than 50% of the votes cast.)
Lawmakers had quite a time with ballot issues during the 2025 legislative session. They may be suffering from their own version of ballot fatigue as they considered 11 ballot issues, ultimately placing four of them on the 2026 ballot. There’s another legislative session before the next election. That’s another chance for lawmakers to endorse even more ballot measures. 
A check of the Secretary of State’s website shows there are already six other ballot issues waiting in the wings for the 2026 ballot. Their backers will try to get them on the ballot the old-fashioned way: by collecting the signatures of registered voters. It takes 17,508 signatures to get an initiated measure on the ballot and 35,017 signatures before voters can consider a constitutional amendment. 
There’s a stark disparity between the relative ease that lawmakers have if they want to get a measure on the ballot and the drudgery of collecting thousands of signatures for citizen-led ballot efforts. 
If voters are suffering from ballot fatigue, perhaps lawmakers are suffering from “ballot envy,” an anguish rooted in the realization that there are people in the state with far more will and determination than they have when it comes to getting an issue before the voters. 
When they talk about ballot fatigue, lawmakers would have you believe that they want to protect voters from the chore of making a few extra choices on Election Day. The real definition of ballot fatigue is that lawmakers are tired of seeing issues appear and reappear on the ballot that don’t conform to their worldview. Given the current Republican super-majorities in both chambers, there’s no other way than through a ballot initiative for citizens to get issues like abortion and marijuana legalization in front of voters. 
For Republicans, it’s not the voting that’s tiring but the effort it takes every two years to fight off ideas that they find disagreeable. They point to the cavalcade of political commercials as a bad thing rather than celebrating the notion that political messages are just our free speech rights in action.
Of course ballot fatigue is a play on words, substituting the word ballot for battle. But South Dakotans are in a real battle to keep their access to the ballot. It’s a battle in which we can’t afford to get fatigued.

Liz Cheney, speaking at an Anchorage event on Thursday, had harsh words for much of her Republican Party but praise for a rare GOP member who, like her, is willing to criticize President Donald Trump: Alaska’s senior U.S. senator.
“I can’t be here in Alaska and not mention the incredible courage of Sen. Lisa Murkowski,” Cheney said near the start of her event, held at a packed theater in the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts.
“You see it almost every day. There are very few Republicans who will be consistently counted on to do the right thing. And she’s one of a very small group,” Cheney said.
The former U.S. House member from Wyoming – and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney – spoke at a lecture hosted by the University of Alaska Anchorage and Alaska World Affairs Council. She took questions from veteran journalist Elizabeth Arnold, who teaches at UAA.
Like Murkowski, Cheney voted to impeach Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and opposed him in other ways.
Unlike Murkowski, who was reelected in 2022 over a Trump-backed challenger, Cheney lost her seat in the GOP primary to a Trump loyalist, Harriet Hageman, who now represents Wyoming’s single House district.
That was after Cheney co-chaired the congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and Trump’s role in it, and after she had been stripped of her GOP leadership role by fellow House Republicans because of her opposition to Trump’s actions.
She is aghast that Trump, now back in the White House, has pardoned those rioters, including those who attacked police officers – and that Republicans in office have gone along with those pardons.

	“When you hear the Republicans, any Republicans, saying that they are the party that supports law enforcement, you know, please go back and look at the videos of Jan. 6,” Cheney said. Remind those Republicans that Trump watched the events unfold on television for three hours without trying to stop the riot, she said.
“He watched police officers get brutally beaten by people who were carrying his flag; they were doing it in his name … And then, when he came into office, he pardoned all of those people,” she said.
The Republican Party as a whole — with a few exceptions like Murkowski – has betrayed its convictions and even the U.S. Constitution to become “a personality cult” loyal only to Trump, Cheney said.
Today’s GOP is “something we haven’t seen in this country before,” she said. “The party has walked away from the Constitution,” said the former House member, who noted that she grew up as a Republican and cast her first vote for President Ronald Reagan.
Cheney spent much of her speech calling out House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders of Congress who she said have enabled Trump’s attacks on the rule of law and other bad actions.
“The problem with Mike is that he’s fundamentally dishonest,” she said.
And they have enabled rank incompetence and corruption in the Trump administration, the most serious of which is Trump’s attack on the rule of law.
Voters should take action to counter the cult-like devotion that has given Trump and his administration ”carte blanche,” Cheney said.

(Photo by James Evans/University of Alaska Anchorage)
 

	“That’s why it’s crucially important that in 2026, the Republicans lose the majority in the House and the Senate,” she said.
She also called on the audience and public at large to continue protesting Trump administration actions, writing letters to the editor, contacting members of Congress and state legislators and even consider running for office to replace bad officials.
It was a message embraced by the event audience. Many of those attending Cheney’s address had walked over to the theater after attending a May Day anti-Trump protest held a few blocks away on downtown Anchorage’s Park Strip. Several times during the event, the audience erupted in applause and cheers.
Cheney herself has continued to be politically active since losing her House seat.
She started a political action committee and has been supporting candidates she believes will counter the Trump movement – most notably, former Vice President Kamala Harris, who wound up losing the 2024 presidential election. She wrote a book, titled “Oath and Honor,” that details the confrontations she had with fellow congressional Republicans over the efforts to overthrow the 2020 election results. She has also been teaching at the University of Virginia and traveling the country to speak at events like that held Thursday in Anchorage.
Returning to elective office remains a possibility, she said. “I don’t know if I will end up being a candidate again myself. But it’s certainly not something that I’m ruling out,” she said.
That statement was greeted with enthusiastic audience applause, and some follow-up back-and-forth quips to close the evening.
“Clearly, I should move here to Alaska,” Cheney said in response to the applause.
“We have ranked choice voting,” Arnold said.
“And you have one good senator,” Cheney replied.
“We have room for one more,” an audience member called out.

Some are held there for months as they wait for an open bed at the Montana State Hospital. (Photo by Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News)POLSON — When someone accused of a crime in this small northwestern Montana town needs mental health care, chances are they’ll be locked in a basement jail cell the size of a walk-in closet.
Prisoners, some held in this isolation cell for months, have scratched initials and the phrase “love hurts” into the metal door’s brown paint. Their pacing has worn a path into the cement floor. Many are held in a sort of limbo, not convicted of a crime but not stable enough to be released. They sleep on a narrow cot next to a toilet. The only view is a fluorescent-lit hallway visible through a small window in the door.
Lake County Attorney James Lapotka stood at the cell’s center talking about the people he helps confine here. He stretched out his arms, his fingertips just shy of touching opposite walls. “I’m getting anxiety just being in here,” Lapotka said.
Last year, a man sentenced for stealing a rifle stayed in that cell 129 days. He was waiting for a spot to open at Montana’s only state-run psychiatric hospital after a mental health evaluator deemed he needed care, according to court records.
A man in the next cell around the same time was on the same waitlist roughly five months. He faced near-daily stints in the jail’s emergency restraint chair — a steel contraption wrapped in foam with straps for his shoulders, arms, and legs. He regularly saw the jail’s mental health doctor. Still, Joel Shearer, a Lake County detention commander, said the man routinely experienced psychotic episodes and asked to be locked in the chair when he felt one coming on and stayed there until his screams subsided.
“Somebody who’s having a mental health crisis — they don’t belong here,” Lapotka said. “We don’t have anywhere else.”
Lake County’s two, roughly 30-square-foot isolation cells are an example of how communities nationwide are failing to provide mental health services — crisis care, in particular. Nearly half of the people locked in local jails in the U.S. have a mental illness.
More than half of Wyoming’s 23 sheriffs told lawmakers there that they were housing people in crisis awaiting mental health care for months, WyoFile reported in January. Nevada has struggled despite a $500 daily fine for each jailed patient whose treatment is delayed. Disability Rights Oregon has said delays in that state continue after two people died in jail while on the state’s psychiatric waitlist.
In Montana, counties are jailing mental health patients they’re not equipped to handle when the Montana State Hospital is at capacity. Few local hospitals have their own inpatient psychiatric beds. As a result, people arrested for anything from petty theft to felony assault can be jailed for months or longer as their mental health worsens. Many haven’t been convicted of a crime.
Montana officials have known for years they have a problem. State officials have said they don’t have space for all the people ordered to the hospital. The psychiatric hospital has 270 beds, with 54 for people in the criminal justice system. Staffing shortages can shrink that capacity further.
The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services backed two bills this legislative session that would shield the state from liability for delays when the Montana State Hospital is full. Ahead of the bills, the agency wrote the hospital has “struggled to maintain appropriate levels of care” due to money and staffing constraints, a lack of community-based services, and having no control over the flow patients Montana courts send its way.
The agency also announced April 23 that $6.5 million was available through one-time grants to help set up jail-based mental health stabilization services.
Officials have said patients deserve care closer to home, in less restrictive settings. But counties say the local services needed don’t exist.
“You have to do the hard things first,” said Matt Kuntz, executive director of the Montana chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “You have to build the beds.”
Health advocates have backed a proposal that would require the state to pay for community commitments. That measure is headed to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte after passing the state House and Senate. Another bill that was still pending would create a new psychiatric hospital for people in the justice system. But implementing those ideas could take years.
The number of inpatient beds for people with a serious mental illness nationwide has plummeted. At one time, that drop was intentional, part of a movement away from locking people up in state-run mental hospitals. But the intended fix, local homelike centers, hasn’t filled the void.
One of Montana’s biggest providers, Western Montana Mental Health Center, had to close some of its crisis sites because of money problems, said Western’s CEO, Bob Lopp. That includes a facility less than a mile from the Lake County jail.
“If that’s not where the funding is, you can’t just do it for the sake of argument and hope that it comes,” Lopp said.
Gianforte has promised to pour money into rebuilding the state’s behavioral health system. Mental health workers in small towns find such promises hard to trust after seeing local services come and go for years.
Health department spokesperson Holly Matkin said the agency is proud of its work to fix “systems that have been broken for too long” and that it will improve services for people who need inpatient care in their communities.
Lake County is known to outsiders as an Instagram-worthy stop on their way to Glacier National Park. It overlaps with the Flathead Indian Reservation, land of the Bitterroot Salish, Upper Pend d’Oreille, and Kootenai tribes. It’s home to a slice of the Rocky Mountains and a gateway to millions of acres of wilderness. Polson, the county seat and site of the jail, is a town of 5,600 on the southern shore of Flathead Lake, one of the largest lakes west of the Mississippi River.
Vincent River has worked as the jail’s sole mental health clinician for 25 years. He said he’s not always available because he’s the only psychologist in four northwestern Montana counties evaluating whether a person in jail needs psychiatric care.
Some are released without care if they linger too long on the state hospital’s waitlist.
“I talk to these family members. I hear them plead with me with their fear in their voices and tell me all that’s been going on for days or weeks or months,” River said. “And then I can’t get people into the hospital. That is a giant crisis.”
It’s not just the state hospital. River said he can’t get people into any psychiatric bed in Montana because there are too few. Instead, he tries to stabilize people while they’re jailed. That has shortfalls.
The jail can’t force someone in psychosis to take medication without a court order and a qualified doctor on hand to administer the prescription. Lake County’s aging facility has faced lawsuits because of poor conditions amid overcrowding, and River has to see patients wherever there’s room.
There isn’t even space for the jail’s restraint chair. Jail workers leave strapped-down prisoners in a hallway or locker room.
River said many gradually get better and leave isolation. Some don’t.
“They languish there, psychotic and lonely,” he said, “at the mercy of what the voices are telling them.”
Locals are working to fill some gaps. A mobile team launched in February is staffed by people who have lived with mental and substance use disorders to provide peer support. But someone truly in crisis has only two options — jail or an emergency room.
The room reserved for people in crisis at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Polson leaves patients both isolated and without privacy. The locked door’s thick glass looks onto a busy emergency room hallway.
Those who deteriorate enough to be deemed dangerous to themselves or others are sent down the road to jail.
Rebecca Bontadelli, an ER physician, said patients can be housed in the room for days as hospital staffers scour Montana and nearby states for an open psychiatric bed. Some reject care in the meantime.
“We’re not really helping them,” Bontadelli said. “They feel like they’re in prison.”

(Photo courtesy of America's Public Television Stations)Should public media be spared the budget cutting axe of President Donald Trump and the congressional allies of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE?
I’m not going to directly answer that question myself, because I’m not an unbiased observer: I’ve worked for years as a reporter and contractor for Alaska Public Media, Anchorage’s public radio and television station. I also have close friendships and working relationships with many of the reporters across the state whose jobs could be at stake.
I do, however, feel confident in saying that there’s another, related question that’s objectively interesting and less problematic for me to try to answer, which is: Will Alaska’s elected officials vote to buck Trump and preserve public media’s federal funding?
That question has become increasingly urgent with the Trump administration plan to end the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or CPB.”
That nonprofit organization, in turn, grants money to both NPR and PBS, as well as to stations across the country — including more than 20 in Alaska, from Utqiagvik on the North Slope to Ketchikan near the Canadian boarder.
Alaska’s stations received more than $12 million from CPB last year, which can amount to 40% or more of their annual budgets.
NPR, which Trump and his allies have attacked as biased towards liberals, derives roughly 1% of its budget from CPB, though it also collects money from individual stations that run its programs.
Alaska’s public media leaders told me they believe Trump’s proposal is more likely to pass the Republican-controlled U.S. House.
They’re counting on the U.S. Senate — where only a few GOP votes would be needed to sink the plan — to be their firewall.
They describe Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski as a rock solid ally in preserving the funding. And they expect Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, a longtime supporter of public media, to come to their defense, too.
But they also say they won’t know for certain until the votes are cast.
“I don’t want to say that I’m fully confident of their votes,” said Tom Abbott, general manager of KFSK in the Southeast Alaska fishing town of Petersburg, which gets some 30% of its budget from CPB.
But, Abbott added: “We’ve had very strong support from both of our U.S. senators, for several years now.”
I was curious to know where Sullivan, Murkowski and Alaska’s sole member of the U.S. House, Republican Nick Begich III, stood on what’s reported to be an impending proposal from Trump to rescind $1.1 billion, or two years of funding, for CPB.
I asked each of their offices Wednesday.
Begich’s spokesperson didn’t respond by my deadline. Murkowski’s spokesman, Joe Plesha, was unequivocal, saying that she is a “fierce advocate for Alaska’s public broadcasting and vehemently opposes this reported rescission.”
“While the administration might be targeting NPR and PBS by rescinding this funding, the real casualty will be local public broadcasting, which is vital for Alaska,” Plesha said.
Sullivan’s spokesperson, Amanda Coyne, also sent a statement: “While Sen. Sullivan believes that NPR has become overly partisan and has veered far from its mission to include a diversity of voices in its coverage, he understands that Alaska’s public radio stations are essential to our state, especially in rural areas.”
Sullivan has also, in recent days, responded to constituents who have emailed in support of public media funding, saying in a form letter that he “will continue to work with the current administration to stress the importance of public broadcasting in Alaska and nationwide.”
Sullivan’s position is particularly interesting because of his politics: Unlike Murkowski, he’s rarely publicly criticized Trump’s policies.
But while Trump’s White House has ripped into public media — saying this monththat “the NPR, PBS grift has ripped us off for too long” — Sullivan has long recognized its value, at least as far as the services it provides in rural communities.
In 2020, he accepted a “champion of public broadcasting” award from a coalition of public television stations. He also joined with Murkowski in recommending an Alaskan, Diane Kaplan, for a seat on CPB’s board of directors, and former President Joe Biden appointed her in 2022.
Kaplan is now in the news this week for a lawsuit she and CPB filed against Trump, alleging that the president is illegally attempting to fire her and other board members.
Begich’s vote will be interesting to watch, as well.
The representative, who’s just a few months into his first term, has aligned himself closely with Trump.
But he’s also sent constituents correspondence about public media funding that references the challenge of communication and information sharing in Alaska’s rural communities, saying that public media plays a “crucial role” in residents’ access to news and emergency alerts.
“I support fiscal responsibility and efforts to reduce wasteful government spending,” he said in one recent message. “I also recognize that certain investments provide valuable returns to our communities. I will continue to advocate for policies that enhance infrastructure, improve broadband access, and support communication networks that serve all Alaskans, including those in our rural communities.”
Republicans have targeted federal funding of public media for years. But those efforts have never gained as much traction as they’re getting now.
Abbott, in Petersburg, describes the current threat to federal funding as “by far, the most serious” in his 28 years as general manager. With the proposal from Trump expected, though still not yet introduced, “it puts us all in an uneasy position.”“We’re kind of waiting for the ax to drop,” he said.

The third had raped and killed a 15-year-old girl.
Wassenaar’s only regret was that he didn’t kill more.
“Child molesters: I wanted to kill them all. That’s all I can say,” he told the Arizona Mirror in a recent phone call.
But he did say more.
“The taxpayers no longer have to pay for them,” he continued. “I’m paying my debt to society.”
The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Re-entry is investigating what happened that day. No charges have been filed yet, and a spokesperson for the Pima County Attorney’s Office said that Corrections has not yet referred its investigation to their office. The Corrections Department has not commented on the matter, other than to condemn the violence and note that it was quickly curtailed.
Wassenaar, who is known in prison as “Rooster,” is already serving 16 life sentences for his part in a 2004 jail-break attempt that ended in a 15-day hostage stand-off at the Lewis Prison in Buckeye. He has spent 38 of his 62 years in Arizona prisons, with just a four-month stint on the outside. And the Pima County Attorney, Laura Conover, has written newspaper op-eds declaring her aversion to the death penalty.
Wassenaar also claims he killed a fourth prisoner last November because he didn’t want to share a cell. He says he strangled the man with his bare hands, but Corrections didn’t believe him and the autopsy conducted by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner could not definitively determine that the man — also a sex offender — was murdered.
Nonetheless, he insisted that he killed the man, telling an investigator from his last trial and a prison advocate who relayed the information to Corrections that he would kill anyone else they assign to his cell.
“You’ve got to give him an ‘A’ for effort,” said Carlos Garcia, the president of the Arizona Correctional Peace Officers Association.
The Corrections Department was playing chicken with Wassenaar, Garcia said: “He told them he was going to kill someone. They didn’t listen, and he did it.”
 ‘I’m a killer now’

I last spoke to Wassenaar 20 years ago, while he was defending himself in trial for the attempted escape and prison takeover. I distinctly recall the sheriff’s  detention officer escorting me to a holding cell, locking me in with Wassenaar and then leaving.
  Ricky Wassenaar’s Arizona inmate photo
Like many accused and convicted criminals I have interviewed, Wassenaar was a paradox: a grab-bag of hatreds and loyalties, with a strict code of honor despite his lawlessness.
On the day I interviewed him, he fretted over the fact that it was my wife’s birthday; shouldn’t I be home with her? He talked about his own mother, how he wanted to be imprisoned close enough to his native Michigan so that she could visit him. And when she died, he told me, he wasn’t sure he still wanted to stay alive. He is still close to his sister, Rhonda, who talks to him regularly, and who was herself convicted of a conspiracy to spring him from custody when he was to be transferred to Ohio to serve his sentence.
What I remember most vividly is his account of why he was sent to Lewis Prison in the first place.
In 1986, Wassenaar was arrested for armed robbery and aggravated assault. I know nothing about those crimes, but after 10 years, he was released on home arrest and was staying with a family in Tucson.
He had a whole list of people he was angry at when he got out, and he told me the anger buzzed in his head like a hive of bees.
He had been out more than four months when he walked into a Tucson video shop with the intent of renting a pornographic video. The shop clerk asked him for a phone number and Wassenaar didn’t want to give the only number he had, which belonged to the people he was staying with.
The clerk ridiculed him. So, the next night, Wassenaar came back with a gun and held up the shop. Then he took off in a car and led police on a high-speed chase that ended in a crash.
Wassenaar said he woke up on a hospital gurney. There was a TV set right above him showing the evening news and flashing his photograph. Suddenly, the buzzing had stopped, he told me, and he realized he was going back to prison.
Last week, during our phone call, I reminded him of our earlier conversations.
“I was a whole different person then,” he said. And when I asked him how so, he answered, “I’m a killer now. I was never a killer before.”
 The 15-day siege

In January 2004, Wassenaar almost escaped from prison. But instead of making it outside the prison walls, he and his prison mate ended up starting the longest ever hostage situation at a prison.
He had worked in the prison legal library and felt he was discriminated against by prison management in ways he was punished, a belief that has been a running theme throughout his prison life.
He now worked in the kitchen as a cook, and he put together a plan with another inmate in the kitchen, Steven Coy. On a January morning, when they knew the mess hall would be understaffed, they sprung the plan. Wassenaar overpowered a correctional officer, handcuffed him and took his uniform. He shaved off his own beard to more closely resemble a correctional officer. He asked the other prisoners in the cafeteria if they wanted to join him, but they refused. So, he headed out the door to a nearby guard tower. The guard tower was a short stop on the way to the prison administration building and a door outside of the prison to freedom.
One of the guards on duty in the tower, Jason Auch, mistook Wassenaar for the officer he had overpowered and buzzed him in. Wassenaar pulled his cap down until Auch reached him, then pulled a metal paddle from one of the kitchen’s industrial mixers out of the pocket of his cargo pants and smacked Auch across the side of the head, knocking him nearly senseless. The second guard in the tower, Lois Fraley, charged him, but he subdued her and handcuffed her. Then, taking an automatic rifle from the tower, he went to see what was holding up Coy.
Wassenaar later said he knew little about why Coy had been in prison. Coy was a convicted rapist, and while Wassenaar was taking the tower, Coy was raping a female civilian worker in the kitchen. Otherwise, they might have pulled off an escape.
When Wassenaar stepped out of the tower, other correctional officers had Coy spread-eagled on the ground. Wassenaar sprayed bullets over their heads. One of them asked who he was shooting at, to which Wassenaar answered, “You!” The officers retreated and Wassenaar pulled Coy into the tower.
The next 15 days were high drama as Wassenaar negotiated with prison officials and other law-enforcement agencies. At one point, during a whispered phone call, Wassenaar told negotiators that he had sent Coy to the tower where they could get a shot at him. Sharpshooters drew a bead on a person in the tower they thought was Coy, then held fire when they realized it could be Auch. Wassenaar made demands for Philly cheesesteaks, Coke, cigarettes and meatball subs, and raged if he didn’t get them. He screamed at the hostage negotiators, once while he held a shotgun to Auch’s head and another time when he threatened to cut off one of Fraley’s fingers.
Coy raped Fraley. Wassenaar was also charged and convicted of sexual assault for an incident that took place during the early hours of the siege. They were on the floor of the tower, below the windows to avoid the snipers, and Wassenaar was pulling off Fraley’s pants to give them to Coy to wear as a disguise. Her underwear came off with her pants, and Wassenaar allegedly put his finger in her vagina at that moment and made remarks. He denied it happened, but the jury concluded that it did.
Eventually, Coy and Wassenaar surrendered after getting assurances that they would be transferred to prisons out of Arizona. They had a last meal with a couple of beers before they left the tower.
 Courtroom drama

The trial began a year and a day after the start of the siege. It was a circus. Wassenaar chose to defend himself, and he was well matched by the prosecutor, Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Jeanette Gallagher, a tough-talking Chicagoan with a glare and a growl that was just as intimidating as Wassenaar’s.
Coy had already pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences, to start after the 185 years he was already serving. He was whisked off to a prison in Maine.
Wassenaar had attended the pretrial proceedings in shackles and jail stripes. But during the trial, he was dressed out in civilian clothes with a stun belt under his shirt and nylon bands binding his legs to his chair.
At times it was amusing, and admittedly, the media who attended the overflow courtroom was at times charmed by Wassenaar. Once, when he took the witness stand before the jury came in, Wassenaar grabbed the microphone and pretended he was a club DJ, asking for song suggestions and then saying he was going to play the Lynyrd Skynyrd song “Free Bird.” On multiple occasions, Gallagher would storm out of the courtroom and utter angry epithets that journalists could not report.
When Judge Warren Granville asked Wassenaar how far he had gone in school. Wassenaar answered, “DOC documents will tell you I have a GED. Others will tell you I have a Master’s Degree in being a dumbass.”
Auch, the male correctional officer taken hostage, withered on the stand under Wassenaar’s questioning. Fraley, however, was confident and unyielding. She told the jury how Wassenaar would make her mop blood and urine off the floor. She fantasized about dumping the buckets over his head and jumping from the tower.
“A couple of broken legs, I would have been satisfied with,” she said.
On another day, Wassenaar’s withering gaze was countered by Maricopa County Sheriff’s Sgt. Kip Rustenburg, who had been one of the hostage negotiators during the siege. When Wassenaar said something offensive, she flashed her eyes and smiled at him slyly, without saying a word. He had to turn away, half laughing, but clearly intimidated.
And though he denied the sex assault charges and attempted murder charges for shooting at correctional officers, the jury found him guilty of 19 counts. He was sentenced to 16 life sentences, a harsh enhancement for committing the crimes while he was already in prison.
Wassenaar was sent to a prison in Ohio. He was later transferred to New Mexico, out of sight and out of mind, before coming back to a prison in Tucson in 2016, and housed in a sex-offender unit. In Wassenaar’s mind, he was sent back because Charles Ryan, then the Corrections director, “Wanted his pound of flesh.” Wassenaar had embarrassed the department. Ryan, he said, “wanted revenge before he died.”
 ‘I wanted to kill them all’

Much of the following account comes from my recent conversation with Wassenaar. He was calling from prison, limited in time. The phone cut off in mid-sentence. Other information comes from court records and from conversations with Donna Hamm, of the prison advocacy organization Middle Ground. Hamm has spoken to various people with knowledge of the events. None of it, other than the victims’ names, has been confirmed by the corrections department or the Pima County Attorney’s Office.
Wassenaar told Hamm that he didn’t want to share a cell with another prisoner. When they moved Joseph Desisto into the cell, Wassenaar told Hamm he tried to block the door to keep him out.
Desisto, 81, had been convicted of multiple counts of child sex abuse and sexual conduct with a minor.
Desisto was found dead in the cell on Nov. 5, 2024, which Wassenaar made a point of reminding me was Election Day. Wassenaar said he strangled Desisto.
“I choked him with an arm bar, and then with my hands,” he told me. And he said that he was dripping sweat all over Desisto from the effort, something he told Hamm as well, and said he left DNA evidence on Desisto’s body.
Desisto’s autopsy noted Wassenaar’s allegation, but the medical examiner found no signs of strangulation: there were no marks on Desisto’s neck and his hyoid bone — an indicator of strangulation if broken — was intact. He had broken ribs, according to the report, a common injury that occurs during CPR, and Wassenaar volunteered that prison EMTs had in fact broken Desisto’s ribs.
The cause of death was inconclusive.
Wassenaar told Hamm and me that he got the equivalent of a 30-day time-out even though he confessed to killing the cell mate.
He called his former trial investigator. He called Hamm. He wanted to be implicated in Desisto’s death. He thought Desisto’s family would want to know what happened to him.
Hamm asked him, “Why would you kill someone if you’re so concerned about their family?”
He said he just wanted to be alone. But he insisted on his guilt. “I gave a detailed account,” he told me.
He told Hamm he had made it clear to his keepers that, if they put anyone else in his cell, he would kill them, too.
“He wants to do his time the way he wants to do it,” she said.
In the meantime, in December, on the anniversary of his mother’s death, he said, he picked out a good-sized rock from the prison yard and saved it in his cell.
By the morning of April 4, prison authorities had put an inmate named Saul Alvarez in Wassenaar’s cell. Alvarez had kidnapped a 15-year-old girl in 1998, raped her and killed her. Hamm had been told that Wassenaar suffocated him and stabbed him to death with a shank and arranged Alvarez’s body on his bed to make it look like he was asleep. He took the rock he had saved and put it in his fishnet laundry bag and headed out to the prison yard.
In the yard, other prisoners were starting to assemble in line for breakfast. Outside the mess hall door was a long passageway enclosed in chain-link fence that the prisoners call “the cage.” Wassenaar came in and started swinging his rock.
He felt he had jumped the gun.
“If I had waited until they were all locked in that cage, I would have killed ten or twelve,” he said.
Instead, he killed two, Thorne Harnage and Donald Lashley, both of whom were serving life sentences for sexual conduct with a minor. Another prisoner tried to stop him, and Wassenaar said he stabbed him.
He was overpowered before he had finished, he told me.
“I wanted to kill them all.”

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.


Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.
Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

(Photo by Tanner Johnson and provided by Jenny-Marie Stryker)Alaska’s branch of the Democratic Party announced Friday that it has hired Jenny-Marie Stryker, currently the political director for the Alaska Center, as its new executive director.
The announcement follows the resignation of former executive director Lindsay Kavanaugh and a decision by the national party to increase its contributions to state-level party organizations, particularly those in Republican-controlled states. The executive director serves as the party’s top paid staff member in the state.
State party chair Eric Croft called her “an excellent addition to our team.”
Stryker, 30, moved to Alaska in 2017 and has been active in politics during her time in the state.
“I thought about it so, so much, and felt like there’s very few things that I could do that would be more impactful to create the Alaska that I want to live in,” she said about her decision to apply for the executive director job.
Stryker said she remembers canvassing for Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign long before she was old enough to vote. She became a registered Democrat in California, her birth state, as soon as she could.
“I think what’s really inspiring to me is the values that we all hold, which is an economy that works for everyone and uplifts everyone. You know, we have such a polarized society, such a giant wealth gap, and giant wealth spread. And I think the Democrats were very clearly, to me, are the party that has an inspiring vision for how to solve that,” she said.
After Democratic incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola lost her U.S. House seat to Republican Nick Begich in last year’s U.S. House election, the Democratic Party has named Alaska’s House race as one of the ones it plans to focus on in 2026.
Democrats will also seek to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, who has been a reliable supporter of President Donald Trump.
“2026 is going to be a massively consequential year for Alaska,” she said.
Stryker said it’s important to remember that there also are municipal elections this fall and in the spring.
“We don’t get the benefit of an off year in Alaska,” she said.
Stryker will start her work with the state party in June and said she would have more insight into her future plans at this point.
“From what I’ve been learning, we have to be laser-focused on increasing Democratic voter registration, increasing Democratic turnout, investing in our regional party infrastructure,” she said.
“We’re a massive state, and the regional party infrastructure is so, so important for us to succeed. It’s not the Anchorage party, it’s the Alaska party, and we think about it statewide, and our plans are statewide, and I think that’s really important for folks to know,” Stryker said.

Shadrach Minkins, already separated from his family, escaped from the Norfolk, Virginia, home, where he was enslaved. He made his way to Boston, where he did odd jobs until he began working as a waiter at Taft’s Cornhill Coffee House. 
Months later, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which gave authorities the power to go into free states and arrest Black Americans who had escaped slavery. 
A slave catcher named John Caphart arrived in Boston with papers for Minkins. While serving breakfast at the coffee house, federal authorities arrested Minkins. 
Several local lawyers, including Robert Morris, volunteered to represent him. Three days later, a group of abolitionists, led by African-American abolitionist Lewis Hayden, broke into the Boston courthouse and rescued a surprised Minkins. 
“The rescuers headed north along Court Street, 200 or more following like the tail of a comet,” author Gary Collison wrote. They guided him across the Charles River to the Cambridge home of the Rev. Joseph C. Lovejoy, whose brother, Elijah, had been lynched by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois in 1837. 
Another Black leader, John J. Smith, helped Minkins get a wagon with horses, and from Cambridge, Hayden, Smith and Minkins traveled to Concord, where Minkins stayed with the Bigelow family, which guided him to the Underground Railroad, making his way to Montreal, spending the rest of his life in Canada as a free man.

Shadrach Minkins, already separated from his family, escaped from the Norfolk, Virginia, home, where he was enslaved. He made his way to Boston, where he did odd jobs until he began working as a waiter at Taft’s Cornhill Coffee House. 
Months later, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which gave authorities the power to go into free states and arrest Black Americans who had escaped slavery. 
A slave catcher named John Caphart arrived in Boston with papers for Minkins. While serving breakfast at the coffee house, federal authorities arrested Minkins. 
Several local lawyers, including Robert Morris, volunteered to represent him. Three days later, a group of abolitionists, led by African-American abolitionist Lewis Hayden, broke into the Boston courthouse and rescued a surprised Minkins. 
“The rescuers headed north along Court Street, 200 or more following like the tail of a comet,” author Gary Collison wrote. They guided him across the Charles River to the Cambridge home of the Rev. Joseph C. Lovejoy, whose brother, Elijah, had been lynched by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois in 1837. 
Another Black leader, John J. Smith, helped Minkins get a wagon with horses, and from Cambridge, Hayden, Smith and Minkins traveled to Concord, where Minkins stayed with the Bigelow family, which guided him to the Underground Railroad, making his way to Montreal, spending the rest of his life in Canada as a free man. 
Abolitionists cheered his escape, and President Millard Fillmore fumed. Morris, Hayden and others were charged, but sympathetic juries acquitted them. Meanwhile in Montreal, Minkins met fellow fugitives, married, had four children and continued to work as a waiter before operating his own restaurants.

Such gantries have replaced toll booths on the state's toll roads. (Photo courtesy the Maryland Transportation Authority)A key bond rating agency has issued a negative outlook for outstanding revenue bonds issued by the Maryland Transportation Authority, amid uncertainty surrounding the reconstruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed the authority’s AA- bond rating, but in an April 25 report downgraded its outlook from stable to negative and warned of the potential for future changes.
“The outlook revision to negative reflects our view that there is at least a one-in-three chance we could lower the rating within the two-year outlook if potential project cost escalations and uncertain timing of future federal reimbursements weaken the authority’s ability to sustain financial metrics at levels comparable with those of peers as it finances the reconstruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and its $5.1 billion capital improvement program,” S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Andrew Stafford said in a statement.
The Standard & Poor’s announcement warned: “We could lower the rating if actual financial performance trends negatively, and is materially weaker than currently forecast due to construction cost escalations, project delays, or softening demand.”
“We do not anticipate raising the rating over the two-year outlook period, given MDTA’s relatively high debt burden and additional borrowing plans,” the credit rating agency said.
Currently, the authority has $2.1 billion in outstanding debt. In fiscal 2026, which begins in July, that amount is expected to “increase significantly” to $2.6 billion, according to an analysis by the Department of Legislative Services.
Outstanding debt is projected to increase to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2027, before peaking at $3.8 billion in fiscal years 2029 and 2030 — an amount just under the authority’s statutory borrowing cap, according to the legislative analysis from February.
New Key Bridge design highlights both ‘triumph’ and ‘tragedy’ a year after collapse

Bond ratings determine the interest rate governments pay on money borrowed for buildings, roads and other infrastructure projects. Lower ratings ultimately cost governments – and taxpayers —more.
Revenue bonds issued by the authority are separate from the state’s general obligation bond borrowing.
A year ago, Moody’s reaffirmed the state’s coveted AAA rating on general obligation bonds but downgraded its outlook from stable to negative, citing concerns about looming structural deficits driven by programs including the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms.
In March, Moody’s issued another report citing concerns about cuts to federal employment and other concerns. The firm said Maryland is at greatest risk from those cuts.
Moody’s, along with Standard & Poor’s and Fitch are all expected to meet with state officials this month. From those meetings, the three agencies will issue updated annual bond ratings in advance of a scheduled June bond sale.
There are rumblings in corners of Annapolis about a potential downgrade of the state’s creditworthiness from one or more of the rating agencies.
The state has held the coveted “triple, triple-A” rating for more than three decades. Maryland got its first triple-A rating from Standard & Poor’s in 1961, followed by Moody’s 12 years later and Fitch in 1993.
The authority operates eight toll facilities including the Fort McHenry and Harbor tunnels, the Bay Bridge, the Gov. Harry W. Nice/Sen. Thomas “Mac” Middleton Bridge and the Intercounty Connector. It also operated the Key Bridge and is in charge of its replacement.
Tolls charged by the authority at those facilities are pledged to repay its borrowing.
A Maryland Transportation Authority spokesperson, in an emailed statement said the agency will continue to meet its debt payment obligations.
“The Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) recognizes that the negative ratings outlook reflects the uncertainty associated with a mega project the size of the Key Bridge Rebuild and uncertain timing of when federal funding will be received,” the spokesperson wrote. “Despite the loss of the Key Bridge and temporary loss of associated revenues, the MDTA expects to remain in compliance with all board directed financial policies and trust agreement covenants.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The negative outlook comes a year after the catastrophic collapse of the bridge. The span over the Patapsco collapsed after a pier was struck by the Dali, a fully laden 984-foot cargo vessel that lost power. Six people working on the bridge died in the incident.
The allision remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.
“The State of Maryland continues to pursue the DALI’s owner and manager for all the damages caused by their negligence and incompetence – including the cost to reconstruct the Francis Scott Key Bridge – so that the parties responsible for this tragedy pay for the damages they caused,” the MdTA spokesperson wrote. “The American Relief Act, 2025, provides that if any additional funds are required to build the new bridge beyond the compensation paid by the DALI, the federal government will provide that funding.”
Those federal lawsuits are complicated and ongoing. Final resolution could take years of litigation.
Standard and Poor’s issued a bond opinion immediately following the incident. In that opinion, the bond rating agency said “disruption and damage from the recent collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge … is not expected to have immediate credit implications for its ratings” on the authority, Baltimore City or the state.
“However, the long-term financial impact, particularly for MDTA, will likely be unknown for some time,” according to the Standard & Poor’s 2024 opinion.
Moody’s ratings issued its own updated opinion that same month. In it, the agency downgraded the authority’s outlook from stable to negative on $2.2 billion in outstanding debt.
The company cited “uncertainty around the Francis Scott Key Bridge’s … replacement project’s costs, including their funding, and timing. Any negative impact from the replacement project would be on top of financial metrics that were expected to narrow from capital investments prior to the loss of the bridge.”
Maryland officials mark one year since collapse of Key Bridge

A replacement is expected to cost at least $1.7 billion. Officials hope to complete the new span by 2028.
State officials continue to rely on promises of full federal funding for a replacement made by then-President Joseph Biden (D) just hours after the span collapsed. But that promise is less certain since the election of President Donald Trump (R).
Trump has made good on his campaign promise to slash government spending and employment. In March, he said he would block plans for a new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt — a project Gov. Wes Moore and others lauded as an economic boon to the state and Prince George’s County.
Trump’s election also cast doubt on the likelihood of federal funding for an east-west Red Line transit project in Baltimore. Moore made construction of the line a signature campaign promise.
For now, the authority said it does not expect to speed up a projected toll increase, though one is coming.
“MDTA’s current financial plan indicates that toll increases are not needed before FY 2028. This action by S&P is not likely to change the projected timing of that need,” the agency spokesperson wrote.
In January, a Department of Legislative Services analysis highlighted the authority’s own projection of “fiscal challenges on the horizon,” including increases in outstanding debt between fiscal 2026 and 2030. That legislative review noted “the need for action, such as implementing a toll increase to maintain the debt service coverage ratio by fiscal 2028.”
The projected need for an increase is a year sooner than the timeline projected in a 2024 analysis.
“Compared to the prior forecast, the current forecast has significant forecasted increases in capital expenditures related to the rebuilding of the Francis Scott Key Bridge,” analysts wrote in their review.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13697971305_08ce56a830_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-03 07:58:22.106221

Although the wetlands just got here, they have locked tons of ancient carbon into their sediment  and plants, and they’re still doing work as our emissions continue to grow. They have tons of  other benefits, like filtering our water, providing a place for fisheries to continue their life cycle,  and acting as a soaking buffer when the storm surge rises.

Wetlands also attract biodiversity, which  underpins human health and nutrition, and we all know health is true wealth.
Unfortunately, the space that wetlands occupy is on the decline, globally decreasing between 3%  and 7% each year. This is due to human impact, such as development on wetlands, but also the ever-rising sea levels pushing them inland. Wetlands may be able to survive if they are able to  migrate inland, but with human development impeding their movement, they are becoming  fragmented and eventually can die.
When wetlands die, their work stops, which exacerbates climate change issues.
Maryland as a state has a rich maritime heritage, and is affected by its water bodies, like the  Chesapeake, the Pocomoke and the Atlantic. The blue crab is an icon, beautiful to look at and  culturally significant to eat and protect. For a place that finds the water to be significant,  wetlands need to be a part of that narrative.
There is hope, with many initiatives that would allow these ecosystems to thrive far into the  future, but we have to lean into it as a society and focus on policy that will benefit generations  long after we are gone. We have to reshape how we think of these wetlands, because with the  inevitable future of sea level rise and climate change, they could save our beloved coasts.
Chances are there is a wetland right in your backyard or around the corner.
If you sit silently in a wetland, you’ll start to discover all of its secrets and how much life it  holds while we humans are busy. Small terrapins poking their heads out of the water, soaking up  the sun. A bald eagle soaring overhead, searching for the next fish to catch. Sunlight hitting the  puddles of water through the loblolly pines. Horseshoe crabs crawling up banks to take a rest from the tides. Cordgrass swaying in the wind as the hairs on your arms pick up on the change in  direction.
If we grow to understand these places, and love them, we will want to protect them. So on your  next free weekend, choose to visit one of your local Maryland wetlands.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4831334400_6f7db35780_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-03 07:04:57.465789

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As states rush to address falling literacy scores, a new kind of education debate in state legislatures is taking hold: not whether reading instruction needs fixing, but how to fix it.
More than a dozen states have enacted laws banning public school educators from teaching youngsters to read using an approach that’s been popular for decades. The method, known as “three-cueing,” encourages kids to figure out unfamiliar words using context clues such as meaning, sentence structure and visual hints.
In the past two years, several states have instead embraced instruction rooted in what’s known as the “science of reading.” That approach leans heavily on phonics — relying on letter and rhyming sounds to read words such as cat, hat and rat.
The policy discussions on early literacy are unfolding against a backdrop of alarming national reading proficiency levels. The 2024 Nation’s Report Card revealed that 40% of fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders scored below the basic reading level — the highest percentages in decades.
No state improved in fourth- or eighth-grade reading in 2024. Eight states — Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah and Vermont — scored worse than they did a year or two prior in eighth-grade reading.
Five — Arizona, Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Vermont — saw dips in their fourth-grade reading scores.
In response to these troubling trends, a growing number of states are moving beyond localized efforts and tackling literacy through statewide legislation.
New Jersey last year mandated universal K-3 literacy screenings. Indiana lawmakers this month passed a bill that would allow some students to retake required reading tests before being held back in third grade; that bill is en route to the governor’s desk.
Oregon and Washington are weighing statewide literacy coaching and training models, while lawmakers in Montana introduced a bill to allow literacy interventions to cover broader reading and academic skills, not just early reading basics.
Mississippi, a state seen as a model for turnaround in literacy rates over the past decade, seeks to expand and require evidence-based reading interventions, mandatory literacy screenings and targeted teacher training, and to explicitly ban the use of three-cueing methods in reading instruction in grades 4-8.
Together, these efforts signal a national shift: States are treating literacy not as a local initiative, but as the foundation of public education policy.
“Literacy is the lever,” said Tafshier Cosby, the senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, an advocacy group. “If states focus on that, we see bipartisan wins. But the challenge is making that a statewide priority, not just a district-by-district hope.”
 ‘It’s the system that needs fixing’

Before he was even sworn in, first-term Georgia Democratic state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, a former teacher and principal, had already drafted a bill to end the use of the three-cueing system in Georgia classrooms.
This month, the final version focused on the science of reading passed the state legislature without a single “no” vote. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill into law Monday to outlaw three-cueing.
Sen. Kemp said his passion for literacy reform stretches back decades, shaped by experiences tutoring children at a local church as a college student in the early 2000s. It was there, he said, that he began noticing patterns in how students struggled with foundational reading.
“In my experience, I saw kids struggle to identify the word they were reading. I saw how some kids were guessing what the word was instead of decoding,” Kemp recalled. “And it’s not technology or screens that’s the problem. It’s what teachers are being instructed on how to teach reading. It’s the system that needs fixing, not the teachers.”
Sen. Kemp’s bill requires the Professional Standards Commission — a state agency that oversees teacher prep and certification — to adopt rules mandating evidence-based reading instruction aligned with the science of reading, a set of practices rooted in decades of cognitive research on how children best learn to read.
“Current strategies used to teach literacy include methods that teach students to guess rather than read, preventing them from reaching their full potential,” Sen. Kemp said in a public statement following the bill’s legislative passage. “I know we can be better, and I’m proud to see our legislative body take much-needed steps to help make Georgia the number one state for literacy.”
In West Virginia, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would require the state’s teachers to be certified in the science of reading.
Cosby, of the National Parents Union, said local policy changes can be driven by parents even before legislatures act.
“All politics are local,” Cosby said. “Parents don’t need to wait for statewide mandates — they can ask school boards for universal screeners and structured literacy now.”
Still, some parents worry their states are simply funding more studies on early literacy rather than taking direct action to address it.
A Portland, Oregon, parent of three — one of whom has dyslexia — sent written testimony this year urging lawmakers to skip further studies and immediately implement structured literacy statewide.
“We do not need another study to tell us what we already know — structured literacy is the most effective way to teach all children to read, particularly those with dyslexia and other reading challenges,” wrote Katherine Hoffman.
 Opposition to ‘science of reading’

Unlike in Georgia, the “science of reading” has met resistance in other states.
In California, legislation that would require phonics-based reading instruction statewide has faced opposition from English learner advocates who argue that a one-size-fits-all approach may not effectively serve multilingual students.
In opposition to the bill, the California Teachers Association argued that by codifying a rigid definition of the “science of reading,” lawmakers ignore the evolving nature of reading research and undermine teachers’ ability to meet the diverse needs of their students.
“Placing a definition for ‘science of reading’ in statute is problematic,” wrote Seth Bramble, a legislative advocate for the California Teachers Association in a March letter addressed to the state’s Assembly Education Committee. “This bill would carve into stone scientific knowledge that by its very nature is constantly being tested, validated, refuted, revised, and improved.”
Similarly, in Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March vetoed a bill that would have reversed changes to the state’s scoring system to align the state’s benchmarks with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal assessment tool that has recently been hit with funding cuts and layoffs under the Trump administration. Evers said in his veto that Republican lawmakers were stepping on the state superintendent’s independence.
That veto is another step in the evolution of a broader constitutional fight over literacy policy and how literacy funds are appropriated and released. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers set aside $50 million for a new statewide literacy initiative, but disagreements over legislative versus executive control have stalled its disbursement.
Indiana’s legislature faced criticism from educators over a 2024 mandate requiring 80 hours of literacy training for pre-K to sixth-grade teachers before they can renew their licenses. Teachers argued that the additional requirements were burdensome and did not account for their professional expertise.












A student's likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.


– Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute




In Illinois, literacy struggles have been building for more than a decade, according to Mailee Smith, senior director of policy at the Illinois Policy Institute. Today, only 3 in 10 Illinois third- and fourth-graders can read at grade level, based on state and national assessments.
Although Illinois lawmakers amended the school code in 2023 to create a state literacy plan, Smith noted the plan is only guidance and does not require districts to adopt evidence-based reading instruction. She urged local school boards to act on their own.
“If students can’t read by third grade, half of fourth-grade curriculum becomes incomprehensible,” she said. “A student’s likelihood to graduate high school can be predicted by their reading skill at the end of third grade.”
Despite the challenges, Smith said even small steps can make a real difference.
“Screening, intervention, parental notice, science-based instruction and thoughtful grade promotion — those are the five pillars, and Illinois and even local school districts can implement some of these steps right away,” she said.
“It doesn’t have to be daunting.”

(Photo illustration by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A session that started under the lingering shadow of a bitter yet short-lived argument over immigration came sputtering to an end Friday with no agreement on a new state budget, the one bill the Legislature is constitutionally obliged to pass.
Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez on Friday announced an extended session with lawmakers slated to return to Tallahassee on May 12.
Acrimony over Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez’s inability to reach an accord spilled over from fiscal to substantive policy, with snits breaking out in a number of areas. The Senate’s proposed state fiscal year 2025-26 budget is  $117.3 billion.
 The House’s proposed FY 25-26 budget is $112.9 billion.  
In the past few days, legislators did pass some high-profile bills, including measures designed to mitigate a crisis for condominium owners and set up new guardrails against developments in state parks – that one a rebuff to Gov. Ron DeSantis. Last summer, his administration briefly considered a plan to establish golf courses and hotels at several state parks but retreated in a hail of public outrage.

The Republican-controlled Florida Legislature also approved a bill that will make it more difficult for citizen-led constitutional amendments to make it on the ballot.
“This is the most important bill that we will be hearing in this chamber,” said Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman on Wednesday. “And as you’ve heard, it’s going to greatly restrict the access of the citizens of the state of Florida to be able to address the system.”
The Legislature agreed to eliminate a 35-year ban that prevented some people from pursuing wrongful-death lawsuits against physicians and hospitals, a top priority for Perez. 
Lawmakers, during the last week of session, agreed to roll back a law passed in 2023 that would’ve forced schools to push back their start times in 2026, leaving the decision up to schools. 
Legislators filed 1,951 bills for consideration during the 2025 session. As of Friday, just 243 had passed, a Senate bill report showed. 
Here’s a list of some of the bills that didn’t make it through the session.
 Working and the economy

Rural Renaissance: SB 110 is a top priority for Albritton. It steers infrastructure investments to rural parts of the state. Despite unanimous support in the upper chamber, the House did not take it up during the 60 days lawmakers were in town. Instead, the $200 million bill will be a topic when lawmakers reconvene in the coming weeks. 
E-Verify: DeSantis has repeatedly lambasted the House this session, stating that the chamber opposed everything he supports. But the House passed one piece of legislation DeSantis has pushed for, to require all employers to use the E-Verify system to check that new hires can legally work in the country.
However, the Senate never took up bills that would have brought thousands in penalties for employers who hire people unauthorized to work. Under existing law, only public agencies, their contractors, and companies with more than 25 employees have to use E-Verify. 
“I’m sure he’s gonna be pretty upset that the Senate isn’t willing to move on E-Verify,” Perez told reporters on April 24.
Employment: Florida voters went to the polls in 2020 to raise the minimum wage ultimately to $15 an hour by 2026, yet a proposal by Lee County Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin (SB 676) called for certain workers to “voluntarily” agree to work for below the minimum wage in work-study, internship, or apprenticeship programs.

The proposal passed through two committees in the Senate before being temporarily postponed on April 16, and it never came back — something Albritton was fine with.
“I don’t love it, to tell you the truth,” Albritton told reporters last month. “I think if someone works, whether they’re being an apprentice or whatever, the minimum wage is in the [state] Constitution for a reason.” When asked at the time whether the measure was dead for the session, he said, “I would expect so.”
Lawmakers have bounced around reducing protections for young Floridians in the workforce, including allowing them to work overnight and full-time hours during school weeks. 
Orlando Weekly reported that the bill was pushed by the DeSantis administration. The Senate bill, SB 918, did not make it to a second committee, while the House passed a version of the bill, HB 1225, off the floor last week that would keep overnight hours during the school year off limits for young people. The bill died. 
Property insurance: The House inserted an amendment awarding attorney’s fees to the winning party in insurance litigation into a Senate bill extending (SB 832) new legal protections to phosphate mining companies. Still, the Senate refused to move forward on the changes amid heavy pushback from DeSantis, insurance companies, and the state’s insurance regulator. The bill died on Friday after the Senate took out from it the property insurance provisions. 
Albritton told reporters on Monday that he believed in the changes lawmakers enacted in 2022 and 2023 to discourage lawsuits that insurance companies blamed for high rates were working.
“It’s only been a couple years, maybe. We’re still wanting to make sure we’re watching very closely what that is yielding,” Albritton said. “You’re right, there’s lots of new capital coming into the state. There’s new companies, rates are beginning to bend down pretty well, which is good news.”
The Office of Insurance Regulation reported an 0.7% drop in insurance costs in the fourth quarter of 2024. Twelve insurance companies have entered the state’s market, according to an announcement from the Office of Insurance Regulation on April 7.   
 Education 

Baby Olivia: The chambers were at odds over mandated viewing of the “Baby Olivia” video to teach embryologic development to public school students. That provision was included in HB 1255, one of the bills lawmakers battled on until the end of session.
Seeking agreement from the Senate, the House removed the Baby Olivia language Friday night. What’s left of the bill requires parental consent for schools that use corporal punishment.
Various bills to put university presidential searches into the sunshine and remove Board of Governors involvement in those searches never made it to the finish line.
Meanwhile, in his budget proposal, DeSantis proposed transferring the Ringling Museum from Florida State University to New College of Florida, his evolving “Hillsdale College of the South.” That proposal has gone nowhere in the Legislature so far, with stakeholders from the museum organizing against such a transfer. 
 Health

Parental consent: Exceptions that protect minors’ privacy with health care providers will remain in Florida statute. Senators didn’t take a final vote on a bill (HB 1505) requiring minors to obtain parental consent before receiving treatment for sexually transmitted infections and diseases. The bill also would have removed a provision letting physicians prescribe birth control to a minor if their medical opinion is that the patient would suffer health hazards otherwise.
In the proposal’s last committee stop in the Senate, Stuart Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell teared up while she talked about her late husband’s work as an OBGYN treating young women.
“He would roll over in his grave right now. I’m a no,” she said on April 21.
THC products: One of the biggest fails of the session has to be the Legislature’s inability to regulate hemp-derived THC products for the third year in a row.
  State Sen. Colleen Burton via Florida Senate
Perez assembled a 24-member workgroup that began meeting during the first week of session to “gain knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.” They came up with two main conclusions – that they didn’t want to do anything that might kill what has emerged as a billion-dollar industry in the state, but they also determined to change the status quo of how the product is being regulated – or not being regulated – in Florida.
The bills in the Senate sponsored by Polk County Republican Sen. Colleen Burton and in the House by Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman did have some significant differences, which apparently in the end were too great. That’s despite the fact that those measures were approved unanimously in all committees that heard them. 
“We will continue to debate how hemp affects public health and our economy,” Salzman told the Phoenix. “There are legal gaps we need to address in the future and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure these products are safe and protect consumers, while still allowing Florida farmers to thrive.”
 Politics and law

Sovereign immunity: Rep. Fiona McFarland once again has fallen short in her efforts to increase sovereign immunity limits for people injured by the government or its political subdivisions. Her bill, HB 301, never saw movement in the Florida Senate, which stood firm against it.
“I’m very disappointed,” McFarland told the Florida Phoenix Friday. She promised she’d sponsor the bill during the 2026 session. 
No fault repeal/PIP: The Florida House also championed legislation (HB 1181) to repeal the state’s no-fault automobile insurance laws and replace them with a fault-based system. It was one of several pieces of legislation the House advanced this session that would allow for more litigation, prompting Insurance and Banking Committee member Rep. Mike Caruso to opine, “Maybe we should call this the Insurance and Trial Attorneys Subcommittee because I feel like we’re doing a lot just for the benefit of trial attorneys.” The Senate agreed and never advanced the bill. DeSantis had already vetoed a PIP repeal once and opposed this year’s effort. The Senate companion (SB 1256) was never considered.

Wrongful death of fetuses: For a second year in a row, a bill (HB 1517) creating a legal avenue for parents to claim damages in the wrongful death of a fetus at any stage of development didn’t make it out of the session. This time around, the House approved the proposal, which reproductive rights advocates warned would establish fetal personhood. 
 Culture and Society

Guns: For the third year in a row, the Florida House voted to repeal the provision of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Act that raised the age to purchase a long gun in Florida from 18 to 21. And for the third year in a row, the Florida Senate opted not to move a companion measure.
Just as disappointing for Second Amendment advocates is that another year went by without the Legislature allowing Floridians to openly carry firearms. Once dubbed the “Gunshine State” for being at the forefront of such pro-gun laws as “Stand Your Ground,” gun-rights groups and Gov. Ron DeSantis himself called earlier this year for Florida to join the other 45 states that allow for “open carry.” 
But that legislation went nowhere in either chamber this year. Senate President Albritton made it known well before the session started that he was “super consistent” in standing with law enforcement, which, in the case of the Florida Sheriffs Association, has consistently as an organization opposed that policy change.  
And a proposal that would have extended concealed-carry rights to Florida colleges and universities (SB 814), filed by now-former Brevard County GOP Sen. Randy Fine, failed in committee, with Miami-Dade Republican Ileana Garcia joining three Democrats to reject the measure. The shootings at Florida State University last month didn’t help the cause.
Hands-free driving: Florida was behind the curve when it finally voted in 2019 law banning texting while driving. With widespread complaints that the way that law was written makes it essentially unenforceable, there’s been a push in the past few sessions for Florida to join the now 30 states with bans on handheld cellphones in autos, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.
Southeast Republican Sen. Erin Grall’s proposal along these lines passed the full Senate on April 9. Its House companion, however, filed by Democrat Allison Tant, was never debated in either of the two committees it was assigned to this year.
Finally, SB 110, dubbed the Rural Renaissance, a top priority for Albritton, would steer infrastructure investments to rural parts of the state. Despite unanimous would support in the upper chamber, the House did not take it up during the 60 days lawmakers were in town. Instead, the $200 million bill will be a topic when lawmakers reconvene in the coming weeks.

A team of local, state and federal agencies referee wildlife watching along Wyoming scenic byway.
The post Togwotee Pass grizzlies attract vexing highway hazard appeared first on WyoFile .","Grassy Wyoming roadsides can be enticing to grizzly bears, especially mothers with cubs, and many people can’t resist stopping to marvel at the charismatic critters. 
“Everybody wants to see a bear. That’s the picture you want to take home from your vacation,” said Wyoming Highway Patrol Sgt. Andy Jackson. 
Stopping to view wildlife can be done safely, but in the heat of the moment, the trooper has written tickets to motorists for stopping in the middle of the road, leaving their car doors flung open and standing a hundred yards down the highway to take pictures. 
“I ask them, ‘Would you do this where you live?’ And they go, ‘Well, no,’” Jackson said. “And I go, ‘Well why would you do it here?’”
As bears come out of hibernation, the snow melts and grass greens up along roadsides, Jackson and his colleagues with other local, state and federal agencies are gearing up to attempt to steer humans toward safer habits when it comes to viewing wildlife. 
Togwotee Pass tees up a particularly vexing mix of grizzlies, wildlife watchers, steep grades, blind corners, high speeds and troubling behavior. Local, state and federal agencies put out a joint call last week for people to follow “ethical wildlife viewing and photography practices” on Togwotee Pass. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department and U.S. Forest Service have jointly stepped up patrols and are asking the public to heed their directions to minimize traffic jams and ensure safety for humans and bears.

Retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent Steve Stoinski knows what a hazardous — and sometimes volatile — mix can be found on Togwotee Pass after spending the summer of 2021 trying to solve the problem. Stoinski came out of retirement to work, under contract, for the Fish and Wildlife Service to intensively haze Grizzly 863, also known as Felicia, away from the roadside. Stoinski was already familiar with the grizzlies of Togwotee Pass, having previously investigated reports of drones harassing the federally protected threatened species. Although hazing briefly deterred the mother grizzly, Stoinski saw that it didn’t have a lasting effect. 
“The takeaways I had for managing grizzlies near the road,” he told WyoFile, “the bears are just going to hang out on the road.”
Roadside bears
Grizzlies have reasons to be next to the road, whether to forage for food or for their own safety, he said. Male grizzlies tend to stay away from the highway, and female grizzlies tend to avoid male grizzlies to protect their cubs, he said. 

“I only saw one boar griz that whole summer,” Stoinski recalled. “At that time, Felicia, Bear 863, she headed out of that area as soon as she got wind of that bear and bolted across the highway. We had to stop traffic to get her across the highway.” 
Wildlife managers no longer have Bear 863 marked, according to Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson. Out of an abundance of caution, Thompson didn’t want to say for certain whether the sow and two cubs frequenting the Togwotee Pass area this spring are Felicia and her offspring. 
“Over the years, we’ve started to wonder if 863 has turned into a different bear that just likes the road,” Thompson told WyoFile. 
Regardless, there’s a sow with two cubs that frequents the area. Game and Fish caught and marked one of the cubs last summer. 
“We definitely have a bear that is very observable, and it’s unfortunate we have to go back every year and remind everybody [of] etiquette and ethics when it comes to viewing them,” Thompson said. 

In recent weeks, state and federal agencies have reported significant bear jams and poor wildlife viewing ethics on Togwotee Pass, including people getting too close to bears. Never approach bears. People should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife. (Jason Wilmot/U.S. Forest Service)
Ethical, and legal, viewing practices include not approaching bears, maintaining 100 yards between yourself and a bear, stopping in paved pullouts — not on the shoulder — and not feeding wildlife. Though Wyoming Highway Patrol typically responds to traffic complaints, they also get called to Togwotee Pass for confrontations over bear viewing. 
“At times, some of the Game and Fish, some of the biologists, get harassed by the people that are bear watching,” Trooper Jackson said. 
Already this spring, Thompson said, “we’ve had some pretty nasty confrontations from some members of the public, basically telling us we can’t tell them what to do.”
Human nature 
Those tensions motivated multiple agencies to come together to ask the public to follow directions from law enforcement and wildlife managers. 
Stoinski also got an earful from bear watchers and photographers in 2021 when he hazed bears away from the road. 
“They were pretty belligerent,” Stoinski said at the time. “They got in our faces, were poking me in the chest.”
But eventually, they overcame those initial conflicts and worked together to promote bear and human safety, he said.  
The Bridger-Teton National Forest is leaning heavily into education and cooperation to improve safety for bears and people on the highway, which is a designated scenic byway. 
Along with the Bear Wise Jackson Hole program and other agency partners, the national forest is asking “the public, photographers, and wildlife tour groups to lead by example.”  
“We get that there’s a lot of opportunities to see wildlife all over the forest,” Bridger-Teton spokeswoman Mary Cernicek said. As new vegetation sprouts along roadsides, attracting bears, “we’re so excited to see them and probably having unintended consequences.”
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners have used this photograph over the years to illustrate the dangerous mix of bears, people and traffic on Togwotee Pass. (Bridger-Teton National Forest)
Originally, Togwotee didn’t see a heavy management presence along the highway, but as bear jams escalated, wildlife managers responded with attempts to change both bear and human behavior. Game and Fish still hazes grizzlies, when possible, away from the Togwotee highway.
“It’s been an ongoing effort to try to keep something worse from happening,” Thompson said. 
If it is Felicia along the road, she has been hit by a car before, he said. 
Last fall, world-famous Grizzly 399 was fatally struck by a vehicle on the highway through the Snake River Canyon south of Jackson. The matriarch bruin had raised her cubs roadside in Grand Teton National Park for nearly two decades. 
Visitors save up and come from around the world to see Wyoming wildlife — a phenomenon not limited to national parks.
Striking a balance 
In Wyoming, it’s illegal to park on the shoulder of a highway unless it’s an emergency, Trooper Jackson said, and people are supposed to use designated pullouts. But enforcing that law isn’t so easy.
He points to the hamlet of Wilson at the base of Teton Pass, where a moose can be seen most summer days from the shoulder of Highway 22. 
“All summer long, we get people stopping, taking a picture of the moose in Fish Creek,” Jackson said. Wyoming Highway Patrol fields frequent complaints from people who want the cars out of there. 
“And I’m going, ‘These people came 2,000 miles to see this,’” Jackson said. “We try to have a good balance of what’s common sense.” 
The Teton County Sheriff’s Office also enforces traffic laws and gets called to help out on Togwotee Pass. Sheriff Matt Carr said the county used to offer overtime pay to a deputy who lived in nearby Buffalo Valley to patrol the area more frequently. 
“The key problem is people stopping,” Carr said. “It’s really not the tourists as much as it is the professional photographers.”
Carr said he no longer has that deputy or the budget to help as much as the county has in the past. 
“We’re trying to watch budgets very seriously this year with the revenue losses we’re seeing from property tax reductions,” Carr said. 
Grizzly speed limit?
Looking back on his summer managing the mayhem in 2021, Stoinski sees human nature as a major driver of behavior that can’t be overlooked. 
“People coming from across the country to visit the parks, or to visit Wyoming, and they see a grizzly bear for the first time in their lives, they just can’t help but stop,” Stoinski said. “There’s got to be a balance between letting people enjoy the bears while they’re near the road without getting too close.”
One thing that authorities can control is the speed limit. For his part, Stoinski would like to see variable speed limits deployed when grizzlies are in the area and bear jams become unavoidable. 
“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit.”Steve Stoinski, retired USFWS Special agent 
Wyoming has variable speed limits for blizzards along the interstate, he noted. Why not take the concept for a test drive along Togwotee? 
“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know when the bears are around the highway,” he said. “Slow traffic down just for people’s safety.”
Already, electronic signs posted along the highway tell people not to stop on the road to view bears.

While the rest of the state is deep into its unofficial festival season, about 75 incarcerated men take part in a rodeo that’s not your traditional apple pie, bucking broncos and fancy horses event.
Its critics describe it more like a sordid gladiator exhibition from peak Roman Empire times. They say this exploitation of inmates reflects outdated views on incarceration in Louisiana, a state where more than 1,000 of every 100,000 residents are behind bars according to the Promise of Justice Initiative.
But the rodeo also has its supporters – and some of the most ardent are the inmates who are part of the show. Reporter Piper Hutchinson attended the event last month and heard why they see the rodeo as a key part of positive prison culture. Read more about her visit to “The Wildest Show in the South.”

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
  NC Attorney General Jeff Jackson (Photo: NCDOJ)
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.










There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company


23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
HIPAA doesn’t help
Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
What states are doing
In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Before his sentencing in March 2025, a convicted child rapist asked for a judgment that would have set him free in 2027. The Kansas resident received 25 years with no chance of parole.
The reason? Jessica’s Law, which Kansas lawmakers passed in 2006.
Kansas was one of the first states to follow Florida’s initial enactment of Jessica’s Law 20 years ago in response to the rape and murder of 9-year-old Jessica “Jessie” Lunsford in Homosassa, Florida. Forty-four other states have followed, altering how America polices, punishes and paroles pedophiles.
Although the law differs in some details from state to state, it generally directs judges to sentence people convicted of sex crimes involving children to a minimum of 25 years. Jessica’s Law also monitors offenders’ movements after prison and strives to keep them away from places where children congregate, such as schools and parks.
Many policymakers, prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges have protested key aspects of the law. They are particularly opposed to its strict minimum sentencing guidelines, which they’ve described as oversimplified and counterproductive.
Proponents, however, point to the law’s origins: Jessica’s February 2005 abduction, rape and murder by a repeat, convicted sex offender. They maintain the crime, which riveted the country for months and sent the third grader’s father, Mark, on a national child protection crusade, exposed deep-seated flaws in law enforcement and the legal system that made children around the country vulnerable to sexual assault.
Jessica’s Law remains mostly intact throughout the country. But it has come under scrutiny and has undergone changes. As a journalism professor who directed a documentary about Lunsford’s efforts to persuade politicians to pass the law that bears his daughter’s name, I’ve kept up with its trials and tribulations.
Twenty years after Florida introduced the law, the jury is still out on whether America’s children are safer as a result.
 
‘Jessie’s Dad’
In making “Jessie’s Dad,” I filmed Lunsford visiting state capitals and Capitol Hill and interviewed many of his allies and detractors. I also reviewed interrogation footage and newsreels, attended the trial of John Couey — Jessica’s killer — and pored over proposed and passed bills, court transcripts and police records.
The resulting 2011 documentary highlights the law’s major perceived pros and cons.
The most glaring of the legal system’s shortcomings before Jessica’s Law, according to Lunsford and other activist groups, was lax treatment by the police and courts. That, they said, allowed many sex offenders who target children to roam free.
As Lunsford hopscotched from state to state to push for the law’s passage, he often noted that prior to raping and killing Jessie, Couey was convicted twice of molesting children but served only fractions of his sentences.
“One time they gave him (Couey) a 10-year sentence; he did two years,” Lunsford told me. “One time, he (Couey) broke into a house and assaulted a child, and he would’ve gotten more time had he stolen their silverware.”
Most of the states that have enacted Jessica’s Law direct judges to sentence child rapists to a minimum of 25 years in prison.
Besides mandatory minimum sentencing, most states that have passed Jessica’s Law require sex-offender parolees to wear a GPS monitor — something Couey never did.
Lunsford repeatedly pointed out that an electronic ankle bracelet, which tells the police the location of the person wearing it, could have led the police to Couey’s room in his sister’s trailer across the street from the Lunsford’s mobile home. That’s where Couey kept Jessie for three days before burying her alive in a backyard grave.
 
‘Romeo and Juliet’ provisions
In 2007, soon after Ohio passed its version of the law, Lunsford’s son Josh faced felony charges for fondling his 14-year-old girlfriend. The girl’s mother, who disapproved of their relationship, turned him in as soon as he turned 18 and became an adult in the eyes of the legal system. Josh ended up being charged with a misdemeanor, to which he pleaded guilty. He served 10 days in jail and 12 months under supervised release.
Reeling from this incident, the elder Lunsford advocated amending Jessica’s Law with so-called Romeo and Juliet provisions. These stipulations typically exempt most young adults from harsh sentencing when the age difference between them and their romantic teen partners adds up to fewer than four or five years.
Pennsylvania, the second state after Florida to pass Jessica’s Law in 2006, became the first to add a Romeo and Juliet provision in 2011.
Today, 44 states have likewise adopted similar provisions.
Legal challenges, too, have revamped parts of Jessica’s Law in some states. In 2015, for instance, California’s Supreme Court ruled the law violated the U.S. Constitution by infringing offenders’ liberty and privacy.
The law did so, the court determined, by universally ordering registered sex offenders to stay at least 2,000 feet away from schools and other places where children congregate. That meant they could not live within 2,000 feet of a school or places where children gathered.
Prior to the ruling, the Jessica’s Law residency restriction left many of California’s registered sex offenders with few viable housing options. It thus forced scores of them onto the streets and contributed to the Golden State’s homelessness crisis.
Critics have also noted it is difficult to monitor homeless pedophiles.
Although the California Supreme Court ruling technically applied only to San Diego County, it has spurred other parts of the state to restrict residency on a case-by-case basis.
 
Electronic tracking
Another divisive Jessica’s Law stipulation, however, may be too complex to simply modify.When included in the original Florida law, electronic tracking appeared to hold great promise.
Today, 38 additional states electronically monitor sex offenders. Yet many accused and paroled sex offenders wearing ankle bracelets have nonetheless harmed children.
For instance, David Renz broke free of his GPS monitor in 2013 while awaiting a child pornography trial in New York and raped a fourth grader. He also killed the 10-year-old girl’s protector and school librarian, Lori Bresnahan.
While others harmed children after cutting off their ankle bracelets, some, like Arkansas resident Leontarius Reed, committed sex crimes while wearing GPS devices. Reed was wearing the device after a previous nonsexual offense.
Critics claim electronic monitoring numbs society into a misleading state of comfort. Others argue it’s better than losing track of sex offenders. They also say it deters crime and has saved countless lives.
Despite the widespread adoption of Jessica’s Law, comprehensive research is still needed to measure its impact. Such a project would examine whether America’s children are truly safer now than they were on May 1, 2005.

Dick Anderson, R-Willow City, talks to a colleague on May 1, 2025, in the House chamber. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A bill that intends to keep North Dakota on the forefront of rare earth mineral development is on its way to the governor after lengthy debate Friday. 
Rep. Dick Anderson, R-Willow City, the sponsor of House Bill 1459, said the bill is needed to position North Dakota for a facility to process rare earth minerals, which can be embedded with coal that is already slated for mining. He said there could be federal funding for such a facility.  
The bill passed the House 63-26 and then the Senate 27-19.
China supplies most of the rare earth minerals needed for electronics. Scott Meyer, R-Grand Forks, supported the bill in the interest of national security and not being reliant on China.
For many opponents, a major sticking point on the bill was language that set a royalty payment for mineral rights owners at 2.5% on the rare earth minerals found within a coal seam. That would be on top of the royalty payment that had been negotiated in the coal lease. 
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, said the bill denies the rights of mineral owners to negotiate with coal companies.
“I would want to have the ability to negotiate another lease,” Bekkedahl said. 
Rare earth minerals seen as a rare opportunity in North Dakota

The Northwest Landowners Association, which represents property owners with coal leases, argued that the royalty provision was unconstitutional. 
Several House members agreed with that sentiment when the conference committee report was presented on the House floor Thursday morning. The bill was sent back to the conference committee for more work. 
Members of the conference committee said the royalty was in the best interest of mineral owners to ensure they get some compensation for the rare earth minerals. 
Sen. Dale Patten, R-Watford City, said the rare earth minerals are part of the coal. 
He said the royalty provision “is a way for that mineral owner to realize revenue,” and without it they may get nothing.

Patten noted that coal companies can make the legal argument that the coal leases already cover development of rare earth minerals. 
Language was added to the bill at the recommendation of Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, who is an attorney, specifying that mineral owners and the coal companies could renegotiate the terms of the lease. 
Klemin said the change addressed some of his concerns but not all of them. He said the bill retroactively changing existing leasing was troubling. 
Anderson said the technology is improving to extract rare earth minerals from the ash of coal that has already been burned, known as fly ash. 
While that process is more expensive, he said if that happens, the mineral owners could get nothing. 
“If you get too greedy, you lose,” Anderson said in a conference committee meeting Friday. 
Rep. Todd Porter, R-Mandan, said litigation was “inevitable” but passing the bill helps frame the issues for the court system and “provides clarity and certainty to industry” that will make them more likely to invest in rare earth mineral processing in the state.

Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, speaks on the House floor during debate on a property tax bill on May 2, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House and Senate compromised on a property tax package Friday amounting to a $1,600 primary residence credit, more than triple the amount homeowners receive now.
But one House member said he plans to promote an initiated measure for the November 2026 ballot that would aim to cut taxes for other property types.
House Bill 1176, sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, and backed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong, passed on the final day of the session with a unanimous vote in the Senate and 86-4 vote in the House.
Lawmakers identified property tax reform as a top priority for the session after voters initiated a ballot measure last year that sought to eliminate property taxes based on assessed value. Although the measure failed, lawmakers said they heard from voters that they expect property tax cuts in the future.

The bill uses earnings from the state Legacy Fund to pay for the program, with the idea that lawmakers could consider even greater property tax relief in the future as the fund grows. Armstrong’s vision is that eventually most homeowners would be on a path to paying zero property taxes.
“This bill provides real relief and real reform for taxpayers,” Armstrong said in a statement Friday. “It’s responsible, affordable and durable. It creates Legacy Fund buy-in, and it’s the single most impactful thing we could do for North Dakota citizens this session.” 
The legislation also seeks to slow the growth of property tax increases with a 3% cap on how much local governments can increase the taxes annually.
The total amount of property tax relief in the package is estimated at $473 million for 2025-27, Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. The bill also includes more money for a disabled veterans tax credit and a renters refund.
“This is truly a landmark bill when it comes to property taxes,” Nathe said after the conference committee agreed on a final version of the bill. “Probably historic.”
Donnell Preskey, government and public affairs specialist for the North Dakota Association of Counties, said counties were not in favor of the caps, but the bill includes an opt-out provision that would allow residents in a taxing district to vote to be exempted from the caps for four years.
“That’s one of the elements we worked really hard to get in there,” Preskey said. She added there are still concerns about what local budgets will look like with 3% caps over the next two years.
She said the association hopes to educate counties on the new property tax rules, how it will impact their budgets and some of the flexibility options available.
The bill also caps how much school districts can raise property taxes. It contains a provision that if the cap on schools forces some districts to drop below the state-mandated local education contribution level, the Department of Public Instruction would administer gap funding to make the districts whole. An additional $30 million is set aside for that gap funding.
  Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, speaks on the House floor during debate on a property tax bill on May 2, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Lawmakers removed a so-called “skin-in-the-game” provision the Senate advanced that would have required homeowners to pay at least 25% of their property tax bill. The Legislature defeated two other property tax proposals that also would have benefited owners of agricultural land, commercial property and centrally assessed properties. 
Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, sponsored House Bill 1168, a competing property tax bill that would have had the state pay 100% of public school funding as a way to deliver property tax relief. Louser said he plans to advance that proposal through an initiated measure. He said he plans to gather signatures with the goal of getting it on the November ballot.
“I was taught to always fight for what I believe in and, members of the assembly, this may be something you believe in, too,” Louser said.
Rep. Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, chairman of the House Finance and Taxation Committee, expressed frustration with the potential ballot measure.
“For a legislator to come on and talk about how he’s going to lead a petition because he doesn’t like the outcome of the property tax relief that the majority of the assembly decided was the way to go is a bit over the top,” Headland said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Legislature went home from their 60-day legislative session on Friday night without passing a budget, but did vote to extend the regular session until June 6, or until they complete their work.
The Senate and House voted on a resolution (HCR 1631) that lists 16 bills that they will consider when they return, likely beginning in the week of May 12, with only bills related to the budget on the agenda.
Senate President Ben Albritton said on the floor of the Senate that the House and Senate had reached a framework for a budget plan, which will include $2.8 billion in tax relief, “the most historic tax relief package in the history of our state.”
“Floridians expect and deserve a balanced budget that reduces state spending, lowers per capita spending, and reduces the growth of state bureaucracy,” he said. “I am committed to working with our partners in the Florida House to pass a budget that reduces debt, accounts for significant, broad-based tax relief, and maintains historic state reserves for emergencies.”
There remains about a $4 billion gap between the proposed budgets passed by the House and Senate last month. The new fiscal year opens on July 1.
Friday’s session included several hour-long breaks sprinkled throughout the day as lawmakers worked to prepare bills that could still win approval in both chambers. In some cases, they couldn’t find common ground, and those bills died on the floor.
Hurricane recovery
One measure they did pass on Friday (SB 180) is aimed at strengthening hurricane relief and recovery and enhance response efforts in Florida. Pinellas County Republican Nick DiCeglie, the bill sponsor, cited the ways local governments in his district handled (or mishandled) recovery efforts following the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall.
The bill prohibits local governments from increasing building permit or inspection fees for six months after a hurricane or tropical storm emergency declared by the governor or federal government.
It requires local governments to develop post-storm permitting plans that provide for special building permits and inspection procedures. It also says that local governments must ensure sufficient personnel are prepared and available post-storm for “expeditious building inspections, permitting and enforcement tasks.
Local governments must lay out multiple locations where building permit services will be offered in person during regular business hours at a minimum.
“Multiple major hurricanes ravaged Florida last year, leaving extensive damage statewide,” said DiCeglie.
“After a storm, Floridians need a clear path to recovery. We’re fighting for families to focus on rebuilding without additional delays or burdens, especially for those who sustained damage or lost their homes. Working with our state and local emergency responders, we can streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination, fortifying and strengthening our communities before the next storm.”
Earlier in the day, the Senate quickly voted on one of the most controversial bills of the session — making it more difficult for citizens to place constitutional amendments on the state ballot. The two chambers had bounced the bill back and forth between them for three days before passing it mostly along party lines (with newly independent Sen. Jason Pizzo joining the Republicans in supporting it).
The Senate voted final passage at 1:44 p.m. The governor signed it at 7:57 p.m., according to legislative records.
“The Speaker said that good things come to those who wait,” said House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell. “Well, Floridians have been waiting an awful long time, and they want us to get property insurance costs under control. They want us to make sure that they have housing affordability, affordable healthcare costs.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)On Friday, the Alaska Senate’s finance committee finished work on a draft state operating budget for the coming year and sent the draft ahead to a vote of the full Senate.
Senators is scheduled to begin debating amendments on Monday, with a vote on the draft expected later in the week.
The committee’s draft is $384 million less than a version passed by the House in April and $1.7 billion less than Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s proposal for the fiscal year that starts July 1 and runs through June 30, 2026.
Most of the cuts came from the 2025 Permanent Fund dividend. Dunleavy proposed a payout of about $3,900 per recipient, and the House reduced that to about $1,400. The Senate’s latest draft has it at $1,000.
The budget arrived in the finance committee with a substantial deficit, and it leaves with a surplus of between $100 million and $200 million, using only numbers in various budget bill drafts to date.
That surplus is almost certainly an illusion, the committee’s two leading members warned.
Sens. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, and Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, said that lawmakers next year are likely to face a significant deficit, somewhere between $300 million and $600 million at current estimates.
“We argue that this is sort of a transitional budget, getting prepared for the headwinds that we’re going to face,” Hoffman said.
The upcoming budget is based on a state forecast from March that predicts North Slope oil prices will average $68 per barrel in the coming fiscal year. Since that forecast was released, futures markets have plummeted, so much so that the Department of Revenue later approached the co-chairs with concerns, Hoffman said. When spending exceeds revenue, lawmakers must make up for it with a supplemental budget bill in the next legislative session.
“It may be as low as $64, which will mean a potential supplemental (bill), if that’s the case, of an additional $150 million, estimated,” Hoffman said.
On top of that are several large union contracts that remain under negotiation. Pay and benefit increases are expected after a salary survey found significant numbers of state employees are underpaid. 
“They may be between $100 million and $300 million,” Hoffman said.
Then add the federal government programs cut because of DOGE, Hoffman said. That White House office has been slashing federal programs and spending. If the state were to lose 5% of its federal funding, keeping programs alive would cost as much as $300 million.
Then there’s fire season to consider, he added.
“If it’s higher than an average year, which may happen, we could see a substantial hit on the state’s coffers. So you know, I and others in the Senate are concerned,” Hoffman said. 
He added that there’s yet another area of concern.
“We’re using north of $100 million in one-time funds in this year’s budget that aren’t going to be available next year,” Hoffman said. “So that is why we may have a gap of between $300 million and $600 million next year.”
Legislators have removed the possibility of closing the budget gap with new revenue — opposed by some key House members — or spending from savings, opposed by Senate leaders who say it wouldn’t be sustainable. 
Stedman referred to the temporary budget surplus as a “buffer” that likely would be consumed by expected cost increases. “We’re a little cautious,” Stedman said.
Some of that buffer could be consumed later this year as members of the House negotiate with the Senate on a budget compromise that integrates parts of the Senate and House drafts.
Stedman said he hopes there will be few items added back into the budget.
“The fact of the matter is,” Hoffman said, “at some point, the message needs to be that we can’t continue as we are.”

May Day is recognized by many countries and organizations as International Workers Day, and hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S. and the world took to the streets to protest, with many condemning the Trump administration, the administration’s aggressive rhetoric toward other countries, fears of global economic turmoil, and hostility toward immigrants’ rights. 
In Alaska, protests took place in at least 21 communities according to reports on social media, on Thursday and others planned through the weekend, from the Arctic region to Southeast Alaska. 
Organizers in several communities spoke with the Alaska Beacon after rallies wrapped up on Thursday, and expressed hope in the unified protest effort and great concern for the impacts of firing federal workers and threatened cuts to essential services, like health care. 
In Petersburg, an estimated 75 people rallied downtown around noon, according to Chelsea Tremblay, one of the organizers with the community group, Petersburg Friends and Neighbors. She said speakers focused on the importance of workers rights, and demonstrators called on Alaska’s congressional delegation to do more, “to stand up for our communities and to keep the separation of powers strong,” she said. “By fighting for the funds that have been allocated to come to our communities, and to stop the loss of jobs.”

Tremblay said Petersburg has been impacted by the federal firings and budget cuts to the U.S. Forest Service in the Tongass National Forest, Head Start, and the end of federal telework options, as well as particular concern around further cuts to the National Weather Service. “That’s a safety issue, right? Or potential funds being withheld from public broadcasting that have already been dedicated, but that’s how people stay connected with the community when they’re out on the boats,” she said. 
She said the group also raised funds for local homelessness services. “We’re stronger together,” she added. “So it feels good to be in solidarity with so many other communities.” 
In the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, an estimated 200 people gathered for a rally in Wasilla, said organizer Dave Musgrave, with the activist group Mat-Su United for Progress. “This was really to lift up unions, and show that we are standing with working families,” he said.
There were speeches, a hot dog roast and a live band that played union songs. “And then people stood along Parks Highway with their signs protesting various things from the (Trump) administration. I’d say the overwhelming concern was the threat to democracy, and our Constitution.”

Musgrave said Mat-Su residents are deeply concerned about federal cuts, particularly any proposed cuts to health care through Medicaid, as about one-third of all Alaska residents rely on the program. 
“That includes pregnant women, that includes single adults, it includes kids,” through the related Denali KidCare program, he said. “And the fallout is going to be for all Alaskans, because it’s not just those on Medicaid. This will cripple our health care system, including hospitals, medical clinics – our whole medical infrastructure is under threat right now.”
On the Kenai Peninsula in Soldotna, organizer Michele Vasquez with the activist group Many Voices said residents are also extremely concerned about job cuts and threats to health care, including for those whose jobs don’t provide them with insurance.
“The folks in between. They work. They work one, two, three jobs, but they’re still working, and they’re still on Medicaid,” she said. “So the impacts to Alaska overall could be very, very devastating.” She said the region is feeling the impacts of job losses, and threatened cuts to services like libraries and public radio sow more uncertainty. “There have been a lot of devastating losses of jobs, and any loss of jobs in Alaska is detrimental.” 
The May Day rally drew an estimated 140 people in Soldotna Creek Park, she said, “in support of workers, union and nonunion.” She said speakers highlighted the importance of supporting disability rights, reproductive health care, and uniting together to push back against the Trump administration. The crowd also raised funds and gathered donations for the local food bank.

Vasquez said some Republicans and Trump voters have joined their protest events over the last month. “Surprisingly,” she said, “It was just shocking to me that they were willing to admit it. And I don’t mean that in a bad way. I think it depends on who they are, what their status is,” she said.
“Mainly, I’ve talked to seniors who are of all political stripes, who are terrified of losing Medicare, of losing their Social Security or their veterans benefits. My husband and I fall into that category, so I can clearly understand why everyone would be fearful,” she said, adding her husband is a retired veteran and disabled. 
“All across political spectrums, we’re all a little scared,” Vasquez said. “Because they’re worried, you know? We’re worried about what happens to our house if we can’t make the mortgage payments? What if we can’t buy food? It’s just, it’s kind of a commonality.”
In Talkeetna, organizer Sandra Loomis said a group of 54 people rallied for May Day, and to protest the Trump agenda. “We marched down Main Street and got a nice picture right there on the river, where you can see Denali behind and did a nice chant, ‘8647,’” she said, referring to the anti-Trump chant to “86,” or reject, the 47th president. 
“People are fed up and just tired of this, all this open corruption from the White House,” Loomis said. “And taking away all our services, taking away our libraries, taking away research, taking away our rights, taking away economic equity. People are fed up and tired of it. It’s way, way, way beyond the pale, and too far, and the blatant disregard of the Constitution and the Supreme Court orders.”

Loomis said Talkeetna residents are also concerned around the federal firings, cuts to programs like Medicaid and the recent cut to Americorps. She expressed outrage and frustration at the Trump administration threatening the press, law firms and universities. Of special concern was Trump’s recent refusal to acknowledge that an image of alleged gang tattoos on a man deported to El Salvador was Photoshopped, “blatantly lying to everyone, right to our faces and like, we know they’re lying!” 
She said the actions go against the core values and principles that the country was founded on. “My family, multiple generations of my family, have fought for the freedoms that we’ve enjoyed,” she said. “One of the things that has made America such an amazing place to live — it’s because we have diversity. It’s because we accept all religions and respect each other.” 
In Juneau, roughly 400 people gathered in front of the Alaska State Capitol, despite the rain, for speeches, calls to protect workers, unions and essential social services, and a performance by the Woosh.ji.een Dance Group. “Get up! Get down. Juneau is a union town!” the crowd chanted, before marching to Marine Park by the cruise ship dock. They also collected donations for the Southeast Alaska Food Bank.  
Organizers said residents are continuing to make regular calls and emails to the state’s congressional delegation, particularly U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who they said has been responsive to their concerns. 
Different groups nationally have said the next national day of action is a People’s Parade planned for June 14, Flag Day.

Initial reactions to the order from the Nebraska federal delegation have been mixed.,"The headquarters of Nebraska Public Media on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s East Campus. (Courtesy of Nebraska Public Media)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Thursday seeking to end federal funding for public media. 
It marks the White House’s latest escalation in its political battle with the media, as Trump and some congressional Republicans fulfill a pledge to cut funding to the organizations. Unlike other executive orders that he signed in public ceremonies, Trump signed this one behind closed doors, while flying on Air Force One, Politico reported. 
Initial reactions to the order from the Nebraska all-Republican federal delegation have been mixed. U.S. Reps. Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, echoed Trump’s criticisms of NPR’s national bias but defended the unique value Nebraska Public Media provides locally. U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents the largely rural 3rd District and U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts had no immediate comment Friday. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the Omaha-based 2nd District, highlighted how crucial Nebraska Public Media remains to the state. 
Gov. Jim Pillen also offered no immediate comment through a spokeswoman while visiting Washington, D.C., to see the president this week. If Trump’s order withstands promised legal challenges, PBS could lose nearly 15% of its annual revenue and NPR could lose 1% of its budget. While federal funding is a fraction of the budget for the national independent public news organizations, federal funding does help smaller, often rural, local affiliate stations of both afford to operate in places the free market might not serve as well. 
Closer to home, the impact could be significant. Nebraska Public Media could lose up to 16% of its annual budget, which could put essential services at risk, including emergency alert systems. The timing creates a budget hole that the state might be hard-pressed to fill during a budget shortfall.

Trump’s order calls for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit corporation authorized by Congress to receive federal funds and distribute them to support public broadcasting, to “cancel existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law and … decline to provide future funding” to the news organizations.
“Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,” the order reads. “What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.” 
Trump also has claimed that NPR and PBS produce “biased and partisan news coverage.” 
The heads of NPR and PBS have defended their federal funding and coverage before a U.S. House Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, subcommittee meeting in March.
Bacon said, “he respects the great job that NPR and PBS have done in Nebraska.” 
Congress allocates more than $500 million annually to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and specifies its intended use. The funding is administered in two-year cycles, scheduled in advance, a structure designed to shield public media from political pressure. 
CPB officials questioned the legitimacy of the president’s new order. The private nonprofit is already suing the Trump administration over another executive order seeking to fire three of its five board members.
PBS and NPR have called the order unlawful, saying it infringed on the freedom of the press. Both plan to challenge it in court. 
Order ‘limits Nebraska Public Media’
Nebraska Public Media, which is responsible for all public TV and radio stations in the state, receives approximately $4 million in federal funding, representing roughly 16% of its annual budget. NPM General Manager and CEO Stacey Decker said that while the station is still evaluating the impacts of Trump’s latest executive order, NPM is “deeply disappointed.” 
“It limits Nebraska Public Media’s ability to make independent and locally focused decisions about the programming and resources we provide to Nebraskans,” Decker’s statement reads.  “It also severs the strong local-national partnership that is the backbone of public media, delivering trusted, valued and essential programming and services to all Americans.”
The state funds roughly 44% of the NPM budget, according to information published on the NPM website. Nebraska Public Media is tasked with live-streaming the legislative session and public hearings on bills. NPM also is among the few Nebraska news organizations staffing the State Capitol with reporters daily during the session. 
“Even during this challenging time, we are steadfast in our commitment to provide every Nebraskan with trusted, valued and essential programs and services,” Decker said. “Just as we have for more than 70 years.” 
NPM’s ‘unique value’
Flood said the Trump executive order is “an opportunity for America to scrutinize the work of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to stop the liberal bias that has infected National Public Radio, and to rethink how federal funding works for local public broadcasting networks.” 
But Flood, who runs his own private media company that includes News Channel Nebraska,  emphasized Nebraska public media’s “unique value” for rural communities in the state and how it “operates independently of CPB.”

“[NPM] is the backbone of our state’s emergency alert system, and they have gone all-in on delivering quality coverage of youth sports,” Flood said. 
Nebraska Public Media broadcasts and streams local high school and college sports, including from the Nebraska School Activities Association and the University of Nebraska and Creighton University. It also issues essential vital alerts for severe storms and other emergencies. A cut in federal funding could jeopardize those services, according to the NPM website. 
Flood added that he would “ensure [Nebraska] public broadcasting network remains strong” by visiting with NPM leaders to discuss how the order impacts them. 
The Legislature’s Appropriations Committee has a proposal to increase the funding of the Nebraska Educational Telecommunications Commission, the state agency responsible for overseeing and licensing the public television and radio stations that make up Nebraska Public Media, for the next two years. 
Still, the state budget shortfall has grown by $190 million, and lawmakers have less than a month to balance the budget. The committee this week made attempts to close the gap by taking another $135 million from cash funds held by various state agencies and reducing the funding state agencies would get for the next two years.
If NPM loses funding, Bacon said, their “absence” would “leave a void.”

On April 25, the House voted 37-0 to approve a resolution calling for readiness.
House Joint Resolution 15, by Rep. Ky Holland, I-Anchorage, is slated for a hearing on Friday in the Senate Resources Committee.
“House Joint Resolution 15 came about from an early awareness this winter about the very dry conditions that we were witnessing in Southcentral Alaska,” said Holland, speaking to the House.
“A really key part of this resolution is a recognition of how important it is that we do the outreach and we encourage the preparation by residents to be able to be more aware of what they can do to protect their own homes through the Firewise program,” he said.
He added that it’s particularly important for Alaskans to be aware that many of the state’s residential areas have a single way in and out.
“That single route is all that’s going to be available for both our fire response apparatus to get in, as well as for anyone who’s trying to evacuate to get out,” he said. “And we only have to look back at some very tragic, large fires we’ve seen in the last five years that have been exacerbated by these problems of the limited ingress and egress routes to realize how important it is for us to assess those areas.”

A Williams County child who was not vaccinated is believed to have contracted the illness from an out-of-state visitor, the department said Friday. The child is in isolation at home.
Health officials are contacting people who may have had contact with the child and advising people who are not vaccinated to quarantine.
The threat to the public is low due to a majority of North Dakotans being vaccinated against the disease, according to the department.
Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS, said vaccination is the most effective defense against contracting measles.
“Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination is safer than risking measles illness,” Howell said. “The MMR vaccine has been safely used in the United States since 1973.”
Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash.
“Anyone with symptoms consistent with measles should call ahead before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others,” she said.
The department said there is no specific medical treatment for measles, but antibiotics may be used in cases that have developed a secondary bacterial infection.  
People who were vaccinated as children and adults born before 1957 are considered protected.
The department said two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing infection. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12-15 months and a booster between 4-6 years old.
The department also recommends that families and individuals consult with their health care provider to discuss immunizations.
North Dakota has an 81% MMR vaccination rate among toddlers, and a 90% rate among kindergarten students for the 2024-2025 school year. 
According to public health data, a 95% vaccination rate is generally needed to prevent wider spread in communities.

(Photo provided by Brian Gabriel)Last summer, a quiet revolution unfolded on the shores of the Kenai Peninsula. A group of setnet fishermen — barred and facing economic ruin from their traditional fishery to protect dwindling king salmon — stepped into a new role: scientific collaborators. Testing set-beach seines as an alternative to gillnets, they proved something remarkable. Not only did they catch abundant sockeye; but, without exception, every king salmon encountered swam away unharmed.  
This wasn’t just conservation — it was partnership. These fishermen didn’t just follow protocols; they refined them in real time, applying generations of knowledge about tides, fish behavior, and gear mechanics. The results? A resounding proof of concept that protecting kings and harvesting sockeye need not be mutually exclusive.  
Yet today, this breakthrough risks becoming a footnote. The Alaska Board of Fisheries insists more data is needed before expanding the program — a cautious stance that ignores both the urgency of the crisis and the ingenuity at hand. Here’s what they’re missing: This experiment isn’t just about science. It’s about survival — for fish and fishermen alike. 
Two tests, one solution
The set-beach seine trials face twin imperatives:  

 Biological success – does it spare kings? Early data: emphatically yes.  
 Economic viability – can fishermen earn a living doing it? Unknown — to be determined.  

This second question is where bureaucracy fails. The options being considered by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for the continued experiments treat economic outcomes as an afterthought, as if conservation can succeed without buy-in from those who work the water. Setnet families have already sacrificed their fishery for kings. Now they’re being financially pressed even more as they strive to build its replacement. The board recently failed to take prudent action. Despite conclusive data, it failed to adopt a viable regulation, asked that more data be collected, and yet refused, when asked by fishermen, to provide any enabling guidelines to the Department of Fish and Game regarding how to proceed to gather that data.  The confusion created by the board has left the department in a delicate predicament: stating it can issue permits but must restrict, or even prohibit  the sale of fish — which flies in the face of common sense, not to mention, elementary economics! 
A ready workforce, a wasting opportunity
The solution is staring us in the face. Work with the fishermen who have brought this concept to the table. Implement their creative solutions to expand the study and allow the sale of fish sufficient to recover the expenses of doing the hard work of continuing the set-beach seine study. Six to eight permit holders working in groups for the next two seasons could definitively:   

increase by many times the data on live king release success and  survival;  
pioneer efficiency tweaks only fishers would spot; and  
document real-world methods to use, problems to solve, costs and profits — the make-or-break metrics. 

Without this, we’re conducting half an experiment. If the economics don’t work, this is just academic theater. We’ve got the skills to make it viable. But for that to happen, we would have to be given the chance.  
The clock is ticking
Every summer without action deepens two crises:  

ecological – kings continue to decline while a proven alternative gathers dust and  
human – fishing families sell permits, leave the industry and take their irreplaceable knowledge with them.  

Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang could:  

 Issue six to eight experimental set-beach seine permits to organized fishermen groups. Action would have to be taken now; there is little time left for the fishermen to prepare for this vital work this season. 
 Allow the commercial sale of sockeye catch by the fishermen to pay for the cost of doing the work and demonstrate the true viability for the future.  
 Formalize co-management, embedding fisher expertise in study design.  

This isn’t about relaxing conservation — it’s about accelerating it with the people who matter most. The kings need allies. The fishermen are ready. All they need is permission to get back to work.

(Photo courtesy of the House of Representatives)In a near-unanimous vote, the Florida House gave final approval Friday to a bill tightening restrictions against state employees’ participation in political campaigning.
The bill, HB 1445, is narrower than what the Florida House first proposed. The lower chamber wanted to bar state employees from soliciting contributions for political parties, committees, or candidates during working hours.
The Senate changed that language, replacing it to prohibit contribution solicitations that are coercive, explicitly stating that state employees suggesting someone make a political donation is OK under the bill.
The language lawmakers agreed upon also stops state employees from participating in any political campaign, not just those for elective offices, when they’re supposed to be working.
Throughout the legislative session, the involvement by state officials in Gov. Ron DeSantis’ political campaign against last year’s failed ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana and restore abortion access prompted legal challenges came under scrutiny.
The move to restrict politicking from state employees came after NBC News first reported that state employees in the governor’s office called lobbyists to request donations for a political committee aligned with DeSantis as he and First Lady Casey DeSantis hinted that she was considering a run for governor.
Although the proposal from Republicans Rep. Debbie Mayfield of Melbourne and Sen. Erin Grall of Vero Beach is on its way to the governor’s desk, DeSantis has already said he would veto it.
“They’re pulling it out of their rear ends and trying to jam it through this process. Over my veto pen,” DeSantis said of the proposal during an April 15 press conference in Pensacola.
DeSantis’ main criticism of the bill at the time involved a provision requiring agency heads to live in Tallahassee, which the governor referred to as a “swamp.” However, the final version cuts off reimbursement for agency heads to travel to Tallahassee. For example, state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo lives in Pinellas County.
Final passage of HB 1445 came well into the evening of the 60th day of the legislative session and with little debate. Mayfield reminded the chamber that the sole vote against the bill when the chamber first passed it on April 16 came from Delray Beach Republican Rep. Michael Caruso, a staunch DeSantis ally.
Caruso was also the sole vote against the bill on Friday.
Two provisions that remained intact in the compromise between the House and Senate require people appointed to universities’ boards of trustees and the board that oversees Florida’s public higher education institutions to live in the state or have graduated from the specific school they serve, or from any state university for the statewide board.

May 2, 2025. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Construction is expected to begin this fall on the new La Plaza de la Raza, a pocket many call the heartbeat of South Omaha’s historic commercial district.
But that’s just the start of a $25 million-plus public investment on the main business corridor of a community known historically as a landing place for the state’s immigrant population.
Leaders of the Adelante II initiative gathered Friday at the 24th and N Streets plaza and offered a progress report, this time sharing a stage with a host of elected officials and business representatives and reinforcing a theme of collaboration.
“Together we’re bringing the heart of our community forward — adelante,” said Itzel Lopez, CEO of the Latino Economic Development Council, a lead partner on the project.

Currently a paved parking lot that shifts to fiesta grounds on certain occasions, the plaza is to be transformed via a $25 million state award from the North and South Omaha recovery grant program. Its projected opening is in 2027.
Douglas County and the City of Omaha each committed $500,000 from pandemic funds to the effort as well.
Key features include an amphitheater, stage, playground areas, open lawn, shaded family gathering area and signature art. 
The plaza makeover is the anchor of the Adelante initiative, which includes other components:

Before the year’s end, project leaders expect to have secured a site in the district for a multi-tier parking garage, with ground floor retailers, that will more than replace parking currently at the plaza lot. 
Following that will come new sidewalk, streetscape and wayfinding improvements along the main 24th Street corridor to help create a uniform vibe from Q to F Streets, Lopez said.

Lopez said her organization is hoping to raise additional funds for other improvements to the corridor, including a building that would house the LEDC, employment and other programming.
Overseeing the Adelante II redevelopment is Canopy South, a nonprofit that calls itself a “community quarterback.” 
In addition to the 24th Street area improvements, Canopy South is leading the Q Street Collaborative initiative, which received a separate $39 million from the North and South Omaha recovery grant program for several other projects in South Omaha. 
In all, the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in January 2024 awarded 130 groups and businesses a total of nearly $235 million through the North and South Omaha grant program. 
Cesar Garcia, CEO of Canopy South, said the City of Omaha is handling the acquisition of Adelante’s new garage site that is to offer parking for shoppers and workers of the area. He said choices have been narrowed to a few and negotiations are ongoing.
He said the plaza is a city-owned public space and will remain so once the plaza is revamped. Programming at the plaza likely will be a collaboration between the city and community organizations, Garcia said, though details are being worked out.

Also speaking at the Friday event was Douglas County Board Chair Roger Garcia; Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert; Omaha Public Power District CEO Javier Fernandez; South Omaha Business Improvement District President Ross Pesek; Nebraska Department of Economic Development’s Javier Saldaña and LEDC President Armando Salgado.
Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca, former State Sen. Tony Vargas and Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes were among several dozen people who gathered at the plaza for entertainment by Mariachi music and dancers. 
Among others were City Councilmen Pete Festersen and Ron Hug;  U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.; Denise Powell, who has announced her candidacy for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District as a Democrat; merchants and community members.
“The Latino community is at the heart of South Omaha’s story, and today we celebrate that legacy,” said Canopy South’s Garcia, stressing that the improvements are for all of Omaha and tourists to enjoy. 
“This is about investing in places that create the future we want for generations to come.”

Georgia chair because he has experience running in statewide elections and an ability to rally donors. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder (File)The Democratic Party of Georgia is set to elect a new state chair on Saturday to compete against Republican-controlled state and federal governments.
A new leader will be selected by the Georgia Democrats to replace Atlanta U.S. Representative Nikema Williams, who resigned in March following internal pressure from key members of her party, including U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff, who expressed doubts about her ability to devote sufficient attention to promoting the party’s platform.
Ossoff plans a bid to retain his Senate seat in 2026 and he expressed his desire for a change in party leadership after the Democrats’ poor performance up and down the ballot in last year’s election. 
President Donald Trump’s administration’s reshaping of the White House agenda looms large in the wake of his return to office, which raises questions about the role of Democratic party leadership in winning close elections.
Seven candidates are competing for the Democratic Party of Georgia chair and plan to deliver speeches in Atlanta seeking support for their bid to lead a party that recently enjoyed historical success with two Democratic senators winning the 2020 election as well as the state’s pivotal role in putting former President Joe Biden in the White House.
The field of candidates hoping to lead Georgia Democrats includes Gwinnett County state Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, former Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis and Rome City Councilwoman Wendy Davis, and perceived frontrunner Charley Bailey, a former candidate for attorney general and lieutenant governor.
The current party chair Matthew Wilson said Democrats are excited about the state committee meeting on Saturday. 
He said they have seven great candidates running for chair, a treasurer’s race, and other votes to determine key strategies. 
“The party is primed to stand up against Republican policies rolling out from Washington, D.C.“The benefit to being a big tent party like the Democratic Party is  that we have lots of different voices from all corners of the political spectrum. We’ve got conservatives, we have moderates, we have liberals, we have progressives, and it is going to be a big job for the new chair to make sure that we are united moving forward in a strategy that centers, again, what matters most, and that’s electoral victories,” Wilson said.
The 2026 election will include races for the 236-member General Assembly, U.S. Senate as well as constitutional officers including governor after Republican Brian Kemp is ineligible for a third term.
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said there is a built-in advantage for incumbent state officials since 2023 legislation allows top Georgia lawmakers to set up their own political action committees during the legislative session.
Democrats have signaled the importance of the next chair by making it a full-time role, especially with many statewide positions and key Senate races up for grabs in Georgia, Bullock said.
The success of Democratic candidates will depend on their ability to coalesce behind a strong candidate and avoid bitter primaries, he said. 
“Its potentially going to be a big year in Georgia giving  Democrats a shot at winning some of the statewide constitutional offices,”. “They haven’t won an open seat statewide constitutional office in this century.”
Bailey is the perceived favorite to become the next party chair because he has experience running in statewide elections and an ability to rally donors by not having certain skeletons that would be easy for Republicans to take advantage of, Bullock said.
“He can learn from the challenges that he had to overcome as a candidate,” Bullock said. “ He is advising others who maybe have not had the kind of scrutiny that a person gets when they start running statewide so he can give advice in terms of here’s some things you don’t want to say you believe in.”
Brian Robinson, a Georgia Republican strategist, said Democratic candidates will need to overcome the perception that Georgia is well-run by Republicans. Democrats could sway voters by taking advantage of national issues such as Trump’s poor approval ratings on the economy as he’s followed through on plans to impose steep tariffs. 
A new Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that a majority of registered Georgia voters currently disapprove of Trump’s policies on the economy, tariffs, NATO and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs. The poll, however, revealed the support for Trump’s policies were sharply partisan, with 85% of surveyed Republicans approving compared to 97% of Democrats opposed.
“Republicans in Georgia are going into 2026 with a lot of things out of their control,” Robinson said.  They’re going to  nee focus on the things they can control: get out to vote, raise money, and pick candidates who can win. But we know that there’s a headwind for the party in the White House.”
“If Trump’s approval rating is the low 40s or high 30s, that’s a prime opportunity for Democrats in the state, if they can have discipline to pick good candidates who don’t scare the middle, don’t scare independents, and can win (support) from some swing voters in the metro Atlanta area,” Robinson said.
The big question for 2026 is whether Kemp enters the GOP field of potential challengers to Ossoff’s re-election bid.
“Is Brian Kemp heads and tails the best choice for Republicans as the most competitive candidate?” Robinson asked. “Yes, absolutely and anybody who says different is not a serious person to talk about politics.”
“But that second tier of GOP candidates will become the first tier at that juncture,” Robinson said. “They will get nominated, and they will have a lot of money behind them from a lot of organizations.”
State Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones, an Augusta Democrat, said the next party chair needs to be able to work closely with the local parties. 
“I think the key is to work with the county parties and make sure you have a good brand name as far as 2026 is concerned,” the Augusta Democrat said. “ I think all of them are basically committed to that.”
Sandy Springs Democratic Sen. Josh McLaurin is optimistic about the party having a groundswell of support for officials fighting for party ideals. 
“They want to see energy, the Democratic base does, from its leadership, because what we don’t want is to treat this like it’s just normal politics, like the Trump deportations and the tariffs and all of this is just kind of business as usual,” McLaurin said.

Community groups, labor unions, student and faith communities rallied across Vermont and around the nation on May Day, commemorated as international workers’ day in a demonstration of mass solidarity.

Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerWILLISTON — Immigrant rights, trans rights, worker rights and support for Palestinians were forefront at a May Day rally in Williston Thursday evening. Organizers estimated 2,500 people marched to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s facility on Harvest Lane and then to Hannaford Supermarket in a peaceful protest that condemned recent actions of President Donald Trump’s administration.“I’m here because I believe in social justice and human rights,” said Joanna Cole, a former state representative who lives in Shelburne. She came to participate in the rally with her partner, Sarah Flynn, outside the ICE facility.“I do not want any immigrants forced out, especially illegally,” she said, referring to recent student arrests and ICE raids in Vermont. “I think it’s horrible so many people are being kidnapped off the street and being thrown in jail.”“It smacks of Hitler in Germany and of McCarthyism in the U.S. and I don’t want to be any part of it,” Cole added.Community groups, labor unions, student and faith communities rallied across Vermont and around the nation on May Day, commemorated as international workers’ day in a demonstration of mass solidarity.From the ICE data center in Williston to the Statehouse in Montpelier and beyond, Vermonters denounced “billionaire profiteers” and actions of the Trump administration that has launched a concerted effort to dismantle government and the rights of workers, immigrants and other vulnerable groups nationwide.As Cole spoke, drumbeats and chants on Williston Road heralded the arrival of a large march organized by Migrant Justice joined by multiple labor and advocacy organizations. “An injury to one is an injury to all,” read the handmade banner held by three people up front flanked by another three people holding Palestinian flags and one waving the stars and stripes.“We are here at ICE, the same people who took our brother Mohsen, who we freed yesterday,” said an organizer wearing a red and white kaffiyeh, a scarf often worn to show solidarity with Palestinians.During a speech she called for “No ICE and no deportations” amid loud cheers outside the red brick federal building where a handful of federal workers stood guard in full uniform with marked cars during the peaceful rally.Student supporters, hospital union leaders, a representative from Vermonters for Justice in Palestine and another from the FreeHer campaign gave short speeches in front of the federal building, punctuated by drum beats, chants and cheering from the large group.Jacob Berkowitz, president of UVMMC Support Staff United at the University of Vermont Medical Center, said he joined the rally to “stand up and speak for those that cannot,” such as immigrant workers, those who are poor and those who face violence everyday.
While Trump has been in power for just more than 100 days, his mass deportation plan has had significant impact in Vermont, from the recent arrest of eight migrant dairy workers at Berkshire and the detainment of a Palestinian student in Colchester to revoking the legal statuses of some resettled groups, freezing funding for refugee support and jeopardizing local jobs. And it continues to try to prevent a detained Tufts student’s return to Vermont.“This lays bare a fundamental truth. Prisons and police have always been weapons of class warfare,” said Jonathan Elwell, an organizer from FreeHer Vermont, a prison abolition group, in a brief speech. “No matter how hard the goons who run them try to frame prisons as apolitical tools of public safety or spout progressive promises of rehabilitation, we know the truth. They are always deployed against those who are dispossessed, differentiated or dissident.”Protesters waved signs signaling their opposition to Trump, ICE, prisons, capitalism, the muzzling of free speech and democracy: ‘Power to the workers, not the billionaires,’ ‘ICE is terrorism,’ ‘Respect the Constitution.’ ‘Good dogs eat fascists,’ read a cardboard sign attached to a brown dog’s harness.“I’m making it a point to go to a lot of protests just because I do not like what the Trump administration is doing. I am especially upset about deportations without a trial,” said Monica Hawkes, who came from Jeffersonville to join the Williston protest.Continuing on, the march ended around the boundaries of the Hannaford Supermarket on Marshall Avenue around 8 p.m., with Migrant Justice advocates and allies demanding the grocery chain join the Milk With Dignity campaign in a continued effort to fight for the rights of farmworkers.Migrant Justice launched the campaign in 2019 to promote fair wages and dignity on farms and demands that Hannaford improve conditions on the farms that supply its dairy products. The nonprofit representing immigrant farmworkers statewide filed a complaint in the Netherlands last month outlining human rights violations in Hannaford’s supply chain. The U.S. grocery chain is a subsidiary of Ahold Delhaize, a Dutch-Belgian multinational company. “I think a huge place that unites us is that we are all working people and we are powerful if we are in solidarity,” said Bex Love from Northfield.Love sported black-and-white cow print and helped hold up a towering makeshift white cow, made to support Milk With Dignity, with her friend Izzy de Buy Wenniger, of Burlington, at the picket line near the grocery store. There, security guards blocked marchers from going on the property.On the sidewalk outside, speakers once again lined up to share their thoughts.Thousands in Williston marched in support of immigrant and farmworker rights on May Day 2025. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDigger“Under Donald Trump, our lives are under attack,” said a Franklin County farmworker who identified herself as Maribel. Her comments, spoken in Spanish, were translated by Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice. Despite working long, hard hours, farmworkers like herself are not given the dignity of a fair wage, health care or safe housing, Maribel added, and corporations like Hannaford continue to exploit them.As she called for solidarity on the packed sidewalk in the fading light of the waning day, allies applauded, a child drummed on an upside down paint bucket, and a passing car honked in support.Read the story on VTDigger here:  From ICE to Hannaford: Vermonters rally on May Day for human rights and social justice amid escalating Trump administration attacks, rollbacks.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/May-Day-2025-1-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 20:03:59.962112

Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, talk while walking in the hall of the Capitol on May 1, 2025. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers on Friday approved an Ethics Commission budget full of major policy changes — though they abandoned a controversial proposal that would have imposed a deadline for ethics complaints.
The budget, totaling nearly $1.4 million, was forwarded to both chambers for a vote that morning following final amendments from a six-member conference committee. The Senate approved the budget by a 44-2 vote, while the House passed it 71-19.
The Ethics Commission sought money in Senate Bill 2004 for a fourth staff member for the 2025-2027 budget cycle, which the Legislature ultimately rejected. That employee would have focused on education and communications. The Senate initially approved the request, setting aside $250,000 for a two-year salary, benefits as well as other costs. The House later axed this funding — a move the conference committee sustained.
Legislators did agree to fund a $50,000 case management system to help the commission track filings, which staff say will help them work more efficiently.
Other noteworthy provisions in the budget include a handful of changes intended to fix bottlenecks in the Ethics Commission’s complaint process.
Some lawmakers who worked on the budget this session complained that the commission sometimes takes years to resolve complaints. Some complaints are more than two years old.
Meanwhile, the commission has received a flood of new filings since Jan. 1. As of April 28, the board had received 68 complaints since the start of 2025. That’s more than the commission received in all of 2024.
Some, though not all, of the policy changes in the budget were originally proposed in bills that died earlier this session, like House Bill 1360 and House Bill 1505.
Generally, the Ethics Commission is opposed to adding policy into the budget bill, said Executive Director Rebecca Binstock. She said she worries some of the provisions will add red tape to the commission’s work, though she expects at least a few to help the board’s work go more smoothly.
“The commission’s position has always been that we prefer a clean budget,” Binstock said.
Ethics commissioners say bill would impose an arbitrary cutoff for investigations

One provision in the bill approved Friday would allow the commission to informally settle ethics complaints directly with the accused. Previously, the commission could only act as a mediator to broker informal resolutions between the accused and the filer — which sometimes doesn’t work if that filer’s demands were unrealistic. The commission must attempt to mediate between both parties first, however.
Another requires the commission to develop time management standards for processing complaints, which Binstock said the commission supports and wanted to pursue anyway.
Until Thursday, the budget included a mandate for the Ethics Commission to dismiss complaints after 180 days. It was added as part of an amendment brought by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, who said it is needed to make sure the commission’s investigations don’t drag on indefinitely.
“It’s just a matter of fairness to the accused,” Nathe said previously. “They shouldn’t have to sit there with this hanging over their head for years at a time.”
The Ethics Commission opposed the six-month window as a threat to its work, arguing that many complaints cannot be effectively probed within that timeframe and that it would incentivize people accused of ethics violations to obstruct investigations to run out the clock.
In place of the deadline, the conference committee added a clause that states an individual accused of a violation may petition the commission at any time to dismiss the complaint against them. The Ethics Commission will have to draft a policy implementing this language.
Some lawmakers said the root of the commission’s backlog of complaints stems from a lack of resources, and that the budget does not address this problem.
Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, unsuccessfully brought a budget amendment to more than double the commission’s staff, arguing that the funding is necessary for the body to do its job effectively.
“I think the activity thus far indicates that we have a lack in that we don’t have another staff person,” Mathern said on the floor Friday. “However, we’ve made some progress, and hopefully by the next time we meet next session, we can get that other staff person to help us all do a great job.”
Voters created an ethics commission in North Dakota. Then the Legislature limited its power.

A separate amendment brought by Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo, requires the commission to publish an annual report providing details about its work, including the number of complaints filed and what the commission has done to resolve them.
The bill also allows people accused of violations to discuss complaints against them.
Another section protects lawmakers from being prosecuted with a conflict of interest crime for voting on bills so long as they observe the proper legislative conflict of interest rules or heed the informal advice of an Ethics Commission staff member.
The bill advances to Gov. Kelly Armstrong for his consideration.

Nevada was awarded about $15 million in funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) this year, but had not received the remaining 10% of its allocated funding before the Trump administration fired every employee responsible for administering the funds.
The Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday they would release the nearly $400 million in LIHEAP utility assistance funding that had not yet been distributed to states by Thursday.
“I am committed to ensuring that our programs run efficiently. With today’s announcement, all available LIHEAP funding for this fiscal year will be released. We will continue to work with our state, tribal, and territorial partners to ensure this funding reaches eligible families,” said Andrew Gradison, Acting Assistant Secretary for Children and Families.
Utility advocates and Democrats in Congress raised the alarm about last month, warning that the gutting of federal workers and the program could leave the funds in limbo.
After news of the mass firing last month, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen and several other Democratic senators sent a letter to HHS demanding the agency release all of the LIHEAP funds that Congress has appropriated.
“By terminating all 23 employees tasked with overseeing LIHEAP, it is now unclear how these funds will be administered. In our view, that is unacceptable,” read the letter. “Failure to disburse these funds constitutes an illegal impoundment of bipartisan, congressionally appropriated funds and will put the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in America at risk.”
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program received more than half its funding from LIHEAP last year, making it a vital source of utility assistance funding for the state.
Last year, Nevada received more than $17 million in LIHEAP funding to help 12,000 low-income households in the state keep their power on. A portion of those funds were also used to help low-income households pay for upgrades that improve energy efficiency and lower power bills in the long term.
The Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program paid out another $13.8 million in benefits last year from state revenue generated from Nevada’s Universal Energy Charge which helped another nearly 6,000 households pay their utilities. 
Still, as temperatures rise there is a growing demand for utility assistance funding in the state. Nearly 32,000 Nevadans had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to data from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
In Southern Nevada, where temperatures reached 100 degrees or higher for 64 consecutive days in 2024, air conditioning is a life-saving necessity.
The state’s ability to provide energy assistance could be reduced even more in 2026, as LIHEAP was among 60 programs President Donald Trump asked Congress to defund in a budget request Friday.
Nevada’s Energy Assistance Program begins July 1st and applications are accepted through June 30th. Applications are evaluated year round or until funding is exhausted. Eligible households receive an annual, one-time per year benefit customarily paid directly to their energy provider.
Those interested in applying for LIHEAP can visit energyhelp.us or call the National Energy Assistance Referral (NEAR) hotline toll-free at: 1-866-674-6327.  
Households can easily identify if they may be eligible for assistance by using the LIHEAP Eligibility Tool on energyhelp.us.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thermostat-1024x735.jpeg,,,2025-05-02 20:03:59.962112

‘Penguin Day’ returns to the Capitol
Just before gaveling into session on Monday, state lawmakers had a chance to meet with a delegation of visitors from South Africa — by way of Mystic.
Green/blue and Blue/blue, two African penguins from the Mystic Aquarium, served as animal ambassadors for the aquarium’s annual “Penguin Day” at the state Capitol. The names of the pair derive from colored beads on their wings that staff use to identify individual birds.
Each of the penguins took turns with a caretaker outside of their mobile enclosure, posing for pictures with staff and lawmakers. Petting was not permitted, for the animal’s safety. State Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, beamed as she leaned in for an up-close greeting with Green/blue. “What a great day,” she exclaimed.
Welander said her eldest son, who recently graduated high school, is planning to study marine biology in college. “If I missed Penguin Day, he’d never forgive me.”
The penguins’ visit also offers aquarium staff a chance to engage with lawmakers about various legislative issues and to raise awareness for their animal rescue program. Lobbyists for the aquarium were also on hand, answering questions and snapping photos.
“We advocate for a lot of the positive environmental measures, things like decreasing plastic pollution, public education, encouraging public advocacy and responsible environmental stewardship along the coastlines,” said Allison Tuttle, the aquarium’s chief zoological officer.
While wild penguins live almost exclusively south of the equator, Mystic’s animal rescue program fields over 100 calls each year for stranded seals, sea turtles and other marine animals in Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York.

Special Education
The Special Education Committee on Tuesday approved two identical bills that would adjust the funding model for special education across the state and provide more oversight of the programs.
The bills are the newly formed committee’s signature pieces of legislation this session and aim to address what districts say is a lack of state investment in special education and problems for students in the programs. The committee passed a House and Senate bill, which will next be considered by the Education Committee. Lawmakers will decide later which is the best avenue for passage.
The bills had some changes following a public hearing last month. The Office of the Child Advocate would have a bigger role in oversight of special education programs and cost-setting. The costs would also be set on an individualized rate rather than a universal rate. A previous moratorium on new special education providers has been removed, and there is a requirement for the state to conduct randomized audits of restraint and seclusion use for special education students.

Gun violence prevention
U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal held a press conference Friday after President Donald Trump removed federal funding for programs supporting gun violence prevention. Though Connecticut gun reform and mental health organizations are not currently on the list of programs that are receiving the funding cuts, Murphy and Blumenthal expressed concern that funding removal could affect Connecticut.
“You are not serving any constituency by cutting funding to these groups,” Murphy said, adding, “We are going to litigate this issue.”
They were joined by Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, Rev. Henry Brown of Mothers United Against Violence, a gun violence support group, and Andrew Woods and Johanna Schubert of Hartford Communities that Care, a nonprofit focused on community support and violence prevention.
“This is a defunding of public safety in communities like Hartford,” Arulampalam said, adding “any one shooting in the city is too many.”

Contraception for minors
The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill enabling minors to receive contraceptives, prenatal care and pain management during labor without the consent of an adult. The bill has undergone significant changes since its original draft, which was met with fierce criticism by organizations like the Family Institute of Connecticut. Originally, the bill would have removed state regulations on abortions and abortion clinics — which, among other things, required doctors to report data on abortions to the state, prohibited third trimester abortions and allowed healthcare providers to refuse to perform an abortion for moral or religious reasons. All of these provisions were removed.
“There is no longer anything about abortion in this particular bill,” Democratic Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey of Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said Thursday. McCarthy Vahey cited the 2023 Connecticut school health survey, which shows that 28% of high schoolers have had sexual intercourse. While over half used a condom, only 1 in 10 used both a condom and some form of contraception.
Rep. Nicole Klarides-Ditria, R-Seymour, said the goal of the bill was to ensure that young people could get medical care without being afraid of repercussions. “I would venture to say this bill is going to prevent pregnancies. It will prevent abortions because it’s going to enable our minors to get contraception to prevent pregnancies,” she said.
The bill also precludes medical personnel from sharing information about the services a minor received without the consent of the minor patient. Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said the bill’s open-ended language could open the door to preventing doctors from sharing information about other issues. He proposed an amendment that would require a parent or guardian — or, in some cases, another trusted adult over the age of 21 — to be notified after a minor received an abortion. The amendment was rejected, and the bill was adopted 117-27.

Birthing centers
The House this week voted to pass a bill that requires the state’s Office of Health Strategy to craft a strategic plan for increasing the number of birthing centers and hospitals in areas with high percentages of Medicaid recipients and limited access to facilities.
The OHS commissioner must report to legislators by Jan. 1, 2027 on recommendations and state appropriations needed to stand up more birthing centers and hospitals in underserved areas.
An amendment adopted during the bill’s debate eliminated a mandate that the state Department of Social Services increase Medicaid reimbursement for doulas as part of the Connecticut’s bundled maternity payments.
The issue of maintaining or adding birthing services in underserved areas has received considerable attention. In late 2023, state officials approved the closure of Windham Hospital’s labor and delivery unit, ending a three-year saga that pitted community members against one of Connecticut’s largest health systems. A study this year concluded that opening a freestanding birthing center in that area is not feasible because there isn’t enough demand to sustain it.
In 2023, the legislature passed a law to allow freestanding birth centers in the state, and to date there is just one, located in Danbury. Each center needs about 115 annual births to break even and 500 births to be financially viable, according to industry benchmarks.

McCoy, 37 — who has been staying off the streets by sleeping in a blue bus offered by the Nomad Alliance, a nonprofit that helps unsheltered Utahns — said he was recently diagnosed with a lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He’s been told that he has maybe five to 10 years left to live, “and there’s no cure for it,” he said, so all he can do is focus on medical treatment that helps him stay comfortable through the remainder of his life.  
“If I were to lose my Medicaid, pardon my language, but there’s no way in hell I’d be able to afford any of that,” he said. “I’ve been on the streets my entire adult life. … I have a hard enough time trying to feed myself.” 
Friday’s public hearing at the Multi-Agency State Office Building in  Salt Lake City was the first of two scheduled as part of a 30-day public comment period the state officials are required to hold before submitting a proposed waiver to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in June. 
Advocates sound alarm as Utah looks to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion

That waiver, as currently drafted, would ask President Donald Trump’s administration to allow Utah to reinstate work requirements on the state’s Medicaid expansion program. Currently, about 75,000 adult Utahns are enrolled in the state’s expansion program, which allows Medicaid eligibility to Utahns whose annual income is up to 133% of the federal poverty level (roughly $20,800 for an individual or $42,760 for a family of four, according to national thresholds). 
The waiver would permit a list of exemptions to the work requirement, excluding those working at least 30 hours a week, those who are 60 or older, pregnant, physically or mentally unable to meet the requirements, parents with a child dependent under the age of 6, among others. And it would allow Medicaid recipients to claim “good cause” for circumstances not on the exemptions list, such as hospitalization or a death in the family, according to state officials. 
However, of those 75,000 adults enrolled, an estimated 7,900 would not fall under an exemption and would be subject to work requirements if the state submits the waiver and it’s approved by federal officials. That means those 7,900 could lose their Medicaid coverage if they don’t start working or submit documentation to the state that they’re applying for at least 48 jobs during a three-month period. 
Along with McCoy, concerned Utahns and low-income advocates came to Friday’s public hearing to express concerns about the Utah Department of Health and Human Services’s decision to re-submit the Medicaid work requirement waiver. 
Previously, when the state’s first waiver was submitted in 2020, the work requirement was approved at the time under Trump’s first administration, but just months later it was suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in 2021, when Utah’s waiver was up for renewal, former President Joe Biden’s administration required the state to remove that work requirement.

Now, with Trump back in the Oval Office, Utah DHHS agency leaders have decided to resubmit it. The move adds Utah to the list of states looking to impose work requirements on certain Medicaid recipients under a Republican-controlled Congress and Trump, wanting to encourage people to find work and reduce their reliance on public assistance. 
However, several low-income advocates told state officials during Friday’s hearing that mandating work requirements on vulnerable populations — especially those who are medically frail or experiencing homelessness — would at best saddle them with unnecessary paperwork they don’t have time for and at worst cause them to lose their medical care. 
Kseniya Kniazeva, founder and president of Nomad Alliance, said many of the homeless Utahns her nonprofit helps rely on Medicaid coverage. 
“Without Medicaid, they would suffer,” she said, worrying that imposing work requirements would mean the difference between life and death for many of Utah’s homeless. 
“The population that I serve cannot work 30 hours a week while they’re on the streets,” she said. “If they could, they would get a job and they would get health care through their job. That’s why Medicaid is here, it’s for people who cannot work because they have chronic health conditions or mental health conditions.”  
Kniazeva said for many Utahns experiencing homelessness, almost all of their energy is spent on dealing with keeping a roof over their head and staying safe and healthy — not looking for a job or jumping through administrative hoops to keep health care coverage.

“We cannot remove crucial health care for this population,” she said. “Forcing them to apply to 48 jobs in a three-month period? … When their whole entire life is consumed by trying to find food and water and a bathroom today, how are you supposed to think about applying for jobs so you can keep your medical care?” 
Most of them don’t even have phones, she said, let alone access to a computer. 
“For the love of God, please,” Kniazeva said. “This is not what Jesus would do.”
Stephanie Burdick, consumer representative on the state’s Medical Care Advisory Committee, said even though the state’s proposed waiver includes a list of exemptions, still requiring Utahns to prove they qualify for an exemption creates too many administrative obstacles for vulnerable populations. 
“This mass surveillance of poor people and mass surveillance of sick people, it infringes on basic American rights,” Burdick said, her voice straining with emotion. “Why should they have to prove to you that their health conditions meet your definition (of qualifying for a work requirement exemption)?”
Burdick questioned why the Utah DHHS is moving forward with re-submitting the waiver when it has not received a new mandate from state legislators to do so. If state leaders really want to increase employment for Utahns, she said they should focus on voluntary job programs, not make health care coverage contingent.
“Do not force this kind of government bureaucracy on Utahns’ health care,” she said. 
Jennifer Strohecker, the state’s Medicaid director, repeatedly thanked those who attended Friday’s meeting and said their input would help inform the final version of the state’s waiver application. 
“These enrich our process and allow us to really consider multiple angles when evaluating this policy proposal,” she said. 
Friday wasn’t the only opportunity for Utahns to weigh in to the proposed waiver. There’s another public hearing scheduled for May 14 at 4 p.m.. at the Multi-Agency State Office Building, located at 195 N. 1950 West in Salt Lake City. Utahns can also submit comments on the state’s website or email them to Medicaid1115waiver@utah.gov.

Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan died Friday morning at 91, more than two decades after leaving office for the last time and 12 years after his release from federal prison.

He died just one day after being put into hospice care in his native Kankakee.

Ryan, a Republican, served  one term as governor from 1999 to 2003, and spent the last decade or so of his life speaking about and ultimately writing a book on his 2000 decision to put a moratorium on Illinois’ death penalty and then commuting the sentences of 167 death row inmates in the state’s prison system to life sentences.

“I can’t really believe that there’s ever gonna be a system devised where an innocent person couldn’t be executed,” Ryan told Capitol News Illinois in a 2020 interview. “You gotta have a perfect law if you’re gonna have ... death as a penalty. So I just figured the best way to do it was to do away with that opportunity.”

But Ryan’s time as governor — and his entire 35-year career in politics — was ultimately overshadowed by his time as secretary of state in the 1990s. During his two terms leading that office, Ryan oversaw a license-for-bribes scheme that led to the deaths of six children in a fiery vehicle explosion and 79 federal indictments, including his own.

Before that, Ryan served as lieutenant governor alongside Gov. Jim Thompson, whose law firm would later represent Ryan pro bono in his corruption case. He also spent two years as Illinois House speaker, capping a decade in the General Assembly.

A pharmacist by trade, Ryan began his political career in the late 1960s on the Kankakee County Board.

License-for-bribes conviction

The former governor spent nearly six years in prison and on home confinement after his 2006 conviction on corruption charges stemming from an investigation into a freak accident on a Milwaukee expressway in 1994.

The Willis family, who’d been driving from Chicago to a vacation in Wisconsin, were engulfed in flames when their minivan exploded after a taillight fell off a semitrailer truck and punctured the van’s fuel tank. The explosion killed the six Willis children, while the Rev. Duane Willis and his wife Janet were badly burned.

An investigation into the crash revealed that other motorists had tried to warn the semi driver about the dangling vehicle part, but he didn’t understand English, even though federal law requires truck drivers be proficient in English to get a commercial license.

After Wisconsin authorities passed along the information to the Secretary of State’s office, an internal investigation found the truck driver may have paid a bribe to get his license. But Ryan squashed the probe and fired the investigators.

The feds, however, picked up the investigation while Ryan was running for governor, finding a systematic operation in which bribes paid for commercial driver’s licenses were funneled into Ryan’s campaign fund.

Even as secretary of state employees were being indicted in what came to be known as Operation Safe Roads, Ryan claimed to know nothing about the scheme and was elected governor over Democratic then-U.S. Rep. Glenn Poshard in 1998.

But as the investigation reached a fever pitch and the cloud of suspicion over Ryan grew, he chose to not run for a second term as governor in 2002. That paved the way for Democrat Rod Blagojevich’s victory over Republican Jim Ryan, who suffered from sharing a surname and party with the then-governor.

Ryan was indicted in 2004, convicted in 2006 after a lengthy trial and went to prison in 2007 following a monthslong appeals process, making him the third Illinois governor to serve time. Several years later, Blagojevich would follow.

Death penalty moratorium

Since his 2013 release from prison and subsequent stint on home confinement, Ryan dedicated the last years of his life returning to a subject he’d become passionate about as governor: the death penalty.

Ryan parlayed his speaking engagements into a book, co-authored with a former Chicago Tribune reporter and published in 2020. The book, titled “Until I Could Be Sure: How I Stopped the Death Penalty in Illinois,” detailed the former governor’s debates and deliberations leading up to his decision to put a moratorium on the state’s death penalty in January 2000.

Just before leaving office three years later, Ryan commuted the death sentences of 167 Illinois prisoners, which garnered international attention.

Ryan’s ascent to the governor’s office coincided with emerging DNA evidence technology and a wave of exonerations across the country, including in Illinois. The state would later become known as an outlier for false confessions and exonerations. But at the time, Ryan’s stance was controversial in a tough-on-crime era of politics.

In his 2020 interview with CNI, Ryan said the majority of his staff tried to dissuade him from making moves on the death penalty, which wouldn’t be officially abolished in Illinois until 2011.

But Ryan said the uncertainty of decisions made under the death penalty system bothered him, especially in the wake of the exoneration of death row inmate Anthony Porter in February 1999, when Ryan was a month into his term as governor. Porter was freed after journalism students at Northwestern University uncovered evidence of his innocence.

“The whole system was just prone with error,” Ryan said. “It’s just — you got error in every corner.”

Former Illinois House GOP Leader Jim Durkin, who in 2023 stepped down from the post Ryan held decades before, told CNI he’d gotten to know the former governor better in his later years through Ryan’s son Homer.

Durkin said when he’d meet up with the Ryans in Kankakee while campaigning for fellow House Republicans, their lunches would often be punctuated by locals who'd wanted to say, “‘Hello, governor’ — not ‘Hello, George’ ... They loved him.”

“He made a mistake and he did his time,” Durkin said. “And he didn’t express or show any bitterness toward anyone involved in his case. Just wanted to get on with his life. That shows a strong man who takes responsibility.”

Illinois Senate Minority Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, echoed Durkin’s accolades that Ryan was a “master of bridging the gap” both between Republicans and Democrats and between organized labor and management.

“He was a bold leader who wasn’t afraid to reach across the aisle and bring people together for the greater good,” Curran said. “His investments in infrastructure, technology, and education to help create a brighter future for Illinois will long be remembered.”

State attorneys general are urging concerned customers to delete their data, while experts warn that state and federal laws may not fully protect their privacy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The fate of more than 15 million customers’ genetic data remains in limbo after popular DNA testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy in March. The data is up for sale, stoking fears about how it might be used and prompting attorneys general from more than a dozen states to warn 23andMe users: Delete your data.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said in a March statement.
“You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.
23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”
 HIPAA doesn’t help

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year, and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.
 What states are doing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.
Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

Phil Pouech, D-Hinesburg, speaks as the House Transportation Committee takes testimony at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, February 12, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIdaho is not a place, as far as I know, that comes up in the Vermont Statehouse all that often. But the House Transportation Committee has been considering a proposal first enacted in that state — and that supporters here say would make it safer to ride bicycles in busy areas.Rep. Phil Pouech, D-Hinesburg, is urging his fellow committee members to add language into this year’s miscellaneous motor vehicle bill that would allow cyclists to treat stop signs like yield signs — essentially, letting them coast through intersections when no drivers or pedestrians are present. The policy is often called an “Idaho stop,” because the Gem State (yes, that’s what they call it) was the first in the country to put such an idea on the books. Today, 11 states have enacted similar laws, according to Local Motion, a Burlington-based advocacy organization for cyclists.Pouech’s amendment would also allow bikers to follow pedestrian signals, instead of normal traffic lights, at intersections. Both that measure, and the “Idaho stop,” were part of companion House and Senate bills introduced earlier this year that have not advanced on their own. The motor vehicle bill, S.123, has already cleared the Senate and is now being considered in House Transportation. On Friday, the panel heard from several witnesses who said they support tacking Pouech’s proposal onto the DMV bill, which is one of the “must-pass” bills each year. Jonathon Weber, programs director for Local Motion, told the committee many cyclists already do what the amendment proposes to legalize because they know that it makes them safer.Following pedestrian signals allows cyclists to clear through intersections before vehicles start moving, reducing the likelihood of crashes, he said. Meanwhile, he said, letting cyclists avoid stopping at an intersection — and in many cases, avoid having to unclip their shoes from their pedals as a result — would also reduce the time that they spend in such crash-prone areas. Weber pointed to research published last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation, which found that existing stop-as-yield laws were associated with reduced crash rates, particularly at intersections in suburban communities.“We believe that Vermonters shouldn’t have to break the law in order to perform a safe and helpful behavior out on the streets,” he said Friday.Much of the language in the annual DMV bill is proposed by the state Agency of Transportation — and the legislation contains many relatively minor changes to motor vehicle laws. The agency isn’t taking a position either for or against Pouech’s proposal, he said Friday.House Transportation is expected to take up the issue again Tuesday, he said, when it could vote on his amendment and then on the bill as a whole.— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowAbout 95% of people incarcerated in Vermont will one day leave prison.

Along with creating new state-level flood response and preparedness and responsibilities, the bill has a variety of measures geared toward helping those communities keep as much of their revenue as possible.The bill would also create a new “municipal grand list stabilization fund,” which for five years would reimburse municipalities for lost property taxes on flood buyouts, since properties purchased by communities for flood mitigation or recovery represent a loss in potential property tax revenue. It also puts in place a new state-led flood buyout program to replace or add onto the flood buyouts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Another provision would allow communities to keep a larger percentage of their local options tax, 75% rather than 70%, Waszazak said.

At an ecosystem meeting, officials explain that progress and decisions about continued protections have been put on hold pending confirmation of Brian Nesvik, Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  
The post Yellowstone grizzly managers — dispersed and reduced by DOGE — shine little light on delisting battle appeared first on WyoFile[...]","CODY—Two days of discussion about the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population passed before anyone inquired about the status of the species the meeting was focused on. 
Under a court order in January, the Biden administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service proposed continuing with Endangered Species Act protections in the Yellowstone region and all other portions of the Lower 48 where grizzlies reside. Shortly thereafter, pro-delisting leadership was installed by the Trump administration: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s now nominated to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
For months, there’s been little official word about what’s going on with Fish and Wildlife’s proposal, though the agency delayed the deadline for the public to provide feedback. In Cody this week, the topic was barely broached at the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s semi-annual Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee meeting. It only came up because a member of the public, local resident Dewey Vanderhoff, asked “where we’re at in the overall picture with delisting” during the meeting’s closing minutes.

Hilary Cooley, Fish and Wildlife’s grizzly bear recovery coordinator, pointed out the proposal on the table — and said she couldn’t say much more. 
“As far as what happens with that proposal, we’re waiting for leadership to be installed,” Cooley said. “Acting leadership is not interested in making decisions right now.” 
As of Friday, 27 pending nominees appeared above Nesvik on the U.S. Senate’s Executive Calendar, which suggests the wait could drag on. The Trump administration also appointed another Wyomingite — mule deer advocate Josh Coursey — to a high Fish and Wildlife Service post, albeit one that doesn’t require Senate confirmation. 
Even if expected Fish and Wildlife Service leaders don’t attempt to pull back the existing continued-listing proposal administratively, legislative efforts are underway to delist grizzly bears, including from Rep. Harriet Hageman.

Wyoming-sanctioned grizzly hunting bill fails to overcome concerns about Endangered Species Act violations 



The gathering of Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear managers in Cody differed from typical meetings because of the turmoil and turnover the Trump administration has brought to the federal government via its Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Most federal members of the committee attended remotely due to travel and spending restrictions. There were also new faces, goodbyes and discussion about what the diminished Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team can realistically accomplish going forward. 
“One way or another, the USGS is not going to have the resources they’ve had in the past,” Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Administrator Ken McDonald told the group. “At the November meeting, we better have a plan for the following spring.”
Biologist Matt Gould, the study team’s new leader, told the group that, despite changes in capacity, the committee’s science arm will continue with grizzly monitoring, data collection and administering the new population model to assess bear numbers — last estimated at 1,050 in the ecosystem’s core.

The Cody meeting was the last as a full-time employee for Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team Leader Frank van Manen. The longtime federal biologist retired earlier than expected, though he is staying involved in an emeritus role. He helmed the group for 13 years.
“I know there are some challenges ahead, but keep up the good fight,” van Manen told the group. “This endeavor has been successful for 50 years, for a good reason: Agencies working together.”

(Getty Images)Advocates for people held in an immigration detention center in Estancia, N.M. say sewage is again backing up into their cells, and they do not have access to clean drinking water.
The Town of Estancia, where the prison is located, posted on social media on Monday asking residents to conserve water. The well serving the community is not producing enough to meet demands, Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela said in a statement on Thursday.
Tiffany Wang, an attorney with the Oregon-based Innovation Law Lab who regularly speaks with people held inside the Torrance County Detention Facility, told Source NM they’ve reported since Monday there has been “absolutely no access to water,” leaving them unable to flush toilets or take showers and exacerbating illnesses and hygiene issues.
“Several reports indicate that stagnant human waste has sat in sites across the facility and that people are resorting to desperate measures such as fasting in order to avoid defecating and defecating on paper plates to put into the trash instead of using toilets, which they are unable to flush,” Wang said.
In addition to detaining migrants, the Torrance County lockup holds people facing federal charges and serves as the county’s jail. It’s owned and operated by private prison company CoreCivic. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts with the county to provide space to hold detained people, and Torrance County contracts with CoreCivic to facilitate the agreement with ICE. President Donald Trump is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with CoreCivic and other private prison companies, Stateline reports.
Spokespeople for CoreCivic and the county government on Friday acknowledged a shortage of water, but denied allegations that the prison doesn’t have any or that sewage is flooding the cells.
Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, told Source NM any claim that Torrance has been without running water since Monday “is completely false.”
While the prison changed its operations to reduce water consumption, Gustin said, drinking water is always available in the cell pods and staff have given people bottled water. Wang told Source inmates have told her that this is limited to two bottles per day.
“At no point have those in our care been without drinking water,” Gustin said. He said laundry and showers have been “placed on a schedule” but remain available to everyone.
The ongoing conservation measures are meant to ensure the town doesn’t reach critically low levels in its water storage tank, Barela, the county manager, told Source NM. She said the prison’s water tank “has never been empty,” people held there “have had enough water to meet basic water needs during this time,” and the well is being repaired.
Wang said the possibility that some limited amount of water remains in the facility’s tank “does not change the truth that people detained inside TCDF say they have now gone since Monday without running water to meet their basic needs.”
CoreCivic, county deny evacuation
Innovation Law Lab on Tuesday informed ICE El Paso Field Office Director Mary De Anda-Ybarra about specifically where the problems are happening inside the prison, according to emails the group shared with Source NM. De Anda-Ybarra responded the same day by asking for more information and then the next morning, told them “we are looking into the matter.”
Wang said following the law lab’s letter to the ICE field office, the detained men told her officials  evacuated them from one dormitory with a history of sewage flooding. She said prison staff are making detained people clean the feces themselves without personal protective equipment.
CoreCivic and the county also deny these allegations. A spokesperson for ICE did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
“There are also no sewage flooding issues, nor have we had to relocate any residents,” Gustin said.
Barela said she is unaware of any “systemic issues” when it comes to sewage backups in the prison, and maintenance issues are addressed as they come up. “To my knowledge, TCDF has rectified all building maintenance issues within a reasonable time frame after becoming aware of the concerns,” she said.
Wang said Torrance has a “well-documented record of failing plumbing infrastructure,” and shared a map of flooding issues in nearly every cell pod.
“Claims that CoreCivic and Torrance County are unaware of systemic sewage flooding issues are disingenuous and false,” she said.
In interviews with legal advocates and researchers, people detained inside Torrance have described cells “inundated with dirty water” in 2024; entire cell pods flooded with raw sewage in 2023; and broken sinks and water fountains in 2022. New Mexico’s Congressional delegation cited these issues and others when they repeatedly asked former President Joe Biden to close Torrance, but he refused.
‘A public health crisis’
Wang said people detained in Torrance already have various illnesses that would be exacerbated by a lack of potable water, including a gallbladder infection requiring an operation, epilepsy, vision issues and diabetes.
Gustin said CoreCivic hasn’t received any reports of incarcerated people or staff becoming sick as a result of the water problem.
Wang said the county and CoreCivic’s comments “fly in the face of numerous testimonies from detained individuals and their families stating that the facility has been without water for flushing toilets or showering since Monday.”
“It is remarkable, but unfortunately not surprising, that CoreCivic and Torrance County officials are currently attempting to claim that plumbing and water issues are unfounded or have been resolved,” she said. “It speaks to the impunity and dishonesty with which CoreCivic, ICE, and Torrance County collaborate to operate TCDF.”
Wang said it’s shameful that CoreCivic and the county “continue to profit at the expense of the health of detained individuals and the wellbeing of the town of Estancia.”
“ICE and CoreCivic should halt further transfers of people into TCDF, which is in the midst of a public health crisis, release all the people currently detained inside, and finally shut TCDF down,” she said.

(Photo of black bears in North Carolina by NC Garry Tucker/ USFWS)Several black bears spent the winter tucked into dens in northeastern Iowa, which wildlife experts say is a “step up the ladder” toward an established breeding population of bears in the state. 
Black bear sightings in the region have been fairly regular over the past decade or so, but with the prospect of more bear sightings to come, Vince Evelsizer with Iowa Department of Natural Resources said he wants to make sure Iowans “get off on the right start.” 
“That starts with all of us having a better understanding of bears, and what motivates them,” Evelsizer said. 
DNR met with police departments, sheriff’s offices, conservation boards and other officials in northeastern counties, to help prepare them in the event of a bear-related call. 
Evelsizer said this type of education around bears will lead to a better understanding of how to deal with bears, “for the sake of the bear and for human safety sake.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The department has also partnered with the organization BearWise, to provide messaging on how to live with bears. Bear Wise, which was developed by state agency bear biologists, has basic tips for residential and outdoor bear interactions. 
People in residential areas in “bear country” can do things like take down bird feeders, secure any food left outside, including pet food and garbage, and clean their outdoor grills when bears are active, from spring through fall. 
Bears have incredibly strong senses of smell and can smell a tasty snack from more than a mile away, according to BearWise.
Loud noises and big arm movements are the best way to scare a black bear away if it turns up in a yard or across a hiking trail.
Black bear attacks are “extremely rare” according to BearWise, but Evelsizer said it’s best to “give black bears space.” 
Over the years, he said the department has reported a handful of instances of bears hit by cars or shot in the state. 
There are no legal protections for bears in Iowa, though a bill was introduced in the House this year to create a program for hunting and trapping black bears, and establish penalties for the unlawful taking of a bear. 
“It is up to the people of Iowa to decide if they would like to see protection (for the bears) or not,” Evelsizer said. 
A natural resurgence 
Black bears, which can be cinnamon, brown, blonde or black in color, were once common across all of North America. European settlement in the country eliminated much of the population, and drove the bears to more remote areas, away from human settlements. 
Gradually, however, the populations have come back. Iowa’s neighbors to the north, Minnesota and Wisconsin, are now home to an estimated 16,000 and 24,000 black bears, respectively. 

Bear fact: Bears are not considered “true hibernators” because their body temperature only drops about 12 degrees during their winter slumbers, according to BearWise. During the 4-6 months the bears spend snuggled in a den, they do not eat, drink or go to the bathroom. The National Park Service reports that during a bear’s torpor, they can still wake suddenly if they sense danger. 

Evelsizer said the bears began to reside in the driftless region of the two states, which is why some have wandered into Iowa. 
“It’s interesting that this is actually going on in our modern world,” Evelsizer said. “After so many years … the book is still being written.” 
Black bear visits in past years have mostly consisted of males crossing over during mating season and then looping back up to Wisconsin or Minnesota. Evelsizer said the handful of black bears that stuck around this year through Iowa’s winter have already emerged from their winter torpor. 
Evelsizer said overwintering females would be the next step toward an established breeding population in Iowa. 
Iowa is still dealing with individual bears at this point, with an average of about five bear sightings a year and eight sightings last year. 
“My hunch is that they’re more adaptive than we think, and that we may see more than we thought we ever would,” Evelsizer said.

Flood-related expenses and lost revenue could resound for years — and not just in Barre.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  As Barre voters prepare to weigh in on this year’s budget, flood woes from years past still linger.","Kaycen Hedges tries to clear mud from Third Street in Barre on Thursday, July 11, 2024, after overnight flooding. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe most fateful decision made about Barre City’s fiscal future might not be made by voters at its Town Meeting Day election on May 13. Rather, it’s the decisions made by state lawmakers, federal agencies and the Trump administration at large that have already affected Barre’s coffers as it slowly pulls itself up from two major flood events. “Our recovery and the impacts (are) not felt across just one year. We need sort of an off-ramp, and we need multiyear assistance,” Barre City Manager Nick Storellicastro said. “I mean, that obviously didn’t translate to this year.”Voters will soon decide whether to support the $14.8 million 2026 budget proposal, representing a property tax rate increase of 5.87%. Barre City voters moved its Town Meeting Day to May in 2024 to better fit the back end of the state Legislature’s calendar. The budget Storellicastro helped to prepare this upcoming fiscal year had to work without the roughly $1 million in state flood aid that the city received in 2024. Barre City was one of the hardest-hit communities in Vermont during the 2023 flood event, and was hit again, less hard, the following year.So far, the city has received only $50,000 in direct operational assistance for this upcoming fiscal year, which runs from July 1 to June 30, from the state. “We’re never going to turn down money from the state. But obviously, the difference between $50,000 (and) a million is a big deal,” he said. “We probably could have used a number with six figures in it, it would have been something more meaningful.”Barre City officials ultimately chose to make up its budget deficit by cutting its bulky waste removal service, leaving positions unfilled and raising certain city fees and taxes, among other measures. The city also benefited from a small boon: Longtime Barre resident Eugene Cozzi bequeathed a large trust to the city upon his death in 2024, $75,000 of which will be used this year to help support cemetery operations, Storellicastro said. However, the fate of a bill that would provide flood-affected municipalities some fiscal relief is still up in the air. H.397, currently in the Senate Government Operations Committee, has a variety of measures geared toward helping communities keep as much of their revenue as possible. Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre City, said that as the state’s financial situation has gotten worse due to Trump administration cuts across the country, he worked on H.397 to “put smaller pieces” of funding together for municipalities. He said the bill would create a new state-led flood buyout program to replace or add onto the flood buyouts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “We need to build up our state systems,” he said. “We can’t assume FEMA will be there,” as the Trump administration has cut back on key FEMA programs. The bill would also create a new “municipal grand list stabilization fund,” which for five years would reimburse municipalities for lost property taxes on flood buyouts, since properties purchased by communities for flood mitigation or recovery represent a loss in potential property tax revenue.Storellicastro told the Senate Committee on Government Operations on Tuesday that 60 Barre property owners have applied for buyouts. Of those, Barre has approved only 27. “Barre City is four square miles,” he said. “Anytime we give up a parcel to a FEMA buyout, that is gone forever from property tax revenue, from development, from housing, from whatever you want to call it. So we only decided to move forward with very targeted buyouts of clusters along the river because those properties have mitigation value to the city as a whole.”Another provision in the bill would allow communities to keep a larger percentage of their local options tax, 75% rather than 70%, Waszazak said. The remaining portion goes into a state fund that provides tax relief to municipalities for state-owned property.Town officials beyond Barre support those changes, while acknowledging they have limitations. Tom Leitz, municipal manager for Waterbury, said the extra 5% in local options tax would mean an additional $60,000 in revenue for the town. “I think we’ll be back asking the same questions of the Legislature in a year or two, but I’m still really happy to get an additional 5%,” he said. “That’s a big win for us.”Liz Scharf, Middlessex Select Board chair, said the town was in the process of approving 12 buyouts that could translate to a loss of $60,000 in property tax revenue per year. “It’s not something we can rely on in perpetuity,” because of the five-year time limit, she said. “But it obviously would be helpful to have that.”Yet the town’s challenges go well beyond buyout funds. Middlesex is still waiting on more than $5.4 million in FEMA reimbursement for the emergency repairs it made for the 2023 flood. The money has been coming in “at a snail’s pace,” she said. The delay has left Scharf with a daunting fiscal bind. “Usually, a town like us would have $200,000 to $400,000 of reserve funds, just for things, right? Like, ‘Oh, yeah, this broke down and we didn’t have the money for it.’ We have zero reserve funds,” she said. Meanwhile, “everything in our town is falling apart,” she said: the town hall, the town shed, a town-owned truck. Just recently, she got a picture from the town’s foreman of a road that appears to be sinking toward a gorge, the kind of damage that could cost thousands to repair. The town has been borrowing funds to keep up, but Scharf is worried its credit will max out soon.“I don’t know what to do in the next storm,” she said. “I don’t know how we’re going to pay for the next road repairs, because we just don’t even have the money to front it.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  As Barre voters prepare to weigh in on this year’s budget, flood woes from years past still linger.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/barre-storm-folo-9-20240711.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 19:06:08.418813

Tucked in between the conservative, rural north Georgia mountains and the more liberal Atlanta suburbs, Cherokee has a relatively large population that is relatively conservative, which makes it a gold mine for Republicans running statewide races. Last fall, Cherokee voters gave now-President Donald just under 70% of their ballots, more than 112,000 in total, helping him flip the state back for Republicans after it narrowly went to former president Joe Biden in 2020.
That’s why it was a little unusual to see top Georgia Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Harold Jones and state Sen. Jason Esteves, who recently launched his 2026 gubernatorial campaign, speaking to large crowds at events in Cherokee Thursday.
Getting Shigley with it

Jones, who represents Augusta, made the trek to downtown Canton to show support for the woman he hopes will be his newest colleague. He was joined by other top Democratic senators including Sens. Josh McLaurin, Elena Parent and Sheikh Rahman as well as state Rep. Shea Roberts.
Debra Shigley, a Harvard-educated attorney, small business owner and mom of five announced Thursday she is running to replace Republican state Sen. Brandon Beach, who was picked by Trump to become the next U.S. Treasury Secretary.
Shigley said her campaign will emphasize honesty, transparency and kitchen table issues.

“That’s the voice I’ll bring to the state senate, a voice that knows what it’s like to juggle diaper changes with Zoom calls and soccer practice, a voice that understands struggle, believes in solutions and refuses to give up on Georgia families,” she said.
But before Shigley can deliver her first floor speech, she’ll have to fight off the winner of a crowded Republican primary. The candidates so far include Cherokee County Commissioner Steve West, trucking company founder Jason Dickerson, Army veteran and small business owner Grant McGarry and firefighter Brice Futch.
The eventual GOP primary winner will enter the general with a distinct advantage – the district, which includes parts of Cherokee and north Fulton counties, heavily favors a Republican. Beach, a stalwart conservative and Trump ally, won the district with around 70% of the vote last year.
Democratic leaders say despite that disadvantage, they feel good about Shigley’s shot.
That’s because it’s an off-year, special election, which will likely take place during summer vacation season. That is likely to mean a low turnout race, and Democrats are betting their base, peeved at the news out of the federal government, will be more energized to cast their ballots.
“I think the way the winds of the country are blowing right now, and also in Georgia, is to see that the Republicans are really not about helping families and doing things for people,” Jones said. “So, number one, I think that’s the reality, and then number two, we have a great candidate. So when we put those two things together, I really do believe it’s flippable.”
Where’s Barry?
  Congressman Barry Loudermilk
Democrats have held rallies with crowds numbering in the hundreds in south Cherokee, including outside the Woodstock office of Republican Congressman Barry Loudermilk.
On Thursday evening, Cherokee Democrats and the Atlanta-North Georgia Labor Council hosted a mock town hall in Loudermilk’s name at a Woodstock church. The congressman’s place was taken by a cardboard cutout of Waldo, the elusive red and white stripe-wearing fellow from the Where’s Waldo books, with Loudermilk’s face pasted on, the joke being that Loudermilk can’t be found by his constituents.
More than 200 people packed into the Allen Temple AME Church to ask questions, not of Loudermilk, but of Esteves and McLaurin as well as fellow Democrats Sen. Sonya Halpern and Rep. Lisa Campbell.
The questioners came from a left-of-center perspective, largely expressing fear and anger at federal policies ranging from immigration and economics to health care and the environment.
A major theme was the demand that lawmakers do more to counter Trump’s agenda.

Shawn Kwak, a naturalized citizen and former Republican, said even though he served in the U.S. Navy, he cannot prove his citizenship because he doesn’t have a birth certificate, which impacts his ability to vote and get a driver’s license.
“I don’t see the fight in the Democratic Party,” he said. “I’m holding back a lot of anger right now. My family and thousands of people across this nation are right now struggling to hold on, to hide, to keep themselves out of the line of fire. I’m not afraid to stand up. I fought for this nation. I was a Republican. I am armed and I’m military-trained. We are out there this weekend fighting again. I don’t see you guys out there with us. I hear you talk a lot of talk, but I don’t hear the issues that are important, that we are getting attacked right now. I’m afraid that if they question my rights, I can’t prove my citizenship anymore.”
Speaking after the event, Esteves acknowledged the frustrations some Democrats have with the party and said he will focus his campaign on policies that will help Georgians.
“The Democratic Party is not on the ballot, Jason Esteves is on the ballot,” he said. “So I’m going to focus on my race. I’m going to focus on making sure that we have candidates up and down the ballot that are focused on the issues that Georgians care about. And ultimately that comes down to keeping and growing of hard-earned money in people’s pockets. And I’m not going to focus on what’s happening at the national level. Obviously what’s happening in D.C. with Donald Trump and Elon Musk is causing a lot of chaos down here. And we’re going to have to navigate through that. But at the end of the day, what Georgians want is someone who’s going to focus on them.”
Dems moving north?
  Sen. Jason Esteves. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Esteves said he was encouraged by the big crowd in Cherokee and that he sees chipping away votes in red counties as critical for Democrats running statewide.
“What we have to do is make sure that we’re meeting voters where they are across the state, regardless of what the vote totals were in prior elections and talk to people about the issues that they care about,” he said.
Democrats like Biden and Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff who have won statewide races racked up big numbers in Atlanta and its suburbs like Cobb County, Cherokee’s neighbor to the south.
Once a Republican stronghold, Cobb has moved more to the left over the last few decades as younger people and more minorities moved in seeking good schools and affordable homes within reach of Atlanta’s jobs and amenities.
That same dynamic could be just getting under way in Cherokee, said Nate Rich, chair of the Cherokee County Democratic Party.
“Cherokee’s definitely a slower burn because we are like that next layer of counties out beyond the north metro arc, right? So I don’t know that Cherokee’s gonna be this dramatic collapse of dominoes that Cobb was back in ‘16 and ‘18, but we’re doing the work now in preparation. We’ve got a lot of organization, we’ve got a lot of good energy, we’ve got some great candidates, so we’re feeling really good about it.”
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said that cautious optimism may be warranted.
“Looking at what’s happened over the last, not quite a generation, in terms of presidential voting, virtually all the precincts in the southern third of Cherokee have become a little more Democratic,” he said. “It’s not so consistent in gubernatorial elections from 2010 to 2022, but still, generally, South Cherokee is becoming a bit more democratic now. Still, it is, overall, a huge win for Republicans, but yeah, Democrats are showing some strength in the southern part of the county.”
Speaking to reporters at the Democratic town hall, Woodstock Republican Rep. Charlice Byrd said not so fast. She said it’s true that a lot of new people are moving into areas like Woodstock, Acworth and Canton, but the county still has a strong Republican majority and will for the foreseeable future.
“It shifts to the left, it shifts  to the right, then it comes back to the middle, then it goes one way or the other again,” she said. “I feel very confident that Cherokee County will remain red for quite a while yet. I mean, we haven’t seen anything drastic. There was a drop in when we did the redistricting, the lines changed a little bit, but it’s still pretty red. And as I see it now, whoever is running as a Republican, they need Cherokee County.”
  Woodstock Republican Reps. Charlice Byrd and Jordan Ridley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Byrd and fellow Woodstock Republican Rep. Jordan Ridley, who are seen as on the more conservative side of the House GOP, sat in the front row for the Democratic town hall.
“Their big thing is like, ‘Barry, why are you hiding?’ We want to make sure no one thought we were hiding,” Ridley said. Ridley added that he doesn’t think that is a fair assessment of Loudermilk.
Ridley echoed Byrd’s assessment of the parties’ future chances in Cherokee and predicted Shigley will have a more difficult race than she and Senate Democrats might think.
“That’s going to be a hard hill to climb, and if for some reason they do catch lightning in a bottle, they get extremely lucky, we come back to a full election cycle in ‘26, and they’re not going to hold that seat,” he said. “So if they do get lucky, they’re gonna lose it in 12 months. They know that, we know that, so I don’t see them putting a lot of money in – let’s just be realistic, if you’re winning by 70% the other party’s not going to hold it, it’s going to flip right back.”

“There is nothing more personal than an individual’s genetic information,” said Idaho’s Republican Attorney General Raúl Labrador in a March 24 consumer alert, “and allowing that to be sold off to the highest bidder raises serious consumer protection concerns for privacy. I want to make sure that 23andMe customers in Idaho have every opportunity to protect their genetic data.”
North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, agreed in a March statement.
“Your genetic data is your most personal, confidential data, and you should be able to protect who has access to it,” Jackson said. “You have the power to delete your data now — please act quickly.”
 What state and federal laws protect the privacy of your genetic data?

Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and the founder of a health care strategy firm, deleted his information on 23andMe as soon as he learned of the bankruptcy filing, he told Stateline.
For him, the bankruptcy begs a vital question that federal and state laws don’t fully address: What happens to your genetic data when the company holding it collapses?
Federal protections are flimsy. States have beefed up their genetic privacy laws in recent years, but many experts say they don’t go far enough.












There actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.


– Dr. Adam Brown, emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy company




23andMe has said the bankruptcy will not change how it stores, manages or protects its trove of sensitive customer information. In a news release issued shortly after the bankruptcy announcement, the company said any potential buyers would have to agree to comply with 23andMe’s consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws. When contacted by Stateline, the company declined to comment beyond what it has published in news releases and information it posted for customers on its website.
But once the data is in the hands of another company, that company could change its privacy policy at any time, experts noted.
“Once you get to the point of bankruptcy court, there may not be those same guarantees or the same ethos a new company may have around privacy protections for consumers,” Brown said.
“I want people to understand there actually are not a lot of data privacy protections for consumers, especially for these direct-to-customer-type businesses.”

 HIPAA doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe

Companies such as 23andMe offer their users potentially game-changing revelations about their health and ancestry. The process is simple: Mail in a saliva sample and the company uses it to build an individual genetic profile that can reveal not only a person’s family connections, but also health insights such as their risk of developing a disease like cancer or Alzheimer’s.
This valuable personal data underpins a direct-to-customer genetic testing market that was valued at $1.93 billion globally in 2023 and is expected to grow, according to market research firm Grand View Research.
23andMe was an industry giant until its stock price plummeted following a massive 2023 data breach that affected the accounts of nearly 7 million customers. Then came the $30 million class-action lawsuit settlement.
The company declared bankruptcy in late March of this year and announced it’s up for sale.
A flurry of alerts from state attorneys general around the country soon followed. AGs from states including Alabama, Arizona, California, , Idaho, Kentucky, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Texas issued similar press releases that recommended customers ask the company to delete their genetic profile and destroy the saliva sample used to create it.
“We have robust state privacy laws that include data deletion rights, and I would encourage any Texan concerned about their data to exercise the right to have their data securely deleted,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in an April statement.
Labrador similarly encouraged Idahoans to look at all genetic testing companies to see if they store a customer’s data.
Consumers may use the Consumer Reports App to request that direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies, including 23andMe, delete any personal data, the Idaho attorney general’s consumer alert said.
“Consumers who have submitted genetic samples to other companies should determine if their genetic information has been stored by that company,” the alert said. “If your data has been stored, you may request the company destroy any stored information either through the Consumer Reports App or through the company itself.”
The fear is that a new 23andMe owner could choose to use or share sensitive personal genetic data in ways the company’s current privacy policy doesn’t allow. There’s worry it could be used, for example, to inflate people’s life insurance premiums or expose them to employment discrimination.
And there aren’t many guardrails to prevent that from happening.
HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, doesn’t apply to companies like 23andMe. The landmark federal law protects patients’ sensitive health information when it’s handled by doctors, hospitals and health insurers. But direct-to-customer companies such as 23andMe or Ancestry aren’t considered health care providers, and their non-invasive saliva collection kit isn’t considered a medical test.
The main federal law that protects people from discrimination based on their genetic information is nearly 20 years old. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, long before the rise of at-home testing kits. It applies to employers and health insurers, but not to life insurance companies, mortgage lenders and other non-health entities. And it doesn’t explicitly protect epigenetic information, which is information about the way a person’s genes — and by extension, health — are affected by outside factors such as smoking, disease or stress.

 What states are doing to regulate genetic testing

In the past five years, at least 14 states have passed laws regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing offered by companies like Ancestry and 23andMe. There’s variation, but generally the laws require companies to get customers’ express consent before using or sharing their data, and allow customers to request their genetic data be deleted and biological samples destroyed.
It’s a good start, but doesn’t go far enough, said Anya Prince, a University of Iowa law professor whose research focuses on health and genetic privacy.
Many of those state efforts were built around a model law developed by the Coalition for Genetic Data Protection, an industry group with two member companies: 23andMe and Ancestry.
As DNA testing kits exploded in popularity and attracted increased scrutiny from lawmakers, the coalition pushed to influence legislation and set industry standards. The privacy protections in the laws mirror what 23andMe and Ancestry were already doing with their own privacy policies, experts say.
“They do have some really sensible privacy protections,” said Prince. “It’s great that people can delete their genetic data, and it’s great that law enforcement needs a warrant to access it. But if a privacy advocate had written a model law, there would be the potential for more and broader protections.”
For example, she said, many of the state laws address privacy requirements just for direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies. If 23andMe’s data is bought by, say, a pharmaceutical company, those state laws no longer apply.
The coalition now appears to be inactive, its website defunct.
Since 2020, more than a dozen states have passed some version of a genetic information privacy law, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming, based on a Stateline analysis. This year, the Indiana legislature passed a bill that’s now headed to the governor’s desk. Bills have been introduced this year in other states, including West Virginia.

Prince said state laws rely too heavily on consumers to self-manage their data privacy. They’re expected to understand a company’s policy, when studies have shown the public often doesn’t read privacy notices nor fully understand how companies use their data. Further, many state laws don’t address how third parties, such as law enforcement, can access and use consumer genetic data.
It’s also not always clear how the laws will be enforced, or who’s responsible for oversight.
“In general, I think there’s a disconnect between how people think their privacy is protected and how it’s actually protected,” she said.
But a few states have enacted laws that are more robust. California, for example, has a genetic information privacy law, but also has a general data protection law, as well as a state version of the federal GINA law that extends genetic anti-discrimination protections into areas including housing, education and licensing.
Florida has beefed up its DNA privacy laws in recent years, making the using or selling of an individual’s DNA without informed consent a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. Florida was also the first state to prohibit life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic information to determine coverage.

krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images) A central Iowa investment advisor accused of defrauding investors in a million-dollar Ponzi scheme is appealing the revocation of his business licenses.
Des Moines investment advisor Cory J. Dawkins of Elite Wealth Partners is asking a Polk County judge to review and overturn a decision by the Iowa Insurance Division to revoke his license and registration as an investment advisor and insurance producer.
Dawkins is also seeking an immediate stay of the license revocations, at least until a final decision is rendered in the case, to avoid “substantial and irreparable harm” to his business and reputation.
In court filings, Dawkins says he has spent his entire professional life in the insurance, banking and financial services industry.
“Since the Iowa insurance commissioner’s investigation began, my business has suffered an approximate 87% revenue drop,” he told the court. “Several negative articles about me have appeared online since the commissioner’s investigation began. These articles present a distorted view of the situation by falsely suggesting that clients have lost all their money and portraying me as the mastermind behind the investments.”
Dawkins said there is a “significant possibility his clients many recover their investments” and that he had “no decision-making authority in the underlying investments at issue.” He adds that if he is barred from the securities industry, efforts to recover his clients’ money  will be “substantially curtailed.”
Without court intervention, he argues, he will be forced to close his business, will be unable to pay the $2.3 million in restitution ordered by the division, and will have to file for bankruptcy protection.  He adds that with his professional identity being “intrinsically linked” to his role as a financial advisor, the revocation of his license “would cause me severe psychological distress that extends far beyond financial considerations.”
A hearing in the matter is now scheduled for May 30, 2025. The Iowa Insurance Division is seeking dismissal of the case, arguing that by statute Dawkins had 30 days to seek judicial review of its decision, but filed his case after 33 days had passed.
SEC said business was ‘actually a Ponzi scheme’
In 2022, the Iowa Insurance Division formally charged Dawkins, Elite Wealth Partners and EWP Permian Basin Fund II with securities fraud; performing unregistered activity as securities agents; committing acts that constituted grounds for discipline as investment advisors; and fraud or dishonest conduct as demonstrated through incompetence, untrustworthiness and financial irresponsibility.
According to the Iowa Insurance Division, Dawkins offered high-risk, unsecured investment opportunities that were not in his clients’ best interests. The division alleges the scheme was launched sometime before May 2019 when Dawkins spoke to a Polk County couple about investing in EWP Permian Basin Fund II, whereby the couple’s money would be used to back a company that was purportedly purchasing oil wells.
According to the division’s findings of fact, EWP was not actually buying wells and had no assets to secure the notes that were issued to investors. The representations made to the Polk County couple and to other subsequent investors by Dawkins were “untrue” and amounted to securities fraud, according to the division.
EWP, the division found, was set up as a vehicle through which people could invest in an entity called the Heartland Drilling Fund. Dawkins failed to review Heartland’s financial statements and “exhibited significant uncertainty” as to which oil and gas interests were actually held by Heartland, the division found.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the division noted, would later conclude that promised returns to investors “were little more than an illusion and were actually a Ponzi scheme.”
Dawkins and Elite Wealth collected thousands of dollars in fees related to their investment transactions. Dawkins, however, had a conflict of interest by acting as both an investment advisor and a self-interested promoter of EWP, the division concluded. He also was alleged to have steered investors to a “very high risk” entity called the Carson Oil Field Development Fund II without disclosing all of the risks involved.
By 2021, the division found, Dawkins and Elite Wealth should have known they were recommending investments “that had numerous characteristics of a fraudulent Ponzi scheme,” with initial investors being paid from proceeds generated by newer investors.
Division cites ‘heartbreaking’ effect on investor
One of the alleged victims in the scheme was a 19-year-old Iowa State University student whose father had recently died of cancer. The division said it found her subsequent testimony about her dealings with Dawkins to be “simply heartbreaking.”
The young woman, whose name is redacted from public filings in the case, had invested $188,000 of her father’s money with Dawkins, according to the division.
“We needed money to pay for a funeral,” the woman testified at a hearing. “We simply had my dad’s body in a freezer for two weeks. So, we were really struggling, and we owed a whole bunch of our family members money. And we just kind of proceeded because we were so desperate for funeral money to pay for his gravestone and to pay the mortgage on our home … I guess my dad already chose that investment. So we just kind of went with whatever he had … And if he trusted Cory with that market on that, then I just went ahead with it.”
Dawkins, the division found, later accepted no responsibility for steering the student toward the high-risk investment, stating that Dawkins “absurdly claimed” that although he was a fiduciary, his introduction of the EWP investment opportunity to the student was not a recommendation of any kind.
In its findings of fact, the division said it found Dawkins’ testimony at a hearing on the matter to be “wholly untrustworthy, leaving us with the unmistakable impression that Dawkins was willing to say practically anything” to avoid accountability.
The division stated that losses by 15 investors, including interest, totaled $2,371,618.
Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen revoked the investment advisor registrations of Dawkins and Elite Wealth, revoked the insurance producer licenses of Dawkins and Elite Wealth, and permanently barred EWP from issuing or offering securities of any kind in Iowa.
Ommen also ordered EWP to pay $2.3 million in restitution, with $1.9 million of that amount payable immediately, and the remaining $400,000 payable no later than March 31, 2026. Ommen’s order also specifies that Dawkins and Elite Wealth are also held liable for the $2.3 million in restitution.
Dawkins has not responded to requests for comment from Iowa Capital Dispatch, but SEC records indicate he, Elite Wealth and EWP have denied all of the division’s allegations.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gavel-cash.jpg,,,2025-05-02 18:07:50.593998

(Photo courtesy the Doña Ana County Clerk's Office)Money can’t buy you love, but it can get you a $55 New Mexico marriage license this summer.
New Mexico Marriage license fees will more than double next month from the current $25 fee thanks to Senate Bill 290, sponsored by Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) during the legislative session held earlier this year. Out of the total new charge, the county clerk’s office keeps $20; another $20 will go to the state’s Children’s Trust Fund; and $15 will benefit each county’s general fund.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the bill on April 8 and the fee increase goes into effect on June 20. 

According to the fiscal impact report, the fee increase is estimated to bring in an additional $195,000 in revenue each year – including about $32,500 for the Children’s Trust Fund, which currently receives most of its revenue from special license plate sales. The fund is administered by the Children, Youth and Families Department’s Family Services Division. Trust fund grants are awarded to “community-based organizations” throughout the state working to help prevent or treat child abuse and neglect. 
Doña Ana County Clerk Amanda López Askin told Source NM that the marriage license fee has not increased since the 1990s, and previous efforts to pass an increase failed. 
“This is my seventh year that I’m starting [as county clerk]. We have been pushing for an increase that was, I think, reasonable, but also would be impactful for each of the counties in terms of their funds,” López Askin said. However, she noted: “It’s not just about increasing revenue. It’s also about collectively supporting children across the state.”
New Mexico’s license fee will still be on the lower side, compared to neighboring states such as Texas and Arizona, which both charge over $80, according to the Doña Ana County Clerk’s Office. Doña Ana County Chief Deputy County Clerk Caroline Zamora said many people from El Paso, Texas travel to her office for marriage licenses because of the cheaper fee.

David Wasinger watches the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate appears on the verge of rekindling a 50-year-old fight over the role of the lieutenant governor, triggered in part by the five hours of budget debate this week.
At the start of Thursday’s session, Lt. Gov. David Wasinger recognized himself to speak, then quoted state Sen. Joe Nicola expressing his frustration at the short time allowed to read and understand the $49.7 billion spending package.
Wasinger said he was traveling in the state during the budget debate and heard similar complaints. 
“The perceptions of the folks are the same perception that the senator has outlined,” Wasinger said. “So to give you a heads up, I will be, either yet this session be taking a far more active role, or it may happen next session, because I think some rules need to be changed within this chamber.”
Wasinger did not mention during his speech that his office budget was cut in the Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by state Sen. Lincoln Hough of Springfield, who Wasinger defeated in the 2024 GOP primary. He lost one of the eight staff positions in his office, which is already the smallest of all statewide elected officials.
 Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina, speaks during a March GOP press conference at the midpoint of the legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Friday morning, Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin — who by the rules holds the power to choose committee members, refer bills and decide parliamentary questions — used a social media post to slap back at Wasinger’s remarks.
Wasinger was out of line giving a speech in the Senate chambers, O’Laughlin said, because that is  “a right reserved for senators.”
“He advised that he would be introducing new rules maybe next session,” O’Laughlin wrote. “Uh…..no. He does not have the authority to do this because he is not a senator. He also advised that he would be using the senate caucus staff. Also no.”
If Wasinger wants change, she wrote, “one way to be helpful is to not insult the entire Senate body in a five-minute speech.”
Wasinger, like Nicola, never held public office before winning election in November. His campaign promised he would be “challenging the Jefferson City establishment” if elected but he has not attempted to exercise the kinds of powers generally inherent in the job of presiding over a parliamentary body.
In his speech from the dais, Wasinger said that while he ran as an outsider, he had remained silent because he wanted to observe the chamber.
“I didn’t want to come in and, you know, begin throwing hand grenades,” Wasinger said.
If Wasinger tries to exert some sort of authority over the Senate, he would run headlong into a five-decade old Missouri Supreme Court ruling that diminished the already meager role of the lieutenant governor. 
 “Full-time Phelps” case

In 1972, Bill Phelps was elected lieutenant governor, the first Republican to win the office since 1928.
 Lt. Gov. Bill Phelps in the official photo published in 1975. (Source: Missouri Official Manual)
He promised he would be a “full-time” lieutenant governor, despite the lack of actual responsibilities in the office. Along with being ready to take over upon the death, disability or impeachment of the governor, the officeholder is “ex officio president of the senate.” In that role, the Constitution says, the lieutenant governor may join in Senate debate when it sits as a committee of the whole and cast the deciding vote in the case of ties.
As Phelps took office in 1973, the Senate changed its rules to put all substantive powers of the presiding officer in the hands of the president pro tem, elected from the members. The rules even allowed the president pro tem to dismiss the lieutenant governor from the dais.
And when then-state Sen. Bill Cason took the gavel from Phelps over his objections on the final day of the 1973 session, Phelps took the case to the Missouri Supreme Court.
At first, the case was only over the rule allowing the pro tem to relieve the lieutenant governor of the gavel. That rule, the 6-1 court said, was unconstitutional.
The pro tem must yield, Judge James Finch wrote, when the “lieutenant governor is present and desirous of exercising his role as presiding officer of the senate.”
That didn’t end the controversy.
The opinion was issued in November 1973, just before the start of the 1974 session. The courts were forced to issue a clarification when Phelps also contended the rules giving the pro tem the power to name committees, assign bills and rule on parliamentary questions were invalid.
The court quashed that argument. The lieutenant governor may hold the gavel if he or she wishes, but cannot use any power inherent in the role of presiding officer because those duties had been assigned elsewhere under the rules.
The Senate has the power to write rules to govern its proceedings, subject only to limits in the Constitution, the court decided.
“The powers and functions referred to…are not given to the lieutenant governor in (directly by the constitutional) or anywhere else in the Constitution,” the unanimous court ruled.
In a statement Thursday afternoon, Wasinger said he hopes to reduce the amount of time “wasted on the senate floor” where “arcane senate rules stall progress on or completely block good legislation that would improve the lives of Missourians.”
His goal, he said, is to remove those impasses.
“Many other states have made reforms to their senate rules, and it is time Missouri does so as well,” Wasinger said. “This isn’t about any individual senator – it’s about a system in Jefferson City in much need of common sense reforms.”
O’Laughlin, in her response to his speech, said Wasinger needs to learn the lesson she learned, that it takes more than certainty about the wisdom of an idea to accomplish anything in the Senate.
“Lesson One: Develop a personal relationship with each senator and offer to help navigate what is an extremely complicated system,” O’Laughlin wrote. “This is how you get something done. Ultimately it’s the ONLY way.”
A mocking voice from the rank and file of the Senate showed Wasinger will have more, not less, work to do after his speech. As he closed his speech, he invited members to contact his chief of staff, Katie Ashcroft, with any ideas for reforming the rules.
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, responded in kind on social media.
“If you have any ideas how @davidwasinger could do his job better,” she wrote, “please let Karen in my office know.”

(Photo By Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)What began as a session focused on how to spend Virginia’s projected multi-billion surplus has ended with Gov. Glenn Youngkin yanking nearly $900 million out of the state budget — bracing for the economic aftershocks of President Donald Trump’s new administration.
At the start of the 2025 legislative session both Youngkin and members of Virginia’s General Assembly had their eyes on how best to use the windfall. But after Trump took office in late January, Youngkin announced Friday that he was setting aside a $900 million cushion to prepare for potential federal impacts. 
A good portion of the money stems from cutting one-time capital projects at colleges and universities and other public facilities which Youngkin said are still in the planning stages and haven’t yet entered construction. 
Amid Trump’s cuts to federal workers, congressional plans to trim federal funding, and fresh tariffs rattling international trade, Youngkin has repeatedly emphasized “short-term risks” and “short-term disruptions” as reasons to hold back spending. 
“As President Trump rightfully resets trade imbalances and restores fiscal responsibility in DC,” Youngkin said as he announced he was signing the state budget on Friday. “Those short term disruptions, I think, require us to be responsible and not spend 100% of this forecasted surplus today.”
House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, commended Youngkin’s actions as “prudent” in a statement issued on Friday. He added that “Virginia is better positioned to weather whatever comes next.”
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surrovell, D-Fairfax expressed frustration in a call with reporters Friday afternoon. 
“I’m glad to see the governor is finally agreeing with us that the Virginia economy has some serious risk due to the actions of President Trump and Elon Musk,” Senate Surovell said on the call following Youngkin’s announcement. 
However, he criticized Youngkin for not conferring with lawmakers on his budget cuts. 
“He should have had a dialogue with us during the session so he could try to reach a mutual understanding or compromise about it, instead of showing up at the last minute, $900 million out of our budget,” Surrovell said. 
 Signed and vetoed bills 

Meanwhile, the governor may have pleased many lawmakers by deciding to sign bills he had previously tried to alter.  
When the legislature convened last month to review his amendments, they chose not to accept many of the amendments or substitutions he proposed when they sent the bills back to him for final signature or veto. They’d also accepted his recommendations in part on some of the bills as well.
“There are a lot of bills that I think are very interesting that I hadn’t seen before that we tried to make a little better,” Youngkin said. “Didn’t get the amendments passed, but I’m going to sign them because I think they actually are pretty decent bills.” 
For instance, Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico saw several of his returned bills signed to include an overhaul of Standards of Learning testing procedures and a bill to require social media companies verify the age of users and place time limits for minors under 16. Delegates Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax and Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, respectively carried the House versions of the bills.
The governor also vetoed bills that had been sent back to him with his amendments rejected. 
Such was the case with proposals from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, that would create a right to contraception in Virginia. The lawmakers have stressed in recent years that state-level protections could be needed if two U.S. Supreme Court cases upholding contraception rights were overturned. 
After the fall of Roe v. Wade, the federal case that had protected abortion access, Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting the court’s previous contraception rulings. While his counterparts have not signaled similar interest, some states have sought to restrict contraception, while others have worked to shore up protections. 
Like last year, Youngkin tried to amend Hashmi and Price’s bills to line up with the Supreme Court, which the lawmakers  said “gutted” the bills and missed the point. The Democratic-controlled legislature rejected his substitute, and he later rejected their bills altogether — just as he did this year. 
 Other budget bits

Meanwhile, on Friday, Youngkin celebrated some of the ways the state budget will support people, including investments in maternal health, which drew cheers from attendees. Both Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers had emphasized the need for legislation and funding to address maternal health disparities in the state, and the governor has already backed several bills carried by Democrats as well. 
The budget also includes $50 million for disaster response relief in Southwest Virginia and $50 million for community flood protection funding. A years-long effort — which had previously failed — to budget $50 million to overhaul Richmond’s combined sewage overflow system survived this time around. 
Following Richmond’s water crisis earlier this year, when water treatment plant failures left the region with unsafe drinking water for nearly a week, Youngkin also announced  plans to invest $25 million in drinking water infrastructure. 
He received applause from the audience when he mentioned the budget’s investment in education — $834 million in public education, which includes lifting support caps, investments for English language learners, investment in special education, and $7.5 million earmarked to help reduce child care waitlists. There’s also $134 million, he said, to fund “much deserved bonuses for our teachers.” 
Youngkin also emphasized that the budget includes funding for Medicaid — a program that may still face some jeopardy in the state amid federal actions. Should congress cut federal spending, Virginia’s 2018 expansion, which affects roughly 630,000 people, could be at risk. 
Some lawmakers have suggested that a special session might be needed to figure out how to cover those costs if that happens, while Youngkin said Friday he believes there are ways to streamline the program’s operations in the state to look for “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
As it’s his final year as governor, Youngkin said he plans to address his cuts to capital projects in a “caboose budget” later this year. In that proposal he can outline what he envisions the legislature with as they head into the  2026 legislative session under whoever the new governor ends up being. 
“We can postpone the final appropriation for these very worthy projects and enable the General Assembly to take it back up in January,” Youngkin said. “I would really like to include them in my introduced caboose budget, and then the General Assembly can get to work.”

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) on Friday described President Donald Trump’s May 1 executive order eliminating funding for NPR and PBS.

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) on Friday described President Donald Trump’s May 1 executive order eliminating funding for NPR and PBS.
Entitled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” the order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease current and future direct and indirect funding “consistent with my Administration’s policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.” It also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary to determine whether PBS or NPR “(or any successor organization)…are complying with the statutory mandate that ‘no person shall be subjected to discrimination in employment . . . on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.’ In the event of a finding of noncompliance,” the order continues, “the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate corrective action.”
Luján, the ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Media, said in a statement the “unlawful” order, signed “in the dark of night,” will “strip New Mexicans of vital access to public programming that educates, entertains, and keeps us safe. For decades, NPR and PBS have delivered news, entertainment, and much more to New Mexicans, especially in rural and Tribal communities. Public media, like NPR, PBS, and their local affiliates, provide critical information to New Mexicans in all corners of the state — including during disasters and emergencies when our rural communities rely on public media the most.”
Moreover, Luján’s statement noted, “this illegal executive order is an attempt by President Trump to strip New Mexicans of vital public services that thousands rely on day-to-day. The President is disregarding CPB’s authority and working to prevent New Mexicans from accessing free news, educational programming, and emergency alerts. Defunding NPR and PBS will leave New Mexicans in the dark when they need information the most.”
Local NPR affiliate KUNM General Manager Richard Towne, in a statement provided to Source, agreed with Luján’s characterization of the order, writing:
“In my view, the EO does not have the legal basis for enforcement.  This is because CPB is an independent non-profit corporation, not a government agency.  The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 protects CPB against political meddling through Congressional funding for two years of funding.”
Towne notes that the CPB is currently funded by Congress “with White House approval” through Sept. 30, 2027, so Trump’s executive order bypasses Congress.
Trump’s order impacts approximately $540,000 in CPB funding for KUNM over the next two years, he said. For public radio and television together, the impact is more than $11 million over the next two years, he noted, adding: “This is not chump change.”
New Mexico PBS General Manager and CEO Franz Joachim sent Source a similar comment, also noting that Trump’s EO “is a clear violation of the 1st amendment and the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as a firewall against federal interference how our federal funding is used.” Federal funding of public media, he added, “is essential and irreplaceable. Government should fund the free distribution of information that saves lives and changes lives. 
Towne also shared a letter he received Friday afternoon from CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison that says while Trump’s executive order “is concerning, we believe it has no effect on CPB, since CPB is not a federal agency subject to the President’s authority.” As such, “CPB will not be adding any additional conditions or restrictions on our Community Service Grants. Payments will continue to go to our grantees per their grant agreements.”
Harrison’s letter also noted that a few days prior to the executive order, the Trump administration “sent emails to three members of CPB’s Board of Directors stating they are fired effective immediately. We immediately filed a lawsuit to say the Administration has no authority to terminate any of CPB’s board members. A U.S. District Court Judge ruled in favor of holding a hearing on our motion for a temporary restraining order, which seeks to block the president’s actions until the case can be fully heard. The hearing is scheduled for May 14. 
That being said, Harrison acknowledged rumors that the administration intends to try to pull back $1.1 billion from CPB’s forthcoming budget,. The CPB board met Friday to discuss these issues.
“I am proud of the resilience and dedication I have seen across the system,” Harrison’s letter concludes. “Your efforts ensure that public media remains a cornerstone of our shared democracy. Together, we will navigate these challenges, guided by our shared commitment to service, education, and community.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kunmdj-1024x473.jpg,,,2025-05-02 18:07:50.593998

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state’s attorney general called Friday for Oklahoma’s commissioner of mental health to be fired, a day after the agency she oversees warned lawmakers that it will not be able to pay its employees later this month.  
Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the governor needs to fire Commissioner Allie Friesen, who heads the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, after legislators revealed they had learned that the agency expected to run out of funds as early as Wednesday. On Friday, they said the agency shifted that payroll shortfall date to May 21.
The payroll issue is the latest in a series of reports of financial disarray and shortfalls at the agency, which has an annual budget of about $610 million and slightly more than 2,000 employees. The agency is the subject of a handful of probes, including from lawmakers, the state auditor and inspector, and a “special investigator” who will be appointed by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt.
The agency reported a $43 million deficit and requested $6.2 million to make ends meet through the end of the fiscal year, but officials haven’t been able to explain how they reached these numbers or publicly answer questions about their payroll costs, drawing the frustration of state lawmakers.

Drummond on Friday called the disarray at the mental health department a “financial meltdown” and “nothing short of government malpractice.”
“Gov. Stitt should have fired his failed agency head months ago when we first learned of her incompetent leadership,” he said in a statement. “I am calling on Gov. Stitt to immediately terminate Commissioner Allie Friesen and seek guidance from industry experts so he can appoint a new leader who is up to the job.”
Stitt appointed Friesen to the role in January 2024 and said Friday that she continues to have his support. Friesen has blamed many of the financial issues on her predecessors.
Stitt said in a statement Friday that Drummond should focus on prosecuting criminals rather than those he has “targeted as political enemies.”
“I’ve tasked Allie Friesen with the difficult job of shining a light on an agency that has operated in darkness for far too long,” he said. “Anytime bureaucracy is disturbed, those committed to the status quo will try and stop (the) truth from being revealed. The same thing is happening to President (Donald) Trump as he tries to clean up the bureaucracy in D.C. Commissioner Friesen is going to continue to do this work.” 
In a later statement, he said the issues emerging from the agency are the result of “years of mismanagement” and did not happen overnight. Stitt outlined a plan of action in a letter to legislative leaders, including bringing in a “highly respected, independent financial expert” from outside the agency to temporarily take control of the department’s finances, officially naming a special investigator, and directing the head of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, along with mental health agency officials, to conduct a “top-to-bottom review of all Medicaid and federally funded functions within the agency.”
Friesen did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Drummond’s call for her termination, but said in an earlier statement that agency leaders are working with Stitt’s office and state leaders to “navigate a difficult but necessary period of operational and fiscal reform” and ensure continuity of services and stability of the workforce. 
“This process, while challenging, is essential to strengthening financial systems, improving oversight, and ensuring operational integrity,” Friesen said. 
Payroll issues
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, said he received a call Thursday afternoon from the agency’s legislative liaison informing him officials don’t have enough money to make payroll next week.

Lawson, who chairs a special House committee investigating the agency’s finances, said Friday that payroll issues have just now surfaced as a result of “significant mismanagement” or “unique budget practices” within the department. 
“So tracing money, where it’s coming from and where it’s going, has been challenging and problematic for staff,” he said. “And as they’ve continued to do their work, they’re discovering more problems, and being unable to meet payroll is just the most recent one.” 
The payroll shortfall will likely affect how hundreds, if not thousands, of state employees feed their families, Lawson said. He said based on his understanding, the payroll issues only affect state employees and not provider contracts. 
Lawmakers previously pointed out that in the last year, the agency hired 20 employees with salaries of $100,000 or more. Another 12 had their salaries raised to that level and 13 were hired with salaries under six figures. The average employee at the mental health department earns just under $52,000. 
Lawson said his committee plans to meet Monday morning in light of the payroll shortfall to question mental health leaders. He said it is possible the Legislature could make an emergency appropriation, but to do so would require support of two-thirds of the House and Senate. A recommendation could come after Monday’s hearing and after Republicans and Democrats meet privately to assess interest and need. 
The special House committee Lawson chairs has now met three times to probe the agency’s disarray and has questioned the qualifications of its interim chief financial officer and why the financial issues exist. 
He said it’s unclear if the $6.2 supplemental appropriation the agency has requested will be enough to get them through the fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
“You know, we’ve got a lot of questions on if we appropriate this money,” he said. “Is it indeed the right amount? Does that indeed get us through the rest of the fiscal year?”
The House wants “good and accurate” information, which can take time, Lawson said, but he’s glad the department proactively reached out.

“The last thing I want is to make a bad situation worse and ask a department who has identified budget problems to make rash decisions or quick decisions that are not good decisions and give us more bad information,” Lawson said. “I do feel like there’s a lot going on at that department to make good decisions, but unfortunately, I think it’s going to take a lot of time.” 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert wrote that he’d had a previous meeting with agency leadership and was assured there would be no cash flow issues before the end of May, according to an email sent Thursday night to House lawmakers, which was obtained by Oklahoma Voice.
He wrote that Friesen first learned of the payroll shortage at 3 p.m. Thursday. 
“We are out of time and will not accept any more delays. Individuals at ODMHSAS have known about this shortfall for months yet it is the final month of (the) legislative session and we still do not have answers. This is unacceptable,” he said Friday in a statement. “We will get to the bottom of how this happened and who is responsible. The people of Oklahoma deserve better than this dysfunction. Our top priority remains maintaining vital services while also being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Kate Zanger has worked in higher education for 49 years, more than half of that time at Clarke University in Dubuque. The vice president for student life is set to retire at the end of the spring semester.
In her career working at universities in Washington, D.C., and New York, Zanger said she has never seen actions taken against international students like the mass changes to Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) statuses and visa revocations that swept across the U.S.
This is a “time of fear” for international students, said Zanger, the principal designated school official at Clarke working with the Student and Exchange Visitor program. While many students’ statuses have been restored at this point, officials working with impacted students say there will be social and economic consequences down the road.
“For U.S. citizens, this time is kind of frightening, because of everything that you hear that’s going on with the government,” Zanger said. “Imagine being an international student trying to figure this out.”
Iowa universities confirm more than a dozen impacted students
Of the 40 Iowa public universities, community colleges and private institutions contacted by the Iowa Capital Dispatch and the 28 that responded, 13 acknowledged having some number of university students or recent graduates with changed SEVIS statuses.
The only state university to provide specific numbers of international students was the University of Northern Iowa, reporting two students with terminated — and reinstated — SEVIS statuses. Representatives from the University of Iowa and Iowa State University both stated there were students at their institutions who have seen their status change, but declined to say how many students and how many have been reinstated.
At least four UI students have been impacted by student status revocations, and are suing the Department of Homeland Security for the actions taken against them. According to reporting by the Iowa State Daily, at least two ISU students have seen their visas revoked.
Other colleges confirming impacted international students include Coe College, Clarke University, Eastern Iowa Community Colleges, Mount Mercy University, Luther College, Graceland University, Des Moines Area Community College, Southeastern Community College and St. Ambrose University.
All respondents saw either one or two student statuses change, and all but two students across all of the institutions have seen their statuses restored.

Some students have also seen their visas revoked with much more aggressive language than in the past, said Karen Edwards, Grinnell College dean for International Student Affairs and principal designated school official.
Grinnell College refused to give specific numbers of impacted students, however, Edwards said around 20% of the student body, or around 340 students, are international, and some have seen both their SEVIS status change and their visa canceled.
While Edwards said F1 student visa revocation as a result of criminal activity is nothing new, and because these visa holders have “duration of status benefits,” they are not required to immediately leave the country if their visa is revoked, but they will have to reapply for a visa if they do travel abroad.
In the past when students were notified of their visa revocation, Edwards said information would be included explaining all of this. Now, language on these notices is “harsher,” she said, warning the holder that they are subject to detention or deportation to a country not their own.
Edwards said the termination of SEVIS records is incredibly troublesome, as it is the record giving international students lawful status to study and complete other requirements and enabling information access and sharing for universities when needed.
“When a SEVIS record is terminated, for example, someone who’s here can’t record their address update, or can’t reduce their course load in their final semester, or can’t submit other applications, a transfer to a new program or graduate level,” Edwards said. “So it really does immediately mean they can’t function as a lawful F1 student here.”
Even alumni who have continued to stay in the U.S. lawfully under their visa and SEVIS status have been impacted, Edwards said.
Uncertainty and fear for students
Moving away from campus. Trying to find legal representation. Missing a commencement ceremony and having to figure out how to retrieve an earned degree. These are some of the hardships endured by international students with terminated SEVIS statuses and revoked visas, according to university officials.
At St. Ambrose University in Davenport, two students saw a change in their SEVIS status and chose to leave the campus. Ricki Grover, international student advisor and study abroad coordinator, said in an email the university provided financial support to the students through its student emergency fund, helped them connect with legal resources and ensured they’d be able to complete their coursework over the summer.
While these statuses have now been reinstated, Grover said the students have not returned to campus.
Some universities have legal experts on hand to help impacted international students, Zanger said, but smaller colleges like Clarke don’t. She said she reached out to larger institutions to see if an attorney would be available to represent the one Clarke student who saw their status terminated, but no one had the time. It can be difficult to find an immigration lawyer who has the expertise to work with students, she said.
Students have told her they’re choosing to stay in the U.S. for the summer out of fear that they won’t be let back in to finish their studies, and Zanger said she’s recommended all international students carry with them the correct documents when traveling.
Others have said if they can’t reenter the country, then they don’t really want to be here anyway.
“We try to assure them that we want you here at Clarke, we want you to graduate from Clarke, you bring a lot to our campus community,” Zanger said.
The one student at Graceland University in Lamoni who saw their visa revoked was supposed to walk in the university’s commencement ceremony on April 27, but couldn’t, despite their visa being reinstated that weekend. Graceland spokesperson Shane Adams said in an email the university will work with the student to ensure they still receive their degree.
“We were disappointed that the student was not able to walk with their classmates on Sunday,” Adams said in his email.
National actions could cause drop in international enrollment
International student enrollment in U.S. universities has been increasing over the past few years, with the 2024 Open Doors Report citing an increase of more than 25,000 students between the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years.
The U.S. has traditionally been viewed as a welcoming and supportive space for students, which Edwards said has made the country a higher education destination for those wishing to study abroad. She worries about how actions taken against international students will impact what she called the country’s fifth-largest export — higher education.
“I think right now, given the climate in the U.S. … if I was coming from another country, I might think twice about studying in the U.S.,” Zanger said, “which is very sad, because our international students bring a lot to each of the campuses they are part of.”
According to data from nonprofit NAFSA: Association of International Educators, in the 2023-2024 academic year alone, international students supported more than 378,000 jobs and contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy. International students in Iowa have contributed nearly $272 million to the state economy and close to 1,900 jobs.
Beyond any economic impact these actions could have, Edwards said the diplomacy, goodwill and innovations that come with international students and the global perspectives and connections they bring will most likely be damaged.
“If we are less viewed as an education destination, that really places our whole way of thinking and learning at risk and it turns us into an isolationist space, as opposed to a global space with thinkers from all over the world,” Edwards said. “That’s what drew me to the field. That’s what makes me passionate about what I do and I see it at work here, because students from all over the world sit in the same classroom, (and) whether they’re talking about English literature or whether they’re doing a science project, it just brings a new voice to the table that helps everybody.”

The suit accuses the companies of receiving personal information through California’s state health insurance exchange.


One day after an investigation by CalMatters and The Markup, LinkedIn and Google were hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging they improperly received confidential data from trackers on California’s health insurance exchange website. 
A California congressman, citing the investigation, then called on the federal Health and Human Services Department to investigate the exchange’s sharing of data to LinkedIn.
In the article, published this week, CalMatters and The Markup revealed how trackers on the website, coveredca.com, sent information on visitors to LinkedIn through a tool called the Insight Tag. As visitors filled out forms on the site, the trackers sent LinkedIn information about them, including whether they were pregnant, blind, transgender, or had experienced domestic abuse. The trackers also monitored information on visitors’ searches for medical providers and how often those visitors used prescription drugs.

How the state sent Californians’ personal health data to LinkedIn 
April 28, 2025April 27, 2025 




The government entity that operates the exchange, Covered California, has since removed the trackers. A spokesperson said they had been used as part of an advertising campaign that began in February 2024.
The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California, cites forensic testing by CalMatters and The Markup, as well as research by the plaintiff, to allege that LinkedIn and Google received health data from web trackers on coveredca.com without the knowledge or consent of users. The plaintiff in the suit is an anonymous California woman who alleges she filled out information on Covered California around June of last year, and had that information sent to LinkedIn and Google.
A proposed class action, the lawsuit seeks to represent everyone who had information transmitted to the tech companies by Covered California. The firm representing her, Bursor and Fisher, has a speciality in class-action suits, including in data privacy, and touts receiving a $100 million settlement from Google for alleged privacy violations in 2022. 
“LinkedIn and Google intentionally intercepted sensitive and confidential communications between Covered California and its customers,” the suit, which seeks to represent others similarly situated, reads. “LinkedIn and Google failed to receive consent for these interceptions.”
“LinkedIn and Google failed to receive consent.”Proposed class action lawsuit filed in federal court over sharing of sensitive data from California’s health insurance exchange.
The suit alleges that the tracking runs afoul of California and federal laws, including the California Invasion of Privacy Act, which requires consent before “communications” can be sent to third parties. The companies made similar violations under the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, according to the suit.
Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A LinkedIn spokesperson referred to the company’s previous statement, saying that its policies “expressly prohibit customers from installing the Insight Tag on web pages that collect or contain sensitive data, including pages offering health-related services.” 
Millions of people in the state have received coverage through Covered California, set up under the Affordable Care Act as a way for Californians to quickly and easily shop for insurance and compare plans. In a statement posted online after publication of the  CalMatters and Markup story, the organization said it was “reviewing the nature and extent of sensitive consumer data and information that was inadvertently shared with LinkedIn.”
Since the tracking was revealed, the story has also drawn the attention of lawmakers. Rep. Kevin Kiley, who called the sharing of data “incredibly disturbing,” sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services asking it to investigate whether the tracking may have violated privacy laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Kiley is a Republican whose California district stretches from suburban Sacramento to Death Valley.
Among other questions, the letter asks the agency to determine how many people were affected by the tracking, and how “something like this [can] be prevented in the future.”

(Image courtesy of HOK Architecture)Construction is ramping up at a new state psychiatric hospital as Washington works to meet continued demand for treatment of people accused of crimes.
The state broke ground in October on the new 350-bed facility at Western State Hospital in Pierce County. Work began in December, but picked up last month and passersby will start to see the building develop in June, said state Department of Social and Health Services spokesperson Jessica Nelson. 
For years, the Department of Social and Health Services has been under court oversight to improve unconstitutionally long wait times for mental health treatment and evaluations for criminal defendants who are incompetent to stand trial. The new hospital is key to complying with a court-ordered settlement in the case known as Trueblood.
Washington is required to conduct an evaluation within 14 days and offer inpatient competency restoration treatment within seven days. The state has long struggled to meet those guidelines and has paid hundreds of millions in fines as a result.
At the groundbreaking for the new hospital in October, then-Gov. Jay Inslee noted the rise in need for these services over the past few years. 
“This exponential growth was not sustainable unless we really put pedal to the metal on our building programs with what we’re doing today,” Inslee said. “So we have invested tremendous resources to respond to this tremendous challenge.”
In February, the most recent month for which comprehensive state data is available, the average wait time for a jail-based evaluation was about 11 days. Inpatient evaluations took five to six days. Admissions for treatment took nearly seven days at Eastern State Hospital, near Spokane, and less than six days at Western State. In years past, this could take over a year. 
The new Western State Hospital will be the latest addition to the state’s bed capacity. 
In 2023, the state acquired and opened a psychiatric hospital in Tukwila for patients under civil commitments, freeing up space for criminal defendants at Western State. 
Last year, the state added another 86 beds at Eastern and Western State hospitals. 
In their capital budget passed last weekend, state lawmakers included $282 million for the final phase of construction at the new hospital. The budget now sits on Gov. Bob Ferguson’s desk. 
The hospital is aiming to help shift the focus at Western State more toward people entangled in the criminal justice system who need treatment and away from civil patients. Under that system, civil commitments would transfer to community-based facilities to get help.
Construction is expected to be completed between 2027 and 2029.

Only farms would qualify for the money under the Senate’s initial plan, which came together after floods and freezes in recent years devastated Vermont agriculture.Over the last two years, “persistently rainy conditions made many forested areas too wet to harvest,” a rep from the Professional Logging Contractors of the Northeast told legislators last week in the House committee dealing with agriculture and forestry. Those conditions came alongside damage to roads and bridges due to flooding. Heavy mud seasons and warmer, wetter winters in particular can inhibit both the harvest and transport of timber, leaving loggers stuck.Lawmakers had already been looking at including foresters in the bill when the testimony came. Shortly after, a draft doing just that was introduced.“We expect the loggers impacted would be a fraction of the claims, but their losses from adverse  weather events cause great hardship, and giving loggers the opportunity to apply for emergency funds seems fair,” said Rep. Michelle Bos-Lun, D-Westminster, who had sponsored a nearly identical House bill that covered foresters.A typical forestry outfit’s business model looks a lot different from the average farm, but people in both industries are subject to extreme weather events hurting bottom lines. “Loggers have historically been left out of these relief bills,” said Rep. David Durfree, D-Shaftsbury. Flood relief efforts like the Business Emergency Gap Assistance Program didn’t extend funds to loggers as their losses were considered revenue loss, according to the logging organization.The inclusion of foresters raises questions about who or what would receive payments. Loggers often use sub-contractors for loading logs or trucking timber, and legislators need to determine if or how the fund could compensate those workers.“Clearly, there are different circumstances for a farmer than there are for a logging contractor, and the biggest one is that the logging contractor doesn’t generally own the property they are working on,” said Dana Doran, the rep from the logging group, told the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency and Forestry.In a phone call Monday, Doran was confident lawmakers would find a way to ensure everyone involved in a logging operation could be compensated.He believes the important part is setting up legislation to provide much needed relief for struggling foresters.As laid out earlier this year, the fund would help farms recover losses or reimburse them for unexpected costs. Those could include wages, wiped-out income from destroyed crops or repairs to roads. It would cover up to 50% of uninsured or uncovered losses, up to $150,000 per year for a farm. A review board would make the final call, with a turnaround coming at most 30 days from officials receiving an “administratively complete application,” under ideal circumstances.The updated version of the bill in the House committee in late April included two forestry operators on the review board alongside the previously planned group of state officials, farmers and farming orgs. Forest fires have also been added to the list of eligible extreme weather events.Legislators also added a limit on the proportion of the fund a single farm or forestry operation could receive at 5%. The maximum funding a single entity could receive from the program remains capped at $150,000. The bill is now being considered in the state Senate.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Proposed farmer relief fund for floods and more could now include loggers.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/logging-2-20230202.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(USFWS)The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks is asking anglers in the state to help with ongoing trout research projects.
Working with Montana State University, biologists are in their second year of tagging trout in the Big Hole, Beaverhead, Ruby and Madison rivers. The ongoing research project is aimed at understanding trout population declines in those waterways, and overall health concerns for fish in the Upper Missouri River Basin.
Anglers are asked to report any tagged fish that they catch, essentially working as “citizen scientists” to provide information on environmental conditions and other factors that contribute to the survival and mortality of trout.
“This is a great chance for anglers to take an active part in this research that will benefit the fishery,” said FWP Fisheries Manager Mike Duncan in a press release. “We need your help. Please report the tagged fish you catch.”
Each fish tag — colored blue or yellow — has a unique number and will be attached near the dorsal fin.

FWP says that anglers who catch a tagged fish should use clippers to remove the tag as close to the skin as possible while minimizing handling time and exposure to air for the fish, then submit a report for each tagged fish they catch from the four rivers mentioned above. These reports will include information such as the tag number, date, location, condition of the fish, gear type used, and whether the angler released or harvested the fish.
A how-to video on the process is available on FWP’s website.
FWP operates a rewards program as an incentive for anglers to take part and report tags. Reported blue tags will be entered into regular drawings for gear and fishing trips, while reports of yellow tags are each worth $100.
Some fish may still be carrying tags from last year, according to FWP, which may be covered in algae and less noticeable to anglers, but the same reporting process and reward opportunities apply to older tags.
Reports can be submitted by visiting mtcfru.org/msutag or by calling 406-994-2384.
Anglers and other river recreationists may also meet staff from MSU while on the river. These creel clerks will be interviewing recreational river users as part of the ongoing research effort.
The research project in 2024 after annual sampling the year before found fish numbers to be at or near historical lows in sections of the Upper Missouri River Basin. Since then, FWP has been working closely with MSU to study fish mortality, recruitment and health.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13982951691_6da005c3eb_o-1024x714.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Proceeds from the event fund educational programs that offer a chance for a better life. 
Held every Sunday in October and one weekend in April, the infamous prison rodeo is one of the highlights of the year for the hundreds of men incarcerated at the Louisiana State Penitentiary who participate in the events. 
Despite its controversies, the rodeo’s most ardent supporters are its participants, for whom the event is a rare bridge to the world outside Angola’s thousands of acres and an opportunity to financially support themselves and their education. 
Andrew Hundley, executive director of the Louisiana Parole Project, which assists formerly incarcerated people as they reenter society, likened Angola to a college campus. It’s an apt metaphor for Hundley, who completed correspondence courses at LSU while he was incarcerated at Angola. 
“There are a lot of opportunities there to use your time wisely, or use your time not so wisely,” Hundley said. “For the people who want to use their time wisely, they’re more than a dozen vocational programs that are there, from automotive repair to collision repair, carpentry, welding, plumbing, small engine repair, you name it.”

‘Wildest Show in the South’
The rodeo is unlike any professional rodeo. For starters, the 75 or so men who compete don’t receive any training. For many of them, the first time they mount a bull is just seconds before the gates open. 
While the men do receive safety vests and helmets, the lack of training makes it more dangerous than a traditional rodeo. After one event at the April 26 rodeo, one incarcerated person was seen falling multiple times trying to get out of the arena after his event, eventually having to be helped out of the mud. 
This rodeo — nicknamed “the Wildest Show in the South” — is also different because it offers unique events that add to the spectacle — like bull pinball. 
It works like this: a rodeo clown sets down hula hoops in the arena, and an incarcerated person stands in each one. A bull is released and the last man remaining in his hoop wins. 
A clown identified only as Rudy exchanged banter with the rodeo emcee over the arena’s public address system.
“Now what would make a human being get in one of them hoops?” Rudy asked during the show.  
“It’s kind of like trying to sign up for the Darwin Award,” the emcee replied, referencing the rhetorical honor given to people who contribute to evolution by removing themselves from the gene pool, usually through a foolish and dangerous act. 
The prison has held its rodeo since 1965 and has been the subject of frequent criticism. 
Operating as a farm on the site of a former slave plantation, Louisiana State Penitentiary has a brutal history. For much of its time, it has been known for indiscriminate violence. Even after significant reforms throughout the late 20th century, it is still the subject of controversy. 
Workers on the prison’s “farm line,” who pick the vegetables that help feed the prisoners, are currently suing the state, alleging dangerous working conditions. Inmates at Angola can earn a maximum of $8 a week, regardless of the type of work they do. 
Despite the danger and outside criticism, none of the dozen incarcerated men or formerly incarcerated men the Illuminator interviewed at the rodeo had a negative thing to say about the event. 
Assistant Warden Anne Easley sat in on all interviews the lluminator conducted at the rodeo. Only incarcerated people with trusty status, meaning they have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have good disciplinary records, were participating in the event and therefore available for interviews. 
In addition to rodeo participants, interviewees included inmate-instructors and incarcerated people selling crafts they made using skills learned at the prison. The craft fair, held outside the rodeo arena, has an atmosphere not unlike a flea market. It offers handmade goods including furniture, art and jewelry. Merchandise sales support the incarcerated people financially or finance prison organizations such as sobriety groups. 
“Y’all come to this rodeo to find out how people feel about it. If all of your views on a rodeo are negative, and you’re not getting all negative answers, then something’s off, right?,” Jeffrey Hilburn, editor of The Angolite, the prison’s news magazine, said in an interview. “But if you come here and you find out that an inmate who’s making a hobby craft … he’s going to get a good percentage of that money.” 
“His family doesn’t have to send him that money. His family can pay their taxes, gas bill, save enough and buy a dozen eggs for $10,” added Hilburn, who serving time for the 1991 second-degree murder of Mark Jones in Richland Parish. He was recently denied parole. 
But support for the rodeo, while widespread among incarcerated people and formerly incarcerated people, is not universal. 
Norris Henderson, now executive director of Voice of the Experienced, an organization that advocates for incarcerated people, was once held at Angola. Henderson was exonerated after 27 years of incarceration. As a volunteer in the prison infirmary, he saw first-hand the injuries of the rodeo participants. 
“To me, the rodeo was just this form of exploitation,” Henderson said. “This is kind of like the Roman Coliseum, where people come to cheer, not the humans in the arena, they come to cheer the animals? 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
‘This whole place has made me a different person’
The career training programs the rodeo finances are run by inmate-instructors, who are required to have the same certifications as those who teach the same courses at a community or technical college. 
There are 17 different career and technical education programs at the prison. According to a fact-sheet included in a souvenir rodeo program, the inmate-led reentry training and mentoring program saves the state $4 million a year. 
Among the instructors is Luther McFarland, the only incarcerated person with teaching certification from the American Welding Society. He is also certified by the National Center for Construction Education and Research.

Like most other instructors at Angola, McFarland is a “lifer,” meaning he’s serving a life sentence. McFarland, who does not have the possibility of parole, was convicted of the 2004 second-degree murder of Coulton Lyell Jr. in Metairie. 
McFarland has a welding certification from Baton Rouge Community College, which he received before the school ended its program at Angola due to budget constraints. McFarland said he has taught welding at Angola since 2010. 
“It really helped me build character … when you’re coming from the streets and you got guys from New Orleans … coming with some mindset,  it was really a challenge, but we got through it,” McFarland said of his time as an instructor. “It wasn’t easy, but we got through it.”  
The instruction has to start with basics, as many of his students have never handled basic tools. But eventually they get trained up enough to do serious work, McFarland said. Several of the barbeque grills he and his students had welded were on sale that Saturday. 
“We learn how to just get the guys up to a par so when they go home, they have the mindset to be able to work in this type of environment and know what to expect from them because it’s the same way,” McFarland said. 
McFarland said his work training his students to be welders when they’re released was the start of his legacy. Though not eligible for parole, he hopes he will receive clemency. In order to receive a sentence commutation, an individual must receive a favorable vote of the Pardon Board as well as approval from the governor. 
Two of McFarland’s former students came to visit their former instructor at the rodeo, including Austin McCraine, father to a newborn. McCraine served time for theft. He said he came back to the rodeo to pay homage to his friends and mentors. 
McCraine worked in welding for a year before moving up to a pipefitter’s job, which typically calls for more skills and experience – and pays better.
“I’ve been working there for almost a year now,” McCraine said. “This whole place has made me a different person.”

Students at the University of South […[...]","The Horseshoe of the University of South Carolina campus, Monday, Oct. 30, 2023 in Columbia, S.C.(File/Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The federal government has restored the visa status of more than a dozen international students at South Carolina colleges. Still, a lawsuit filed by a University of South Carolina international student from Nigeria, arguing he was denied due process, continues amid ongoing changes to U.S. immigration policy.
Students at the University of South Carolina, Furman University and Clemson University were among more than 1,800 international students across the country who had lost their legal status changed with little to no explanation from the federal government in recent weeks.
After a flurry of legal challenges in federal courts nationwide, the government began reversing those terminations late last week and said it would issue new guidelines for canceling a student’s legal status.
Among those who saw their status reinstated, at least for now, was Matthew Ariwoola, 32, of Nigeria.
“Matthew’s status was revoked with no notice and no explanation. Just as suddenly, with just as little explanation his status was restored,” said ACLU of South Carolina spokesman Paul Bowers, whose organization is representing Ariwoola in court. “The reason we’re still fighting this is to defend his due process rights.”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security previously referred the SC Daily Gazette to the U.S. Department of State. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ariwoola, a fourth-year doctoral chemistry student at USC, was scheduled to graduate in December.
But on April 8, USC staff informed Ariwoola and at least 11 other students they could not continue studying or teaching due to the change of their immigration status in a Homeland Security-maintained database.
USC staff then recommended in an email to Ariwoola included in court filings that he “depart the United States as soon as possible because you no longer have legal status in the United States.”
U.S. District Judge Jacquelyn Austin stepped in, granting and then extending a temporary order through May 16, to prevent Ariwoola’s detention or deportation while the case makes its way through the court system.
USC and Furman have since confirmed the status changes of impacted students — two at Furman and a dozen at USC — were reversed. Clemson did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette about the status of impacted students at the Upstate university.
Just days after the reversals, the federal government revealed its expanded policy on reasons international students’ legal status can be terminated. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement document, filed this week in a federal court in Texas, said reasons for termination now include the revocation of the visas granted to students to enter the U.S.
Historically, students whose visas were revoked or expired have not lost their legal residency status and could stay in the U.S. to finish school. It only prevented their leaving the U.S. and returning without reapplying.
Ariwoola’s student visa expired in February.
Remarks made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in March suggested the new administration’s stance would differ from past standards.
“Your visa is expired, your visa is revoked, you have to leave,” he told reporters. “There is no right to a student visa.””
Under the new guidance that has come in in court proceedings, Homeland Security officials also seem to have stripped students of their status simply if their names appeared in a criminal or fingerprint database, The Associated Press reported.
In the case of Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems at the University of Texas in Arlington, Department of Homeland Security officials told the judge employees ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI database that lists missing persons, the names of suspects and arrests, even if charges were dropped or never filed.
In total, about 6,400 students were identified.
Police arrested Ariwoola in 2023 on a warrant out of Georgia for alleged “theft by deception,” a crime which can involve the use of in-person or cyber scams to steal from a victim. But according to the ACLU, Ariwoola had never contacted the accuser, and the prosecutor had dismissed all charges.
Even so, Ariwoola has no way of knowing for certain if that’s why the government changed his status. The attorneys have yet to fully respond to Ariwoola’s allegations.
Because Ariwoola’s status was restored, government lawyers wrote in court filings that they intend to ask the judge to dismiss the lawsuit if the student does not withdraw it before June 20.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SC26-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Religious leaders in Washington will be required to report child abuse or neglect, even when it is disclosed in confession, under a new law signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Friday.
“Protecting our kids, first, is the most important thing. This bill protects Washingtonians from abuse and harm,” Ferguson said, noting Washington is one of five states in which clergy are not currently mandated reporters.
It took Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, three years to get the bill to the governor’s desk. Making sure disclosures during confidential conversations between a penitent and religious leader were not exempt was critical, she said.
“You never put somebody’s conscience above the protection of a child,” she said.
Senate Bill 5375 passed by margins of 64-31 in the House and 28-20 in the Senate. It takes effect July 27. 
It adds clergy members to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families.
Clergy would join school personnel, nurses, social service counselors, psychologists, and many others with a duty to report when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.”
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
While disclosures in confession or other religious rites where the clergy member is bound to confidentiality are not exempt, religious leaders will retain their privilege to not be compelled to testify in related court cases or criminal proceedings.
More than half the states make clergy mandatory reporters and most exempt what is heard in a confessional. Washington will join several states, including New Hampshire and West Virginia where such conversations are not exempt.
“It says the church is not above the law, especially when it comes to protecting children,” said Mary Dispenza, a founding member of the Catholic Accountability Project and member of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. “We know children will be safer as a result of passing this law.”
Removing the confessional privilege proved the most divisive provision in legislative debates. 
It’s the chief reason the Washington State Catholic Conference opposed the legislation. They said it would force priests to break the seal of confession, considered a sacred promise to never reveal any of the information disclosed.
Most Republican lawmakers were opposed to including the confessional, too. They argued in hearings and floor debates that abusers would do more harm because they would no longer be able to freely confide and seek forgiveness.
Keeping the confessional in the bill did not give Ferguson pause.
“Not for me,” he said. As a Catholic, “I’m very familiar with it. Been to confession, myself. I felt this was important legislation for protecting kids.”
Frame has said her push for the legislation began after reading an InvestigateWest account of a lawsuit alleging a Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation in Spokane covered up abuse of children by an elder.
Momentum grew as Catholic and Jehovah’s Witness survivors shared their stories with lawmakers and argued for including the confessions, she said. 
“This is going to protect children in other religious communities, especially Jehovah’s Witnesses,” said Marino Hardin of Seattle, who worked to pass the law on behalf of abuse victims. “I believe that a lot more children will not fall through the cracks.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ferguson-clergy-bill-signing-may-2-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Erik Smith, Gov. Laura Kelly and Kansas Bureau of Investigation Director Tony Mattivi, standing left to right. Sarah Meeks, left in red, was wife of the late Derby Police Department Detective Charles Meeks, who died in a traffic accident in 1976. His name was added this year to the state monument. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Sarah Meeks said she was the one expected to perish in the head-on collision during a late-evening rainstorm on US-54 in southwest Kansas.
When an elderly motorist drifted across the yellow line at 9 p.m. May 5, 1976, about 2 miles east of Bucklin, Sarah Meeks woke up just in time to see blur of the oncoming car’s rapidly approaching headlights. Force of the impact threw her into the windshield and caused extensive head trauma. Her husband, Derby Police Department Detective Charles Meeks, initially was treated for a broken arm and shattered leg. But, tragically, Charles Meeks passed away four days later. His wife survived.
“I was the one who was supposed to be dead,” Sarah Meeks said. “When they did the autopsy, they found it was a brain bleed that did him in.”
Sarah Meeks recounted those harrowing moments Friday after the annual service in Topeka honoring men and women who had their names carved into the Kansas Law Enforcement Memorial on the Capitol grounds.
The 307th and 308th names etched into the circular memorial were that of Meeks, who died at age 34 while driving to a firearms competition as a representative of the police department, and Leavenworth County Deputy Sheriff Glenn Curtiss, who was shot and killed at age 26 during a scuffle with the suspect in an Oct. 29, 1924, bank robbery in Linwood.
Gov. Laura Kelly and Tony Mattivi, director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, spoke of the state’s good fortune that no names would be added to pay tribute to law enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice during 2024.
“Today, we’re fortunate that for the first time in several years we’re not mourning new line-of-duty deaths in Kansas. That is a blessing,” she said. “But it does not change the solemn responsibility we have to remember those that did give their lives. To all families of fallen officers, you carry a burden few can understand.”
Kelly said the service acknowledged courage demonstrated by law enforcement officers who responded to crimes, of course, but also intervened when people were stricken by mental illness, addiction, homelessness and other challenges evident in society.
The death of Meeks and Curtiss were memorialized in speech, prayer and song. A pipe and drum corps’ offered a rendition of “Amazing Grace.” A line of officers delivered the traditional 21-volley salute. More than 100 uniformed law enforcement officers from Kansas stood at attention on the memorial’s perimeter.
Mattivi, representing the KBI, said Kansans had a duty to recognize women and men who lost their lives while engaged in work to protect communities.
“We mourn the officers whose lives were cut short. We remember their sacrifices in the name of justice.” Mattivi said. “We promise to stand together as brothers and sisters in blue and do everything possible to avoid other senseless tragedies. To each of you, who stand in the same line of fire and risk your lives every single day, thank you.”
Sarah Meeks and her son, Charles, who was 9 years old when the detective died, joined other families in placing flowers on the memorial wall where names of the deceased reside. Both wife and son appreciated the opportunity, after nearly half a century, to take part in the commemoration of lives lost.
“We’ve been to Washington, D.C., and seen the name on the monument there,” Sarah Meeks said. “This is great. He always wanted to be in law enforcement.”

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/Minnesota House of Representatives Information Services)Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill creating new safety standards for workers who use scuba equipment to remove underwater weeds from lakes, following the deaths of two young and inexperienced divers.
Brady Aune and Joe Anderson died two years apart in remarkably similar accidents that their parents blame on the carelessness of their employers. They allege the companies didn’t provide adequate training or safety equipment that might have saved their lives.
Neither man was certified in scuba diving. In fact, neither had been scuba diving before they were handed oxygen tanks and weighted belts and sent to pull out weeds in deep murky water with little to no supervision.
“Brady and Joseph were two remarkable young men whose tragic, preventable deaths are a stark reminder that workplace safety cannot be an afterthought,” Walz said in a statement announcing his signature on May 1, International Workers Day.
The law, which had Democratic and Republican authors, requires workers who use scuba equipment to have an open water scuba diver certificate, or more advanced certificate, from a nationally recognized agency.
Commercial diving operations must also ensure a standby diver is available when another worker is in the water, and that workers are trained in first aid and CPR.
Companies must require workers to wear a buoyancy control device that can inflate automatically like the yellow emergency vests on airplanes, as well as an illuminated dive beacon and other safety equipment.
The law took effect immediately.
Aune was 20 years old when he drowned in Lake Minnetonka in Spring 2022 on his fourth day working for $16 an hour for Dive Guys, an aquatic weed removal company owned by Matt Wilkie.
Investigators found Aune’s weighted belt was on backward, so he wasn’t able to remove it, and that just one of the five employees on the job was trained in scuba diving.
Anderson was 18 years old when he drowned in Lac Lavon in Dakota County in 2024 while working for a different company, Your Lake Aquatic Plant Management. It was his third day on the job and his first time diving underwater.
His parents say he was a strong swimmer, but he received just 15 minutes of training the day he died, from a co-worker who wasn’t scuba certified. Anderson’s supervisor also wasn’t trained in CPR, and while first responders were able to resuscitate him, he died three days later in the hospital.
OSHA fined Dive Guys $128,450 and Your Lake Aquatic Plant Management $730,000, which the company is appealing.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031125-PHOTO-workforce-MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Teachers would be able to count years of experience in another field toward their paycheck under a bill the House passed this week.
The bill went back to the Senate, where it is likely to pass, sending it to the governor’s desk for his signature. Both the House and Senate passed the bill unanimously.
If the bill becomes law, certified teachers would be able to count every two years of work experience as one year of teaching in a similar subject matter. While that won’t fix the ongoing shortage of school staff on its own, it could make a difference when combined with other changes, supporters said.
SC Senate advances bill on teacher contracts called a ‘huge win’ for K-12 educators

“Quality teachers, to bring them in, we need tools in the toolbox,” said House Education Chairwoman Shannon Erickson, R-Beaufort. “And this is a tool in the toolbox.”
Prior work experience would not count toward a teacher’s other benefits or retirement.
Pay is often a leading deterrent for people looking to become a teacher after years in a different field. Because teachers in the state are paid based on their years of experience and highest college degree, a career-changer would start at a district’s lowest pay level for their educational experience.
That can come as a shock for someone who has spent years working in a private industry. Even people who have considered teaching might decide not to pursue it or leave after a few years because they can’t afford it or don’t want to take the pay cut, teachers’ advocates said.
At the same time, having teachers with lived experience in a field, including the expertise that comes with that, can be valuable for students, said Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. For instance, a fellow teacher at Blythewood High School worked for Westinghouse Electric Company before bringing that knowledge to a chemistry classroom.
“All around, this policy is an easy win for teacher recruitment and retention,” Kelly said.
A new teacher with five years of other work experience and a bachelor’s degree could expect to see a starting salary about $2,000 higher than before the bill passed, according to a financial analysis of the bill.
Teachers who have been in the profession for years but started out on a different career path will also be able to request a bump in the state salary schedule from the Department of Education.
SC House budget plan raises teacher pay by $1,500 instead of $3,000

The department estimates that at least 9,400 teachers would be eligible for the credit, according to the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Sherry East, president of the South Carolina Education Association remained skeptical about how many people would change their minds about teaching because of the bill. Even if it attracts a few teachers, though, that would be worth it, she said.
The key will be making sure those new teachers have the training to succeed in the classroom as well as in the private sector, she said. All teachers who receive the higher pay must also receive a teaching certificate before going into a classroom.
“If it will entice people into the classroom, we’re all for it,” East said. “However, we need to make sure career-changers have the support they need to be an effective teacher.”
Both the House and Senate passed a version of the bill last year, but it failed to reach the finish line after the House tacked on a separate education bill that the Senate then removed.
The bill House members attached, known as the Educator Assistance Act, headed to the governor’s desk this week after passing both chambers. Advocates expect that bill, which aims to cut down on red tape teachers face, to also bolster recruitment and retention.
As would a proposed increase to the state’s minimum pay for teachers, bringing it to $48,500 for first-year educators, advocates have said. That pay bump, included in both the House and Senate spending plans, is locked into the state budget.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ChildcareGetty-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)An environmental organization and a Native American advocacy group say two important Black Hills cultural and historical sites face threats from exploratory drilling projects.
One of the projects is proposed by Rapid City-based Pete Lien and Sons. It wants to conduct exploratory drilling for graphite on national forest land near Pe’ Sla, also known as Reynolds Prairie, which is a high-elevation meadow in the central Black Hills. Graphite is used in electric vehicle batteries, lubricants, pencils and other products.
Pe’ Sla is a ceremonial site for Lakota people, and it figures prominently in traditional Lakota creation stories.
“Drilling at Pe’ Sla would be like drilling under the Vatican or at a sacred site in Jerusalem,” said Taylor Gunhammer, an Oglala Lakota, in a news release. “Under any circumstances, it is not a place to be considering mining.”
Dakota Gold will conduct pre-permit study for potential mine in Homestake area

In response to questions from South Dakota Searchlight, a representative of Pete Lien and Sons said the U.S. Forest Service is reviewing the plan’s potential impact on sites of cultural and historical significance in the proposed project area, and questions and concerns should be directed to that agency. 
Gunhammer is a local organizer with NDN Collective, a Native American advocacy group in Rapid City. NDN and the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance are encouraging people to submit comments on the Pete Lien and Sons project and another project that could affect Craven Canyon in the southern Black Hills.
That’s where a Canadian company, Clean Nuclear Energy Corp., plans to conduct exploratory drilling for uranium on state-owned land located seven miles north of Edgemont. Uranium is the primary ingredient in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.
The Black Hills Clean Water Alliance and NDN said Craven Canyon contains 7,000-year-old cultural and historical sites of importance to Indigenous tribes, historians and archeologists.
A representative of Clean Nuclear Energy Corp., Mike Blady, said in email correspondence with South Dakota Searchlight that the proposed exploration area has been explored and mined previously. A letter to the company from state regulators last year said the area is within a quarter-mile of the edge of Craven Canyon, but Blady said the area is over a mile away.
“We are aware of the cultural significance and are doing everything in our power to ensure that there is no collateral damage,” Blady wrote. “We have consulted with the state and federal government as well as hosting an open house for Indigenous groups and are confident that there will not be adverse effects.
Meanwhile, another company, enCore Energy, hopes to mine uranium in the Edgemont area. Its various state and federal mining permit applications have been bogged down in administrative and court appeals for years.
The Clean Nuclear Energy Corp. drilling proposal will be considered by the state Board of Minerals and Environment. The Pete Lien and Sons proposal is under consideration by the supervisor of the Black Hills National Forest. Both proposals are open for public comment.

Vaillancourt, 53, of Rutland is brought in to Rutland criminal court for her arraignment after being charged with manslaughter and cruelty to a child arising from the January death of 6-month-old Harper Rose Briar at the defendant’s state-certified in-home day care facility. Pool photo by Robert Layman/Rutland HeraldThe Vermont Supreme Court has upheld the convictions of a former Rutland child care provider found guilty on charges of involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to a child in the death of a 6-month-old baby more than six years ago. Stacey Vaillancourt, 59, was charged in 2019 with giving a fatal amount of a sedative found in over-the-counter antihistamines to Harper Rose Briar, who was in her care. Vaillancourt was convicted of the two charges against her by a Rutland County jury following a trial in December 2023, and was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. She appealed her convictions, and Friday the five-member Vermont Supreme Court in a unanimous decision affirmed the jury’s guilty verdicts. “Defendant has not identified any grounds to disturb the jury’s verdict,” Justice Nancy Waples wrote in the 17-page ruling.“First, there was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to convict defendant for both involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to a child with death resulting,” Waples wrote. “Second, the verdicts against her are not inconsistent and do not violate double-jeopardy.”Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan prosecuted the case at trial along with Deputy State’s Attorney Daron Raleigh. Deputy State’s Attorney Evan Meenan argued the appeal for the prosecution before the Vermont Supreme Court in March.“I hope today’s decision brings closure and a sense of justice to everyone who loved Harper during her all-too-brief life,” Sullivan said in a statement Friday.Dawn Matthews, an appellate attorney with the Vermont Defender General’s Office, argued Vaillancourt’s appeal. Matthews could not immediately be reached Friday for comment.The Pittsford infant died Jan. 24, 2019, at the child care facility that Vaillancourt ran out of her home on North Street in Rutland, according to charging documents filed in the case. Authorities had been called to Vaillancourt’s child care facility that day for a report that the infant was not breathing, the filings stated. Harper was taken by ambulance to Rutland Regional Medical Center, where she later died.It was Harper’s third day at the child care facility when, the charging documents stated, Vaillancourt gave her a fatal amount of diphenhydramine, an “over-the-counter (sedating) antihistamine used for treatment of allergic reactions.”An autopsy report from the chief medical examiner’s office showed that Harper’s death was a homicide caused by “diphenhydramine intoxication.”Vaillancourt’s defense had contended the state case was based on circumstantial evidence and also raised the possibility that another person could have administered the medication. Among the arguments in her appeal, Vaillancourt’s attorney stated that Judge Cortland Corsones erred at the trial by allowing into evidence two short videos of Harper because they were “unduly” prejudicial.“Here,” Waples wrote in the high court’s ruling, “the State argued that it had to prove causation, so videos showing (Harper’s) developmental capacity were relevant because they demonstrated that she did not have the capacity to either give herself medicine or protect herself from harm.”The high court rejected Vaillancourt’s argument regarding the videos.“Any emotional response generated in the jurors from the videos does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the videos,” Waples wrote in the decision.As of Friday, Vaillancourt was incarcerated at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility, the state’s only women’s prison, in South Burlington, according to the state Department of Corrections.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Supreme Court upholds convictions for Rutland child care provider in baby’s death.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190319_rhd_infant_death-daycare_Vaillancourt-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

The board alleges Amber Herzmann, 44, was working as a travel nurse from June 2024 through September 2024. On Sept. 10, 2024, the board alleges, her employment contract was suspended due to suspicion of medication misappropriation.
The board alleges a review of her charts suggests she was administering the narcotic painkiller fentanyl to women after they gave birth, although the drug is typically prescribed to patients during active labor. Multiple patients denied receiving the medication or the number of doses of medication Herzmann claimed to have administered, according to the board.

Herzmann’s employer later submitted a report to the Drug Enforcement Administration indicating 14 vials of fentanyl and two syringes of hydromorphone were lost or were suspected of being stolen.
The board charged Herzmann with misappropriation of patient medications. In resolving the case, the board agreed on April 10 to let Herzmann retain her license as a registered nurse, and Herzmann agreed to participate in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, a program that offers assistance to health care professionals with substance abuse issues.
Court records show that on April 24, two weeks after the board approved that settlement agreement, Herzmann was criminally charged with nine felony counts of unlawfully obtaining a prescription drug, plus one aggravated misdemeanor charge of tampering with records.
Prosecutors allege that in October, November and December of 2024 — after her travel-nurse employment contract was suspended — Herzmann was working on the maternity floor of Mercy Hospital in Clinton where she claimed to have administered the narcotic painkillers fentanyl, oxycodone and Dilaudid to multiple patients but instead kept the drugs for her own purposes.
Herzmann is scheduled to be arraigned on May 22, 2025. She has yet to enter a plea in the case.
Other nursing board actions
Other nurses recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Nursing include:
— Stephanie Erdman, an advanced registered nurse practitioner who was charged with failing to assess and report the status of a patient, and failure to establish a relationship with a patient. The board alleges that at some unspecified time in the past, Erdman was working as the medical director of a medical spa where she prescribed drugs to a patient she didn’t see and then failed to follow up with the patient. The board settled the case by requiring Erdman to complete 30 hours of educational training on clinical supervision and documentation.
— Jean Havugimana, a licensed practical nurse who was recently charged by the board with leaving a nursing assignment without first ensuring the safety of his patients, and with committing an act or omission that might adversely affect a patient.
According to the board, Havugimana was working a 12-hour overnight shift at The Views of Marion, which operates the Oakview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, on Jan. 27, 2024. On that night, Havugimana was the only nurse on duty to assist two certified nursing assistants in caring for roughly 40 residents. The facility’s video surveillance allegedly shows Havugimana was inside the facility for less than three hours during his 12-hour shift, and that he repeatedly exited and reentered the building.
The board alleges that during the night, the two CNAs were unable to reach Havugimana to assist with residents’ needs; that Havugimana had the keys necessary to access residents’ medications; and that he was the only person on duty authorized to administer medications.
At one point during the night, Havugimana was “observed in his vehicle, parked in the lot, playing loud music with a female passenger,” the board alleges. At a board hearing on the matter, Havugimana claimed he was working his shift as required, but was busy caring for patients in other areas of the building. According to the board, he offered no explanation as to why his colleagues couldn’t locate him or reach him via their cellphones and walkie-talkies.
In resolving the case, the board suspended Havugimana’s license for one year and stipulated that after the license is reinstated, it will be placed on probationary status for one year. As part of that probation, Havugimana will have to complete additional educational training and submit to chemical screening.
In 2009, the board charged Havugimana with falsely claiming to have completed his educational requirements for licensing and for failing to inform the board of a conviction for driving while barred as a habitual offender. The board suspended Havugimana’s license as a result of those charges.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama judge Thursday blocked the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) from regulating freestanding birth centers as hospitals, delivering a victory to midwives in the state.
Montgomery Circuit Court Judge Greg Griffin’s ruling concluded that the Alabama Legislature did not authorize the ADPH to regulate midwifery care in birth centers as “hospitals,” saying that ADPH’s attempt to impose hospital regulations on Freestanding Birth Centers (FSBCs), which offer an out-of-hospital birth option, was unlawful.
“Because both legal rules of statutory construction and undisputed record evidence make clear that FSBCs do not provide ‘obstetrical care,’ and do not provide care ‘to the public generally,’ ADPH’s attempt to regulate them as ‘hospitals’ exceeds its statutory authority and violates the AAPA,” Griffin wrote in the ruling.

Messages seeking comment was left with ADPH and the Alabama Attorney General’s office.
Birth centers are health care facilities dedicated to childbirth and are centered around the midwifery model of care. They are often looked at as an in-between option for mothers not completely comfortable with home births or the medical setting of a hospital. Supporters also say that it provides another option for people with low-risk pregnancies in a state where about 34% of counties are considered maternity care deserts.
Dr. Heather Skanes, OB-GYN and owner of Oasis Family Birth Center in Birmingham, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in an interview Friday that the ruling allows her to keep operating without “the burdensome regulations that ADPH was planning to impose” on them. Since reopening after the preliminary injunction, Skanes said that her birth center has been “able to start caring for birthing people again.”
“We’ve been doing births without any issues, and we’ve continued to provide safe and effective prenatal, labor, delivery, postpartum care in an underserved area here in Birmingham,” Skanes said.
New rules approved by the ADPH in 2023 required Alabama birth centers to be overseen by a physician; be located within 30 minutes of an OB-GYN hospital and seek hospital licenses. Birth center advocates feared these regulations, especially the hospital licensing requirement, would make it challenging to serve low-risk pregnancies, particularly in rural areas of the state with poor maternal health outcomes that may lack health care providers..
The plaintiffs, including the birth centers, midwives, and the Alabama affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives, filed a lawsuit in August 2023. The plaintiffs argued that these rules would make it nearly impossible for them to provide midwifery care. The following month, Griffin blocked ADPH from enforcing hospital licensing requirements on birth centers.
In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represents the plaintiffs, said the rule would ensure access to equitable pregnancy care in Alabama, a state facing a maternal and infant health crisis. This crisis disproportionately affects Black women, low-income communities, and those living in rural areas with limited access to hospitals.
“We are elated that the dedicated midwives at Alabama’s birth centers can continue to provide crucial care to pregnant Alabamians across the state without undue interference,” said Whitney White, staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. “Midwifery care in birth centers is safe, can improve patient outcomes, and can play a critical role in expanding access to equitable pregnancy care in Alabama.”
JaTaune Bosby Gilchrist, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, said the ruling affirms the essentiality of midwife-led care.
“This ruling is a powerful affirmation of what birth workers, families, and communities across Alabama have long known: midwife-led care is essential,” Gilchrist said in a statement. “As hospitals and obstetric services close across the state, particularly in rural areas, birth centers and midwives are stepping in to fill a dangerous gap in access.”
Skanes said that she hopes the ruling “allows Alabama to really reconsider the way that we provide maternal care.” She said that birthing centers could be a solution to providing maternal care by placing them “in strategic areas around the state.” She said that Alabamians would benefit from an integrative approach to maternal care that utilizes both birth centers and hospitals.
 “I think that we really have to change our mindset as physicians and as Alabamians, that this care can really be integrated into the medical system,” Skanes said. “That it doesn’t have to be something that’s stigmatized, it doesn’t have to be something that is talked down upon, but it’s just another option for women and for birthing people, and it works in conjunction with the hospital.”

DemasThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between IPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a new, shorter timeline for its environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project.
In April, the Army Corps announced it would speed up its review of the tunnel project under a national energy emergency declared by President Donald Trump.
Friday’s announcement was the first time they gave specifics about Line 5 under the new emergency procedures.
The Army Corps will release the draft environmental review on May 30.
That starts the clock on public comment, with half as much time to give it under the new timeline — 30 days instead of 60.
Canada-based Enbridge has long sought to build a tunnel underneath the Straits of Mackinac to house a section of the Line 5 pipeline, which carries oil and natural gas liquids over 645 miles from Wisconsin to Ontario.
About four miles of the pipeline sits along the lakebed between Michigan’s two peninsulas. In 2020, Enbridge applied for a federal permit to build a tunnel for the pipeline and has said doing so would make it safer.
Opponents argue that the tunnel would further endanger the environment, the Great Lakes, and Indigenous ways of life. They also say Trump’s executive order undermines public input into such projects.
With the faster review process, the Army Corps could decide on a permit this fall — months earlier than previously planned.
The Army Corps permit process is one of the last major hurdles in this years’ long process for Enbridge — but not the final step. The company is redoing a permit for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.
“Our record of decision is estimated to be fall 2025,” said Army Corps spokesperson Carrie Fox in an email. “However, the Corps of Engineers permit cannot be issued before the EGLE permit is granted.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Aurelia Giacometto, the embattled secretary of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, has left the agency, according to a news release Friday from Gov. Jeff Landry.
The governor said Giacometto has accepted a position with Earth and Water Law, a firm in Washington, D.C. The governor has appointed Courtney Burdette to fill the vacancy left by Giacometto. 
Giacometto’s departure follows a year of tumult that began with high-ranking LDEQ executives resigning and publicly airing their complaints about her alleged harassment of subordinates. It was also brought to light that Giacometto used public money to travel to out-of-state political events with no obvious connection to her position in state government. 
The most recent high-end LDEQ resignation occurred Monday when its top financial executive left for another state agency, marking at least the 15th departure of a key employee under Giacometto’s tenure. Many of her highest-ranking lieutenants, several of whom were experienced civil servants, left after just a few months or weeks on the job. 
An Indiana native, Giacometto rose to political prominence as President Donald Trump’s appointee to head the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during his first term. After leaving her federal government post, she went on a speaking tour for the National Rifle Association, which she continued several months into her new job at LDEQ. She could not be reached for comment Friday.
Giacometto’s leadership style came under heightened scrutiny in March when Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack published the results of a workplace culture survey. Its results revealed pervasive low morale under her leadership, with some employees saying they felt pressured to violate the law or department policy. 
Roughly two weeks after the publication of that report, long-time LDEQ ombudsman Roger Ward abruptly resigned and disseminated a scathing seven-page letter detailing what he called “the increasingly erratic and alarmingly vicious behavior” of Giacometto. Ward said he wrote the letter in lieu of providing an exit interview, a long-established LDEQ practice Giacometto ended this year. 
“This is long overdue but fantastic news for the DEQ institutionally and its employees,” Ward said in an email reacting to Friday’s news. “Ms. Giacometto’s tenure at DEQ has been a nightmare for both new and career employees at the agency. The damage she has done to the agency is immense and it is a shame that it took so many complaints and departures to finally get the governor to address her egregious and narcissistic behavior. DEQ employees are rejoicing over her departure and are thrilled that the Governor has chosen Courtney Burdette as Giacometto’s replacement. Unlike Giacometto, Courtney has the intellect and temperament to lead the agency.”
Top financial official the latest to depart from Louisiana Dept. of Environmental Quality

Ward’s earlier polemic reinforced a similar departing letter from former LDEQ Undersecretary Chandra Pidgeon, who left the agency in March 2024 after just weeks of being hired. Pigeon similarly complained about Giacometto’s “harassment of longtime employees” and other actions.
“I have worked for 23 years for the state of Louisiana, and I have never encountered a leader so destructive, calculating, and callous,” she wrote.
None of that stopped the governor from praising Giacometto’s leadership throughout her time in office and again in his news release Friday.
“I want to sincerely thank Aurelia for her dedicated service to our State and the Department of Environmental Quality. Aurelia prioritized environmental improvements to our air, land, and water, while also keeping a focus on the jobs and businesses that often suffer from red-tape and overregulation,” Landry said. “We are grateful for her actions to improve the Department and wish her the best in her next endeavor.”
Burdette, Giacometto’s replacement, first joined the legal team at LDEQ in January 2014. She served as a permits supervisor of the department’s legal division before becoming general counsel in 2020 and later executive counsel.
Her experience also includes working as an attorney with the Louisiana Board of Ethics, and she was previously an assistant state attorney general who defended the state in a variety of tort cases, according to the governor’s office.
Burdette received a bachelor’s degree in English from Howard University and her law degree from LSU.
This is a developing story.

Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, co-chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, where the legislation originated as a committee bill with no individual  sponsor, told senators it was designed to “incentivize individuals to serve on our boards.”
No one asked if there is a dearth of individuals willing to accept a seat on one of the 16 quasi-public authorities that oversee, among other things, the Connecticut Lottery, Bradley International Airport and, yes, the insurance exchange whose mission is to help people find affordable health coverage.
The bill is similar to a provision slipped into a 235-page budget bill last year by a person or persons unknown, at least to the public, and then removed by leaders amid press inquiries. Such items, which often are drawn with a specific constituent or constituency in mind, are colorfully known at the Capitol as “rats.”
The rat was resurrected with a greater measure of transparency in Senate Bill 1384, a 13-line piece of legislation clearly labeled: “An Act Allowing Board Members of Quasi-Public Agencies to Obtain Health Insurance Coverage Under the State Employee Plan.”
But the exercise of going through the full legislative process — vetting by a committee and a public hearing — yielded no answer to basic questions about the bill’s origin and necessity: Where did it come from? Who sought it?
The Senate passed the bill on a 20-14 vote, with three Democrats joining all 11 Republicans in opposition. Two of the three Democratic dissenters, Sen. Matt Lesser of Middletown and Sen. Martha Marx of New London, also had voted against it in committee. 
Neither spoke during the debate in the Senate or in committee, but Marx said in an interview Friday, “No one could tell me the reason why we were doing that bill.”
Last year’s version only covered four quasi-public authorities, among them the Connecticut Airport Authority, whose board members include Vincent Mauro Jr., the New Haven Democratic chair and former chief of staff to Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
Mauro, now a government affairs advisor employed by McCarter & English, a New Jersey law firm with a law and lobbying presence in Connecticut, New York, and Washington D.C., said he was unaware of Senate Bill 1384 and had no role in its passage.
“I have good health insurance,” he said.
At the Capitol, there is no way to trace the DNA of legislation, aside from the record produced by legislative sponsors, advocates and opponents, public hearing testimony and debates in committee and on the floor. SB 1384 generated none of that. 
It was one of a dozen bills on a public hearing agenda of the insurance committee in March, but a review of the transcript shows no mention of the bill, pro or con. There was no written testimony offering praise, criticism or analysis from the quasi-publics, which would bear most of the cost of health care premiums.
Behind the scenes, the bill apparently generated no discussion among the lawmakers who screen bills before they come for a vote in committee, as SB 1384 did on March 13, the last day the Insurance and Real Estate Committee sent bills to the floor.
As is the case with all committee meetings, a video record is available on CT-N.
“I don’t remember going over this bill in screening or talking about it,” Rep. Cara Pavalock-D’Amato, R-Bristol, told fellow committee members in March. She did remember the same idea surfaced a year or two ago, “I think, as a rat.”
Cabrera ignored the rat reference and briefly explained the bill as providing board members access to the state employee plan for the duration of their service, requiring them to pay the same share of the premium as employees, which averages 15%.
“Who put in this bill?” Pavalock-D’Amato asked. “Does anybody know where this bill originated from?”
Cabrera noted there were 16 quasi-publics listed at the bottom of the bill.
She said she understood that. 
“But where is this bill coming from?” she asked. “Is there anybody specific, or any group, that has pushed this bill?”
“So, it was a bill that I originally spearheaded,” Cabrera said, adding he had been “talking to several legislators.”
That was the extent of the origin story of SB 1384.
Rep. Kerry Wood, D-Rocky Hill, the House co-chair of the committee, told Cabrera at the meeting she was willing to move the bill out of committee to the Senate floor but offered no assurance of voting for passage if it reached the House.
“I am going to reluctantly support this bill to get it moving forward,” Wood said then. “But I have said this over and over again, that I would like to see us stop putting bills forward to add anyone that needs health insurance to the state employee plan.”
She reiterated her reluctance to support the bill Thursday after the Senate voted and Cabrera briefly met with Wood outside the House chamber. Wood said she was unsure the bill would get called for a floor vote in the House — of what she would do if it did.
Tom Swan, the executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, typically applauds anything that expands availability to health care. Not so this time, even though he could be a potential beneficiary. He sits on the board of a quasi-public, the State Education Resource Center.
“We support opening up the state employee health plan for everybody, not just political insiders,” Swan said of CCAG. He laughed and added, “As a board member of a quasi-public, I’ll decline the opportunity to enroll if presented.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/capitollastnight-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Despite possibly facing contempt sanctions, Attorney General James Uthmeier won’t tell law enforcement to comply with a federal judge’s order suspending an immigration law that led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams is considering holding Uthmeier in contempt over his greenlighting of arrests under a law making it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien” — despite her order temporarily blocking enforcement.
The law adds heightened penalties for re-entry.
In his first acknowledgement of the possible sanctions reported Tuesday, Uthmeier told Fox News Digital that he won’t tell law enforcement to “stop fulfilling their constitutional duties.” The attorney general’s press secretary didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from the Florida Phoenix.
“I do not believe an AG should be held in contempt for respecting the rule of law and appropriate separation of powers,” Uthmeier said. “The ACLU is dead set on obstructing President Donald Trump’s efforts to detain and deport illegals, and we are going to fight back. We will vigorously defend our laws and advance President Trump’s agenda on illegal immigration.”
U.S. judge slams state AG for calling court’s block on immigration law illegitimate

Williams scheduled a hearing on May 29 in the Miami federal court to discuss sanctions against Uthmeier over his defiance of her court order in his April 23 letter to law enforcement stating that there wasn’t a legitimate order stopping them from arresting people under the entry and reentry law.
But that April 23 letter was a pivot from another letter Uthmeier sent five days earlier, telling law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs that they shouldn’t arrest anyone under SB 4C, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed on Feb. 13 and Williams temporarily blocked on April 4.
“Color me surprised and shocked,” Williams said, asking what had happened in the five days between the letters, during a Tuesday hearing.
His office did not say whether Uthmeier would attend the hearing. Uthmeier has been attorney general since February. DeSantis appointed his former chief of staff to replace Ashley Moody after her ascension to the U.S. Senate, another appointment by the governor.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Law’s suspension
Along with the contemplation of sanctions, Williams on Tuesday suspended the law for the remainder of the litigation. However, the defendants — Uthmeier, the statewide prosecutor, and state attorneys — almost immediately filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. They’ve also asked Williams to remove her block.
The Florida Immigrant Coalition, The Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought the suit against the state claiming the law is unconstitutional because federal law governs entry into the country.
“This case is about more than one law — it’s about whether our leaders will follow the Constitution,” said Amy Godshall, an immigrants’ rights attorney at the ACLU of Florida, in a press release Wednesday.
Americans for Immigrant Justice and the Community Justice Project attorneys also represent the plaintiffs.
Uthmeier’s argument is that the court’s order doesn’t apply to law enforcement, including the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Highway Patrol, because those entities are not named defendants and he lacks authority to discipline them.
Still, Williams showed irritation with that argument Tuesday, saying Uthmeier’s statements on social media showed he exercises authority over law enforcement agencies.
The defendants’ position that arrests should continue even if prosecutors can’t carry forward the cases raised grave constitutional concerns with due process, Williams wrote in her order.
Continued arrests following the suspension of the law had also prompted frustration from Williams, who mentioned in her order the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Leon County.
An FHP trooper arrested Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, on April 16. The case garnered national attention following the Florida Phoenix’s reporting of the arrest without probable cause and Lopez-Gomez’s subsequent release from the Leon County Jail.
No arrests under the suspended law have taken place since Williams further clarified on April 18 that her order applies to law enforcement, Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey DeSousa told Williams during the Tuesday hearing.

Prison staff, state human services employees, lawmakers, judicial officials and community providers spent a morning learning about the complicated process of getting out of prison. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s first reentry simulation mimics the bureaucratic morass of leaving prison.","Participants at a reentry simulation hosted by the Vermont Department of Corrections attempt to receive forms of identification. By Ethan Weinstein/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — About 95% of people incarcerated in Vermont will one day leave prison. But getting out — and staying out — relies on a system that often appears rigged against those reentering society. “The system as it’s built today forces individuals to jump through hoops that many of us in this room would struggle through, even in the best of circumstances,” Nick Deml, Vermont Department of Corrections commissioner, told participants at the state’s first ever reentry simulation. More than 50 people, including prison staff, state human services employees, lawmakers, judicial officials and community social services providers spent Friday morning reenacting the brutal bureaucracy people leaving prison face every day. Those exiting incarceration often start life from scratch — forced to acquire basic identification, obtain employment and find housing —  all while battling food insecurity and lack of transportation. The morning’s simulation, which led participants through the cascading steps of reentry, was the brainchild of Maurice Q. Jones, chair of the Philadelphia Reentry Coalition. Jones spent years of his life incarcerated and has devoted the years since helping improve reentry services.  “This is a way for folks to gain empathy to effectuate change,” he said in an interview, describing the event. “When I came home, there was almost zero hope. And I felt like there was a greater need to do this work than to do anything else.”   Inside the Capitol Plaza Hotel, attendees began the session by each adopting the identity of someone just leaving prison, outlined in a series of provided materials. Those documents described the person’s criminal history, housing (or lack thereof), financial situation, employment status, probation requirements, and existing forms of ID. Across four 15-minute “weeks,” each participant needed to complete a variety of tasks, like passing drug screenings, attending Alcoholics Anonymous and counseling, and meeting with a probation officer, all while trying to find employment and stay out of trouble. During “week one,” the line to acquire a birth certificate, Social Security card and state ID snaked across the hotel conference room. During every interaction, participants needed to turn over “transportation cards” representing their ride to the appointment, each of which cost money. And even small transactions like filling out forms came with fees. Low on cash? Donate blood plasma up to twice per week, or pawn a guitar or laptop — just don’t expect much money in return. In almost every instance, an interaction required three forms of ID. Between “weeks,” participants vented about the orchestrated chaos. They’d failed to pay rent, forcing them to report to a shelter. People skipped meals, missed probation appointments, stood next in line for an appointment only to hear the closing bell. At times, the futility of every step appeared to baffle attendees. One participant voiced frustration that despite submitting to three drug tests, she was told she never submitted a test at all, barring her from employment. She thought the hiccup in the simulation was unrealistic.“In real life, they wouldn’t be able to lie,” she said.Katie Jones, a recovery coaching supervisor at Turning Point Center of Central Vermont, who was volunteering at the simulation, suggested otherwise.“You might be surprised.”By the fourth round, some attendees appeared too frustrated to continue. Large sheets of paper meant for participants to write down feelings and impressions started to fill with exasperation: “headache,” “overwhelmed,” “defeated,” “cheated,” “jail is easier.”To Timothy Burgess, an advocate for incarcerated people in Vermont who is himself formerly incarcerated, the simulation’s hair-tearing nature rang true. On Friday, he found himself on the other side of the system, playing the part of probation officer. As he watched the red-faced participants fumble through the process, he couldn’t help but empathize with POs, and he hoped the event might inspire change. “This is an amazing opportunity.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s first reentry simulation mimics the bureaucratic morass of leaving prison.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vermont-DOC-reentry-simulation-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C729&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-02 17:09:21.384894

Interview: Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita Drops A Bombshell On Why Indiana Immigration Bill Died… pic.twitter.com/jqrUH2fRCj

Rokita, in an archived April 30 interview with conservative radio host Casey Hendrickson, said the bill “stalled” because “someone had a personal grudge against the language,” naming Fort Wayne Sen. Liz Brown as the barrier. 
“… (She) told me one of the reasons was she’s got a family member who’s an illegal alien,” Rokita told Hendrickson.
In a statement shared with the Indiana Capital Chronicle, a spokesperson for Brown called the claim “blatantly false.”
“Senator Brown does not have an illegal alien relative. This claim by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita is blatantly false, and is meant to be misleading to Indiana constituents to make them think that Senator Brown has a personal conflict in performing her duties as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee,” said her legislative office said. “These public erroneous statements are made in an attempt to hurt the credibility and transparency needed and expected in the Indiana state legislative process.”
Brown went on to confirm that she’d filed an official grievance and request for an investigation into Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission.
Relevant background
The underlying bill, House Bill 1531, would have required local law enforcement officers to comply with federal detainer requests for undocumented immigrants. It would have also banned employers from hiring unauthorized residents. 
Though the bill passed out of the House on a 64-26 vote, it never got a hearing in the Senate, where it was assigned to Brown’s committee. As the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brown has the power to select which bills get a hearing — though bills can be reassigned to other committees to circumvent a chair. 
When author Rep. J.D. Prescott was asked about the bill’s demise by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, he referred questions to Brown. 
Brown, an attorney, said she’d shared concerns with Rokita about the legislation “early in the legislative process.” The statement cited the condensed timeline during a budget-writing session and said Hoosiers had shared issues regarding potential impacts, including the possibility of a conflict with federal law.
Rokita weighs in on federal education moves, Indiana immigration bill

Instead, the office pointed to her support for House Enrolled Act 1393, which would require local law enforcement to notify federal immigration authorities about undocumented immigrants in custody.
“(Brown) commends President Trump for the decisive actions he has taken federally to stop the flow of illegal immigration,” the statement concluded.
Rokita fired back, saying in a statement that Brown either “provided inaccurate or unclear information to me and others in the past, or she is backtracking now.”
“As for a disciplinary complaint, Liz can get in line. She didn’t give my office the authority to investigate illegal aliens, but she wants others to investigate me over comments she made. How ironic,” Rokita said. “This is also another example of weaponization of the Indiana court system to attempt to silence me and the people of this state who are tired of sending representatives to Indianapolis who don’t really represent them.”
He went on to accuse the disciplinary commission of encouraging “this political lawfare” by endorsing political candidates, making donations and accepting complaints from “politically partisan people.” 
Rokita has faced the disciplinary commission before. He continues to litigate a case in which he called a practicing OB-GYN an “activist acting as a doctor” after she mentioned seeing a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio travel to Indiana for an abortion. She was later fined by the Medical Licensing Board for sharing patient information — a move supported by Rokita. 
Though reprimanded by the state’s Supreme Court justices, a subsequent press release from Rokita’s office and his public statements have prompted further scrutiny.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s snowpacks melted a month earlier than usual, making a bad water situation worse for New Mexico’s rivers and the people and ecosystems depending on them.
Climate change delivered a double-whammy on top of record low snow for New Mexico, said Andrew Mangham, a senior service hydrologist for National Weather Service in Albuquerque.
The ripple of the rapid melt has hurt Utah and Colorado as well, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration May 1 drought report. Governors for Washington state and Utah declared states of emergencies for drought in their states.

Federal projections for the upper Rio Grande expect only 12% of normal water from snow will make it to the river. Snow accounts for three-quarters of the river’s supply.
“We’ve already seen the bump in all of the rivers from snowmelt, that peak flow is already past us now,” Mangham said, estimating the state experienced the second-driest winter in 130 years. “In terms of volume going through any point on the river, our forecasts all show it’s somewhere between a third to a half of what is normal.”
New Mexico’s meager snowpack and current water conditions bode poorly for fire season, as windy and hot conditions are expected to continue, and the lack of winter moisture left forests drier than usual.
“We’re looking at a nightmare of a fire weather season, I’m not gonna sugarcoat that,” Mangham said.
Overall, the short term forecasts predict New Mexico’s weather to be warmer, drier and windier, although possible storms could cause some spring flooding — such as in the Ruidoso burn scar this weekend.
Long range forecasts paint a potentially brighter picture for the seasonal summer rains, which are possibly going to be stronger than usual in the western part of the state, while the remainder is looking like it will be typical.
“But we still gotta make it through the spring to get to monsoon season,” Mangham said.

SPRINGFIELD — Two Democratic leaders in the Illinois Senate openly expressed their disagreement this week about Gov. JB Pritzker’s proposal to allow community colleges to offer four-year bachelor’s degree programs in certain high-demand employment fields.

The exchange between Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, of Westchester, and Sen. Cristina Castro, of Elgin, who chairs the powerful Senate Executive Committee, took place during a hearing on an unrelated bill that would overhaul the way Illinois funds public universities. But it offered a public view of the reasons why the baccalaureate proposal, which Pritzker touted in his budget address in February, has so far failed to advance in the General Assembly.

Both the university funding proposal (Senate Bill 13 and House Bill 1581) and the community college proposal (HB 3717 and SB 2482) are intended to stem the spiraling cost to students and their families of obtaining a four-year college degree.

The funding proposal calls for increasing state funding for universities to reduce their reliance on tuition and fees. The community college proposal is intended to make certain four-year degrees available through lower-cost institutions and more accessible to older, nontraditional students who don’t live near a four-year institution.

The university funding plan, sponsored by Lightford, was the subject of a Senate committee hearing Wednesday. The bill allowing community colleges to offer four-year baccalaureate degrees did not advance out of a House committee before a March 21 deadline.

During Wednesday’s hearing, Lightford appeared with a panel of university presidents from Chicago State, Western Illinois, Illinois State and Northern Illinois universities, and the Southern Illinois University System – all of whom support the funding proposal but oppose the community college baccalaureate plan.

“If we're thinking about students’ basic needs, we also need to be thinking about the students that don't necessarily go to the four-year schools,” Castro said to the panel. “If students are really the focus, why are you guys opposed to the (four)-year baccalaureate degrees?”

“I’d like to answer your question, madam chair, because I believe it has zero to do with what we're trying to accomplish here,” Lightford replied.

She said the university funding proposal was the product of four years of negotiations that were intended to address a specific set of issues facing universities – namely, the adequacy and equity of their funding systems. The community college proposal, she argued, would draw students away from universities that are already struggling to maintain enrollment levels.

“Community college students need to stay at the two-year community college level, and then students who are going for a bachelor's degree should stay at the university level,” Lightford said. “Because what happens is, when you begin to offer four-year programs at a two-year school, those students who would traditionally go to the four-year university, we’ll lose those students to the community college level.”

During the exchange with Castro, Lightford referred to the community college proposal as “your bill,” even though Castro is not listed as a sponsor or cosponsor of the Senate version. Castro corrected Lightford, saying: “To be fair, it is the governor's bill. This is one of his initiatives that he has been working on.”

But Lightford said the governor “doesn’t push a button on the floor or in a committee.”

“I like the governor,” she said. “He’s probably my favorite. … But this isn’t that bill.”

Dan Mahony, president of the SIU System, added that he does not oppose the concept of community colleges offering bachelor’s degrees, and said negotiations are continuing on that proposal. He said he wants to make sure the final plan “doesn't pit our universities and community colleges against each other in a way that's unproductive and not good for taxpayers and not good for students.”

“We want to do something that actually is productive, and that's what we're working towards, and we'll continue to work towards,” he said

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature intends to use investment revenue to pay for the implementation of Proposition 130, the measure voters approved last fall to direct $350 million to law enforcement.
Under a bill nearing final passage, local law enforcement agencies would get at least $15,000 per year to use for recruitment, continuing education and additional compensation. Surviving spouses or family members of an officer killed during duty would receive a $1 million survivor’s benefit.
To pay for it, members of the bipartisan Joint Budget Committee want to send $500 million to the Public Employees Retirement Association to invest.
“The bill before you represents a fair and faithful, balanced implementation of the voters’ intent, while ensuring that we can continue to fund equally-important priorities across our state budget and maintain our necessary reserves,” Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat, told the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday.

Proposition 130, backed by the conservative nonprofit Advance Colorado, passed with about 53% of the vote last November. That means lawmakers needed to grapple with its implementation during an ultra-tight budget year in which they already faced a $1.2 billion gap.
Senate Bill 25-310 would establish the Peace Officer Support and Training Fund, which would receive an initial transfer of $15 million in general fund money next year. Then, $500 million from the state’s general fund reserve — money set aside as a buffer for emergencies — would get sent to PERA to invest. Up to $35 million generated from that investment would be sent to the support fund annually, and other revenue would be used to offset a portion of what the state owes to PERA for pension liability every year.
The plan is to always have $15 million per year in the law enforcement support fund. Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican, said that the average return on PERA investments is about 7%. An expected average annual return of $35 million on the investment would mean the Legislature would fulfill its $350 million obligation under Proposition 130 in 10 years.
“This is how we are using our existing state assets to generate revenues to meet the voters’ intent,” Bird said.
Local law enforcement agencies would get at least $15,000 per year, and if there is enough revenue available, additional money using a formula based on department size. That would begin in December 2026. Agencies would need to prove compliance with allowable spending through an annual audit.
Adam Turk with the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police told lawmakers in committee that the funding mechanism would not kick in fast enough.
“The funding structure as currently written, delays the impact of this critical investment far beyond the time frame in which departments need it most,” he said. “The timeline does not align with the pressing public safety, staffing and resource challenges agencies are facing today. Proposition 130 was passed by voters with the expectation that the funding would help stabilize and strengthen law enforcement capacity now, not decades into the future.”
The Colorado Municipal League, Colorado Counties Inc. County Sheriffs of Colorado and the Colorado Fraternal Order of Police support the bill.
It passed the Senate unanimously on Tuesday. It needs to clear the House floor, including debate and preliminary voice vote followed by a final recorded vote on a separate day, before the end of the legislative session on May 7. Representatives began that debate on Thursday, but the preliminary vote was delayed on that day and again on Friday morning.
