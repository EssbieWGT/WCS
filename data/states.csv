(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) As Utah’s capital city has faced pressure from state leaders to crack down on crime, camping and drugs, Salt Lake City’s new police chief is seeking a nearly $15 million — or 12.4% — bump to the Salt Lake City Police Department’s budget. 
Chief Brian Redd — whom Mayor Erin Mendenhall appointed earlier this year to replace former police Chief Mike Brown after she pushed him to retire — gave his first budget presentation in front of the Salt Lake City Council on Thursday, when he made his case for an increase to the city police force’s budget. 
“We understand this is a flat budget year and a challenging year,” Redd told council members, acknowledging that his request may be tough for city leaders to fund based on projected revenues, but he thanked them for considering his proposal.
Corrections director Brian Redd recommended as Salt Lake City’s new police chief

Redd asked that city leaders consider bringing the Salt Lake City Police Department’s budget from $120 million this year to $135 million for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins July 1. The vast majority of his request — more than $13.3 million — would be for a roughly 8.7% increase to police wages and benefits that were negotiated through union agreements. 
Additionally, the increase would continue to fund 12 new police officer positions that city leaders recently approved to create two squads dedicated to patrolling the Jordan River Trail and surrounding neighborhoods — areas that have been impacted by homelessness issues and illegal camping. 
Notably, Redd’s request did not include any more full-time officer positions on top of the 12 that were added in the middle of the budget year. Currently, the Salt Lake City Police Department has 779 full-time employees. That includes 630 sworn officers and 149 civilian staff positions, according to city documents.

Of those positions, about 45 sworn officer roles are currently vacant, up from 22 vacant positions in January 2024, when the department was authorized to staff up to 608 officers. After the department’s authorized officer staffing increased to 630, the number of vacant positions also increased, “reflecting the ongoing challenge of recruiting to meet expanding personnel needs,” according to a city staff report. 
“The Department is prioritizing the filling of these vacancies and has initiated a refinement of its sworn recruitment strategy,” the staff report says, “including expanding the recruitment team, streamlining the hiring and onboarding process, and allowing candidates to begin onboarding immediately following successful background checks.”
More money for a new ‘intelligence hub’ and drones
The budget proposal also includes $519,350 in one-time money and $35,325 in ongoing money to fund a Real Time Crime Center (RTCC) — which is envisioned to be a “centralized intelligence hub that leverages real-time data to enhance proactive policing, threat detection, and emergency response,” according to the staff report. 
State leaders call SLC police ‘ineffective,’ urge mayor to act — or state will step in 

Redd said police officials are hoping to better utilize technology, “primarily cameras and license plate readers that will help us reduce crime, respond to crime more quickly and efficiently when it occurs.” 
“By integrating data streams from public safety cameras, drone footage, and other analytical tools, the RTCC will support smarter deployment decisions, more effective threat assessments, enhanced response times, and improved patrol planning across the city,” the report continues, adding that it “directly supports the goals outlined” in the mayor’s public safety plan.
Once up and running, the RTCC is envisioned to “triage calls for service using live feeds and real-time analysis, allowing the Department to tailor its response strategies based on up-to-the-minute information,” the staff report says. “The Center will also enable integration with fixed public safety cameras and drone video streams, and it is expected to expand into real-time
monitoring of social media platforms as part of the Department’s evolving threat management efforts.”
Redd is also asking the City Council to use $95,000 in one-time money and $53,550 in ongoing money to fund a new “drone as first responder” program, which would be designed to “utilize drones as an initial response tool in place of an in-person officer dispatch when appropriate.” 
“This model allows for rapid assessment of scenes, provides real-time situational awareness to responding officers, and enables more efficient use of Department resources — particularly in instances where a physical presence may not be necessary,” the city staff report says.

The Salt Lake City Police Department has already been testing using drones to help officers. It launched a pilot program on Jan. 1, and since then the police department has conducted more than 420 drone deployments, according to the staff report. So far, they’ve only been used to “assess low-priority calls, such as 911 hang-ups, reports of suspicious activity, and incidents later determined to be unfounded.” 
Redd said he’s asking for funding to set up a new program to “actually deploy drones to active calls.” 
‘Fed up’: SLC mayor answers Utah leaders’ call for plan to ‘restore public safety’

Through an expanded drone program, department leaders hope to improve response times, offer better real-time information to officers, and free up more officers for “high-priority emergencies” while reducing the number of officers needed on scene in certain situations. 
“This is also a great de-escalation tool,” Redd said, adding that “the drone can go ahead of the officers to identify, does this person have a weapon? Are there citizens around? What do we do with traffic? So this is something we want to build out in the future.” 
Redd said the current budget request would act as “seed funding to really get this program off the ground,” and he added that “we will likely be coming back” with more budget requests in the future, not only for more drones but potentially for more full-time positions to support the program. 
“Ultimately what we hope is that investment will reduce the need to send officers to certain calls, or if we send officers, have eyes on before officers get to the situation for de-escalation purposes and safety purposes for our officers and the public,” Redd said. 
City Council warmly receives Redd’s proposal, but wants discussion on privacy
City Council member Alejandro Puy said he was supportive of the request, but also urged city leaders to be cautious and mindful when it comes to privacy concerns if they’re going to proceed with an expanded drone program. 
“Now, it seems to me that as a department we are evolving and growing and using new technologies,” Puy said, adding that more cameras, a monitoring center and “more drones” could open up “a lot of potential problems.”

“The only way I feel like approving this is (if) there’s a legislative intent from our side to have a deep policy discussion for the use, the monitoring, of drones and cameras, accounting for civil liberties questions, the privacy, the right of privacy, also accountability, transparency, all of these things that need to be in policy,” Puy said. “Because if not, we are probably walking ourselves into a problem waiting to happen.” 
While Puy added “it’s important to approve this,” he said city leaders need to ensure “people using it know what is appropriate and what is not. … All of these potential things that could go wrong, (but) also highlighting for our neighbors the use of this and how it could go right.” 
Redd said his department is already “working on that” with the mayor’s office, “and would love to engage all of you and also your communities that you represent.” He added that “we’re also engaged at the state level, with the state’s data privacy officer and legislators are also looking at this.” 
“We want to get it right,” Redd said. “That’s important.” 
The Salt Lake City Council has until the end of June to finalize the budget for the coming fiscal year, which begins July 1.

Republican voters will have the choice between Heather Doyle, Clint Hollingsworth, Dan McWhorter and Cindy Myrex on July 15. The lone Democratic candidate, Matt Glover, will advance to the general election on Oct. 28 against the winner of the special election primary. If one Republican candidate does not receive 50% of votes, the special runoff election will take place on Aug. 12.
Former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April after he was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session. All interviewed candidates said they are running for office for Cullman County representation in Montgomery. 
“You didn’t ask how anybody that lives there, how they felt about it,” Doyle said. “This is our community, like we live there. This is going to affect us.”
“My plan is to represent the folks in this district like I have my constituents with the city,” Hollingsworth said. “I’m gonna work hard for them, just like what I’ve done for the last 17 years on the city council, for the folks here that voted for me.”
“I didn’t think we were getting much representation on the issues that I thought were important, so I figured I’d get involved,” McWhorter said.
Efforts to schedule an interview with Myrex were not successful.
Doyle, Glover and McWhorter also expressed opposition to SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills. It was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey on May 7 and allowed the City of Cullman to annex a resort on Smith Lake in Cullman County, a dry county, for the resort to serve alcohol. 
“I mean, there’s nothing I can do about that, even though I know that’s the main concentration for the election. I just think it’s wrong,” Doyle said.
“We’re exploring what it would take to rescind the legislation,” McWhorter said.
Glover’s first priority in his campaign is giving the people more power, which he said was not present when the legislation passed.
The Republican primary
Doyle, 43, is a former teacher and realtor in the Smith Lake area of Cullman County. She wants to reform the court system, inspired by an ongoing custody battle in her personal life that she declined to explain because of potential implications in the litigation.
“I think we just need a better system, like something for inmates to even go to rehab,” she said in an interview Monday. “I just think we need to do something better.”
She also wants to reduce wasteful spending and government overreach by reviewing where state taxpayer dollars are going.
“I think we need to look closer at the budget and what we’re spending and the programs,” she said.
Finally, she wants to improve education in the state and be a voice for children in education and in custody battles.
“They don’t get like issues that are going on with the court system, with kids, it’s just not a man thing. They’re not worried about kids, and they’re not worried about women,” she said. “And I just think we’ve got a lot of things going on with juveniles in the court system that I think just needs to be handled differently.”
The first-time candidate said she is the best for the job because she will not rely on the politics of lawmaking to pass legislation. 
“Nobody’s going to be able to bribe me, I don’t owe anybody a favor,” she said. “I really think this is how politics work.”
Hollingsworth, 47, owns a used car dealership in Cullman. He said in an interview on May 27 that he is prioritizing education and work force development.
“Investing in public education and job training programs is vital to prepare our students for future employment opportunities,” he said.
He also said he wants the state to support volunteer fire departments more. There are 983 volunteer fire departments in the state, 23 of which are in Cullman County, according to the Alabama Forestry Commission.
“There’s 17 in this district that I’m running for, and I want to help with funding and training and just trying to get people willing to serve and help their community,” Hollingsworth said.
He also said he wants to improve transportation infrastructure.
“Reliable transportation is essential for employment, education and our health care,” he said. “Not just the county roads, but even 65 and interstate highways just need upgrades for sure.”
The former Cullman County City Councilman said he is the best candidate because of his tenure on city council, which he has served on since 2008.
“It’s a new challenge for me, but it encompasses areas that I’m already kind of used to,” he said. “I’m just looking forward to helping and serving more people.”
McWhorter, 68, has been a sales manager for Innovative Analytical Solutions in Bremen, Alabama, for a decade. McWhorter said in an interview on May 21 that his main priority is to implement a property tax cap for property owners who are at least 65 years old.
“Property ownership is either a right or it’s a privilege,” McWhorter said. “So if it’s a right, we don’t tax free speech, right? So why are you taxing my property?”
Aside from that, McWhorter also wants a “clean lottery bill” that would fund two years of tuition at technical colleges. The legislature failed to pass a comprehensive gaming bill in 2024, and the House rejected any attempts at another from the Senate this year.
“The second one is a clean lottery bill that’ll fund two-year college tuition, or two years of college tuition for any high school graduate with a C average,” he said.
Lastly, McWhorter wants to completely eliminate the tax on overtime, which is set to expire on June 30. He also mentioned eliminating daylight savings time as a goal.
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, an original supporter of the bill, has said the exemption created a larger hole in the Education Trust Fund (ETF) than expected. President Donald Trump has advocated for a national exemption in his second term.
The lone Democrat
Glover, 40, served on the Good Hope City Council from 2012-2016. He wants to prioritize local power. 
“Returning power to local communities, like just trying to wrestle away some of the power that the state government has taken from like local cities and towns, which plays in with SB 322,” Glover said in an interview on May 23.
He also said he opposes HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, which was signed into law on May 14. The bill requires testing and labeling for all consumable hemp products and caps at 10 milligrams per individually wrapped product and 40 milligrams per package. It will require the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board to license retailers of these products, restrict retail establishments selling hemp products and impose an excise tax on consumable hemp products.
“With the amount of jobs that I think that’s going to cost, and the amount of like, government overreach that is involved with it is pretty disgusting,” he said.
Finally, Glover wants to advocate for direct ballot initiatives in order for Alabamians to have a say in a state lottery. Nineteen states have direct ballot initiatives, which allow citizens to propose constitutional amendments.
“A lot of that goes back to us not being able to get the lottery amendment on the ballot, like sports gambling, any number of things, but where they just won’t pass it in Montgomery to allow the citizens to vote,” he said.
Glover said he is running for office to show the people of the district that there are Democrats and that they deserve to be represented.
“We still exist. And I think there’s just a lack of enthusiasm and motivation,” he said. “When you see a statewide ballot with no Democrats running, it makes people less likely to turn out, and then it looks like that they’re just not there.”

,California,2025-06-03 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles County’s chief executive will be one of California’s most powerful political gigs,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/los-angeles-county-powerful-ceo/,"A minor miracle occurred when Los Angeles County voters last year approved several governance reforms, including creating an elected county executive, a position that would be second in California's real-world power only to governor.","After California became a U.S. state in 1850, its Legislature grappled with how state and local governments would be structured. One decree was that counties, beginning with Los Angeles, would have five-member boards of supervisors.
Almost everything about California’s governance has changed in the last 175 years — even the size of its Legislature, which an 1879 constitutional amendment set at 80 members in the Assembly and 40 in the Senate.
With one exception, the city and county of San Francisco, California’s counties have had five-member governing boards ever since, including tiny Alpine County, with scarcely 1,000 residents, and Los Angeles, with nearly 10 million.
That’s going to change. Last year, after decades of unsuccessful efforts to overhaul how Los Angeles County is governed, a minor miracle occurred when its voters approved an expansion of its Board of Supervisors to nine members after the 2030 census. It was miraculous not only that it occurred but that the reform was proposed by the current board itself — albeit not unanimously — in a remarkable display of willingness to dilute members’ powers. 
Even more stunningly, the ballot measure also made a quantum reduction in the board’s powers by creating the elective office of county executive with potentially sweeping authority to govern the county, much as California’s governor or a big city mayor does.
Given Los Angeles County’s immense population exceeds all but 10 states, as well as its outsized economic, cultural and political weight, the ballot measure instantly created a position that would be second in real-world power only to the governorship. The occupant would automatically become a potential governor or U.S. senator.
The exact extent of the county executive’s authority, however, was not spelled out in the ballot measure. Instead, Measure G created a 13-member Governance Reform Task Force that will recommend the details of implementing its provisions, including the county executive’s authority.
The task force, reflecting the county’s extremely diverse economic, cultural and political communities, held its first meeting last week and the executive’s powers were a preoccupation of its members, some of whom opposed Measure G.
As the Los Angeles Times’ account of the meeting put it, “Should the chief executive be able to hire and fire department heads? What are the veto powers? How much control will the executive have over the county’s purse strings?”
The Times quoted Marcel Rodarte, a task force member who heads the California Contract Cities Association, as worrying about a bombastic executive “running amok and burning bridges unnecessarily,” adding, “It’s a possibility it could happen. I want to make sure that those nine supervisors have the ability to rein in the CEO.”
Rodarte’s members, which comprise dozens of small Los Angeles cities, contract with the county for such things as police patrols and fire protection, so they are concerned about who will be sitting across the table in contract negotiations. County employee unions expressed similar reservations about labor contracts.
One of the big questions is whether the county executive will have a term limit.
Governors, legislators and other state officeholders have term limits. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s second term will end in 19 months and has publicly cited the impending end of his governorship in seeking action on his priority issues.
As it stands, the county executive will not be term-limited, and that potentially looms large in the task force’s recommendations for amending the county charter.
There’s not a lot of room for protracted debates among task force members because the first county executive will be elected in 2028. Every ambitious Los Angeles politician will be weighing a campaign and everyone needs to know what the winner can — and cannot — do after being inaugurated.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/060620-Kenneth-Hahn-Hall-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

About the Health Fund
Governor Thomas R. Carper signed Senate Bill 8 into law on July 20, 1999, creating the Delaware Health Fund to improve health care access and invest in long-term public health initiatives.
Authored by Senator Patricia M. Blevins, the legislation directed all funds received by Delaware through the national tobacco Master Settlement Agreement into a dedicated account for health-related purposes.
The law also established the Delaware Health Fund Advisory Committee (DHFAC), which will advise the Governor and General Assembly on how to allocate expected funds each fiscal year.
The committee’s recommendations will align with the fund’s core goals, which include expanding access to affordable health care, enhancing health infrastructure, promoting preventive care, and reducing tobacco and substance use.
Funds may also support innovative medical testing, treatment for lesser-known chronic diseases, and payment assistance programs for residents managing recurring medical costs.
To apply to Health Fund
Interested applicants must submit their materials electronically to James.Berryhill@delaware.gov, copying Susan.Bailey@delaware.gov.
All applications should be in PDF format and include the organization’s name at the beginning of the file name.
The Delaware Health Fund is supported by annual payments the state receives through the Master Settlement Agreement with participating tobacco manufacturers.
These funds support a range of public health initiatives across the state.

Ivey’s office announced in a news release Friday the 11 new members and four returning members of the newly constituted board, who include representatives from various Alabama veterans service organizations.
“I am proud to assemble a strong and wide-ranging Board of veterans to serve all of their fellow veterans,” Ivey said in the statement.

Four board members kept their positions in the newly constituted board: Deborah Walker and Charles Waugh from the Disabled American Veterans; retired Colonel Anne Toms of the Military Officers Association of America and retired Colonel Scott Gedling of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who served as the Board’s vice chair.
New appointees include retired Colonel Larry Vannoy, retired Colonel Walter Kozak and John Keen, Jr. of American Legion; Jeffrey Fisher of American Veterans; Sergeant Brandi Whitman of Disabled American Veterans; John Burks of Marine Corps League; Michael Urquhart of Military Officers Association of America; Lorenzo Nathan of Military Order of the Purple Heart; Robert Schmidbauer of The Veterans of Foreign Wars; Michael Davis of Vietnam Veterans of America and retired Colonel Lori Rasmussen of the U.S. Air Force.
The appointments come after the passage of SB 67, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Jones, R-Centre, in March, which overhauled the Department of Veterans Affairs. While the legislation kept the board at its current size of 17 members, it removed its power to enact policies and rules, making it an advisory role to the governor’s office. The new law also grants the governor the authority to appoint the agency’s commissioner. Proponents of the restructuring argued that the bill was meant to improve services for Alabama’s veterans, saying it would “elevate” veterans’ needs.
The legislative change came after a contentious period between the governor and the previous board. Ivey had fired former Commissioner Kent Davis over a dispute concerning his management of federal grants. After Ivey demanded Davis’ resignation and his refusal to resign, the former board members voted to keep him in his post, stating they found no evidence of wrongdoing. Davis subsequently resigned, but an attorney for Davis has indicated the possibility of legal action.
Following the signing of the new law on March 18, Ivey appointed retired Brigadier General Jeffrey Newton as the new commissioner. Newton had been serving as the acting commissioner since Davis’s dismissal.

The Nevada State Legislature channeled their inner “Looney Tunes” and ended this year’s session in dramatic fashion, with a Senate Republican-led filibuster and the death of several high-profile bills. Most prominent among the casualties was the heavily lobbied proposal to give $1.4 billion in transferable tax breaks to the film industry, as well as two of Gov. Joe Lombardo’s priority bills.
Lawmakers did, however, pass the constitutionally required budget bills, meaning no special session is required. That’s an improvement over the 2023 session when lawmakers were forced into a brief 1-day session to pass one of five budget bills.
As the clock ticked toward midnight on Monday, Lombardo’s crime bill and health care bill, as well as the Summerlin Studios film tax credit bill, appeared to have a chance at sprinting across the finish line.  But all three fell victim to Nevada’s constitutional rule that legislative sessions only last 120 days and must end precisely at midnight.
In the Senate, the Republican caucus chose to use a series of parliamentary motions to protest and delay votes on two last-minute resolutions introduced by Democrats. In the Assembly, there were less theatrics but a procedural rule delayed an immediate vote and the clock ran out.
Here’s a recap of what happened.
For a second time, film tax fizzles
Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui’s proposal to provide Sony Pictures Entertainment, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Howard Hughest Holdings with the largest public subsidy in state history went further in this year’s legislative session than a similar proposal did two years ago. But ultimately, Assembly Bill 238 met the same fate as its predecessor: It died in the Senate.
The bill would have massively expanded Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film studio currently referred to as the Summerlin Studios. It was one of two film tax credit bills introduced this session. The other film tax credit bill, sponsored by Democratic State Sen. Roberta Lange, centered on a film studio in southwest Las Vegas. It received a committee hearing earlier in the session but never received a full floor vote. Both film studios were included in a combined bill in the 2023 session.
On Monday, Lange proposed an amendment to turn Jauregui’s bill into an interim study. The move came after lobbyists for Lange’s film tax credit bill unsuccessfully pushed for the two bills to be merged into one.
Sony Pictures executives have said Summerlin Studios is “shovel ready” but contingent on the approval of a massive expansion of the state’s film tax credit program. It was not immediately clear Monday how the developer and film studios will proceed.
Lombardo’s priorities
Going into the session, Lombardo announced he would introduce five “priority bills” — on education, housing, crime, health care, and economic development. At sine die, an amended version of the housing bill had inched across the finish line, and provisions of the education bill had passed after being amended into a competing omnibus education bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro.
The governor’s crime bill and health care bill looked as if they had a chance of passing in the last hour of the session. Both had been significantly amended, but ultimately failed.
Lombardo’s economic development bill had received a hearing May 22 but appeared to move very little after that.
A spokesperson for the governor declined to comment on the end of the legislative session or the prospect of a possible special session to consider his priority bills. Lombardo will likely shift his focus to signing or vetoing the dozens of bills now on his desk. He has 10 days to veto the bills or they automatically become law.
Legislative Commission controversy
Senate Concurrent Resolution 8 would have changed the partisan split of the Legislative Commission, according to Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus. The language of the resolution was not available on the Legislature’s website.
Titus said the caucus received the resolution 30 minutes prior to the vote. Democrats used parliamentary rules to cut off debate on the resolution.
Republicans responded with a confusing series of parliamentary motions that were overlapped with Democrats attempting to shut them down and move the proceedings along. Republican State Sen Ira Hansen called for voice votes to be retaken using the chamber’s electronic voting system. Republican State Sen. Lori Rogich at one point delayed voting electronically and when prompted to replied, “I’m thinking.”
After the clock struck midnight, there was a debate over whether any additional actions could be taken. Legislative Counsel Bureau staff offered a legal interpretation, but Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony, who presides over the Senate, rejected it, saying he needed to see the explanation in writing.
The stalemate ended with Titus explaining the caucus’s protest and saying they were willing to move on.
“We will look at what we have as a body and as a minority moving forward in protest of what happened,” she said. “Unfortunately, it leaves a bad taste in what was otherwise a very good session.”
Titus told media the protest had nothing to do with any other bills. When asked if she thought the governor should call a special session, she said no.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250603_070003737-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

In a significant move toward reforming how public schools are funded in Delaware, the state’s Public Education Funding Commission voted Monday evening to adopt a hybrid funding framework, combining elements of the current unit-count system with a weighted block grant model.
The decision comes after months of deliberation involving educators, parent advocates, legislators, and community leaders.
The Commission, which was first formed in 2024 by the General Assembly, has spent the past year reviewing Delaware’s education funding system and exploring alternatives aimed at improving equity, transparency, and student outcomes.

The newly approved hybrid model is designed to allocate additional funding to students with greater needs, including those from low-income families, English learners, and students with disabilities.
It also includes dedicated funding for educator positions based on student demographics and statewide salary guidelines.
Funding Commission’s decision
In addition to endorsing the hybrid model, the Commission voted on four other key provisions:

Implementation Plan: A three- to five-year transition plan will be developed, ensuring that no local education agency (LEA) sees a reduction in funding during the phase-in.
Local Wealth Considerations: The group will continue studying how to adjust for local revenue disparities, with an eye on reforms to equalization and state-local funding shares.
Ongoing Oversight: A permanent advisory body composed of parents, educators, and community leaders will be established to review the funding system regularly.
Community Engagement: A statewide outreach campaign, including town halls and focus groups, will gather public input. At least one event will be held in each county, with data shared transparently to illustrate the impact of proposed changes.

These recommendations will inform the next phase of modeling and analysis, which will evaluate how the changes could affect individual schools and districts across the state.
The Commission, which continues under the 153rd General Assembly, is expected to serve as a long-term advisory body to ensure Delaware’s education funding system evolves to meet the needs of all students.

For Jewish children — especially those growing up in places like Vermont, where they may be one of just a few in their class — the headlines can feel isolating.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Aimee Loiter: A Jewish connection through bar and bat mitzvah and why it matters in today’s world.","This commentary is by Aimee Loiter, education director at Temple Sinai in South Burlington.As the school year wraps up across Vermont, many parents are turning their thoughts toward summer plans and next year’s activities. For Jewish families, this is also the time to ask a deeper question: How will my child stay connected to their identity in a complicated world?There is perhaps no more powerful answer than the journey of becoming Bar or Bat Mitzvah.A Bar or Bat Mitzvah marks a young person’s transition into Jewish responsibility. But it is far more than a religious tradition. It’s a formative rite of passage that strengthens identity, builds confidence and offers a deep sense of belonging, especially vital at a time when the world feels increasingly uncertain.The Jewish community has been shaken once again by violence connected to a global rise in antisemitism. For Jewish children — especially those growing up in places like Vermont, where they may be one of just a few in their class — the headlines can feel isolating. But stepping into Jewish adulthood, surrounded by a community that sings with you, learns with you, and celebrates with you, can be a powerful antidote to fear.Early teen years are a time when kids begin asking, “Who am I?” and “Where do I fit in?” This is a crucial window for forming identity and building resilience. Taking on the challenge of learning to read Hebrew with its entirely different alphabet and sound system, interpreting ancient texts and offering personal reflections on God, justice or Jewish history isn’t just academic. It’s meaningful. It’s hard work. And it’s theirs.What’s especially beautiful about bar and bat mitzvah in Vermont is that there’s no pressure for lavish productions or over-the-top parties. Here, some of the most moving celebrations have been as simple as a picnic at Oakledge Park or a lunch of a child’s favorite foods — whether that’s lox and bagels or frosted pop tarts. The focus stays where it belongs: on the young person and the community that surrounds them.And unlike so many milestones today, this one isn’t competitive. A bar or bat mitzvah is not about being the best, but about being your best self. It is a declaration: I am part of this people, this story, this hope.For families wondering how to root their kids in something real, something joyful, something resilient, now is the time to start. Fall may feel far off, but Jewish learning and Jewish living thrive when we plan ahead.In a scary and uncertain world, giving your child the gift of a bar or bat mitzvah isn’t just about honoring tradition. It’s about offering connection, purpose and a path forward. It’s an anchor they can return to for life.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Aimee Loiter: A Jewish connection through bar and bat mitzvah and why it matters in today’s world.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peggy Stevens: Actions speak louder than words.","Dear Editor,It is only right that Vermont officials recently have been reaching out to our Quebec neighbors and allies in an effort to strengthen relationships shredded by recent words and actions of our president and our homeland security secretary.There is nothing funny or acceptable about referring to Canada as “the 51st state” or requiring Quebec patrons to use the back door of the international Haskell Library in Derby Line instead of the main entrance as enjoyed by Stanstead residents for over a century.What more significant gesture of concern and respect for our northern neighbors could there be than to immediately make permanent the current moratorium on disposal or discharge of landfill leachate, “treated “ or not, anywhere in the international Memphremagog watershed?Lake Memphremagog is the drinking water reservoir of more than 175,000 residents of the Eastern Townships. Sampling and analysis by the ANR of surface waters, fish tissues and wastewater effluent revealed unacceptable levels of PFOS, a chemical with no known safe level of exposure. Other contaminants of concern also enter our lake waters every day.If the waters of Lake Memphremagog flowed from north to south, threatening the drinking water of so many thousands of Vermont citizens, Vermonters would expect nothing less than immediate action by Quebec to protect the health and safety of our citizens.A permanent ban, to the maximum extent possible, on chemical contamination of Lake Memphremagog is an action that would speak volumes and swiftly restore Quebec’s faith in our mutually respectful and beneficial relationship.There is a bill right now in the House Environment Committee, H.113, a bill that would draft a crisis response plan, assessing pollutants of concern and ways to mitigate them.

That’s according to estimates from the state and researchers at a left-leaning think tank. The cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, stem from a tax cut and spending package Republicans call their “big, beautiful bill.” This legislation passed the U.S. House on May 22 and still needs approval from the Senate before it can reach President Donald Trump’s desk. 
If more stringent work requirements in the bill take effect, about 79,000 people in Washington would be at risk of losing their benefits entirely, and 149,000 would be at risk of losing some SNAP benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. The majority of those people live in eastern Washington or the Olympic Peninsula. 
The state’s Department of Social and Health Services estimates more than 900,000 people in Washington could see benefits reduced or eliminated if the bill is approved as written. 
“​​The expanded work requirements provision alone would risk more than 198,000 Washingtonians losing access to critical food benefits statewide,” said Adolfo Capestany, a spokesperson for the department. 
Around 10% of the state’s population receives SNAP benefits according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The majority of people affected by the cuts would be children, older adults, and people with disabilities.
“The bill would decrease the average monthly SNAP benefit for households by $55.95, from $331.58 per month to $275.63,” said Capestany. 
What’s proposed in the Republican bill is the largest cut in the program’s history, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Nationwide, the program would see a $300 billion, or roughly 30%, reduction.
Since SNAP was introduced, the federal government has fully funded the cost of the food benefits, while states are responsible for screening for eligibility and issuing benefits. States have paid roughly half the cost of administering the program. 
The bill would require additional work requirement screening and would try to shift more costs to states. Studies have shown that work requirements do not boost employment, but do pose challenges for people trying to access benefits. 
At minimum under the Republican proposal, states would be required to pay 5% of SNAP benefits starting in 2028. States that exceed certain thresholds in making errors distributing SNAP payments would have to pay more.
“Washington would be required to backfill hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced federal funding annually,” Capestany said. 
State error rates vary from year to year, which could create challenges in the state’s annual budget process. The addition of the work requirement would increase states’ administrative burden and increase the risk of errors, according to the report. 
Capestany noted that the SNAP cuts Republicans are considering would trickle down to the economy and could decrease the amount flowing to Washington businesses, like grocers and retailers, by an estimated $360 million a year.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/groceries-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

(Ormat press photo)Three proposed geothermal projects in Nevada will be among the first fast-tracked under the Trump administration’s new streamlined environmental review process, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced last week.
Under the new process hailed by Interior Secretary Doug Burhum in April, environmental assessments for small-scale projects will be limited to just 14 days — a sharp contrast to the typical year or more. Full environmental impact statements for more complex projects, which usually take up to 2 years, will now be finalized in just 28 days.
During his first month in office President Donald Trump proclaimed an “energy emergency” as grounds for fast-tracking lengthy environmental reviews and permitting processes for energy projects deemed critical to national security.
Conservation groups have blasted what they see as a circumvention of bedrock environmental laws on the basis of Trump decreeing an “emergency.”
But Burgum, in a statement, said  “by cutting red tape and advancing President Trump’s American Energy Dominance agenda, we’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”
Environmental assessments for the three Nevada projects — all proposed by Ormat Nevada — will be completed within a 14 day timeframe, according to Interior’s May 29 statement.
Those projects include the Diamond Flat Geothermal Project near Fallon; the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project in Lander County; and the Pinto Geothermal Project along the Oregon-Nevada border.  
Geothermal is one the few renewable energy sources the Trump administration is promoting as part of its “American Energy Dominance” plan.
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the CEO of the oilfield services firm Liberty Energy, has called for expanding geothermal energy, citing its potential to enhance energy security and stabilize electricity prices.
During a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month, Wright told Nevada Rep. Susie Lee he is “bullish on the future of geothermal.”
“Permitting and a sober government is necessary to make that happen,” Wright said. 
Under Wright’s leadership, Liberty Energy also invested millions in geothermal energy startup Fervo Energy. In 2023, Fervo Energy launched a geothermal pilot plant in Nevada in partnership with Google to power data centers. 
Nevada generates is second only to California in geothermal electricity generation, , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nevada produces about 26% of total geothermal energy in the nation, and has the potential to grow.
Last month, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report that said geothermal energy in the Great Basin — which covers most of Nevada — could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply.
Geothermal currently accounts for less than 1% of U.S. electricity generation, according to the EIA.
In the last five years, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has put up more than 700,000 acres of land in Nevada to lease for geothermal.
In a press release, USGS said commercial-scale geothermal development will largely depend on the “successful application of evolving and emerging technologies.”
Geothermal and sage grouse
Conservation groups argued the announcement is the latest effort by the Trump administration to target the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires the federal government to conduct an indepth environmental review before moving forward with infrastructure projects.   
“We support geothermal energy as a part of our clean energy mix, but like any projects on public lands these developments could cause environmental impacts,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity in a statement. “Projects like these need full and complete environmental reviews to ensure they don’t unduly harm endangered species or public lands resources.”
While geothermal is a more environmentally sound alternative to traditional power sources like coal and natural gas, there are still environmental risks that require careful review. 
A recent study published in the journal Biological Conservation found that the presence of geothermal plants “adversely affected” greater sage-grouse populations within sagebrush ecosystems. The study found that the presence of geothermal infrastructure near sage-grouse breeding grounds decreased nest survival.
The study specifically reviewed the impact of Nevada’s McGinness Hills Geothermal Development, the largest geothermal complex in Nevada and the fourth largest in the United States. 
The first McGinness Hills geothermal plant was established in July, 2012 and has been producing renewable power since.
Throughout its construction and expansion, the McGinness Hills Geothermal Development has attracted pushback due to its impact on sage-grouse.
In 2017, the Nevada Department of Wildlife wrote a letter to the BLM after the agency documented the downward trend of seven of eleven breeding sites near the McGinness Hills Geothermal Development. 
In the letter the agency accused Ormat of failing to monitor and mitigate the impact of the power plant on sage-grouse habitat, as required under the project approval.
If the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project is approved under the new streamlined environmental review process, it would expand three geothermal power plants by adding new wells, heat exchangers, cooling fans, and a 15 megawatt solar photovoltaic field.
Other Ormat geothermal energy projects have faced controversy and pushback in Nevada. 
In 2023, a planned geothermal project by Ormat was sent back to square one after federal land managers decided to reexamine the project’s approval following the listing of a small rare toad living in adjacent springs as endangered.
Another planned Ormat geothermal project near Gerlach, Nevada was thrown out by the Washoe County Board of County Commissioners in 2023 after locals fiercely opposed the project.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DJI_0403-HDR_THS-Visuals-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Allina doctors like me unionized in 2023 to have a voice so we can improve our workplaces and our careers and to ensure primary care is viable for future generations.
We took this step because the autocratic, profit-centric, factory style of practicing medicine is no longer viable. With our successful vote, we became the largest outpatient provider union in the United States.
We took this vote to make change for ourselves and our patients, but progress has been slow. We have been bargaining for about 15 months,± starting in February of 2024. We’ve sat across from Allina nearly 40 times, and we’ve made progress in many areas.
Unfortunately, despite all of this work it feels like we aren’t seeing the progress we need from Allina as we push toward a contract.
We understand contract negotiations can be difficult, but many areas should be simple to navigate and find common ground.
Health care workers, for instance, face workplace violence at higher rates than most other industries in the country. We feel that it would be reasonable to strive for safe and secure work sites.
Our proposals have offered measures to improve the safety of health care workers, but we have not found common ground with our employer yet.
We feel that physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners should have benefits like paid time off — a common benefit in many other industries that doctors currently lack. We have been unable to get Allina to move on that issue.

Our proposals have outlined provisions for appropriate staffing. We need nurses, medical assistants and laboratory and other ancillary staff in order to properly serve our patient’s needs. Unfortunately, some of our clinics remain understaffed, rendering it more difficult to perform our daily duties. We have proposed language around this, yet this is another issue that still needs to be resolved.
There is a clear trend in health care of providers reducing work hours. Many feel this is necessary to try to maintain some semblance of work-life balance. Health care worker burnout rates remain high. The antidote for this is not increasing work hours. Our providers trade hours of time away from family, friends and the necessary activities for well-being each week to do volumes of work that are non-compensated and don’t take place in the exam room.
Our proposals have measures to reduce the amount of this work and strategies to promote an actual work-life balance. We worry if we don’t address this, even more providers will leave the industry, which is bad for patients across Minnesota.
Most of us on the bargaining team knew we would reach resistance at some point. I had hoped we would be further along when it happened. I am not willing to abandon important issues, which our members have expressed so much concern over, simply because Allina doesn’t wish to see these common-sense changes happen. These issues are prominent with providers in health care systems across the country, and we can showcase a path forward if we can reach a fair contract.
Primary care has been shown to improve community health. A strong primary care system reduces mortality, improves life expectancy, improves health equity and lowers health care costs. Primary care must be supported and nurtured by our health care systems, communities and state government. As our providers burn out and reduce hours, our patients lose access to care. We will see worse chronic disease control and worse health outcomes.
Our members are engaging in an informational picket Tuesday because we feel this is a necessary step to help Allina administration understand the need for continued negotiations. We feel this is an important step to engage our patients and communities on the plight of primary care providers and the desperate need to maintain a strong primary care network.
Our negotiations need not be contentious. A good contract helps keep Allina’s employees happy. A good contract can attract the best providers across the state to bolster our community health efforts. A good contract ensures those new providers will flock to Allina, ready to provide our communities with decades of excellent care. A good contract helps our providers and administration collaborate to provide better care across the state of Minnesota.
On this day, we’re raising awareness that things are stuck in our negotiations, but remain hopeful that Allina will hear the voices of providers, patients and our community and understand why a fair first contract is the best solution for all involved.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/P1151760-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

The five-person panel included former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, Detroit City Council member Fred Durhal III, former nonprofit CEO Saunteel Jenkins, Triumph Church Pastor Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr. and current Detroit City Council President Mary Sheffield. Candidates fielded questions about the city’s tax incentives, their plans to support business and education, address violent crime and poverty and ensure sustainable funding in the city’s budget. 
Although the panel did not represent the full range of candidates seeking election as the city’s mayor, the group was selected by the Detroit Regional Chamber’s Political Action Committee due to time constraints. Attorney Todd Perkins, businessman Joel Haashiim, entrepreneur Jonathan Barlow and two-time mayoral candidate Danetta Simpson are also competing for Detroit’s executive office, with the primary election scheduled for August 5. The two candidates with the highest vote total will advance to the general election on Nov. 4. 
With a wide field of candidates each seeking to make the final ballot, here are the highlights from each participant.

Saunteel Jenkins
Opening the debate, Jenkins noted that many of the city’s tax abatement programs would begin expiring in 2027, with over half set to expire by 2030. Jenkins said she would retool these programs at the risk of losing businesses and jobs within Detroit.
As Mayor Mike Duggan – who opted against seeking reelection to pursue an independent bid for governor – worked to rebuild confidence in the city, bringing in investments and jobs, the same needed to happen in the city’s neighborhoods, Jenkins said, calling for a commercial corridor in each of the city’s seven districts.
“We have to ensure that our planning is intentional and that it is inclusive,” Jenkins said. “And when we are having discussions about tax abatements, discussions about affordable housing, we have a real plan in place that is driving development and affordable housing and public transit in a way that is building our neighborhoods.”
If elected, Jenkins said she would craft a strategic plan to help shape economic development in each district, working with communities to decide how they want their commercial districts to look. There is also a need for additional office space for startups that can’t afford space downtown, she said.
Neighborhood planning efforts should include schools, in order to ensure students have access to high quality options for education, Jenkins said.
Additionally, as the city moves forward without $826 million in federal revenue it received through the American Rescue Plan Act, and payments under the city’s “Grand Bargain” coming to an end, the city needed to find ways to grow its businesses and its population, Jenkins said. She noted that she sees a role for a chief growth officer in her administration, if elected.

Fred Durhal III
Throughout the debate, Durhal pointed to his prior experience as a member of the Michigan Legislature, promising to coordinate with lawmakers on property tax reform and a willingness to go to bat for additional resources for education within the city.
He repeatedly noted, however, that solutions come with a price tag, quoting his grandmother in saying there’s “no romance without finance.”
Aside from pressing the city to utilize its current resources and maintaining discipline in the budget process, Durhal proposed a tax on blighted properties and a speculative tax on land sitting under development as potential new sources of revenue.
He also pitched a corridor improvement authority for the city, focused on creating walkable neighborhoods where residents have access to groceries and other amenities, which could catalyze small business in the process.

Solomon Kinloch
Kinloch remained focused on Detroit’s neighborhoods and their residents throughout the debate, and said he would work to bring the neighborhoods to the table on issues like tax policy. Kinloch said that the next mayor needed to be open to doing something new to address homelessness, poverty and job creation.
He also argued the city’s budget could use input from people whose priorities are aligned with the community. 
On the push to bring business back to residential areas of the city, Kinloch said Detroit should leverage its corporate, philanthropic and community partnerships to create an apprenticeship program to funnel Detroiters into high paying jobs. The city should also work with private-industry grocers to mentor entrepreneurship opportunities, Kinloch said. He also called for an end to food deserts within the city’s neighborhoods. 
“People shouldn’t have to eat out of a liquor store or a gas station,” Kinloch said.
Addressing education, Kinloch said his administration would bring in a chief educational officer to coordinate with the Detroit Public Schools superintendent and school board to ensure that the city is providing supplemental resources to ensure students arrive at school healthy and whole.

James Craig
As his fellow candidates offered pitches to address poverty and support businesses in the city, Craig said there needs to be a focus on growing the middle class.
“I talked a lot about growing small businesses. That doesn’t take away from continuing to grow big businesses,” Craig said. “We have got to raise revenues in the city. … We have to collaborate.”
That means having a business-friendly city, Craig said.
“And one of the things that I’ve heard as chief and deputy mayor over time is that in many of the neighborhoods, they feel left out,” he said. “They feel left out, the businesses feel left out.”
Craig argued there’s too much red tape for businesses coming into the city, and that efforts to make the city more friendly to business would help stabilize property taxes and keep them lower. He further emphasized the importance of continuing to bring in new business, and that tax dollars pay for vital services like police, fire departments and infrastructure. 
On policing, Craig promised to pick up where he left off in building trust through neighborhood policing, and noted that homicides had fallen to the lowest level since the 1960s during his tenure as police chief.
However, Craig criticized gun buyback programs within the city, saying “I have never in my 44 years in policing seen a criminal turn in a gun.”
“They don’t work. It’s all political talk,” he said. 
While other candidates pledged to work across the aisle to win support for the city from lawmakers in Lansing, Craig pointed to his existing relationship with President Donald Trump, who praised Craig for his response to Black Lives Matter protests in the Summer of 2020. 
Protestors later filed federal lawsuits arguing the Detroit Police Department used unconstitutional and excessive force and prevented them from exercising their First Amendment rights. The city agreed to a $1 million settlement in 2022.
“It’s not about me, it’s not about the president, it’s about the city of Detroit,” he said.

As her opponents offered solutions to address the expiring tax abatement program, Sheffield said her focus would be on addressing poverty and the high property tax rate, which lead to the need for these programs to begin with. Sheffield promised “real structural property tax reform,” instead. 
The city also needs to continue to build its middle class, Sheffield said, noting that while Detroit’s median income sits around $38,000, the median for the state is around $70,000.
“Without a doubt, we have to ensure that more investment comes back into our neighborhoods, and that we’re activating our commercial corridors,” Sheffield said. “I’m very excited for my administration to be way more hands on as it relates to the education of our youth.”
Schools and the workforce are also targets for support, Sheffield said. 
“We have to invest more in education and the workforce, creating a pipeline that is ready for the jobs that are coming for today and of tomorrow,” she said.
Sheffield also called for a holistic approach in addressing crime which includes community policing alongside programs and efforts to deal with the root causes of violence. She said that could be done by providing support for mental health, jobs and education. If elected, Sheffield said she would retain Todd Bettison as police chief.
Detroit is also in need of a new funding approach for programs that would have previously been funded by the federal government. Sheffield said she would consider floating a local sales option tax, a tax on admission to sporting events, concerts and other types of entertainment or a half-a-penny tax.
“If cost savings could be achieved within various departments, I think we should look at that, but more importantly, it’s going to be about bringing more revenue into the city of Detroit to fund various programs,” Sheffield said, who later promised to aggressively pursue federal funding alongside state and local partners.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2936-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

Mike Cierpiot, R-Lee's Summit, following the Senate's adjournment in 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Almost two dozen employees in Missouri State Archives and the State Library are on paid leave and will lose their jobs at the end of the month because of a politically motivated budget cut targeting Secretary of State Denny Hoskins.
Twenty-two employees — 17 in the archives, five in the library — were told Friday that they did not need to return to work Monday. The employees are being paid through the end of the month, — the final month of the current budget year — but according to Hoskins could not be retained because of “budget restrictions enacted by the Missouri General Assembly.”
However, the Republican lawmakers behind the cut say it only targeted unfilled positions in the office and there was absolutely no financial reason for Hoskins had to lay off any staff.
Hoskins, a Republican, is former state senator and has been secretary of state since January. While in the General Assembly, he tried repeatedly to cut job slots he said had been unfilled for months or years, arguing that agencies that had functioned without filling some jobs didn’t need the help.
Hoskins was also a member of the Missouri Freedom Caucus, which fought harder with the GOP majority leadership than it did against Democrats. State Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Lee’s Summit Republican regularly tussled with Hoskins and the Freecom Caucus, punished him earlier this year with a budget amendment cutting 25 of the office’s authorized personnel strength of 267 full time equivalent employees, or FTE, and $680,000 from one of the funds that helps pay salaries.
In the last full year under Hoskins’ predecessor,  only 204 of those positions were filled. The office has not used more than 215 of its full time slots for at least eight years. 
At the time the cut was made, Cierpiot said it should not require any layoffs.
In a statement to The Independent, Rachel Dunn, spokeswoman for Hoskins, claimed the office had no choice. 
“The General Assembly did not cut vacant or flexible FTE authority,” she said. “It explicitly eliminated 25 FTEs from our budget, meaning we were required by law to reduce filled positions to meet that mandate. These cuts were not based on current vacancies but on a hard reduction in authorized staffing levels.”
The employees were given leave with pay to allow them time to seek new jobs, she wrote.
“This was done out of respect for their service, and to give them time to plan next steps with dignity, rather than executing immediate unpaid terminations,” Dunn said.
The $19.6 million budget approved for Hoskins’ office operations includes $11.6 million in general revenue and $8 million from other funds. In addition to the archives and library, the office is the state’s chief election authority, the repository of records establishing every business and not-for-profit in the state, and the regulator of securities brokers and sales.
Lawmakers give Hoskins — and every other statewide elected official — complete flexibility in determining whether each dollar is spent on payroll or the expense of maintaining the office. 
And in each of the past three years, the office has returned about $3 million unspent to the state treasury, including $300,000 to $400,000 of general revenue.
There was enough money and enough flexibility for Hoskins to retain all his employees, Cierpiot said. The budget change, he said, did not mandate layoffs. 
“If Secretary of State Hoskins thinks that he needs to pull back the number of people working at the archives, that’s his decision,” Cierpiot said.
State Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there is no reason Hoskins should have terminated employees.
“I can’t understand a financial reason,” Hough said, “that there isn’t ample personal service dollars within the 100% flexibility that the Secretary of State has to continue paying not only all those folks, but I’m sure they’re still flexing some other dollars associated with the vacant FTEs.”
The problem with looking to the flexibility within the office budget for money to retain the staff is the limited nature of some funds. Money collected to regulate securities can only be spent on that function, Dunn said, and there isn’t enough general revenue to cover the cut in the dedicated funds that support the archive and library functions.
“The legislature cut both the FTEs and associated appropriations,” Dunn said. “Previous administrations had kept many unfilled FTEs on the books, but unfilled FTEs don’t always have funds associated with them. When the legislature cut both unfilled FTEs and payroll funds, our hands were tied.”
The archives is one of the office’s most public-facing functions. It stores and preserves records from the most important to the most mundane and is used for historical and genealogical research. It is also the only part of the office to have regular evening and Saturday hours.
The archives for example, is where the original document for Gov. Lilburn Boggs’ 1838 order that Mormons “must be exterminated or driven from the state” is stored, as is former Gov. Kit Bond’s 1975 order rescinding Boggs’ directive.
Online collections include territorial and state censuses, every volume of the Revised Statutes going back to 1825, and service records for soldiers and sailors from the War of 1812 through World War I.
The archives will have 43 employees after the cut, and the library will have 11, Dunn said.
“The Missouri State Archives are a vital part of our shared history and cultural legacy,” Dunn said. “These cuts will have lasting impacts on public access, preservation, and the historical transparency Missourians deserve.”

(Photo courtesy Kyle Roerink)A remarkable sequence of events unfolded in the week before Memorial Day that could shape the future of Las Vegas more than anything else in recent memory. 
First, Nevada Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei made what may prove to be a fateful miscalculation in the waning days of the House’s negotiations over the reconciliation budget bill. He added an amendment in the literal dark of night that would authorize — nay compel — the sale of over half a million acres of public land in Nevada. 
Public outrage ensued. 
The lands in question in Amodei’s amendment have been considered for sell-off in various land legislation proposals in recent years. Though those proposals have been problematic, conservation interests and county governments were at least involved in the negotiations. It felt like Amodei was blowing up the years of work they’d put in.
His sneak attack also sparked outrage across the entire country. Former Interior Secretary and Montana Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke led the charge in D.C. against the amendment, calling it “my San Juan Hill,” in reference to a battle in the Spanish-American War. Other members of Congress spoke out, and calls from around the country flooded Amodei’s office.
In the end, Amodei bowed to pressure and his amendment was withdrawn from the final House budget bill. Instead of scoring a victory for the real estate and mining interests that bankroll him, he dealt a historic setback to the public lands sell-off movement.
At the same time as negotiations were under way in D.C., the Nevada legislature was considering Assembly Joint Resolution 10, which was an endorsement of the Clark County lands bill. 
The Clark County lands bill — one of the aforementioned lands legislation proposals of recent years — would facilitate tens of thousands of acres of new sprawl south of Las Vegas. It would create a new city the size of St. Louis, stretching all the way to the California border. 
While some environmental groups have been supportive of the Clark County lands bill, citing conservation interests, our groups have steadfastly opposed any proposal that would facilitate the endless sprawl that strains our water supply and harms our air quality, wildlife habitats and communities. 
The Sierra Club, Great Basin Water Network, and Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition worked relentlessly for weeks to halt the measure. 
Amodei’s deeply unpopular amendment loomed large in Nevada’s legislative chambers. The prospect of Democrats endorsing endless sprawl days after Zinke — Trump’s former Interior Secretary — defended public lands was something that Carson City politicians couldn’t stomach. Legislators let the Clark County lands bill die late last week. 
It wasn’t just sprawl on public lands that was dealt a blow last week, however. Coyote Springs — a proposed city on a privately owned parcel of land 50 miles northeast of Las Vegas — had one of the last nails pounded into its coffin by a Clark County District Court judge. 
The developers behind Coyote Springs proposed building a city of a quarter million people on desert they own in northern Clark and southern Lincoln counties. 
The problem is they have no water. And the groundwater that sits deep under their land — which they propose pumping to fill swimming pools and irrigate golf courses — is connected to waters that sustain endangered species and communities downstream via the Muddy River and Colorado River system.
After years of wrangling in court — including a key victory for the Center for Biological Diversity and allies when the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the state’s right to manage groundwater for the public interest, including wildlife — Judge Bita Yeager ruled last week that pumping at Coyote Springs would harm endangered species and communities. 
While Coyote Springs backers are sure to appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court, the evidence and law is overwhelmingly against the project. 
Recent momentum clearly favors those who oppose the endless sprawl machine. But what does the future hold? 
We caught a glimpse last week, as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management launched an environmental review for the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport, formerly known as the Ivanpah Airport. 
The enormous international airport would be built 30 miles south of Las Vegas on a playa near Primm. In addition to the airport and associated facilities, the site would also include retail and industrial development. It would need pipelines for water, tons of concrete, and land currently inhabited by the imperiled desert tortoise. 
The land for the airport was given to Clark County by Congress in 2000, meaning that its permitting is close to a foregone conclusion. Even before Trump launched his assault on the nation’s bedrock environmental laws, federal agencies by and large have rubber-stamped these sorts of developments.
What’s not a foregone conclusion is whether the airport will ever be built. Where will the water come from? Who will pay the Southern Nevada Water Authority to build one pipeline to tap into Colorado River water and another to bring back effluent? Where will the people who work there live? Will we have an exodus of workers driving 60 miles roundtrip to the airport, while tourists do the same long journey just to get to The Strip? Who will pay for the new electricity infrastructure, new schools, new roads, new sewers — new everything? 
The Las Vegas growth machine is at a crossroads. 
While corporations and their politician handmaidens are growing bolder than ever in pushing the development agenda, the public is coming to the defense of our public lands and pushing back against endless sprawl. 
Our organizations will continue to highlight the absurdities of selling off public lands for sprawl and oppose these measures in all their forms. The remarkable events of the past week underscored that we have the power to resist — and win.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Vegas-Sprawl-Horizon-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-06-03 08:05:40.930799

It is personal.
I have avoided using “I’ and have endeavored to remain objective and impersonal as I have addressed and analyzed myriad social, educational and political issues across race, age, gender and socioeconomic status.
That has been my practice, whether writing for radio, in print when I wrote for The Kansas City Star and other newspapers, or online writing for The Missouri Independent the last four years. Even in my own blog.
Maybe the “I” in this column is a “collective I” that tugs.
I have a hunch that many of my fellow Missourians and Americans may be feeling as I do as we live through unprecedented, tumultuous, and unsettling political times.
What are you longing for?
I long for a state and country where:

The fundamental tenets, rules, procedures and laws that have governed our democratic republic still hold true and still mean something as we function in the public square and in our everyday lives.
Our institutions and their histories still have meaning, value, collective power and influence.
There is real meaning and we still value representative government, where those elected really believe in respecting and fighting for the issues and concerns of those who voted for them, sent them to do the people’s bidding.
Each of us can wear the Missourian and American identity with pride, humility and thankfulness irrespective of skin color, gender, place of birth, social or economic station or political leanings.
The behaviors of the leadership in our state and nation — our governor, the legislature, our president, the halls of Congress — are shining examples to be emulated, duplicated, and cheered on.
There is hope and a positive outlook about what each of us can achieve if we work hard enough.

Some may consider those longings naive or idealistic.
I do not.
As a Black woman, born and raised on a small farm in Mississippi, and who has lived and or witnessed first-hand the good, the bad and the ugly of life in America, I have always remained hopeful and refused to give up on believing in the best of our collective humanity.
Even now — as I watch the callous and inhumane way undocumented immigrants are being treated, how caring and career public servants have had their lives upended as their jobs are snatched and taken away indiscriminately with little or no notice — I still believe our collective decency and collective humanity still exist and is worth fighting for.
When I watch DEI programs being dismantled across every aspect of American life as if the playing field is equal, I still believe in fairness and decency in spite of my experiences throughout my career — not getting jobs I was qualified for, sometimes overly qualified for, not able to buy a house in a neighborhood I could afford, on and on.
Despite those experiences, I refused to be bitter, paint the situation or future prospects with a broad brush, or feel that I would always be victimized by racism and sexism.
If I am a victim, it is in my belief that hope for a better humanity reigns eternal.
But today and for some time, I must admit, I am finding it difficult to not become pessimistic, to not throw up my hands and say, “What’s the use? Why not just sit on my porch and watch the birds, and the changing sky?”
Can I or any of us afford to do that, check out and ignore the constant bombardment of news that fly in the face of what this great “Heart of America” state and the country that was once considered the “Beacon on a Hill” supposed to be about?
We see examples and reminders every day that we are allowing debased values and goals to kill the progress we have made for over two centuries.
Why? Why? Why?
Are we willing to sit by and watch what is happening to our state and country?
Why?
Who are the few, yes the few, representatives in Jefferson City and Washington who will assume and use the power invested in them to stand up and stop the negative and destructive trajectory — of us versus them —  that the state and nation is on?
No matter where we hail from, no matter our circumstances of birth, we have shared experiences that should bind us, not divide us.
More importantly, keep us divided.
It really is not about “us” against “them.”
If only we could just keep that thought top of mind.
It isn’t about labels either: Republicans versus Democrats, conservatives versus liberals.
Like many of you, I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans. I vote for the person and what they stand for. I am both conservative and liberal — and moderate — depending on the issue.
When it comes to what is best for Missouri and America, it is about building bridges that we can all walk across to achieve the best good for the greatest number.
That is what I long for.
That is my hope.
What is yours?
We need to have an answer to pass on to our children, our grandchildren, and their children.
Our collective future is dependent on it.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Longings1-rarrarorro-1024x540.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

Marc Racicot embrace at a rally to stop the dozens of constitutional amendment proposals made in the 2023 legislative sessions. Both were keynote speakers at the Feb. 1, 2023, event. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)On June 22, at the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Todd Wilkinson, the editor of Yellowstonian, a publication focused on the environmental issues in the Greater Yellowstone, hosted and moderated a discussion between two old political rivals. 
In 1992, Republican Marc Racicot and Dorothy Bradley campaigned all over the state, conducting more than 20 joint town halls, where they debated the issues of the day. Racicot won in a very close race, and went on to become one of the most popular governors in Montana, up until he made a fateful decision concerning the deregulation of utilities, a piece of legislation that had a long-term impact and has led many Montanans to never forgive him. 
But it’s hard to overlook the fact that Racicot is a man who reflects on these things in a way that is not typical of most politicians, especially from his party. When Racicot endorsed Monica Tranel during the 2022 congressional race, the state Republican party decided to censure him, a particularly confounding decision considering that Racicot was, at one time, the chairman of the Republican National Committee after his term as governor. He also managed George Bush’s campaign during the 2004 presidential race. 
But Racicot never classified himself as a full-on conservative, and he and Bradley both highlighted the fact that during their campaign against each other, they were able to maintain a strong feeling of respect and civility despite their differences. This was one of many issues they pointed to that are contributing to the current political situation. Another was the influx of money, and Bradley pointed out that the maximum donation during their campaign was $35 and they were meticulous about following that. 
But one of the most striking revelations during the evening for me was when someone asked Racicot whether any of the current Republican leadership in Montana ever reaches out to him for advice. 
“They don’t even return my calls,” Racicot answered. 
And although it wasn’t exactly a surprise, I still found myself kind of amazed that these people would completely dismiss the years of experience of someone like Racicot. It’s not hard to imagine that the same holds true for most of the other former office-holders in our state—people like former governors Brian Schweitzer and Steve Bullock, or former congressman Pat Williams, and especially Jon Tester. It’s obviously a product of our current political culture, which values winning over all else, that would produce the kind of arrogance that completely dismisses an entire sector of our population without a thought. But how shortsighted is it to believe that only you and those who think like you have all the answers you need? Or, that asking for advice or feedback is some kind of weakness?
People can say that Donald Trump is to blame, but this started way before he descended that golden escalator, back when Newt Gingrich and his cadre of icy collaborators decided that winning at all costs was way more important than worrying about what is important to the voters. This attitude has slowly poisoned the Republican party to the point where they feel completely justified in disowning one of the people who was considered a shining star. 
And the most maddening part about it is how gleefully and smugly they continue down this path. It’s not hard to imagine why. Because so far, it’s working. Because of Project 2025, they are no longer relying on Trump to drive the train, and it puts him in the perfect position as someone who just has to keep yelling “All aboard” and blowing his own horn. He doesn’t even have to worry about steering. 
So where does that leave us? 
I think Bradley said it best when she pointed out that we are all responsible for where we are, and that we are also responsible for figuring out what to do next. 
“Trump is eventually going away,” she pointed out. “And it’s hard to imagine anyone else in his circle having the same sway over the public. So we have to figure out how to proceed once he’s gone, and how to repair the damage he’s done.” 
The same holds true for our state. 
Greg Gianforte is serving his last term, and there’s no question that people are becoming disillusioned by the lack of access to our political leaders. Our current office-holders have made it their policy to avoid as much contact with the public as possible, and it’s not hard to imagine why. Each time they do that, someone tries to hold them accountable for the many decisions they’ve made that have done untold damage to the citizens of Montana, with the most outrageous being the (still unexplained) increase in property taxes. 
Todd Wilkinson and I are starting a new podcast soon, affiliated with Yellowstonian, and one of our first episodes is going to be a discussion about this conversation between Bradley and Racicot. But as a brief preview, I can tell you that most of the solutions they offered were ones we’ve heard before, and that we will certainly hear again. We need to continue to speak up, gather, make our voices heard, and of course vote. But it was nice to see people with different views coming together to discuss how we got here. And I suspect we will see more of that.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_8299-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 07:04:45.517794

(Getty Images)Gov. Phil Murphy criticized the federal government for terminating programs aimed at modernizing the unemployment insurance system, which suffered under the stress of hundreds of thousands of claimants applying for jobless benefits at the height of the pandemic. 
“At a time of increased uncertainty about the U.S. economy, the last thing the federal government should be doing is taking away resources from states’ unemployment insurance systems,” Murphy said in a statement Monday. “These cuts undermine American workers.”
The Trump administration is terminating $400 million in funds for states across the country to modernize their unemployment systems, money that was authorized in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act passed under the Biden administration. 
The Murphy administration did not comment on whether any money would be returned to the federal government, or whether the change in funding would cause any disruptions to systems in the process of being upgraded. The state Department of Labor did not respond to a request for comment.
New Jersey received nearly $25 million for its upgrades. The grant money was expected to be accessible for tech upgrades through 2028. 
Murphy said in his statement that the state has used those funds to “improve the efficiency of our state’s unemployment insurance application to ensure that all eligible workers can access the benefits to which they are entitled.” 
According to Axios, the U.S. Department of Labor notified Congress last week that these grants were being terminated, suggesting that the funds were wasted on equity projects. However, “equity” in this case refers to efforts to make the system easier for people to use and access, not as a reference to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which the Trump administration has vowed to dismantle.
A record-breaking 1.1 million claims were filed in New Jersey during the first two months of the pandemic, pushing the state’s antiquated unemployment system past the limits of what it could handle. People saw their claims frozen, received their benefits months after they applied — if they received them at all — and were often told to reach out to call centers for specialists, only to be greeted with busy signals or messages to call back another time.  
The unemployment system in New Jersey saw major overhauls following the pandemic — and its first substantial update in over a decade — as a result of a federal program with the U.S. Department of Labor. The unemployment application that rolled out in 2024 can be used on mobile devices, is available in multiple languages, can be saved if the applicant needs to return to it later, and includes revised questions to make it easier to understand.

(Menomonee Falls Public Library)   The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Menomonee Falls residents are concerned about the future of their public library after the village board voted late last month to move $300,000 from the library’s 2026 budget to the police department. 
Board members said the May 19 move, which passed in a unanimous 6-0 vote, was intended to help the police increase staffing in response to an uptick in crime. Critics of the decision said the move is likely to force the library to cut back on staff, hours and programming — potentially putting its certification from Waukesha County at risk. 
The resolution, which was passed months before the board begins working on writing the village’s 2026 budget, also comes as libraries across the country are about to be hit by funding cuts from the federal government as part of President Donald Trump’s effort to slash federal spending. 
This year, the library’s budget was set at about $2.3 million, making the $300,000 cut about 15% of the library’s total budget. The cut is larger than the $225,000 the library was budgeted to spend on purchasing new materials this year. The police department’s 2025 budget is more than $12 million. 
“If village board members are so obsessed with firing librarians, just say so and be transparent with the community, because that is the impact of stealing 20% of the library’s funds,” Ian Dickmann, a community resident and former member of the library board, said at the board meeting. “You will be firing multiple librarians, cutting library hours and negatively impacting library programs, materials and services. The community has spoken in support of the library on multiple occasions. Yet here we are again. If you as a village board cannot manage to properly fund the police and the library, then you have failed as a board.” 
Menomonee Falls Police data shows that crime has increased slightly this year, and through retirements, resignations and leaves, the department currently has fewer than the 65 sworn officers in its budget. Police Chief Mark Waters said at a board meeting in April that the department was working with 54 fully trained officers. 
At that meeting, Waters said that this year, class A offenses, which include more serious crimes such as assaults, robberies and drug offenses, are up 18% compared to the first quarter of 2024. However, much of that increase is due to a 41% increase in drug offenses, of which Waters said the vast majority was “a lot of marijuana taken out of traffic stops.” 
As of April, there had been 41 thefts in Menomonee Falls this year, according to police data, an increase of six incidents from the first quarter last year. The clearance rate, the percentage of crimes that are solved, on those thefts was 51%.
Menomonee Falls Assistance Police Chief Gary Neyhart said in an email that the department has had problems  with staffing, but that budget decisions are up to the board. 
“Chief Mark Waters provides public quarterly updates to the Village Board and a consistent message has been that staffing has been an issue here at the police department,” Neyhart said. “The Village Board then determines how best to address these stated staffing concerns. I also cannot speak on their behalf. I don’t believe we are alone with our staffing issues and that many area departments are in a similar situation as well as dealing with retention and recruitment. We will always strive to provide the highest level of service that our staffing allows.”
Board member Paul Tadda, said at the May meeting that the resolution to cut the library budget was made to maintain the level of police services a suburban community expects. 
“We’re down to 52 fully trained officers. That requires forced overtime to maintain shifts are full and able to respond to emergencies as necessary and provide police services that the village has been accustomed to,” he said. “I do not want to live in Milwaukee.” 
Andy Guss, co-leader of the community group Grassroots Menomonee Falls, told the Wisconsin Examiner he is used to Tadda’s “racist dog whistles,” and that he is more concerned about the library’s ability to remain certified and serve as an important resource for village residents. 
In Wisconsin, counties set a tax levy for library services. Those funds are distributed to municipal libraries to compensate for the use of services by people who live in communities without a library. Municipal residents are exempted from paying the library tax if they live in a community that has a library which meets standards set by the state and county board. 
The Waukesha County standards require the village to provide at least $1,630,000 in the annual library budget, be open at least 60 hours a week, employee at least 17.61 full time employees, have a collection size of at least 125,400 materials, have at least 20 public computers and provide wireless internet access. 
Guss says he’s worried the cuts will put the library dangerously close to not meeting the standards. 
“We’re going to be really close to not hitting the Waukesha County standards,” he says. “And I’m fearful of what will happen if we also lose additional funding from the federal government, because then how short will we be? How many people, how many librarians will we have to fire? How many services will we have to cut? How many books do we not get, how much new material can we not get? How many computers? It’s scary to think about, because it limits access to people that need it. Because I don’t go to the library all the time for books, I use the library for a lot of other things, like book clubs or meeting spaces. What happens to that when the hours are reduced?” 
But at the meeting, board members brushed aside concerns community members raised about the standards. Board member Ann Lessila said in an email to the Examiner that the library won’t suffer.
“By reallocating funds ahead of the budget process, we have allowed the library board extra time to prepare,” Lessila said. “The library has been funded well over the required amount every year, without having to make any significant adjustments. The library remains well funded! Just about every other department has made significant adjustments over the years.” 
Steve Heser, a Menomonee Falls resident and the director of the Milwaukee County Federated Library System, said he highly doubts claims that residents won’t see any impacts from the cuts and that one community library failing to meet the county standards strains the whole county system — which in this case is the Bridges Library System covering all the libraries in Jefferson and Waukesha counties. 
“What you really don’t want in a system is one library failing to meet those standards, and then they’re kind of relying on the other municipalities to foot the bill for their library,” Heser said. 
Aside from the county standards, Guss said he’s also worried about the village board diminishing a community gathering space, especially for kids and teenagers who have already had recreational opportunities taken away. 
In March, the board voted to ban any children over the age of 12 from hanging out unaccompanied at Menomonee Falls Village Park, which is across the street from North Middle School. Village officials said the move was meant to deter vandalism. 
“They’ve got the playground across the street. They ban the 12-year-olds so they can’t go there,” Guss said. “But we do have at the library, they have a teen room that is well managed. I know it’s well attended, but I would assume that, based on these cuts, that they’re going to lower hours, lower staff, and maybe we would even lose the teen room.” 
The Menomonee Falls Village Manager Mark Fitzgerald and six of the village board members did not respond to requests for comment.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
His sister, Susan Garcia, said her brother was removed from a ventilator and died from complications from his attempt to hang himself on July 19 in a Columbia Correctional Institution shower. At the time, Garcia was on clinical observation because he said he was feeling suicidal.
Garcia gave the Examiner access to records her family received from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, including incident reports that provide accounts from the day of Garcia’s suicide attempt. 
Questions remain about the purpose and origin of the tether Garcia used in the suicide attempt, as well as why an officer waited for a supervisor and did not immediately remove the tether when Garcia was found. 
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections has received notice of an anticipated lawsuit being filed against the department on behalf of Victor Garcia, DOC communications director Beth Hardtke said in an email in response to questions from the Examiner. DOC practice is not to comment on matters relating to pending or ongoing litigation, Hardtke said. 
Attorney Lonnie Story said he plans to file a lawsuit involving Victor Garcia’s attempted suicide at the facility. He said he needs to obtain more information before filing a suit. 
Garcia’s prison sentence and mental health strugles

In March 2008, when he was 16, Victor Garcia was found guilty of criminal trespassing in a dwelling, battery, disorderly conduct and a domestic abuse incident. He was sentenced to two years of probation. Garcia’s probation was revoked in July 2008, and in August he was sentenced to nine months in jail. 
When he was 18, Garcia was found guilty of being party to a crime for burglary and being armed with a dangerous weapon, causing substantial bodily harm and two counts of armed robbery with use of force. He was sentenced to over 20 years in prison. 
Garcia was placed in clinical observation on July 8. According to records provided by Susan Garcia, Victor Garcia was placed there because he told security staff and psychological services that he was feeling suicidal. 
An incident report said that Garcia stated he was using psychological services to remove himself from general population status “due to fears that he was being targeted as an informant.” Susan Garcia said her brother had suicidal thoughts and had been threatened by another incarcerated person. 
In the two days prior to his suicide attempt, Garcia did not engage with staff during multiple attempts to evaluate him. According to a review on July 16, Garcia said he felt depressed and felt like dying every day. 
The report said it appeared other members of the psychological services team had recommended exploring a stabilization referral for Garcia to the Wisconsin Resource Center (WRC). WRC provides treatment for severe impairments in daily living caused by mental health challenges. Susan Garcia believes her brother should have been sent to WRC earlier in his time in prison. 
According to a mental health report dated July 19, Victor Garcia was to be monitored every 15 minutes. 
Under the DOC’s clinical observation policy, the frequency with which a patient is monitored can vary. Depending on the level of risk, a patient might be observed at 15, 10 or 5-minute intervals, or constantly. 
According to an incident report by Psych Associate Chastity Drake, Drake thought she heard someone from the clinical observation area “yell they were ‘going to hang’ themselves.” She was unsure who it was. Her report was dated July 19, with an incident time of 2:30 p.m. 
Drake asked who had yelled, and the clinical observation checker told her who it was. The name is redacted in the incident report. Drake stopped at a door to check with that person about whether he was the person who had yelled about hanging himself, and he denied it. 
In front of the shower, Drake reported she “heard a man yelling and it sounded like the voice heard earlier. Due to PIOC going into shower, this writer determined she would touch base with him after the shower.” 
Garcia had access to a ‘tether’

At 2:30-3 p.m., Drake followed the observation checker to check in with Garcia, who was seated on the floor with his back against the door, according to her incident report. Drake could see a “tether” around his neck. She began to bang loudly on the door, yelling “Garcia.” He did not respond. 
Both ends of the tether were secured to the shower door near the shower drain.
Another incident report was completed by correctional officer Anthony Rego, who drove to the hospital where Garcia was treated. He wrote in the report that he’d learned Garcia had been in the shower for approximately 40 minutes, and at some point had the tether around his neck. 
It is unclear if the tether was meant to be attached to the shower door. One incident report said Garcia had used “the tether that was attached to the shower door.” An incident report by correctional officer Tyler Peterson also mentions a tether.
In his report, also dated July 19, Peterson wrote that he was assisting with removing and escorting Victor Garcia from a cell to the observation shower. Once he was in the shower and the door was shut, another correctional officer “removed the tether and wrist restraints,” he wrote. 
Family member questions why Garcia was left tethered while unresponsive 
An incident report by Courtney Schmidt, a licensed psychologist, states she was in RH1 at approximately 2:30 p.m. Schmidt’s report states that she and Drake were waiting to check in with Garcia to assess him for risk and that at the time, he was naked in the shower.
Schmidt wrote that as they walked back to the clinical observation shower, she saw Garcia hanging from the tether. He was unresponsive and she could see that the tether “was wrapped tightly around his neck.” 
Drake began to pound on the shower cell door, and the officer accompanying them called for a “supervisor/help over his radio.” Drake left to go and wait for help in the front, while Schmidt stayed with Garcia. She wrote that she saw his belly slightly moving. 
Schmidt asked the officer if he could take the tether off, “but he stated ‘I am not taking it off until a supervisor comes.’” He then called again over his radio, and Schmidt waited until help arrived. 
In an interview with the Examiner, Susan Garcia questioned the decision to wait for another person to arrive. She thinks the door should have been  opened, and staff should not have waited to assist her brother, “if you obviously see something’s wrong.”
Drake wrote that she heard the officer call for help and went to the clinical observation table to wait for help to arrive. She wrote that “the response appeared delayed due to other high priority events happening at the same time.”
“This writer went to find help and ran into Dr. Stange and Sgt. Ferstl,” Drake wrote. “Sgt. Ferstl and moments later Lt. Laturi and support staff rushed to the clinical observation shower. I observed as the PIOC was removed from cell and began to receive medical treatment.”
In his incident report, supervising officer Steven Laturi wrote that he was working as a shift supervisor. At about 2:40 p.m., he was responding to another emergency in Restrictive Housing Unit 1 (RH1) when he heard a radio call for a supervisor to report to the observation area. 
Laturi wrote that he was unable to respond immediately because he and a team were responding to someone else, whose name was redacted in the report. This person was in a restraint chair in a program cell, and he had tipped his restraint chair back and removed his legs from it. 
According to Ferstl’s incident report, he was assisting Laturi and completing inventory when Drake came out from the RH1 observation area and told staff that Garcia was unresponsive. He reported that at around that time, the observation check officer made a radio call, asking for a supervisor to come to the observation area for an inmate who was harming himself. 
Ferstl wrote that he arrived in the RH1 observation area and saw Garcia sitting upright at the shower door. He tried to get Garcia’s attention, but Garcia was unresponsive. Ferstl made a radio call for a supervisor to report to the observation area. 
Ferstl then “unsecured one end of the door tether which removed the tether’s tension,” he wrote, allowing Garcia to rest in a lying position near the cell door. Ferstl made another radio call, asking the health services unit to report to RH1 immediately. 
How Garcia described himself
Garcia has a profile on penacon.com, a website for finding an incarcerated pen pal. Susan Garcia said her brother set up the profile, which includes photos of artwork. 
Garcia described himself as “an avid reader that enjoys educating, empowering & entertaining myself mentally in a place designed to break the mind, body & spirit.” 
He wrote that being incarcerated at 17 “forced me to mature fast.” “When I’m out,” he wrote, on his bucket list was traveling the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts, experiencing the life of different cultures through food. 
“He would call my kids almost every day,” Susan Garcia said. “Weekly, definitely weekly. He would send them gifts. He loved kids… My brother would give the clothes off his back for you. He was emotional, but hid it. He hid it very well.” 
Further information not yet available 
According to the DOC’s mental health training policy, the department’s division of adult institutions (DAI) is supposed to provide annual update training in suicide prevention to all DAI staff who have contact with incarcerated people. DAI facilities are also supposed to conduct drills simulating a suicide attempt by an incarcerated person and staff response.
On April 17, the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office said it could not release any information pertaining to the investigation at this point. The investigation was being reviewed by the Columbia County District Attorney’s Office, and additional investigation may need to occur. On May 23, the sheriff’s office said there had been no change in the status of the case. 
On May 21, the Examiner submitted a public records request to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, asking for any records produced by any DOC investigation of Garcia’s death.
The DOC denied Susan Garcia access to body camera and security camera footage of Victor Garcia’s suicide attempt, citing security concerns and the public interest in protecting the safety of incarcerated people and staff.

A Broadway-worthy story about the 1920s all-woman Jackson Town Council runs at the Pink Garter Theatre through June 14.
The post ‘Hens deliver’ again at revival of Jackson Petticoat Rules musical appeared first on WyoFile .","“Roosters crow, hens deliver,” five candidates sing in the musical Petticoat Rules as they launch their 1921 campaign in Jackson to become the country’s first all-woman council.
The revival of the musical, first staged 25 years ago, tells the story of that famous group of stalwarts that won two terms and helped turn a frontier town into a livable community. Under the rule of Mayor Grace Miller, who beat her incumbent husband in the election, streets wouldn’t turn into rivers during a rainstorm.
No longer would 2-foot-wide ditches flow into 1-foot-wide gutters. The Town Square wouldn’t be a dump, and Jackson would own its own “Boot Hill” up on Snow King Mountain.
In a delightful script by Broadway playwright Mary Murfitt and show-stopping tunes by composer Pam Phillips, 15 Jackson thespians resurrect Wyoming history in a boot-stomping performance. The show runs through June 14 at the Pink Garter Theatre in Jackson.

With gusto, the players recreate figures from Beaver Dick Leigh to John D. Rockefeller Jr. to Struthers Burt and Cal “The Cowboy” Carrington. They all circulate around the women, including socialite Cissy Patterson, Mayor Miller, her council and Town Marshall Pearl Williams.
“Petticoat Rules in Jackson Hole, a town that works is our only goal,” sings River Nelson as Mayor Miller.
“Cal the cowboy, brings me that special joy,” warbles Sarah Dropinski as Patterson.
Creators Murfitt and Phillips wrote the musical with the help of a 1999 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts after working together on Murfitt’s “Cowgirls” in San Diego. The concept won the grant among applicants from the Equality State.
In the 25th anniversary revival, “we’re especially thrilled to be playing in the Four C Pit Band,” Murfitt and Phillips said in a program statement.

Director Andrew Munz first appeared on the Pink Garter stage at age 10 as one-sixth of the caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland. He’s since launched Tumbleweed Creative Arts and in recent years revived the Pink Garter Theatre to operate as a collaborative arts center.
“I’ve seen firsthand how easily our community can forget its own story,” Munz wrote in the show’s program. At Tumbleweed, “art created on our home turf deserves just as much respect as the art we import.”

Under guise of keeping kids safe, lawmakers look to subvert the freedom to read, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Legislature’s ‘book police’ want Wyoming libraries to pay fines appeared first on WyoFile .","I get angry when I think about legislators determined to subvert Wyoming public libraries’ most crucial role — promoting the freedom to read — under the guise of stopping them from supposedly pushing porn on kids.

Opinion

The Joint Judiciary Committee met in Torrington last month, with several members focused on the best way to punish the Wyoming public library system for this nonexistent problem. 
Rep. Ann Lucas, R-Cheyenne, brought the panel a bag of books from her local library and her own collection. She put sticky notes on pages to indicate “all the nasty words” that made them inappropriate for children.
Rep. Jayme Lien, R-Casper, said Wyoming should follow Iowa’s model legislation that defines, in graphic detail, what’s considered “sexually explicit,” but I’ll spare you the lengthy list of orifices and sex toys she read from at the meeting.
Then, five days after the meeting, a federal judge temporarily blocked Iowa from prohibiting school libraries and classrooms from buying books that depict sex acts.
One of the problems the judge cited was the law’s statewide prohibitions “on what has traditionally been the prerogative of local officials regarding the contents of school libraries.”
That’s a major misstep the committee must reconsider before it makes the same mistake. Why do legislators want to take a sledgehammer to local control and a system that already allows parents and the public to challenge books they object to?
The committee voted to draft a bill that would effectively keep books with objectionable sexual content in a section clearly labeled “adults only.” Unless it’s behind closed doors, librarians would need to constantly patrol to make certain no toddlers, grade-schoolers or teens wander in.


But it’s not at all clear from the committee’s discussion whether it wants to take books that have been banned in many U.S. libraries because of their sexual content and make them unavailable for teens. This means students curious about classic books that, under the bill, the state deems too sexually explicit for minors — by well-regarded authors like Harper Lee, J.D. Salinger, George Orwell, Kurt Vonnegut, Toni Morrison and many other writers — may not be able to access them in libraries.
Younger children would be confined to their own section, free to read books that parents can be assured don’t have any LGBTQ+ characters, lest their kiddos ask what each of those letters means. 
Those forbidden books — particularly ones with transgender themes, the Legislature’s favorite target — would be unavailable to the people they were written for: teens who may be struggling with their own gender identity. They desperately want information but don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone, especially adults.
One of the books Lucas brought, “Gender Queer,” was repeatedly condemned. It’s a 2019 graphic memoir written and illustrated by Maia Kobabe that takes readers on a journey of self-discovery and understanding of the author’s nonbinary and asexual identity.
Sen. Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne, co-chair of the joint committee, compared the book to a pornographic Hustler magazine. “I question whether it belongs in a publicly funded library in the state of Wyoming, period,” he said.
Lindsey Travis, president of the Wyoming Library Association, explained that “we have policies in place so parents make the decision about what their kids check out, not the librarians.” 
“There’s not one librarian out there who is forcing anyone to check out any book,” Travis said.
“These books are rampant across Wyoming,” Olsen maintained. “This idea of local control I support, but local control is obviously not working if these books are in our libraries.”
Local control used to be a mantra of the GOP, but now it’s conveniently forgotten when it offends far-right sensibilities. Apparently, they know better than you what’s appropriate for your children.
Lucas sponsored a bill earlier this year to remove an exemption in state obscenity statutes for librarians, teachers and museum workers. It rightfully died in the House Judiciary Committee, but if it ever passes, authorities could charge them for providing obscene material to minors, making them subject to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine.
Several committee members said they oppose any penalties in a new bill.
I’m glad there’s little appetite for putting librarians in jail.
But Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, chairman emeritus of the Freedom Caucus, was still looking for someone to pay for allegedly risking children’s safety. He urged the committee to use an approach the Freedom Caucus deployed with the Second Amendment Protection Act — a bill that Gov. Mark Gordon ultimately vetoed.
The bill would have prohibited any local agency from hiring former U.S. government employees who had ever enforced any type of federal firearms regulation. The agencies could be fined $50,000 for hiring veterans who had that experience.
Lien made monetarily penalizing libraries a part of her successful motion to draft a bill prohibiting sexually explicit material from being available in school or public libraries’ children’s sections. She lifted another idea from the gun bill: allow citizens to sue libraries for failing to enforce the law.
So now we’ll clog the courts with book challenges that are routinely handled by librarians and library boards.
Here’s a novel idea: Instead of “Iowa-ifying” Wyoming by passing an unconstitutional law in a political gambit to convince voters they’re “saving” children, let’s follow a different path.
Six states – California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and Washington — have passed laws in the past two years that preserve access to reading materials that deal with racial and sexual themes, including the LGBTQ+ community.
Wyoming should become the first red state to join this effort and show that the freedom to read is a principle we uphold, and we won’t abide by censorship in any form. Wyoming should protect libraries from civil suits, not fine them and invite litigation. And just as importantly, Wyoming should continue to allow parents — and not the government — to decide what’s best for their children.

For years, states have taxed hospitals and other health care providers to draw down federal matching funds and help finance their Medicaid programs. Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.










Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

The plume from the explosion rose 400–600 feet into the air, was visible for miles, and threw rocks that destroyed the nearby boardwalk and littered the landscape with debris.
The rock ejected by the explosion was made up of glacial debris, sandstone and siltstone, all of which are part of the geological deposit that makes up the immediate subsurface. None of the rhyolite bedrock was found, indicating that the explosion was rooted at very shallow levels (probably within 100 feet of the surface).

Also present in the debris was impermeable silica that was probably lining the hot water conduits feeding Black Diamond Pool. Silica is dissolved in much of the water that feeds Yellowstone hot springs and geysers, and as that water nears the surface and cools, the silica precipitates out as a solid. It can coat the conduits and, because it is impermeable, can seal the system.
This can cause pressure to build and might eventually lead to an explosion, like the one that occurred on July 23, 2024.
In the weeks and months following the explosion, scientists from several institutions collaborated to install temporary monitoring stations around Black Diamond Pool, including trail cameras, seismometers, acoustic sensors and electromagnetic instruments. The cameras often recorded changes — for example, that new rocks had been ejected from the pool — and the seismometers and acoustic sensors detected several dozen eruptions from the pool.
Some of the eruptions were associated with surges of water that knocked over seismic nodes and moved them from their original locations or partially buried them in silt.
At least two small eruptions, expelling water, mud and small rocks 20–30 feet into the air, were witnessed since the July 23, 2024, explosion. One occurred on Nov. 5, 2024, while scientists were collecting gas samples. Another took place on Jan. 3, 2025, and was observed by a tour group that was passing by the area.

Since the July 23, 2024, explosion, Biscuit Basin has been closed to public visitation as Yellowstone National Park assesses damage and the potential for future hazardous events. To aid with the assessment, on May 14, 2025, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists installed a new webcam in Biscuit Basin. Static images from the camera are publicly available at https://www.usgs.gov/media/webcams/biscuit-basin-webcam, with images updated every 15 minutes.
The camera is a temporary deployment installed on the damaged boardwalk, so the picture is somewhat tilted due to the slope of the boardwalk itself. Nevertheless, the view of Black Diamond Pool is clear, and the camera has pan, tilt and zoom capabilities that allow the frame to be adjusted if activity warrants.
Because the deployment is not intended to be permanent, the camera might fail due to problems with power or telemetry systems. If this happens, we will work to get the camera back online as soon as possible. The camera is intended to operate at least throughout the summer of 2025, and if warranted may be hardened to last throughout the winter months.
Bandwidth at the site is not sufficient at this time to support live streaming, but video is being recorded on site. If the static images document the occurrence of an event (based on the appearance of new rocks or wet ground, for example), video can be downloaded for analysis. If any such events are captured, we’ll be sure to post video clips to the Yellowstone Volcano Observatoy website.
We hope that this new view is of interest to the public, and we are confident it will provide a new perspective on activity at Black Diamond Pool that will be useful for the ongoing assessment of hazards from the area. Many thanks to Yellowstone National Park for supporting this deployment, which was completed under research permit YELL-2025-SCI-5842.
Biscuit Basin remains closed due to the damaged caused on July 23, 2024, as well as hazards posed by potential future hazardous hydrothermal events. So for those who would like a current close-up view of Black Diamond Pool, check out the observatory’s new camera! And stay tuned for more details about the July 23 explosion and subsequent activity as research efforts continue.

But beware: two beaches on Oʻahu and Kauaʻi topped the list of shorelines across the country that are top-priority “bacteria hot spots,” according to a new report by the Surfrider Foundation.
More than 90% of the water samples collected in 2024 from the popular swim spots — Kahaluʻu on Oʻahu and Waikomo Stream at Kōloa Landing on Kauaʻi — had bacteria levels above state health standards. While other parts of the state’s coastlines are even more polluted, of places used by the public, these spots are among the highest-risk for poor water quality.
The data comes from the foundation’s Blue Water Task Force, which analyzes water quality where local governments typically aren’t keeping track. Nationally, 80% of test sites last year had at least one high bacteria result above state health standards. 
“Each location regularly shows dangerous levels of fecal-indicator bacteria tied to human illnesses, including gastrointestinal issues, flu-like symptoms, and serious skin conditions like MRSA and staph infections,” the report said.
Hawaiʻi’s reliance on cesspools has led to particularly stark problems. Wastewater contributes to the problem at Kahaluʻu, according to Daniel Amato, who coordinates the foundation’s data collection on Oʻahu. 
“It’s one of the areas that is just kind of chronically polluted with fecal indicator bacteria,” he said.
Hawaiʻi’s Hot Spots
About a fifth of Surfrider’s 83 test sites in Hawaiʻi had high levels of bacteria more than half of the time, mostly in locations near cesspools. 
In some places, it was even worse. 
Bacteria was detected in every sample collected from Nāwiliwili Stream, which feeds into Kalapaki Bay at Nāwiliwili Beach Park on Kauaʻi. The site has failed to meet water quality standards every month since 2018. 
Just last year, a sign finally went up warning would-be swimmers that high bacteria levels had been detected in the stream, after almost a decade of pressure from Surfrider Foundation. 


Other places also consistently had excessively high bacteria levels. On Oʻahu, Surfrider’s team collects samples across the island every two weeks. One site on Oʻahu’s Windward side, Punaluʻu Beach Park, fell short of state health standards in every sample collected last year.
The problem is particularly bad at the mouths of streams where water flows out to the ocean. Those fresh water sources dump runoff from cesspools, animal waste and other sources of bacterial pollution into the ocean.  
“The bacteria is coming down through these watersheds. It’s being generated by feral animals and human on-site wastewater systems like cesspools and septic tanks, particularly after heavy rains and brown water type events,” Amato said. “So that’s our primary concern — stream mouths near the ocean, where families and people tend to be in the water.”
Maui’s Waters Among Cleanest
In January 2024, several months after the devastating wildfire in Lahaina, Surfrider tested samples from nearby sites for evidence of fire-related contaminants. And here’s some good news: The tests turned up no evidence of any risk to human health from contamination after the fire.
Actually, Maui’s waters tend to be among the cleanest. More than 50% of spots where Surfrider collected samples last year never saw high levels of bacteria in excess of health standards. And even when there were indications of high bacteria levels, those spikes were less frequent on Maui than on Oʻahu and Kauaʻi. 


So what’s safe? 
Beaches that don’t have freshwater sources like streams tend to have less bacteria. 
During the rainy season, “storms serve to ‘flush’ the islands and can result in large amounts of water, sediment, wastewater, and pollutants flowing downhill into the ocean,” bringing with them more bacteria, according to the report. 
But water quality issues and bacteria spikes don’t just happen in the winter. Stagnant water also leads to higher bacteria levels. 


Surfrider recommends paying attention to water quality conditions, avoiding brown water even if there’s no posted warning and staying out of those spots where fresh water streams flow into the ocean.
“For me, it’s more about areas where families go. You always see kids playing in the streams, and you have the beach parks,” Amato said. “And our data is telling us that is not a good idea.”
 “If the water looks questionable,” he said, “it probably is.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)This story was published in partnership with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence. 
As gun violence surged in cities across the country after the start of the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, shootings rose even more steeply in Lansing, Michigan. The worst period came in 2021, when the rate of fatal shootings reached 20 per 100,000 residents, two points higher than the national rate.  
“That wave was so devastating,” said Marlon Beard, a community activist in Lansing whose 17-year-old son, Marshawn, was shot and killed in 2021. “We all kind of asked ourselves what we can do about it.” 
In response, city officials and community groups raised enough money from federal grants and the city to establish a local Advance Peace program, a national violence intervention method that identifies known shooters, with support from the police, and enrolls them in an 18-month fellowship. By late 2022, violence interrupters hit the ground in southwest Lansing, mentoring, conducting skills training, and providing job opportunities to 15 participants. 
Within months, police data showed a decline in shootings. To better understand the program’s efficacy, Advance Peace leaders commissioned a study by the Michigan Public Health Institute and Michigan State University. The study, published in March, found a 19 percent decrease in all shooting incidents from October 2022 to September 2024. More specifically, it found a 52 percent decline in fatal shootings and a 10 percent decline in nonfatal shootings. 
A program that works directly with shooters in Lansing is finding success — and police support

But the overall drop also coincided with a national decrease in gun violence as the pandemic receded. Determining how much of the decline was due to intervention and how much it reflected national trends remains a key part of the puzzle in understanding gun violence trends in Lansing and similar cities. The end of the pandemic also heralded the federal Build Back Better Act, which included $5 billion for community violence intervention work, along with less direct funding that strengthened the social safety net that is crucial in many communities with disproportionate rates of gun deaths. 
That widespread funding anchored programs like this one. The first 18-month Advance Peace fellowship started in late 2022 with 15 fellows on the southwest side, where shootings were most prevalent. Fatal shootings and nonfatal shootings fell by 38 percent and 32 percent, respectively, in that area. But the drop in fatal shootings was greater in the three sections of the city where Advance Peace didn’t have an initial presence, raising questions about the program’s influence. The southwest did, however, have the largest reduction in nonfatal shootings compared to the other areas. 
According to the Lansing study, Advance Peace effectively engaged with the people most likely to pick up a gun, who were identified through family members, friends, other activists, law enforcement, and people recently released from jails and prisons. More than 90 percent of participants no longer use guns to go on the offensive, said Paul Elam, the chief strategy officer at the Michigan Public Health Institute and a key member of the team that implemented the program in Lansing. Elam later took a step back from street-level engagement to join the research team.
“We have evidence that this works,” he said. “We have the evidence to prove that a public health approach works.”
Joseph Richardson, a gun violence researcher and professor at the University of Maryland, said the Advance Peace model can be successful, but more data is needed to show that the program was driving the drop in shootings. “There were significant reductions in fatal shootings where they weren’t doing their work,” Richardson said, but added that continued research of community violence intervention programs is crucial to better understanding “the role a CVI group plays locally. That’s how we learn what steps need to be taken to implement the work properly.”
The second fellowship, which covers the entire city, started in July 2024 and will continue working with 55 fellows until December, when the Trump administration’s termination of $169 million in grants for violence intervention and community safety programs leaves cities like Lansing to scramble for alternatives. Half of Advance Peace Lansing’s funding comes from federal grants, and its leaders are now strategizing about how to raise enough money to sustain the organization’s 22-person staff and $3.5 million annual budget.
“If you remove that intervention piece, gun violence will go up again,” said Michael McKissic, who runs Mikey23, a nonprofit gun violence prevention program that trains young people in trades like construction, plumbing, and electrical work. “We need that intervention. Our organization can’t do that, other organizations can’t do it. You need those individuals who are going to go in and show them the error of their ways.” 
The study showed that fatal shootings decreased by 19 percent more in Lansing from 2022 to 2024 than they did nationally — when gun violence was already dropping across the country post-pandemic. But the city’s rate of nonfatal shootings fluctuated, ending with a 15 percent decline in 2024. Richardson said this is the kind of discrepancy that requires more analysis, but that continued research will be more difficult after the cuts from the federal government. 
Elam and the other authors of the study said gun violence prevention has always been an uphill battle, and hope the promising declines don’t cause leaders to disengage with gun violence prevention. They also emphasized the positive feedback they’ve gotten from residents who say their boots-on-the-ground work has built trust, as well as city leaders, police, and the fellows themselves, most of whom are under 18 years old. 
“We can talk to them,” one of the 16-year-old fellows told The Trace, referring to Advance Peace’s credible messengers. “They care about us, they’re there for us.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/crime-scene.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

				This article is the second in a series on the environmental costs of America’s last remaining alumina refinery. Read Part 1. 



GRAMERCY — There’s a small area along the Mississippi River’s east bank where the land, buildings and roadways are rust-colored and where the air is frequently filled with the same mineral that covers the surface of Mars.
That spot, about 45 miles west-northwest of New Orleans, is near the entrance of the Atlantic Alumina plant, known better as Atalco, the only bauxite refinery in the United States. Bauxite is a rock composed of aluminum oxides and other heavy metals such as iron oxide — the same compound that gives Mars its famous rusty hue.   
Periodically, the bauxite dust travels across the river and blankets the small, historically-Black community of Wallace. In other instances, Atalco has discharged large plumes of white-colored dust from the refined alumina that has traveled as far as 4 miles from the facility. The plant occupies roughly 3 square miles of land at the St. James-St. John the Baptist Parish border.
For Shamell Lavigne, who lives in Wallace, the red remnants from Atalco are one of the many industry-caused hazards of living in St. James Parish. She is an organizer with Rise St. James, a community activist group that focuses on environmental justice.
“Any given day you can pass by over there and, if the wind is blowing a certain way, it’s blowing that red dust,” Lavigne said. 
For years, Lavigne said, rumors have circled in the community that the dust particles from Atalco might contain mercury or arsenic. Both toxic metals have been found in the slurry that spilled from recent levee breaks around Atalco’s manmade “red mud” lakes. 
The series of breaches and leaks dating back to last year are detailed in thousands of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration. An LDEQ spokesman only confirmed that an investigation into Atalco was ongoing when asked for comment. 



The sludge has repeatedly escaped from containment areas and contaminated a public drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp. Lab testing of impacted water and soil samples from those discharges found poisonous heavy metal elements — some at concentrations far beyond the legal and safe limits, government records detail. 
Atalco has not responded to multiple interview requests from the Illuminator.
Gramercy resident Gail LeBoeuf, 72, has lived roughly half a mile from the Atalco facility since 1999 and believes it could be a source of some of her health problems. 
She was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2022, adding to the prevalence of cases along the Mississippi River corridor that go back decades. It has given rise to the label “Cancer Alley” to describe the area between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, where the population has one of the highest concentrations of cancer diagnoses in the nation, according to data from the EPA’s air toxin mapping tool.
Studies have linked the cancer to the area’s high levels of pollution, especially in predominantly Black fenceline communities next to industrial facilities. Nearly 70% of Gramercy residents are Black, according to U.S. Census figures. This includes LeBoeuf, who also has bronchitis that she believes could be the result of Atalco’s particulate matter discharges. 
Residents, some as far as 5 miles from the plant, periodically find their property and vehicles covered in a layer of red bauxite dust or white powder from the making of alumina.  
Elevated levels of arsenic are present in the waste product of alumina refining. Recent medical studies have found that even low levels of arsenic exposure through drinking water can cause bronchitis and certain other respiratory diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health. 
“It’s hard to think it’s not environmentally related,” LeBoeuf said of her illnesses, though she added that her doctors can’t say for certain how much the industrial pollution is to blame.

Pollution by air, land and water
Neighbors of the Atalco alumina refinery face exposure to dust and waste throughout the process, according to a review of regulatory documents. Plus, the facility has repeatedly poured toxic waste into the Mississippi River — and skirted the blame.
From its dock on the river, the Atalco facility receives constant shipments of crushed bauxite ore from its mining operation in Jamaica, where it is extracted near communities that — just like in Louisiana — are routinely caked in a layer of red dust.
When the ships arrive at Atalco, the dock has a system that unloads the bauxite powder from the ship and into a hopper connected to a conveyor belt that carries it into the refinery. Unloading the bauxite from the ship into the hopper is one of the more environmentally risky points in the process because it is prone to spills and wind exposure that carries the red dust into the atmosphere. The company recently installed a fogging system on the conveyor in an effort to minimize the wind-blown dust, though records show it has broken down at times.
The fogger also does nothing to minimize airborne dust from the dried chemical residues in Atalco’s red mud lakes.

Although Atalco was formally notified of the levee breaches surrounding its lakes in August, there were many earlier signs of trouble at the facility. 
LDEQ’s file on the company contains multiple reports about the facility’s pollution leaving chemical residues on homes, vehicles, plants and waterways.
Atalco has an interior system of containment ditches designed to catch chemical spills, stormwater runoff and the wastewater used to process the bauxite. The system is separate from the public drainage ditches that run along the highways outside of the facility. One of Atalco’s ditch systems has an outfall pipe that drains into the Mississippi River, so LDEQ requires the company to treat its process wastewater — which is water used for industrial processes — to keep it relatively free from hazardous contaminants and monitor it with basic water quality testing such as “potential for hydrogen” or pH levels.
Clean water has a neutral pH of around 7.0 on a 14-point scale. Values below 7 are considered acidic, while values above it are considered alkaline. Any extremes at either end of the scale, below 4 and above 10, often indicate the presence of dissolved chemicals that can be hazardous or even fatal to humans, animals and plant life. 
Under the provisions of its river outfall permit, Atalco is prohibited from discharging wastewater with a pH over 10.0 for more than 446 minutes, or just over 7 hours per month, an EPA standard. Most fish cannot survive in water with a pH level over 9.5. Atalco’s outfall monitor consistently detected amounts far greater in the months leading up to the discovery of the red mud lake levee breaches in August 2024.  
One of the highest readings occurred in February 2024, when the facility discharged waste with a pH of 13.2 for a total of over 19,000 minutes — nearly two weeks. That discharge was 43 times greater than what the EPA allows. Records show Atalco exceeded that permit limit almost every month — discharging highly caustic chemicals into the Mississippi River — going as far back as July 2023.  
In nearly every occurrence, the company blamed either the weather or some other third party, telling LDEQ the discharges could not have been prevented. For the discharge in February 2024, Atalco blamed it on a power outage and a lack of steady suppliers for the chemicals needed to neutralize high pH discharge, records show. The state has not penalized the company for those incidents.

Hotline complaint
On April 10, 2024, authorities received a more specific warning sign. Someone filed an anonymous complaint with the National Response Center regarding a “release of an unknown red and orange material onto the ground and into the roadside ditches” surrounding the Atalco plant, according to LDEQ records. 
“Caller states that nothing has been done for clean up and the vegetation is dead in that area,” the complaint noted.  
The National Response Center is a federal communications center that manages a 24-hour hotline for the reporting of chemical spills, train derailments and port security incidents throughout the country. Most complaints reported come from government officials or workers in the industrial and transportation sectors. 
U.S. Coast Guard Coast personnel who staff the hotline are trained to screen complaints and, if necessary, forward them to the agencies most appropriate to respond. For this complaint, the Coast Guard wrote an incident report and immediately notified LDEQ. 
The state agency initiated an investigation but did not visit the facility until 10 days later. During that site visit, the state inspector drove along the highways surrounding the Atalco plant but did not see anything suspicious in the ditches.

The LDEQ inspector then called Atalco on April 22, 2024 — 12 days after the complaint — to ask about the allegation. Atalco’s environmental manager, Charlotte Hooker, told LDEQ that heavy rainfall brought a lot of surface water to the facility. She acknowledged the plant saw a spike in discharges into the Mississippi River but denied that Atalco was polluting the public ditches outside of the facility. 
During the company’s discussion with LDEQ, someone noted that the anonymous caller may have simply witnessed run-off from nearby farmland with red-orange colored soil, according to the inspector’s report.
LDEQ accepted Atalco’s explanation and closed the investigation, according to state records. 
If the investigation had continued, Lavigne said LDEQ might have discovered the levee breaches sooner but doubts if it would have made much of a difference. She said the agency doesn’t do much to compel companies to prevent accidents or clean them up when they happen. She and other residents said authorities are reluctant to enforce regulations because of Atalco’s status as the only remaining alumina plant in the country. 
“I do think that they’re protected in that sense,” Lavigne said.
Atalco became the only remaining domestic source of alumina in the United States after the only other bauxite refinery, L’Alumina, located in Ascension Parish, closed in 2020. 










They’re the only alumina plant in the country, so they ride that horse every time they get in trouble.

Previous infractions
Following a 2017 compliance inspection, LDEQ cited Atalco for 78 state Environmental Quality Act violations, mostly related to the company’s air pollution permit. In 2020, the state negotiated a fine of $75,000 and allowed Atalco to deny any wrongdoing. 
At the federal level, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has cited Atalco for 370 violations since 2021 mostly for caustic material spills, according to an Advocate report. The company paid over a half-million dollars in fines related to those violations.
The residents of St. James and St. John parishes have long been aware of Atalco’s incidents and say the threat of fines has done little to curb the company’s pollution practices. 
Kristy Cambre, a long-time resident of one of the Gramercy neighborhoods closest to Atalco, noticed a layer of white dust covering her vehicle the morning of May 23. 
“It didn’t just wash off quickly or normally,” Cambre said. “Some spots kind of bubbled almost like I was rinsing off a soap.”
The red dustings used to appear more frequently, but Cambre and other residents are now seeing more of the white substance.

The red dust comes from the raw bauxite ore or the dried residue from the red mud lakes, while the white dust is the refined alumina. Mounds of the refined alumina piled on the ground can be seen from the roadways when driving by the facility, and clouds of both white and red dust can be seen coming from Atalco’s shipping dock and its conveyor belts.   
Cambre said she never reports the dustings to authorities, but some of her neighbors have. LDEQ’s file on the company is filled with incident reports prompted by citizen complaints, mostly about the chemical dust and about rust-colored water filling the public ditches. 
In most of those cases, LDEQ records show inspectors would not substantiate the complaints, writing that they have no way of knowing whether the red dust came from Atalco or some nearby farms. 
Farms surrounding Atalco grow sugarcane, and the Illuminator could not find any with finely powdered rust-colored soil.
In most cases, the inspectors reported in their records that they spoke with Atalco executives but never that they spoke with any of the farmers who purportedly have rust-colored soil.  
“They’re turning a blind eye to it,” LeBoeuf said.

Craig Calcagano, alderman-at-large for the town of Gramercy, agreed with LeBoeuf’s assessment. He said he first noticed Atalco’s lakes leaking waste in early 2024 and reported it to both the company and LDEQ, but nothing was ever done about them, he said. 
“They’re the only alumina plant in the country, so they ride that horse every time they get in trouble,” Calcagano said. 
The company has occasionally paid some fines over the years, but nothing has really changed because the pollution continues, Calcagano said. Atalco’s chemicals cover his property on an almost daily basis, he said. The public drainage ditches run red when it rains, and the Blind River Swamp across from the facility is dying, according to the alderman. 
“When it starts destroying everything you got, which you work all your life for like everybody around here, what can you do?” Calcagano asked. “When we complain, we complain on deaf ears because they don’t want to hear it.”
Atalco’s pollution also affects people who don’t live near the plant such as Teresa Williams, who works at a facility down the road from Atalco and said her car gets splattered with rust-colored residue every time she drives to and from her job. 
Gary Watson, a Wallace native who still owns property there but now lives in New Orleans, said the pollution is one of the reasons he left. 
“There should be outrage,” Watson said after he was told of the levee breaches. 
Lavigne, the community activist, said she is concerned about the people who work at Atalco who might be exposed to the toxic chemicals.

One of the more notable incidents occurred July 5, 1999, when an explosion at the plant injured 29 people and dispersed caustic waste. A federal Mine Safety and Health Administration investigation found that a power outage led to a buildup of pressure in the four giant tanks used to heat the caustic slurry. 
LDEQ records indicate the facility has seen numerous other incidents in recent years, including seven incidents since May 2022, resulting in chemical and diesel spills, severe burns to workers that required hospitalization and one death when 45-year-old Curtis Diggs fell into a pit of sodium hydroxide because a grate used to cover the area was missing. (Read more below) 
In previous incidents, Atalco has always claimed its red dust is non-hazardous, which is also a position the EPA still holds. However, recent studies have linked bauxite dust exposure to certain diseases. 
This additional research has prompted the EPA to issue warnings about bauxite’s potential to contain toxic metals and trace radioactive elements, though the toxicity is generally more concentrated in the red mud byproduct. 
Slawomir Lomnicki, an environmental scientist at LSU, said the danger with Atalco’s red mud lakes is the potential for the toxic metal to leach into the groundwater. 
Another risk is that the red mud in the lakes can dry out and turn into airborne dust that can be carried off by the wind, according to Ganga Hettiarachchi, a professor of soil and environmental chemistry at Kansas State University. 
It’s unclear what, if any, consequences Atalco will face in connection with its many permit violations. So far, LDEQ has issued a warning letter for 23 violations in connection with the levee breaches, providing little solace to some of the residents in St. James Parish.
“It looks like, you know, they’re gonna be protected,” Lavigne said. “They’re definitely one of the plants that’s been on our list of really dirty plants.”

Major incidents at the Atalco refinery in the past three years

May 3, 2022 – A large semi-trailer generator caught fire at the facility, spilling about 250 gallons of diesel into a storm drain. 
June 9, 2022 – An Atalco employee was hospitalized with severe chemical burns from a spillage of sodium hydroxide, which the report defined as an “extremely hazardous” caustic liquid.
Nov. 7, 2022 – An Atalco employee suffered chemical burns to his neck, chest and arm from a spillage of caustic liquid. 
Feb. 6, 2023 – Two Atalco workers were hospitalized with severe chemical burns and a third suffered minor injuries after a tank of caustic liquid overflowed and spilled onto them. 
Jan. 7, 2024 – Four Atalco workers were hospitalized with severe chemical burns after a valve failed, spraying them with what records described as an “extremely hazardous” caustic liquid. The company blamed the workers. 
May 4, 2024 – A white crystalline substance blanketed cars, homes, plants and other outdoor surfaces in Gramercy, Lutcher and Paulina. Parish and state authorities figured out it was aluminum oxide coming from Atalco, and the company admitted it was the result of a broken dust valve. Still, Atalco deflected blame, telling LDEQ the failure of the valve could not be anticipated. A later root cause analysis determined the company should have performed more frequent inspections of the equipment. 
Aug. 4, 2024 – A contract worker, 45-year-old Curtis Diggs of Baton Rouge, fell into a sump of sodium hydroxide because part of the grate that covered the pit was missing. He was airlifted to a New Orleans hospital with severe chemical burns and died about a month later.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Atalco-red-sign-1024x574.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

Grueneich works to build support for people living with HIV, including advocating for legislation approved earlier this year. (Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)A Bismarck man who has experienced substance abuse, recovery and living with HIV is hoping to develop his leadership skills after being awarded a Bush Foundation fellowship. 
“I’ve been able to change my own life and work to help others to do the same,” Jason Grueneich told the North Dakota Monitor. “I’m just lucky to be alive and here doing the work. And it’s amazing that the Bush Foundation saw something in me.” 
Grueneich’s work includes being an advocate for those living with HIV. He created Bismarck’s first LGBTQ+ recovery group and this year founded Shine Bright and Live, an HIV-focused nonprofit, and helped repeal a North Dakota state law that he said stigmatized people who are HIV positive. 
Grueneich is one of three North Dakotans awarded a Bush Fellowship in 2025. Up to 30 Bush Fellows are selected each year to receive up to $150,000 to support their leadership goals. Fellows can come from any sector — including business, nonprofit and government, according to the Bush Foundation. 
Grueneich said the Bush Foundation isn’t so much about funding a project but investing in leaders. 
“Leaders work to bring as many people with them as possible,” Grueneich said. “It ripples out into the community and raises people up.” 
Gruenich grew up in Bismarck but said he moved away, developed a substance abuse problem and became infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
He returned to Bismarck and went through a recovery program in 2016. 
Since then, “I have dedicated myself to community,” Grueneich said. 




 Other ND Bush Fellows

Two other North Dakota also were awarded a Bush Fellowship. 
Sarah Dixon-Hackey of West Fargo will pursue certification in suicide prevention skills, expand her expertise in digital media, and deepen her research into cultural disparities in care, according to a news release. She has created storytelling projects with college students and produced podcasts for refugee families to amplify underrepresented voices, especially on the topic of mental health. 
Richard Pallay III of Fargo has used his experience as a DJ to found the cultural initiative WEAREONE. He also launched Soul Dads, a peer support network for Black fathers that blends mentorship with creative expression. Pallay will use his Bush Fellowship to launch a statewide artist network and scale Soul Dads into a model that can be replicated, the news release said.  



Grueneich chairs the North Dakota HIV Advisory Board while working in state government. He has worked for the Department of Transportation for the past five years and is operations manager for the driver’s license division. 
After founding Shine Bright and Live in January, Grueneich spent time at the Capitol advocating for the repeal of a state law that makes it a felony to willfully transfer body fluid containing the HIV virus. 
Rep. Gretchen Dobervich, D-Fargo, sponsored House Bill 1217 that repeals the law. 
She said the law singled out HIV from other infectious diseases by creating the felony crime and discouraged people from getting tested for HIV, leading to the potential spread of the virus. 
The law, “had the opposite effect of what it was intended,” Dobervich said. 
She said Grueneich was instrumental in getting the bill through the Legislature. 
“He was able to make the issue real,” Dobervich said. 
Testifying in front of a legislative committee was new for him, Grueneich said. 
“A leader faces fears,” Grueneich said. “Somebody living with HIV, standing in front of the Legislature numerous times when there’s a lot of stigma about HIV can be daunting.” 
In his testimony, Gruenich cited President Donald Trump, who in his first term in 2019, used the State of the Union address to announce a plan to end the HIV epidemic. 
Grueneich said it was a way to find common ground on HIV issues.
“Unfortunately, we see now the administration is cutting funding for HIV prevention. It’s cutting funding for the years of work we’ve had on finding HIV vaccination or care,” he said. 
Grueneich said one way he hopes to benefit from the Bush Fellowship is learning how to deal with traumatic life experiences that come with working with high-risk communities such as HIV and recovery. 
“You’re continually working through trauma and loss,” Grueneich said. “I want to learn how to heal and process those losses, so I can teach others how they can process that and then refill their cups so they can keep doing the work that’s necessary.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee closed a loop of electric vehicle chargers connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga in May, marking a significant milestone in the state’s push to support EV adoption.
Meanwhile, a federally funded program intended to round out Tennessee’s EV charging network — particularly on the state’s major interstates and U.S. 64 — has been halted since February at the instruction of President Donald Trump’s administration.
Tennessee’s Fast Charge TN program aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways. In the roughly 400-mile loop closed in May with the installation of chargers in the small town of Athens, EV drivers can now access chargers every 34 miles.
The state’s $24 million program is funded separately through funds from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients. 
Some U.S. Republicans are pushing to keep energy tax credits. Tennessee lawmakers aren’t among them.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s Office of Energy Programs released a Notice of Intent for the Fast Charge program’s second round in February and expects to solicit projects for 13 gap areas throughout the state “in the coming months.”
Fast Charge TN’s federally backed counterpart remains at a standstill.
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated up to $5 billion to support EV charger installation along “Alternative Fuel Corridors” across the nation. Tennessee was set to receive $88 million over a 5-year period to complete a plan created by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).
Upon taking office, Trump issued an executive order to pause the disbursement of federal grant money for programs supporting electric vehicles and clean energy initiatives under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended NEVI funding in February, despite having already approved states’ program plans.
TDOT awarded $21 million in NEVI funds to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, but none of those contracts have been executed as the pause remains in effect, according to TDOT Community Relations Director Beth Emmons.
Sixteen states, Washington D.C. and multiple environmental and clean energy groups sued the U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration in a Washington federal court in May, arguing the federal agencies had no authority to freeze funds already appropriated by Congress. The Executive Branch, the suit contends, cannot “override or suspend this process based on changing policy priorities.”
EVs in Tennessee: Uncertainty abounds as Trump targets Biden-era electric vehicle funding

Tennessee is not one of the plaintiffs.
Gov. Bill Lee and Tennessee’s Congressional representatives have largely been mum on the tension between the state’s work to grow the EV industry and the Trump administration’s efforts to retract federal support.
Tennessee has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into incentives and grants to entice EV-related businesses to locate their manufacturing plants in the state. Lee and the state’s economic development department have celebrated the hundreds of jobs promised by EV enterprises since 2017, many in rural areas. 
All but one of Tennessee’s representatives in the U.S. House voted in favor of an amended version of Trump’s budget reconciliation bill — which would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits for consumers and create new annual taxes for EV and hybrid owners — in May. Lee also celebrated the bill’s passage in the House, and did not respond to a request for comment regarding the potential impact to Tennessee’s EV industry.
The bill must pass in the U.S. Senate to become law.

The DOL […],"Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va. (center), visits the Charleston Job Corps Center in July 2023. (Office of Congresswoman Carol Miller photo)At least one of the West Virginia locations of a federal youth job training program will be affected by a “pause” in operations announced by the Trump administration late last week. 
The Department of Labor announced last week it would “pause” operations at all 99 contractor-operated Job Corps locations nationwide by June 25. The DOL said it would arrange transportation and cover expenses for current students back to their homes of record by June 30. 
The “pause” includes the Job Corps center at Charleston, according to news reports. 
West Virginia’s other Job Corps location, the Harpers Ferry Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center, is operated by the U.S. Forest Service. While that office will not be affected by the announcement from the Department of Labor, a spokesperson for the federal Department of Agriculture said Monday it will also review operations at its 24 Job Corps offices.  
“The Trump Administration is looking critically at the way we do business, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the best possible service for our customers, and the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars,” a USDA spokesperson wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. “The Department of Labor has notified USDA of their intention to terminate Job Corps contracts and suspend operations for the Job Corps program. USDA is reviewing the program and will determine the status of our 24 centers soon. We continue to work closely with DOL and Congress to ensure USDA Job Corps facilities continue to prioritize the health and safety of program participants.”
Calls to the Charleston Job Corps center and the Harpers Ferry Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center were not immediately returned Monday. 
The Department of Labor’s decision to suspend the Job Corps program came after an “internal review” of its outcome and structure, the agency said in a news release. The program has been in a “financial crisis” for years, the DOL said. The program operated at a $140 million deficit in 2024. The deficit is expected to grow to $213 million in 2025. 
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training and community,” U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a news release. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve. 
“We remain committed to ensuring all participants are supported through this transition and connected with the resources they need to succeed as we evaluate the program’s possibilities,” she said. 
The Department of Labor said that in 2023, the Job Corps program reported 372 cases of inappropriate sexual behavior and sexual assaults, 1,764 acts of violence, and 1,167 breaches of safety or security. 
The program also has a low graduation average of 39% and has a cost of more than $80,000 per student per year, which is more than the $16,695 per year that the average student earns, according to the DOL.  
Melissa Rhodes, program director for the Charleston Job Corps Center, told WCHS-TV Eyewitness News the staff is “hanging by a thread” and that students of the program are very concerned about the pause.
“The Job Corps program matters,” Rhodes told the news station. “The future of our youth matters and I would like to say we are going to continue to fight for this program because it makes a difference in the lives of young people in our country.”
Nationwide, there are 25,000 Job Corps students at 131 centers, according to the Department of Labor. The department said it would work with local workforce partners to help current students to connect with education and employment opportunities.
According to its website, the Job Corp program is a no-cost vocational training program that helps people aged 16 to 24 earn their high school education, train for a career and find work. It’s the nation’s largest residential career training program. The program has trained more than 2 million people since its inception in 1964.

(Photo of Old Knox County Courthouse: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)At a recent Knoxville Smokies baseball game, I had a brief but nice chat with Ed Shouse, former Knoxville City Council member, former Knox County Commissioner, and former Knox County Trustee.  I congratulated him on being one of the few recent trustees not facing scandal.  He chuckled, shook his head, and said, “You’ve just got to remember it’s not your money.”
It is sage advice for anyone doing public service, especially in the trustee office, established in Knox County’s charter for collecting property taxes, disbursing and accounting for county funds and investing money quickly and wisely to earn interest and profits for the county.  We in Knox County like electing all sorts of administrative offices — register of deeds, county clerk, property assessor, even court clerks — but have experienced angst regarding a lot of recent trustees.
A Knox News article noted that when current trustee Justin Biggs was elected in 2022, he hired several friends and gave them raises ranging from 30% to 71% — effectively expanding the office payroll from Shouse’s time, 2014 to 2022, by nearly $400,000. 
  Knox County Trustee Justin Biggs. (Photo: Justin Biggs for Trustee, Facebook)
Knox News also recently revealed how Biggs and his staff ride and travel in style, racking up travel expenses that well exceeded the county rate.  In 2023 Biggs leased six new Ford Silverado 1500 pickup trucks equipped with four-wheel drive for which the county paid $397,968, about $200,000 more than what taxpayers pay for vehicles used by other county offices. GPS data, according to Knox News, shows trustee staff using county vehicles for personal use.  Biggs says he has reimbursed the county $3,500 for excess expenses, though it is not clear if that is the total owed for all involved.  The Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasurer is investigating.  Any follow up to that investigation will be handled by Blount County’s District Attorney.
Biggs, anticipating tough questions from Knox County commissioners, skipped an appearance before the finance committee, instead sending an office legal assistant.  He nevertheless is seeking re-election to his $164,904 a year job. Most of the Republican establishment has been keeping some distance from his campaign; many likely prefer his primary opponent, Register of Deeds Nick McBride.  Former Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe has called on Biggs to resign.
Trustee shenanigans also likely affected our congressional delegation.  From 2010 to 2013 our trustee was John Duncan, III, son and grandson of longtime congressmen John and Jimmy Duncan from Knox County.  Most political wags thought the trustee gig was a stepping-stone to a third-generation run for Congress.  Duncan, III, however, got in trouble by awarding bonuses for certification and training programs for himself and others on his staff; many of the courses had not actually been taken.  Duncan, III resigned the day he pleaded guilty to felony misconduct in 2013; he received probation with an option for diversion.  In 2014, a judge dismissed his case after he completed the diversion terms.
The biggest trustee scandal was that surrounding Mike Lowe, serving as trustee from 1994 to 2007.  Lowe pleaded guilty to two counts of felony theft related to “ghost employees” — associates on the payroll who didn’t work. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said the scheme robbed county taxpayers of more than $750,000; the TBI also said these associates kicked back some of the money to Lowe.  The former trustee, years after leaving office, also admitted to funneling title work to an associate who would overcharge the county, and give Lowe a cut of that, too.
Lowe was sentenced to ten years in prison, but was behind bars for roughly seven months before the rest of his sentence was changed to supervised probation.
Shouse ended 34 years of public service on Aug. 31, 2022.  His eight years of integrity as trustee mirrored similar upstanding behavior in other public offices.  When selecting a trustee or other position of trust, one good guide is to look for trustworthy behavior and proven integrity, someone who knows it’s not his money, to use Shouse’s words.

(Photo courtesy of Food Bank for the Heartland)People in Marsha Keene’s community are already struggling to cover the basics.
Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-03 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi’s plan for its opioid settlement lets legislators spend tens of millions of dollars on purposes other than the public health crisis,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/03/mississippi-plan-for-its-opioid-settlement-distribution/,Public health advocates and Mississippians affected by the crisis worry the setup for the state's opioid settlement funds could enable the dollars to be spent on purposes other than ending the overdose epidemic.,"In the fallout of over 9,000 Mississippians dying of overdoses since 2000, lawyers and lawmakers have set up a plan to distribute the hundreds of millions of dollars from corporations that catalyzed the crisis. But public health advocates and Mississippians closest to the public health catastrophe worry the setup could enable these dollars to be spent on purposes other than ending the overdose epidemic. 
Mississippi is expected to receive $370 million from pharmaceutical companies that profited while people struggled with addiction. That payout is set to be split between the state and local governments, with 85%, or about $315 million, being controlled by the Legislature. For years after the state attorney general’s office helped finalize the first settlements in 2021, it was unclear how the state would distribute its share and how much would be used to prevent the crisis from persisting. 
State senators and representatives took a major step toward answering these questions earlier this year. They nearly unanimously passed Senate Bill 2767, a law that outlines a general framework for how about $259 million of the funds will be distributed. 
A 15-person advisory council — made up of representatives for state government agencies, elected officials and law enforcement officials — will develop a grant application process for organizations focused on addressing the opioid addiction crisis. 
After evaluating the applications and making a list of which grants should be funded, the Legislature will decide whether to approve or deny each of the council’s recommendations.
The state lawmakers can spend the remaining $56 million they control for any purpose — related or unrelated to addressing addiction. 
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who wield massive power over lawmakers and how state funds are spent, did not respond to questions from Mississippi Today about their priorities for the funds. 
Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford and the bill’s lead sponsor, said she and other senators borrowed some ideas from surrounding states to determine how these funds could best prevent more fallout from the opioid crisis.

“It involves everything, from child welfare services to the judicial system to medical care to mental health services,” she said. “It is a crisis that has affected every aspect of society, and we needed a comprehensive group of people making those recommendations.” 
However, the bill leaves some questions unanswered, like how the application process will work, when it will open to the public and how grants will be evaluated. 
Public health advocates and Mississippians impacted by addiction expressed concern about the advisory council’s makeup, the $56 million carveout for expenses unrelated to the opioid crisis and the Legislature’s final decision-making power. They said those provisions could cause some of the corporate defendants’ dollars to be spent on issues other than addressing and preventing overdoses. 
Jane Clair Tyner, a Hattiesburg resident, lost her 23-year-old son Asa Henderson in 2019 after he struggled for years with substance use disorder. Now, through her job with the Mississippi overdose prevention nonprofit End It For Good, she works to ensure that fewer parents have to go through the pain her family experienced.

She said the only ways these state settlement dollars should be spent are on improving Mississippi public health and keeping people who are at risk of overdosing safe.  
“That’s what it should go towards, but not to the Legislature,” she said. “This is not a rainy day slush fund.”
An evolving plan
It wasn’t always the plan for the Legislature to control so much of the settlement dollars. In 2021, when Mississippi and other states were in the midst of negotiating settlements, State Attorney General Lynn Fitch published an agreement between the state and local governments that would send only 15% to the Legislature’s general fund. 
The agreement said that the bulk of the money – 70% – would be sent to the University of Mississippi Medical Center to build a new addiction medicine institute. But Mississippi law says the Legislature is the ultimate decision maker for how this type of state settlement money gets spent, according to Fitch’s Chief of Staff Michelle Williams.

So lawmakers passed their bill to change the plan. 
The Legislature changed the arrangement to make sure the money goes to where the state’s most pressing addiction needs are, said Boyd. The advisory council, which will be supplemented by at least 22 additional nonvoting members, is a good way to have those needs captured, she said. 
As for the Legislature having final approval power, Boyd said that and other provisions were put into the bill to keep some power with lawmakers if the council becomes ineffective or political. 
It’s the highest percentage of any state’s opioid settlement share that will be controlled by a Legislature, according to the Vital Strategies Overdose Prevention Program and OpioidSettlementTracker.com’s state guides.
Dr. Caleb Alexander, an epidemiology professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, served as one of the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses for some of the opioid lawsuits. Alexander has also helped U.S. cities and counties develop blueprints for how to use the settlements to quell their opioid crises.
He said using the money on a variety of prevention, treatment and recovery strategies, rather than one big project, is likely a better way to save lives and prevent more addiction. But having the Legislature, rather than an apolitical body of addiction experts, play such a large role is not the setup he would suggest. 
“I would have some concerns that it may gum things up,” he said.
Additionally, Alexander said creating ways for funds to not be used to address the opioid epidemic, as the 2025 bill does, is “a shame.” While the settlement agreements say that 70% of the funds must be spent on addressing addiction, there is nothing that prevents all the money from being used for the crisis, and most states are doing that.
He said the settlements define a wide variety of uses as addressing the epidemic — from first responder training to medication research and development — and he doesn’t see a scenario where it makes sense to spend the money on other uses. 
“The costs of abatement far outweigh the available funds for every city or county that I’ve examined,” he said. 
Boyd said she believes her colleagues in the House and Senate are all motivated to use this money to address addiction as a mental health condition. She said the new bill categorizes some funds as “nonabatement” to free them up for ways to address addiction that may not fit neatly into the settlements’ list of uses. 
The attorney general’s original plan was the first to categorize a percentage of the funds as not needing to be used to stop the opioid crisis. Williams said it was written that way to match the terms of the national settlement agreements, although the settlement for the largest payout says spending on purposes other than addressing the opioid crisis is “disfavored by the parties.”
She said Fitch would love to see all the funds be spent on addiction response and prevention, like the One Pill Can Kill campaign the office runs.
“But it’s the Legislature’s prerogative,” she said. 
‘Where are the people in recovery?’
Jason McCarty, the Mississippi Harm Reduction Initiative’s former executive director, said he’s glad the plan is no longer to send such a large portion of the settlement funds to UMMC. Organizations like the Initiative, he said, also could use additional support to keep Mississippians from dying. 
And he’s concerned that while a peer recovery specialist will serve as a nonvoting member, none of the committee’s 15 voting members must be people who’ve experienced addiction. 
“Where are the people in recovery?” he asked. “We’re the subject matter experts.”
Boyd said many of the voting committee roles are representatives of state agencies that she expects will help administer the settlement grants, like the Department of Mental Health. And there were only so many people who the Legislature can assign spots.
“It was no slight to anybody,” she said. “It’s just, this is a completely complex issue.” 
The Mississippi governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the house will each assign two people to the committee, and Boyd said it’s possible they will choose people in recovery. 
The bill says council members need to be appointed by early June. 
However the process plays out, McCarty hopes all the state’s funds go to reputable organizations focused on preventing more opioid-related harm. In Mississippi, he sees a lack of housing and treatment options, especially for new parents, as areas that this money can help address. 
And as hundreds of Mississippians continue to die from overdoses each year, he said the state government has to move quickly and responsibly to make these funds available.

Many blame pharmaceutical industry middlemen called PBMs.","A Rite Aid pharmacy in West Chester, Pa. (Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)Ron McDermott is a part-owner of six pharmacies in western Pennsylvania and any outsider might think his business has never seemed better. 
Since the Philadelphia-based retail pharmacy chain Rite Aid declared bankruptcy last month and announced plans to close hundreds of stores across the state, McDermott has seen a flood of new customers looking to transfer their prescriptions.
“A lot of people are walking into our pharmacies. A lot of people are calling,” McDermott said. “You’d think that’s great news, but there are problems.”
For most businesses, a major competitor shutting their doors would be welcome. But for pharmacists, taking on new clients can actually pose a risk to their bottom line. McDermott’s pharmacies have had to turn away some new customers whose medications would cost them more to stock and package than they could make selling them.
“It’s the complete opposite of what we want to do as a caring, community-based pharmacy,” he said. “We have to be careful when we take on new patients. That’s a sad situation in health care. It’s not the way it should be.”
McDermott blames middlemen in the pharmaceutical supply chain called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. They’re companies that contract with insurance plans to handle their prescription services, and are responsible for reimbursing pharmacists for drugs that they cover.
But McDermott and other pharmacists say those reimbursements have been getting smaller for years, to the point where pharmacies are actually losing money dispensing certain drugs. 
Prescription for trouble: Pennsylvania pharmacists say PBMs are driving pharmacy closures

Along with handling administrative work for insurers and reimbursing pharmacies, they also create insurance plans’ formularies — their list of approved or preferred drugs.  In that role, they negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers, often receiving kickbacks in exchange for placing their products on a plan’s formulary — their list of approved or preferred drugs. On the other end, they negotiate with pharmacies to determine how much they’ll reimburse them when they dispense drugs to insured patients.
The companies’ power comes largely from their size. The three biggest PBMs, Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx, are part of healthcare conglomerates that rank among the biggest companies in the country, and have hands in the insurance and pharmacy businesses too. CVS Health, for example, owns CVS, the largest chain pharmacy in America, CVS Caremark, the largest PBM, and Aetna, one of the largest insurance companies. It’s the sixth largest company in the U.S. by revenue.
The “big three,” as they’re known in the industry, are responsible for processing about 80% of all prescriptions in America. That means pharmacists who refuse to accept the reimbursements that they offer are likely to lose customers whose insurance plans rely on them. 
Many of those customers only use generic drugs, which cost pennies or fractions of pennies to stock. Generally, generics make up a majority of a pharmacy’s drug sales, and can be sold at a profit. But a disproportionate share of their revenue comes from the sale of name brand drugs, which can cost thousands of dollars per bottle and is often where reimbursements fall short of costs.
Rob Frankil, the executive director of the Philadelphia Association of Retail Druggists, a trade group for pharmacists, said that McDermott is not alone.
“I’m already having a lot of my members tell me they’re not willing to take in Rite Aid patients, because they’re already losing money on prescriptions they fill,” he told the Capital-Star. “It all stems from the same thing: the reimbursement is bad when you fill prescriptions.”
Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a national trade group whose members include CVS, Express Scripts and OptumRx, rejected the notion that PBMs contribute to pharmacy closures.
“PBMs put patients first by working to lower prescription drug costs,” Lopes said in a statement. “It makes no sense to blame PBMs for pharmacy closures in Pennsylvania. Independent pharmacies often point the finger at PBMs, instead of acknowledging that there are many factors that influence closures, including customer preferences for online options and changing demographics. “
Lopes added that PBMs “are supporting community pharmacies in Pennsylvania through programs that increase reimbursement and advocating to allow them to expand the additional clinical services they can offer.”
‘Pharmacies as gold’ 
Lucas Berenbrok, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Pharmacy, has been tracking pharmacy closures around the country.
Recently, he was part of a study that found around 200 have closed in Pennsylvania alone between January 2024 and March 2025.
Berenbrok’s research did not dive into the reasons for the closures, but, anecdotally, he said that it often comes back to unsustainable business models and low reimbursement rates.
“This is a big deal because one of the things that pharmacy has prided itself on for a long time is how accessible we are,” he said. “That’s why I got started in this research.”
Lately, Berenbrok’s work has been focused on identifying what he and his colleagues are calling “keystone pharmacies.” These are businesses that, if they closed, would create pharmacy deserts in the communities they serve.
Berenbrok said his team identified over 200 keystone pharmacies in Pennsylvania, though the list has not yet been made public. 
“It’s more of a preventative approach to say, ‘Hey, let’s look at these pharmacies as gold and try to do things to help them stay in business,’” he said.
The recent spate of closures has not just affected local, independent pharmacies, but large chains as well. In 2021, CVS announced it would close 900 pharmacies. In 2024, Walgreens announced it would close over 1,200 in the coming years.
Last month, Rite Aid declared bankruptcy. In bankruptcy filings, it announced plans to shutter about 150 of pharmacies in Pennsylvania alone, but all of its roughly 350 stores in the state may ultimately close.
In a press release, Rite Aid announced that more than 1,000 of its stores nationally will be sold to other businesses, including CVS and Walgreens, with many remaining open through the transition. A spokesperson for Rite Aid did not respond to multiple requests for comment about how many of those are in Pennsylvania, and how many locations in the state may ultimately shutter.
“A pharmacist is one of very few health care providers where you can walk in and talk to a highly educated, highly trained professional, and sometimes you don’t even have to have an appointment or copay,” Berenbrok said. “It’s a really great thing, I think, for everyone to understand and recognize how important it is to have a pharmacy around.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4196-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)When people refer to West Virginia as “Almost Heaven,” we think of the beautiful, quiet scenic areas like Black Water Falls, Canaan Valley and Dolly Sods, all in Tucker County. 
However, our lawmakers just see money signs — and not very many of them.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey recently signed into law House Bill 2014 — one of his key priorities —  which created the state’s microgrid program to encourage data centers to come to the Mountain State. 
Residents in Tucker County are already fighting a proposed data center. A Virginia company, Fundamental Data, has applied for an air permit from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection for the “Ridgeline Facility.” It includes an off-the-grid natural gas power plant between Thomas and Davis, which will likely power the giant data center proposed for a site just a mile away from the county’s most heavily populated and tourist-attracting areas.
A microgrid is a small power plant that is usually attached to a larger national grid, but runs independently to power things like a college campus, hospital complex or, in this case, a data center. West Virginia’s new law allows “high impact data centers” to curtail local zoning ordinances, meaning their microgrids don’t have to attach to existing utilities. 
HB 2014, as requested by Morrisey, originally included provisions that would have required electric utilities with coal fired plants to operate at a higher capacity —  69% compared to 40% — and hold a 45-day supply of coal on hand at all times, while most only stockpile a 30-day supply. 
Lawmakers saw this bill as an opportunity to boost the state’s coal industry, but power companies said it would be difficult to meet those standards. Not only that, but meeting those standards would have raised electricity rates for customers. 
The bill was amended dozens of times and passed without those standards, and Morrisey signed it into law. Now residents of Tucker County are worried about a proposed data center taking away from the serene beauty of their home. 
As someone who grew up in Poca just across the river from the coal-powered John E. Amos Power Plant, I understand why you wouldn’t want a new one to pop up near your home. It’s never quiet — you can hear the beep beep beep of equipment backing up all night and the banging of construction, and when the towers release steam, it sounds like the end of the world (at least it did when I first heard it as a child). And coal definitely keeps the lights on at the plant 24/7.
In Virginia, which has the largest data center market in the world, there are local noise and lighting ordinances to protect residents. West Virginia residents won’t have the same protections.
My dad said during the 1970s, before air pollution was taken more seriously, ash from the John Amos plant would be all over the place in the mornings. Sometime in the 1990s, everyone on our street noticed spots on their cars that messed up the paint. My dad said the air pollution commission ran some tests on the spots that indicated they came from the power plant.
It only happened that one time, dad said, but it was worrisome then and it’s something to think about now as the Trump administration rolls back environmental regulations. For instance, the Department of Justice has been told to block states from enforcing their own regulations on coal — because President Donald Trump wants to revive “beautiful, clean coal.”
Not only are power plants loud, but data centers are as well. They create noise pollution, typically a low humming sound, which is the cooling system that must run constantly to keep the temperatures down. Many data centers also use a diesel powered back-up system in case they lose power, and those must be tested monthly. These generators can run between 85 and 100 dBA — 85 dBA is when hearing can be harmed. 
So why are we putting up with this noise? It must be because it’ll bring lots of jobs to the state, right? Not likely. Data centers are just buildings full of computers, and are largely automated. You ever wonder where the stuff you save on the cloud is stored, where the computers that make AI art are or where bitcoin is mined? In a data center. 
Some facilities employ only 50 people. Most data center jobs come from the construction of the facilities, and are often contracted from out-of-state. 
Aside from data centers not bringing jobs, they could cost ratepayers more money. Virginia has proposed two transmission lines for their data centers, and the lines could cost West Virginians more than $440 million, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis
The two transmission lines, both of which cut through West Virginia, were proposed to help with growing demand for electricity from data centers. PJM’s transmission cost allocation methodology charges all ratepayers for the transmission infrastructure because it assumes that the “regional transmission costs could not be attributed to a single new user or class of users.” However the most recent Regional Transmission Expansion Plan processes shows that’s not the case.
While West Virginia is trying to use Virginia as an example on data centers, the state isn’t doing it the same way with regulations and protections. 
“What you’re going to get if you do it this way is the worst players, the ones that didn’t need to be in Northern Virginia,” said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Piedmont Environmental Council in Virginia. “… the players that are wanting that lack of regulations because they didn’t want to abide by rules and didn’t want to or need to protect communities, which is worse for West Virginia and the communities. What West Virginia is doing is not what Virginia is doing.”
If lawmakers are serious about bringing data centers to the state, then they need to be serious about the consequences and set better regulations to protect residents who want to enjoy wild, wonderful West Virginia without noise cancelling headphones.

After starting around 10 a.m. on Monday, the Senate cast its final vote just after 6:30 p.m. but the House did not until close to 10 p.m.
“We’re done for the night,” House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) said, asking his caucus to walk out of the chamber.
Throughout the day, both chambers rejected a slew of proposals to make significant changes to the state’s Paid Family and Medical Leave program before it starts. The Senate also supported a measure to guarantee agricultural workers state minimum wage. 
But other votes — hundreds — were also cast that take legislation one step closer, or farther, from becoming Maine law. Here are some takeaways from Monday: 
Both chambers
Legislation (LD 3) that would have Maine adopt Eastern Standard Time year-round, contingent on federal approval, now heads to the governor’s desk. It received enactment votes in both chambers on Monday. 
That was also the case for: LD 186, which would clarify the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to establish time-of-use pricing for standard-offer service, LD 1258, which would add qualified out-of-state electric vehicle providers under the Electric Vehicle Fund, and LD 1473, which would require utilities to monitor meters for natural gas leaks.
The following bills have received the initial approval of both chambers, but still need enactment votes:

LD 496: “An Act Regarding the Time Frame for Issuing a Silver Alert and to Require Silver Alerts for All Persons Missing from Certain Inpatient Facilities.”

Growing “tables”
The number of bills on legislative “tables” now abound. 
Bills that land on the appropriations table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget, have already passed the full Legislature with initial votes. However, if they aren’t already funded, they are placed on the table to vie for remaining unappropriated money.
Essentially, that’s everything being voted through with a fiscal note because lawmakers are still drafting what will be in the next two year budget plan. 
For example, the House passed LD 681, “An Act Regarding Public Higher Education Funding in the State,” Monday morning, following an earlier vote in the Senate and bucking the recommendation of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee against its passage. 
On the House floor on Monday, Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) asked, “Are we just discarding the work that’s done by committee?” When the bill was sent back to the Senate for enactment, lawmakers then opted to place it on the table. 
The same happened to LD 697, “An Act to Direct the Maine Prescription Drug Affordability Board to Assess Strategies to Reduce Prescription Drug Costs and to Take Steps to Implement Reference-based Pricing,” which the House passed 125-9 before the Senate placed it on the table. 
After securing favorable votes in either the Senate or House on Monday, the following bills were also placed on the table: 

LD 505: “An Act to Update Processes and Fees in the Probate Court System”
LD 870: “An Act Regarding the Membership of the Maine Land Use Planning Commission”
LD 1097: “An Act to Provide De-escalation and Behavior Intervention Training for School Personnel” 
LD 1773: “An Act to Criminalize Certain Offenses Related to Gift Card Thefts” 

Other bills placed on the table include: LD 60, LD 61, LD 178, LD 192, LD 361, LD 540, LD 616, LD 800, LD 900, LD 1017, LD 1043, LD 1079, LD 1425, LD 1855, LD 105, LD 384, LD 493, LD 500, LD 554, LD 679, LD 858, LD 1100.
There is also a study table, where lawmakers place bills after they pass both chambers if they involve legislative studies. LD 634 and LD 1420 were placed on that table on Monday. 
And there’s a highway table, which LD 1359 was placed on. Maine has separate general fund and highway fund budgets, with the Transportation Committee overseeing the latter.
Non-concurrent matters
After the House voted against a bill (LD 1255) last month that would amend the eligibility requirements for the free community college program, the Senate tried to follow suit, initially. But its vote against the bill failed 15-19, so the chamber passed it under the hammer. It now heads back to the House to see if the lower chamber will reconsider its position. 
Legislation (LD 218) that would make student transfer agreements renew automatically, except in certain circumstances related to attendance or behavior, is poised to die in nonconcurrence. After the House opposed the measure, following the majority recommendation of the Education Committee, the Senate voted for it. The House insisted on its position on Monday. 
The House voted against a bill (LD 115) that would assess impact fees on megayachts over 150 feet long. It now heads back to the Senate in nonconcurrence. The Senate had initially voted to pass the bill, bucking the committee recommendation, but then failed to enact the measure. 
Representatives supportive of the measure described it as a matter of fairness. “Right now, when a family stays in a main hotel, they pay a lodging tax. When a business ships goods through our ports, they pay fees,” Rep. Lookner said. “But when a billionaire docks a 450 foot yacht, a vessel that’s three times as long as the Vinylhaven ferry in one of our harbors, they pay nothing toward the upkeep for our piers, dredging or sea walls that make their stay possible.”
However, Rep. Lydia Crafts (D-Newcastle), speaking against the bill, said individual municipalities already have the ability to assess slip fees.
The Senate stripped the emergency clause from LD 197, which would direct the governor’s Energy Office to conduct a study on the future of electric transmission infrastructure in the state, after it could not reach the threshold needed to enact it as an emergency, which is a two-thirds vote. The bill will now be sent back to the House. 
While that bill now has a chance at passage, LD 213 is essentially dead. The chambers could not agree on LD 213, which would increase the sales commission of retailers who sell lottery tickets. The Senate insisted on its vote against the bill on Monday, after the House insisted on its vote in support of the bill. 
With a 29-5 vote, the Senate passed LD 331, a resolve directing the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure timely reimbursements under MaineCare for hospital cost reports. In doing so it accepted the minority report of the committee, sending it back to the House in nonconcurrence.  
After the House passed LD 77, a measure to fund the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Fisheries and Hatcheries Division by increasing inland fishing license fees, the Senate initially tried to pass it as well, but failed to do so with a 11-23 vote. The chamber then accepted the minority ought not to pass report. 
The chambers also can’t agree on LD 723, a resolve to direct the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to study the feasibility of establishing a nonresidential law enforcement training program. It failed final passage in the House but was approved for final passage in the Senate. 
Some notable enactments 
Emergency legislation needs a two-thirds vote to be enacted. LD 1551, “An Act to Support Maine Eating and Drinking Establishments by Allowing Vendors to Operate on the Premises of an Establishment with a Liquor License,” easily cleared this bar with a 120-0 enactment vote. 
However, LD 1420, which would establish a commission to “ensure a just and equitable energy transition for Maine’s workforce,” failed to reach that threshold with a 68-61 vote. 
While not an emergency bill, LD 723 failed enactment after House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) called for a roll call vote. This bill would direct the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to study the feasibility of establishing a nonresidential law enforcement training program. The House failed to enact it with a 68-71 vote, after supporting its passage initially with a 74-72 vote last month. 
The Senate also enacted a public land resolve (LD 1724) authorizing the Baxter State Park Authority to convey certain land in Cumberland County.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)This year, Denver again earned the ignominious distinction as the sixth worst city in the country for certain air pollutants. Poor air quality is a public health threat, leading to respiratory symptoms and negative long-term health outcomes — coughing, asthma attacks, cardiovascular diseases, etc.
As the Trump administration proudly rolls back federal regulations intended to protect people from air pollution and climate change, it’s imperative that local governments pass policies to fill the void. However, thus far in 2025, Denver’s City Council has done more to signal its disapproval of poor air quality than actually tackle it.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Denver’s 13-member council made headlines at the start of May when it unanimously rejected a $25 million contract with Suncor Energy’s Commerce City oil refinery to purchase asphalt. The council cited concerns of environmental justice and persistent regulatory violations committed by Suncor.
While divestment from negligent or unethical businesses can be a powerful tool to drive change, the practice must be undertaken strategically. In this case, Denver is taking a stance against Suncor by paying an additional $300,000 to an oil refinery with a similarly long rap sheet of regulatory violations — including some that led to explosions and fires. Because Denver’s asphalt will now come from Cenovus Energy in Wisconsin, it must be transported by rail to Colorado, which creates additional environmental risk. Twenty-five percent of the nation’s hazardous material accidents are caused by railroad derailments. For example, in 2023, a train spilled 500,000 pounds of asphalt into the Yellowstone River damaging hundreds of miles of natural habitat.
And finally, asphalt is a byproduct of the oil refining process, and will be produced regardless of whether or not the city buys it. The Denver council’s symbolic support of environmental justice and clean air is well-intentioned, but not strategic. A more effective means of opposing Suncor would be to reduce demand for gasoline — perhaps by promoting public transit or other modes of transportation, which would have the added benefit of reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
 More micromobility
Just weeks after the Denver City Council’s symbolic move against Suncor, the council passed an ordinance to crack down on micromobility. Since Denver signed an exclusive contract with Lime and Lyft in 2020, ridership of shared electric scooters and bikes has increased steadily. On average, Denverites take 11,100 micromobility rides every day, many of which replace car trips. Considering the emission reduction potential of micromobility, Denver’s council should focus on increasing adoption while balancing the needs of pedestrians and other road users. Unfortunately, the new ordinance isn’t balanced — it forces micromobility companies to mitigate “sidewalk riding,” which is tantamount to making micromobility less safe and, therefore, less desirable.
In 2024, 134 pedestrians and bicyclists were killed by cars in Denver — a 78% increase in fatalities since 2015. Although bike infrastructure is expanding, the city is still decades away from a truly connected, cycle-safe city.
Going forward, Lime and Lyft must enforce Denver’s law prohibiting sidewalk riding or face fines. A possible outcome is charging riders more if they ride on sidewalks. But in a city where sidewalk riding is sometimes the only safe option, that discourages safety. For many riders, this would create a lose-lose situation: Avoid the sidewalk even on busy, dangerous roads, or use sidewalks for safety and incur fines. Or, drive a car, instead.
The new micromobility ordinance isn’t all bad, though. It implements a much needed mechanism to reduce improperly parked scooters and bikes, which too often obstruct sidewalks for pedestrians and wheelchair users. The council should have stopped there — regulate parking, but don’t dictate how riders should safely navigate our car-oriented landscape. The best way to encourage riders to avoid sidewalks is to build safe bike infrastructure.
 Alternatives to widening
Contrary to its stated support of cleaner air, Denver’s City Council has recently made moves to further entrench the city’s car reliance by taking steps to widen Peña Boulevard. This Spring, in a 9-2 vote, the council approved a $15 million study to investigate widening Peña and assess other options to alleviate traffic congestion. One council member suggested that the study is a mere “formality” unlikely to seriously consider alternatives to widening Peña.
Transportation contributes significantly to the region’s poor air quality and is the greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Colorado. Investing in road expansion would undermine the city’s commitments to clean air, climate action, and a transit-oriented future. To retain a modicum of consistency, City Council should instead fund bus rapid transit, improvements to the Denver A-Line, greater security at Park-n-Rides along the A-line, or any number of options that would make public transit the most convenient method of traversing the city and getting to the airport.
Considering Denver’s record of poor air quality and the ongoing attacks on our nation’s bedrock environmental protection laws, Denver’s City Council should focus less on signaling support for clean air and environmental justice and more on substantive policies. Besides limiting the construction of new gas stations, the city has done nothing to improve Denver’s air quality this year — the opposite, actually.
Hopefully, the council reconsiders its priorities — before Peña is widened and micromobility ridership drops.

Thom Tillis's Raleigh office. (Photo: Rob Schofield)North Carolina has always been a conservative, business-friendly state in which lobbyists for corporate interests have generally had their way in the state Legislative Building under both Republicans and Democrats.
From the days of tobacco, textiles and furniture to the modern era in which industries like banking, technology, construction and health care predominate, it’s been a rare instance in which lawmakers have said “no” to the policy demands of a large industry – especially those willing to make significant “investments” in political campaigns.
One notable and interesting minor exception to this pattern in recent decades, however, has been in the realm of predatory consumer lending. Throughout the latter decades of the 20th Century right down to the present day, grifting high-cost lenders have generally struggled to gain the foothold here that they enjoy in many other states.
Despite repeated efforts to loosen state laws that bar exploitive products like “payday loans” and “car title loans” and that cap interest rates and fees charged by “consumer finance” companies and makers of high-cost home loans, North Carolina lawmakers have largely held firm.
Several factors that have contributed to this situation, including consistent and forceful advocacy from the consumer protection offices of Attorneys General Mike Easley, Roy Cooper, Josh Stein, and Jeff Jackson; resistance from several legislative leaders (including a handful of Republicans like veteran State Rep. Julia Howard and former State Rep. Jeff Barnhart); and tough stances by the state’s military commanders who’ve seen how predatory loans target and harm the readiness of their troops.
Together with the rise of one of the nation’s strongest networks of consumer advocacy nonprofits – a group that included, among others, advocates from the Center for Responsible Lending, the North Carolina Justice Center, the Financial Protection Law Center and the state’s Legal Aid community — these forces helped keep North Carolina a state that is comparatively predatory lender-free.
What’s more, the successes in this area were so numerous and impactful that following the financial crisis of the early 2000’s that morphed into the Great Recession, they helped inspire action in Washington to establish a watchdog federal government agency known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
In the years since, the CFPB has done prodigious work – winning billions of dollars in refunds for ripped-off homebuyers, student loan borrowers, and banking customers and even putting some predatory lenders out of business. Since its inception, more than 300,000 North Carolinians have turned to the agency with complaints of consumer abuses. More than 86,000 have thus far won relief.
Unfortunately, as one might expect, laws and lawyers that target grifters, scammers and predators are anathema to President Trump – a man whose business career was largely predicated on all manner of shady deals — and he and Republicans in Congress are working hard to gut or abolish the agency.
According to Adam Rust of the Consumer Federation of America, since Trump returned to office in January, his minions have quickly sought to lay off virtually the entire CFPB staff (a move that has waxed and waned in the federal courts), cancelled numerous consumer protection regulations (including rules designed to protect vulnerable seniors from junk fees, rein in online payment app scams and debt collectors, and cap bank overdraft fees), and dismissed more than 20 lawsuits targeting predatory actors.
Where federal law protected certain kinds of work from complete elimination – as with the Office of Servicemember Affairs (a creation of the Military Lending Act) – Rust says Trump’s team evaded the law by simply firing everyone in the office except for a single person. The massive budget and tax bill recently approved by the U.S. House doubles down on this pattern by slashing the agency’s funding agency by around 75%.
To their credit, however, North Carolina advocates and activists – some of whom helped birth the CFPB — have no intention of letting the agency be destroyed without a fight. Last Thursday, several of them gathered for a press event outside of Sen. Thom Tillis’s Raleigh office to plead with him to intervene.
In addition to Rust, speakers included community organizer Emma Horst-Martz, who cited her grandmother’s victimization by an online tech firm as an example of the need to preserve protections for seniors, and a pair of small business women – Ashley Gaddy Robbins and LaCharo Owens – both of whom explained the critical role CFPB protections have played in making access to safe, affordable credit possible for minority and women-owned businesses.
Is there a chance that Tillis could muster the courage, as is his wont every once-in-a-blue-moon, and do the right thing? Experience and a glance at some of his past actions indicate that it’s a huge longshot, but with an uphill reelection race looming in 2026, it seems at least possible that Tillis will see handing such an issue to a Democratic challenger could be a dangerous move.
For their part, the activists and small business owners who pleaded with him last week will not be giving up or going away. Their simple message: stand with the people of North Carolina, not the banks, billionaires and lobbyists. Let’s fervently hope Tillis was listening.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CFBP-presser-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)One of Gov. Jeff Landry’s appointees to the LSU Board of Supervisors flew into a rage at LSU Health Shreveport when its staff would not perform a house call for her husband, threatening to fire multiple employees, according to a whistleblower complaint. She’s also the subject of other complaints that allege she harassed several employees and meddled in the day-to-day operations of the medical school.
Esperanza Moran, who openly rallied for the dismissal of former LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, is the subject of an anonymous whistleblower complaint, at least one Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint filed by top LSU Health Shreveport employees and a separate complaint filed to Landry by a top administrator.
The Illuminator obtained documents cited in this report through a series of public records requests to LSU and the governor’s office. 
  Esperanza Moran (LSU photo)
According to an anonymous whistleblower complaint filed with LSU, Moran went to LSU Health Shreveport just days after being appointed to the board and “[caused] a public scene in outrage” that an employee was not permitted to treat her husband at Moran’s private residence. 
“This incident has caused significant distress within the LSU Health Shreveport community, affecting the staff’s health, morale and productivity,” the complaint reads. “While causing the disturbance, Ms. Moran threatened to terminate staff and said she was the new chancellor and in charge of LSU Health Shreveport.” 
The complaint goes on to say that Moran threatened to have Guzick, Sammy Wyatt, LSU Health Shreveport’s chief compliance and investigation officer, and Sharon Dunn, vice chancellor for academic administration, fired from the university. 
Guzick resigned from his position in April after Moran’s months-long pressure campaign and has since accepted a position with the LSU System office. Dunn and Wyatt are still employed at LSU Health Shreveport.
Wyatt asked the governor to intervene, adding Moran’s alleged actions are damaging to his personal and professional reputation, disrupting his ability to do his job as well as damaging LSU Health Shreveport’s public trust. 
“I am writing to request your assistance in resolving an ongoing issue with Ms. Esperanza Moran,” Wyatt wrote to Landry in December. “She has been consciously, intentionally, and maliciously defaming, harassing, targeting, and retaliating against me, utilizing Power-Based Violence and creating a hostile working environment.” 
Power-based violence is a term found in a 2021 Louisiana law approved in the wake of a Title IX scandal at LSU. It is defined as “any form of interpersonal violence intended to control or intimidate another person through the assertion of power over the person.”
When a reporter asked her about the complaints after her Senate confirmation hearing at the State Capitol last week, Moran requested questions be sent to her via email. She has not responded to the emailed questions. 
Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly and LSU spokesman Todd Woodward have not responded to requests for comment. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In its public records request to the governor’s office, the Illuminator asked for any documents containing Landry’s response to Wyatt’s letter. No documents were provided. 
Moran has not yet received state Senate confirmation. Senators typically vote to confirm governor’s appointees in batches and are expected to endorse Moran by the time the legislative session adjourns June 12. 
Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, who represents Moran’s district, said he would support Moran despite the complaints, noting that she has Landry’s support. 
Esperanza Moran lives in Shreveport and is married to wealthy businessman Scott Moran. The couple own several businesses, including Moran Oil Co., and give generously to Republican political campaigns, including Landry’s. 
The Morans also donate significant sums to LSU athletics, culminating in a plaza outside Tiger Stadium being named after Scott Moran when he gave money toward the 2012 remodel of the facility. 
Wyatt referred questions about his complaint to his attorney, Steve Soileau, adding that he is considering suing over Moran’s conduct. 
“Due to the status of the investigations and referred investigations and possibilities of litigation, we do not feel it would be appropriate to comment on specific items at this time,” Soileau said in response to questions about Wyatt’s letter to Landry. “Mr. Wyatt’s letter speaks for itself and he stands by it. His EEOC complaint is still pending.” 
The “referred investigations” involve Wyatt’s work as the medical school’s chief investigation officer. According to Wyatt’s letter to the governor, some of these probes have been into Moran’s personal friends, and one has been referred to the FBI, which Wyatt said in his complaint is looking into the incident along with state law enforcement. 
It’s unusual for a university board member to be the subject of an EEOC complaint, according to several longtime higher education observers. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a federal entity responsible for investigating workplace discrimination. 
“I’ve seen a lot of supervisors come and go over the years, but I have never encountered anything quite like that,” said Kevin Cope, an LSU professor that has been involved in faculty governance at LSU for multiple decades. He was contacted for reaction to Moran’s alleged actions. “In fact, although the supervisors and I have disagreed, I will say the supervisors usually behave themselves pretty well. So this I will characterize as highly unusual, not only for LSU, but indeed for the nation and for higher education.” 
Politically appointed board members are not meant to be involved in the day-to-day running of a university, as it could threaten a school’s accreditation. But the complaints allege Moran did just that.
LSU closed its investigation into the anonymous complaint just days after it was filed, according to the case file the Illuminator obtained. A reporter reached out to every individual named in the complaint as possibly involved. Some did not respond, but others confirmed they were not contacted for the investigation. Woodward did not respond when asked why not all of the people named were contacted. 
During her Senate confirmation hearing, Moran was asked about the leadership of LSU Health Shreveport. 
“There still needs to be some things cleared up,” Moran said. “When you get the leadership working right, then everything trickles down, so I’m still working on that. I still have a little bit of work left to do.” 
Board members do not have sole authority to decide who staffs administrative positions in a university. Though sometimes they are involved in search committees to hire a top administrator, their influence is weighted by faculty, staff, students and community members.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)A new lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island aims to stop a three-decade practice in which Brown University police officers keep arrest reports hidden from the public.
The complaint filed in Providence County Superior Court Monday was prompted by a pair of journalists — one is a former Brown University student journalist who graduated in 2024 and the second writes for arts and entertainment publication Motif Magazine. Each was separately refused reports of unrelated arrests made by Brown University’s Department of Public Safety. 
Brown University contends that the officers work for a private agency, and therefore are not subject to Rhode Island’s Access to Public Records Act. The ACLU argues that because Brown’s police officers have the same seizure, detention and arrest powers as local and state law enforcement — laid out under a 1995 law — their actions, including arrests, should be subject to the same scrutiny as any other government agency or public body.
“By engaging in one of the most fundamental functions of government — the enforcement of criminal laws and exercising the power to search and seize individuals — BDPS is acting on behalf of and/or in place of a government agency or public body,” the seven-page complaint states.
The legal action comes as good government advocates, including the ACLU, rally for more sweeping reform of the state’s public records law, which has not been updated since 2012. Among the 48 changes proposed in legislation pending before the Rhode Island General Assembly is a provision clarifying that private university police bestowed arrest powers by the state must be subject to state records laws.
Rhode Island School of Design police are the only other private university in Rhode Island given power to arrest under state law, though they are not named in the complaint. Steven Brown, executive director for the ACLU, said the good government group has received half a dozen complaints, mostly from journalists, about Brown University’s refusal to hand over arrest records when asked. 
“It just seems so clear that a police department, wherever it is located, is operating as a public agency when they detain and arrest individuals,” Brown said in a recent interview. “It is rather daunting to consider the power that they have as law enforcement, that they claim they can hide.”
Brian Clark, a spokesperson for Brown, said the university had not received the lawsuit as of Monday afternoon.
“Should we receive it formally, we will review it in full,” Clark said in an emailed response. 
Clark also pointed to a January opinion by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General affirming that Brown’s police department is not subject to state public records law because it is not a government body or public agency. 
The eight-page opinion by Paul Meosky, special assistant attorney general, aimed to settle disputes between the university and two local journalists — the same two people named as plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit — over access to campus police arrest reports.

‘Undisputed,’ AG says
Meosky concluded that it was “undisputed” that Brown University’s police department was a “unit of Brown,” and therefore part of a private, nonprofit institution — not subject to state open records laws.
“Nothing in the record suggests that BUPD has open meetings or is listed as a public body on any government website,” Meosky wrote. “Additionally, the record demonstrates that the BUPD is not authorized to operate beyond the university’s campus and its immediate vicinity.” 
Meosky also noted “the strong public interest” in campus police records.
“We strongly encourage the General Assembly to carefully review this issue and whether the APRA should be amended to make law enforcement-type records maintained by private campus police departments subject to the APRA,” the opinion states.
Timothy Rondeau, a spokesperson for the AG’s office, said the opinion “speaks for itself” when asked for comment about the lawsuit.
“Our Office has been, and will continue, to be vigorously committed to open government,” Rondeau said in an email. “This was a challenging issue, and we will await the Court’s guidance.”
Brown said he was disappointed, but not surprised by the AG’s opinion, which followed what he called a “pattern of deferring to local police departments when it comes to open records laws.”
And it’s incorrect, at least in the eyes of Noble Brigham, a Brown University Class of 2024 graduate and one of the two plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit.
Brigham, 23, now lives in Las Vegas, where he works as a courts reporter for the Las Vegas Review Journal. During his time as a student at Brown, he freelanced for the Providence Journal and wrote for the campus newspaper, the Brown Daily Herald.
Brigham asked campus police for arrest reports in December 2022 while working on a story about a man charged by Brown Police with trespassing and felony breaking and entering, after he was found sleeping in the basement of a campus dorm. Brown refused to hand over the documents, prompting Brigham to appeal to the AG’s office in January 2023. 
Brigham no longer keeps tabs on the fallout from the arrest of the man, who had a 10-year history of run-ins with campus police, according to Brigham’s reporting. 
But he insists access to campus police arrest reports is important.
“I didn’t just file the complaint because I thought Brown was wrong in their interpretation of the records law,” Brigham said in an interview Friday. “I also thought it was important for people to know what’s going on.”

Erasing information 
Exempting Brown police from making arrests public also hides whether campus law enforcement are following through with charges on arrests — or, potentially, erasing those arrests even from internal records.
“One of the most important purposes of APRA is to make sure police agencies cannot make arrests disappear,” said Michael Bilow, a reporter with Motif Magazine and the other plaintiff in the ACLU lawsuit. “To this day, I have no legal assurance that Brown didn’t do that.”
Bilow first sought records for Brown University students arrested during a series of pro-Palestine sit-in protests in the wake of the Hamas attack on Gaza. An initial group of 20 students were arrested by campus police for a Nov. 8, 2023 protest, but the charges were dropped.
Another 41 students were arrested for trespassing during a Dec. 11, 2023, sit-in protest, according to news reports. State law requires that Brown University police must submit any arrest reports to the Providence Police Department.
But when Bilow first requested the arrest documents for the 41 students from Providence police, he was told there were no records. He had also tried to get them from campus police but never heard back. Five months later, Bilow spotted a Providence City Council post on X calling on the city solicitor to drop charges against the 41 Brown students. Bilow re-upped his request to the city, using the social media post as proof that arrests had been made and charges filed. 










One of the most important purposes of APRA is to make sure police agencies cannot make arrests disappear. To this day, I have no legal assurance that Brown didn’t do that.”

Bilow eventually got the information he was asking for from the city of Providence, which admitted its error in previously telling him that there were no records.
“My understanding is that Brown Police did the “processing” of the arrested individuals, which led to our confusion here,” a city spokesperson told Bilow in the reply, which is included in a story by Bilow on Motif’s website. “This is why Public Safety had no records of the arrest.”
Samara Pinto, a spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, indicated this is not unusual.
“Brown University Public Safety reports come into the Department’s possession when criminal cases involving their arrests are referred for prosecution in district court,” Pinto said in an email Monday. “In many instances, the copy in the prosecution file may be the only one we receive.”
While Bilow now has the names and charges against the 41 students, he doesn’t know if anyone else was arrested, but isn’t being prosecuted. That leaves him unable to confirm if others may have been charged but then had charges subsequently dropped.
“I have no proof, but I have no assurance either,” Bilow said. “That in itself is pretty newsworthy.”

Whistleblower steps up 
A former Brown University police officer has begun to speak out about the lengths university officials are willing to go to keep information closeted within the 95-person department. Michael Greco, who worked as a patrol officer for Brown University Department of Public Safety for 18 years before leaving in August, testified in support of public records reform at a State House hearing on May 22.
Greco told lawmakers the department’s exemption from public records law was purposefully manipulated to hide information. On multiple occasions, he or other campus officers would be sent to handle incidents that should have been handled by Providence police, specifically because that would ensure any reports or arrests could remain private, he said.
Greco has filed a workers’ compensation claim against the university after leaving due to post-traumatic stress disorder, which he developed after a November 2021 shooting and bombing threat on campus. In an interview, Greco said he and other officers were sent to respond to a report of bomb threats and someone claiming they were going to “shoot cops.” Greco said he was specifically instructed not to call in the threat on his radio so that Providence police would not hear the information and also respond.
An initial report written by Greco on the day of the threat, Nov. 7, 2021, and shared with Rhode Island Current following the threats at Brown — which were ultimately not proven true — details his concerns about campus police being ill-equipped to respond to an active shooter threat. A printout also shared by Greco shows another officer modified the report two days later; the section in which Greco wrote that he was concerned about responding and was shrugged off was deleted.
“They were willing to dangle us in front of a building where a guy said he would shoot police officers in order to keep something from getting on the Providence radios and out into the public,” Greco said. “If the primary function of Brown’s police department is to take what should be public record and make it private, they are not prioritizing the safety of officers.”
Clark did not respond to requests for comment on Greco’s allegations.
Providence police did eventually respond to the bomb and shooting threats on Nov. 7, 2021. However, the city police incident report notes the call was received at 5:21 p.m., three-and-a-half hours after the initial 1:50 p.m. call to Brown University police noted in Greco’s report.
There were no arrests.
Federal reporting in play
Brown University Department of Public Safety is also required to collect and report crime statistics to the U.S. Department of Education under The Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Act. The university maintains an electronic log of daily incidents, dating back to 2018, noting the date and time of each incident, its classification — larceny, burglary, extortion, etc — and whether the investigation is open, closed or turned over to Providence police. 
The single-line entries offer little detail, and without a formal arrest or transfer to Providence police, most of the specific information remains out of public reach.










If the primary function of Brown’s police department is to take what should be public record and make it private, they are not prioritizing the safety of officers.


– Michael Greco, a former Brown University patrol officer who left in August 2024


Greco also alleged police would routinely doctor incident reports to avoid federal reporting requirements — vandalism became “property damage with malicious intent,” for example. 
“I don’t think that there’s anything more troubling than the notion that an agency that has the power to arrest somebody can keep that information about those arrests secret,” Brown said. “That should concern anyone who cares about transparency and accountability, when any entity is given such incredible power over information.”
The lawsuit asks the court to issue a judgment determining that Brown’s campus police department is a public body, subject to compliance with public records laws. It also seeks court intervention to force Brown University to hand over the arrest documents requested by Bilow and Brigham within 10 days.

(Photo by Tom Pelton/Environmental Integrity Project)A World War II-era boiler in Virginia is at the center of a growing debate over the paper industry’s role in climate change — and how much pollution goes uncounted due to loopholes in federal reporting rules.
The Smurfit Westrock paper mill in Covington, a 126-year-old facility located north of Roanoke, released more climate-warming pollution in 2023 than any other paper mill in the country, according to a sweeping new report by the Environmental Integrity Project. 
The watchdog group found that the facility reported emitting 970,084 metric tons of greenhouse gases last year — but in reality, it released more than 2.5 million tons. The discrepancy stems from an Environmental Protection Agency policy that allows facilities to omit emissions from the burning of wood and wood byproducts, known as “biogenic” fuels.
“This plant is burning dirty fuels using a boiler built in 1940, and the pollution is hitting communities and the climate alike,” said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project. “Even in the digital age, we need paper products. But there is no reason a clean sheet of paper needs to be made with dirty fuels and antiquated methods.”
The Smurfit Westrock press office did not to respond to an email seeking comment Monday.
The report, titled “A Paper Trail of Pollution,” paints a dire portrait of the U.S. pulp and paper industry. 
Over a six-month period, researchers reviewed thousands of public records and visited mills across the country, ultimately studying the 185 largest paper and pulp facilities in the United States. Their findings suggest that many of these plants are operating with outdated infrastructure, lax oversight and little accountability for their true environmental impact.
Among the most striking revelations is that nearly three-quarters of the mills rely on outdated boilers, with an average age of 41 years. One of the oldest, built in 1928, remains in use at a mill in Longview, Washington. In contrast, experts recommend replacing industrial boilers after about 15 years. At more than 40% of the facilities studied, at least one boiler was a half-century old or older.
The Covington mill, which employs several hundred people and is a fixture of the local economy, has long drawn criticism from nearby residents for the foul odors, soot and water pollution it produces. 
In 2023, it was the nation’s top emitter of methane — a greenhouse gas more than 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period — releasing more than 214,000 metric tons. The mill also ranked third among U.S. paper facilities for hydrochloric acid emissions, releasing an estimated 170,000 pounds.
The plant’s impact extends beyond the air. State records document at least a dozen incidents over the past five years in which locals reported dark, cloudy, or contaminated discharges — including black liquor, a toxic wood-processing byproduct — flowing into the nearby Jackson River, a tributary of the James River, and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay. 
One complaint, filed in November 2022, warned of “polluted water destroying the Upper James River fishery.” The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality dismissed the complaint.
Victoria Higgins, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the Covington facility is a clear example of how outdated equipment and regulatory gaps are allowing the paper industry to skirt accountability. 
“Pollution from industrial factories burning trees is an under-counted source of climate-warming pollution,” she said. “In order to deliver on the promise of clean air and a stable climate in Virginia, we need to ensure facilities like the more than century-old Smurfit Westrock mill are moving to cleaner energy sources.”
 An industry steeped in tradition

The American paper industry traces its roots to 1690, when the first mill opened in Germantown, Pennsylvania, using discarded cotton rags and waterwheels for power. By 1810, about 185 mills were operating across the country, but a shortage of rags pushed papermakers to experiment with alternative fibers like straw, bark and eventually wood.
With the advent of mechanical wood grinders in the 19th century, wood pulp became the industry standard, and the U.S. quickly rose to become the world’s top paper producer. That growth came at a cost — mill operations contributed to large-scale deforestation, including the cutting of tens of millions of acres of woodland in a single year by some companies.
Today, the U.S. has more trees than it did 50 years ago, thanks in part to replanting efforts by the industry, which now plants over a billion trees annually. The modern paper sector is dominated by a few major corporations and concentrated in states like Wisconsin, Georgia, and Alabama. More than half of paper produced in the U.S. is now used for packaging and wrapping.
Federal law currently allows the paper industry to exclude emissions from the combustion of biogenic materials — such as wood, wood chips, and black liquor — on the theory that trees will regrow and eventually recapture the carbon released during combustion. 
But environmental groups and scientists increasingly question that logic, particularly when emissions from burning these fuels are both large and immediate, while regrowth can take decades.
Nationwide, the 185 mills studied reported a total of 33.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA in 2023. But after factoring in emissions from biogenic fuels — which the EPA does not currently require mills to report — the Environmental Integrity Project estimates that the true number is closer to 115 million tons. That’s more than three times the reported total.
Other pollutants are also under-regulated. In 2020, the mills collectively released more than 46,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to heart and lung problems, including premature death. Many mills, including some of the worst offenders, lack basic pollution control devices such as scrubbers that can significantly reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. 
The latter chemical is responsible for the rotten egg-like smell associated with many mills, including the one in Covington, and can trigger nausea, headaches and respiratory issues.
Hydrogen sulfide pollution is especially concentrated. In 2023, 90 of the mills reported emitting a combined total of eight million pounds of the chemical, with nearly half of that coming from just 12 plants. Six of the top 10 emitters of hydrogen sulfide across all industries last year were paper mills, the report said.
The report also found that regulatory enforcement has been inconsistent and often toothless. 
A third of the 185 mills studied had an air pollution violation in the last three years. Over the past five years, 95 of them were subject to 267 enforcement actions, which resulted in just $7.4 million in total penalties — a modest sum for an industry with multibillion-dollar revenues.
 Pollution not unique to Virginia plants

Beyond Virginia, the report includes case studies of plants in Washington and South Carolina, where local residents have filed thousands of odor complaints, voiced worries about health risks, and called on regulators to tighten enforcement. 
In Port Townsend, Washington, a mill has spent 12 consecutive quarters in violation of the Clean Air Act. In Catawba, South Carolina, residents have logged nearly 50,000 odor complaints since 2018 against a mill now owned by a private equity group led by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.
Duggan and her colleagues argue that the solution lies in modernization and tougher oversight. The report calls for pulp and paper mills to replace aging boilers with zero-emission industrial heat systems and shift toward cleaner energy sources. It also urges a greater commitment to using recycled paper over virgin wood, which requires more energy and water and generates significantly more emissions. 
According to the group, manufacturing a ton of cardboard from recycled materials requires half the energy, 32% less water, and produces just a quarter of the climate pollution.
The study’s authors also demand an end to the biogenic loophole in EPA reporting rules and warn that the issue could worsen if efforts to eliminate or weaken greenhouse gas reporting requirements under President Donald Trump’s administration succeed.
“The American paper industry should modernize these plants to use cleaner and more efficient power systems and increase recycling to reduce climate pollution and protect the health of nearby communities,” Duggan said. “And this industry should not be allowed to hide its climate pollution.”
For residents of Covington and other communities living in the shadow of aging mills, the hope is that attention from this report will bring pressure for long-overdue reforms — before the paper trail of pollution grows any longer.

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) I’ve been thinking a lot about language lately, and the strange way words that used to mean good things are now attacked as bad, and vice-versa. Diversity, equity and inclusion are radioactive. Mentioning environmental justice or climate change will get your federal program canceled. Coal is clean, even beautiful, and pointing out the connection to global warming makes you an alarmist, because speaking up when your government steers you towards disaster is now a bad thing to do. 
Recently I received an email excoriating “woke” energy policy, which seemed especially curious. I can see how awareness of historic racial injustice against Black people might nudge policy makers into greater support for renewable energy, given that pollution from fossil fuels tends to have a disparate impact on communities of color. But judging from the hostile tone of the email, I believe we may have different understandings of wokeness.  
Sometimes, though, words mean different things to different people without anyone realizing they aren’t using the same definition. That may be the case when Virginia leaders talk about the reliability of the electricity supply. Everyone agrees reliability is critical – but they may not be talking about the same thing.
We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia. Now it’s official.

Virginia’s need for power is growing at a terrific pace. Data centers consume so much electricity that our utilities can’t keep up, causing them to increase imports from out of state. That’s okay for now; West Virginia is not a hostile foreign nation. Also, Virginia is a member of a larger grid, the 13-state (plus D.C.) PJM Interconnection, which manages thousands of generating facilities to ensure output matches demand across the region. But even across this wider area, demand is increasing faster than supply, pushing up prices and threatening a shortfall. Unless we tell data centers to go elsewhere, we need more generation, and fast.
Democrats and Republicans are divided over how to increase the power supply. Democrats remain committed to the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which requires Virginia’s electricity to decarbonize by 2050. Meeting the VCEA’s milestones requires investments in renewable energy and storage, both to address climate change and to save ratepayers from the high costs of coal and fracked gas. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin and members of his party counter that fossil fuels are tried-and-true, baseload sources of energy. They advocate abandoning the VCEA and building more gas plants, arguing that renewable energy just isn’t reliable. 
Note that these Republicans are not alarmists, so they ignore climate change. If they were the proverbial frog in a pot of water on the stove, they would consider it a point of pride that they boiled to death without acknowledging the reason.
Youngkin takes every chance he gets to slam the VCEA. As I’ve previously described, the governor sought to amend various energy-related legislation to become VCEA repeal bills, regardless of the original subject matter or how much good it could do.
With vetoes and destructive amendments, Youngkin acts to deepen Virginia’s energy woes

Last month, Youngkin’s Director of the Department of Energy sent a report on performance-based utility regulation to the State Corporation Commission. With it was a cover letter that had nothing to say about performance-based regulation, but a lot to say about the big, bad VCEA. The letter insists that “By all models, VCEA is unable to meet Virginia’s growing energy demand” and urges the SCC to “prioritize ratepayer affordability and grid reliability over long-term VCEA compliance.” 
Unfortunately for the Youngkin administration, affordability hasn’t been an argument in favor of fossil fuels for many years now. A new solar farm generates a megawatt of electricity more cheaply than a new fossil gas plant, and that will still be true even if Congress revokes renewable energy subsidies – though doing so will make electricity less affordable. 
The argument from fossil fuel defenders then becomes that the cheapest megawatt is not a reliable megawatt. And that’s where meaning matters.
Reliability is so important that even the decarbonization mandate of the VCEA contains an important exception: a utility can build fossil fuel generation under certain circumstances, if it is the only way to keep the lights on. 
Dominion Energy is relying on this escape clause as it seeks regulatory approval to build new fossil gas combustion turbines on the site of an old coal plant in Chesterfield. The move is opposed by local residents, environmental justice advocates and climate activists. (No word on whether they are alarmists or simply alarmed.) They argue Dominion hasn’t met the conditions set out in the VCEA to trigger the escape clause, including achieving energy efficiency targets and proving it can’t meet its needs with renewable energy, energy storage and demand response programs.
Virginia Republicans not only side with Dominion on this, they increasingly favor building gas plants over renewables as a general matter, urging the reliability point. It’s an argument that never made much sense for me, given that renewables make up only 5% of PJM’s electricity. That’s way less than the national average of over 21%, and other grids aren’t crashing right and left. 
The light bulb went off for me while I was watching the May meeting of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation. A PJM representative showed a chart of how the grid operator assigns numbers to different resources according to how they contribute to the electricity supply. Nuclear plants get the highest score because they run constantly, intermittent wind and solar sources get lower scores, with fossil fuel plants in the middle. PJM calls that a reliability score.
For some Republicans, that’s a slam-dunk: the chart proves renewable energy is unreliable. But in spite of its label, the chart doesn’t actually measure reliability; it gives points for availability, which is not the same thing. 
As I once heard a solar installer testify, few things are as reliable as the sun rising every morning (or rather, the earth rotating). With modern weather forecasting, grid operators can predict with great precision how much electricity from solar they can count on at any given time from solar facilities arrayed across the region. Solar energy is highly reliable, even though it is not always available. Add storage, and the availability issue is also resolved.
Obviously, the grid would not be reliable if solar were the only resource operators had to work with. But it isn’t. PJM calls on a mix of different sources, plus storage facilities and demand response, to ensure generation precisely matches the peaks and valleys of demand. Reliability is a matter of keeping resources in sync and ensuring a robust transmission and distribution system.
The threat to reliability today comes from the mad rush to connect new data centers. PJM has been roundly criticized for not approving new generating and storage facilities’ connection to the grid at a fast enough pace to keep up with the increase in demand and retirements of old, money-losing fossil fuel plants. Scrambling to recover, recently it decided to prioritize a smaller number of big, new gas plants over the thousands of megawatts of renewable energy and storage still languishing on its waiting list. 
Meanwhile, PJM wants utilities to keep operating coal plants even though it will make electricity less affordable and violate state climate laws. In this it is joined by the Trump administration, which wants to require utilities to keep running coal plants explicitly to support the coal industry. 
Analysts say this is the wrong way to achieve reliability. A recent report from the consulting firm Synapse estimates that PJM’s approach will raise residential electricity bills by 60% by 2036-2040. By contrast, reforming its interconnection process and enabling more renewable energy and storage to come online would lower bills by 7%. By Synapse’s calculation, Virginia would see the most savings of any state. 
In other words, Virginia Republicans are pursuing reliability the wrong way. Instead of pressuring Democrats to back away from the VCEA, they ought to be pressuring PJM to reform its approach. Reliable power doesn’t have to be expensive, if you take the politics out of it.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images) The Virginia Department of Education is preparing to launch a new Office of Excellence and Best Practices by hiring an executive director who will be responsible for fostering innovation, highlighting high-performing schools, and directing resources toward initiatives with a proven track record of improving student outcomes.
The agency posted an advertisement for the opening last week. 
Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson, who began in March, said it has been challenging for the agency to track and share successful educational practices and resources across school divisions, despite significant funding. She believes the office will help.
“One of the things we’re really working hard at in the department is breaking down silos, including on data sharing, real impact, proven resources that are quickly scalable and usable from the field,” said Gullickson. “We have made progress, but we have a lot more to do to really better support our educators with this data.” 
Some Democratic state legislators, including Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, are concerned about the timing of the agency’s decision to fill a senior position. Since Youngkin completes his term in January, the next governor’s administration may have different ideas about the new office and its leadership. 
“If this role is truly essential to the department’s mission, the decision should be left to the next administration, which will be responsible for setting future education policy and direction,” Hashmi said. “Rushing to fill it now appears to be more about entrenching a political agenda than serving Virginia’s students.”
The governor’s administration and Democrats have not seen eye-to-eye on many education priorities with few exceptions, including their work to improve assessment testing and increase teacher pay. 
In 2022, Youngkin laid out his legislative priorities including his administration’s efforts to“restore excellence in education,” after pointing to the state’s “low” proficiency standards and parents’ battles with school divisions over their rights and concerns. 
The governor also called for investing in charter schools and developing more lab schools.
Democrats have sparred with the administration over most of the governor’s initiatives that involved public education funding and equity, curriculum changes and his scholarship program proposal. The administration, lawmakers and educators also disagreed over the administration’s process for revising school history and social science standards, which determine what students need to know in those subjects before graduating.
The Office of Excellence and Best Practices director, once hired, will work in tandem with the Road to Readiness School Performance and Support Framework Resource Hub, which offers free educational resources to families and educators.
The application process closes on June 11.

After a campaign promise to bring in outsized federal dollars for Maine, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins won reelection during Trump’s first term, overcoming a record amount of spending against her and defying public polls. At the start of the president’s second term, Collins rose to the helm of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the first time a Mainer has chaired one of the upper chamber’s most powerful committees in 92 years.  
However, Maine’s longest-serving member of Congress has reached this pinnacle of authority as President Donald Trump is attempting to flip the system on its head. His administration, by Collins’ own admission, has unjustly rescinded congressionally appropriated funds, at times singling out Maine in what are widely considered retaliatory actions over the state’s defiance of his executive order rolling back transgender rights.  
During Trump’s second term so far, Collins has bucked the executive periodically, particularly with attempts to reign in tariffs by reasserting congressional control and voting against a budget framework passed by the Senate in April because of possible cuts to Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income people and some people with disabilities. Though, in the budget currently being considered, she is supportive of adding work requirements to limit Medicaid eligibility. 
Some of her constituents want to see more public pushback. 
“I focus on results, not rhetoric,” Collins said in an interview. “My goal is not to get on Fox News and MSNBC and rant and rave.”
Outlining her strategy for Maine Morning Star, Collins said she’s had success restoring some funding largely due to conversations outside of public view, relying on her long-developed relationships. 
“It is far more effective for me to, for example, restore the funding that the administration wants to cut for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, LIHEAP, which is so important to the state of Maine, than it is to go make a fiery speech to anywhere that doesn’t result in any change,” Collins said.
But some constituents argue a piecemeal approach to restoring funds will ultimately be ineffective as overall democratic checks and balances are tested.
Collins’ public use of power
During Trump’s first few weeks back in office, Collins said she hoped the courts would side with Congress if the president’s attempts to control spending were litigated. 
Now, with numerous cases in the courts, Collins said, “some of the actions taken by the administration have and will be overturned in court, and others Congress will overturn through the appropriations process.”
She added, “When I disagree with the actions of the administration, I have not hesitated to intervene.” 
Collins said she consulted with the Trump administration in order to restore the U.S. Department of Agriculture grants to the University of Maine, renegotiate the Maine Sea Grant, secure an exception to the hiring freeze at Acadia National Park and reverse the cancellation of a decades-old program that allows parents to register their newborns for a Social Security number while at hospitals  — though Collins’ spokesperson told Maine Morning Star that Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek told the senator it was an error but reporting later revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
But some Maine voters argue Collins should be using her seniority — as the seventh most senior member of the Senate and the most senior Republican woman — for more than piecemeal fixes. 
Falmouth resident Anne Scheer — who carried a sign during a Tax Day protest in Augusta that read “Where’s Susan?” — said she wants the senator to rally her caucus to stand up for democracy, adding that she doesn’t think that has to be an anti-Trump message. 
“She needs to talk with her fellow Republicans and say, ‘This is enough,’” Scheer said. 










Her vote is the mechanism of government but she has a platform that she could be speaking from.


– Biddeford resident Anthony Burgess


Cape Elizabeth resident Jerry Kaufman, an independent who protested against Collins in Biddeford in April, said he’d vote for Collins if she could convince her colleagues to confront the president to say “stop the foolishness.” 
“Show some leadership and bring some people along with you,” Kaufman said. 
At that same protest, Biddeford resident Anthony Burgess, a registered Democrat who voted for Collins once in 2014, criticized her statements of concern and disappointment about some of the Trump administration’s actions as lacking conviction. 
He said independent U.S. Sen. Angus King’s attendance at the “Hands Off” rally in Portland in April demonstrated for him a refusal to cow to Trump. 
“Her vote is the mechanism of government but she has a platform that she could be speaking from,” Burgess said.
When asked what her response is to those who say she should be doing more to ensure the separation of powers remains, Collins pointed to her questioning officials in subcommittee hearings.
One main purpose of subcommittees is to hold hearings on spending proposals during which members can directly question agency heads. Collins has questioned several, including U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the proposed elimination of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. 
“We’re actually holding these subcommittee hearings at a breakneck pace to evaluate spending requests and reductions, as well as to assess compliance with congressional intent and enacted laws,” Collins said.

Exercising private influence
However, Collins said the public does not see what she feels is her most efficient tactic. 
“My goal is to get things fixed and to get problems solved, and I do that through the federal hearings where I’m laying the foundation for restoration of the cuts in biomedical research, which is an extraordinarily high priority for me,” Collins said, as an example. “But also I do it privately by calling up Cabinet members.” 
Collins said she is so far largely approaching her qualms with the administration through these one-on-one conversations.
This tactic has burned her at times in the past, notably when Collins voted for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after she said he gave her private assurances he wasn’t a threat to Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling that he later voted to overturn.   
More recently, ahead of the deadline to avoid a government shutdown, Collins said she started texting with Trump’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency. That outreach does not appear to have gone as planned, at least for the immediate outcome.
While Collins initially said she was “absolutely” opposed to a full-year stop gap approach, she told Politico that Republican leaders instructed her to start writing a plan for that approach anyway. The version that passed, drafted by House GOP leadership, was ultimately pushed through with limited input from spending leaders of either chamber.
But in other cases, she’s touted success that she’s had with these conversations that happen behind closed doors, such as with the restoration of the USDA funding and renegotiation of the Maine Sea Grant. 
“Because I have these relationships with the president’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and with Cabinet members, I have been able to restore funding that was in jeopardy,” Collins said.  
Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine, sees this as a strength unique to Collins.
“Given that she’s the only Republican member of the current Maine delegation and she’s the only person with a committee chair, I think she’s better positioned to have those communications than any of the other members,” Brewer said.  
But while Collins sees these behind-the-scenes negotiations as the most effective way to restore funding that, as she puts it, has been arbitrarily and unfairly cut from Maine, when it comes to attempts to gut entire programs, “that’s going to take legislation,” she said. 
Republicans’ ‘big, beautiful bill’
The sprawling budget bill is the main vehicle where such attempts are currently being made. 
Cokie Giles, a registered nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, protested with National Nurses United outside Collins’ office in Portland in March to demand the senator oppose the possible cuts to Medicaid in the budget. 
While Collins often talks about her ability to work across the aisle, Giles said, “Well, work on your own side, and don’t let these cuts go through.”
After Collins, citing concerns about possible Medicaid cuts, was one of two Senate Republicans to vote against the budget framework that the chamber passed in early April, Giles told Maine Morning Star she was pleased but not confident the senator’s opposition would remain as budget debates continues, nor that her vote would make a difference in the end. 
Late last month, the U.S. House narrowly approved the massive tax and spending plan. The legislation now heads to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are expected to rewrite much of it, now taking into consideration the more detailed budget plan Trump released on Friday. The bill will then have to head back to the House for final approval, with a goal to get it to the president’s desk by the Fourth of July. 
As passed by the House, the 1,116-page package combines 11 bills. Among its many components, the current plan would overhaul Medicaid, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.

Collins did not provide specific red lines that would lead her to not support the budget package, but she described Medicaid as critically important for Maine’s health care system and a vital resource for many seniors, low-income families, disabled patients and those who cannot work. She told Maine Morning Star she “cannot support proposals that would create more duress for our hospitals and providers that are already teetering on the edge of insolvency.”
However, Collins is supportive of placing further limits on program eligibility, specifically “work requirements for able-bodied men and women who are capable of working and do not have obligations that preclude them from participating in the workforce,” she said. 
As passed by the House, people who are between the ages of 19 and 65 would be required to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to be eligible. The language has numerous exceptions, including for pregnant people, parents of dependent children and people who have complex medical conditions, among others.
Under these requirements, 34,000 Mainers would be expected to lose their Medicaid coverage, reducing federal funding by $215 million, according to the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy.
Maine Gov. Janet Mills warned in a radio address on Friday about these cuts, as well as others that would limit access to the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces.
“If you receive health care through MaineCare or CoverME.gov, which is the Affordable Care Act, I encourage you to contact Members of Congress to share what that coverage means to you,” Mills said. “They need to hear your story.”
Some shared their stories at a protest against Collins organized by the Maine Democratic Party in Bangor on Saturday, which drew almost 200 attendees who demanded the senator block the health care and other program cuts in the budget.
“In 2020, [Collins] told us that her seniority would protect us, that chairing Appropriations would give her the power to defend Maine’s interests,” said Shawn Yardley. “Her party now controls the White House and both chambers of Congress, but the cuts and the cruelty keep coming.” 
While Collins emphasized some possible future impacts on MaineCare at the federal level, she said, “the state has not been perfect on this issue.” The senator called out the Maine Legislature for being unable to reach a compromise on its state budget.
“The state is holding up more than $100 million in emergency supplemental funding that would draw down nearly $400 million federal funds,” Collins said. 
Maine Senate Republicans held out their support for the supplemental budget plan, and later the two-year budget, because they’d wanted it to include structural reform to Medicaid — notably the work requirements Collins is supportive of adding on the federal level. 
Last month, the Maine House failed to secure enough support to get the now already allocated Medicaid funding out sooner. Some Republicans, though not ultimately enough for passage, supported that effort, arguing the state needs to pay its bills owed to providers, but others called it a blank check they wouldn’t sign. 
With Maine hospitals already struggling to keep services available, state groups are calling on Collins in particular to reject federal health care cuts, as well as cuts to childcare and food assistance in a digital ad campaign launched this week by Family Values @ Work Action, a national network of state and local coalitions aimed at promoting family-friendly workplace policies.
“This package takes food and medicine from the mouths of Maine families to fund tax cuts for the wealthy,” Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby, said in a statement on Monday. 
Among many other components, the federal budget bill proposes cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, through expanded work requirements and shifting some program costs to state governments. Maine would also lose federal matching funds as a penalty for providing coverage to some immigrant populations. 
The budget plan would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion.
“We have an enormous deficit and debt,” Collins said, “and we do need to evaluate programs.”
As the Senate negotiates what to keep and do away with in the “big, beautiful bill” that represents the heart of Trump’s domestic agenda, how Maine’s senior senator chooses to use her influence, whether in public or not, will be put to the test.

North Carolina’s economy has undergone many important transitions over the last several decades. But in recent years there’s been no more promising arrival on the scene than the electric vehicle industry.
As experts at the national Electrification Coalition pointed out last week, federal EV tax credits have helped spur the creation of more than sixteen thousand jobs and over twenty billion dollars in investments in the state in recent years. And, of course, these are jobs and investments that are not only good for the state’s economy, but for the world as it struggles to end its heroin-like addiction to fossil fuels.
Unfortunately, the massive budget and tax bill approved by the U.S. House last week places all of this in jeopardy by eliminating several tax credits supporting the industry.
The bottom line: Our nation currently spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year subsidizing the fossil fuel industry. The least North Carolina’s congressional delegation can do is help to retain some modest subsidies for an industry of the future that helps our people and our planet.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Republican budget bill the U.S. House approved last month includes a surprise for the 40 states that have expanded Medicaid: penalties for providing health care to some immigrants who are here legally.
Along with punishing the 14 states that use their own funds to cover immigrants who are here illegally, analysts say last-minute changes to the bill would make it all but impossible for states to continue helping some immigrants who are in the country legally, on humanitarian parole.
Under the bill, the federal government would slash funding to states that have expanded Medicaid and provide coverage to immigrants who are on humanitarian parole — immigrants who have received permission to temporarily enter the United States due to an emergency or urgent humanitarian reason.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering adults without children who are eligible under Medicaid expansion, but the bill would cut that to 80% for those states, doubling the state portion from 10% to 20%. That’s the same penalty the bill proposes for states that use their own money to help immigrants who are here illegally.
Ironically, states such as Florida that have extended Medicaid coverage to immigrants who are here on humanitarian parole but have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would not be harmed by the bill, said Leonardo Cuello, a Medicaid law and policy expert and research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.
More states offer health care coverage for certain immigrants, noncitizens

It is “wildly nonsensical and unfair” to penalize expansion states for covering a population that some non-expansion states, such as Florida, also cover, Cuello said. “It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.”
West Virginia is one of the states where lawmakers are nervously watching U.S. Senate discussions on the proposed penalty. Republican state Rep. Matt Rohrbach, a deputy House speaker, said West Virginia legislators tabled a proposal that would have ended Medicaid expansion if the federal government reduced its share of the funding, because the state’s congressional representatives assured them it wasn’t going to happen. Now the future is murkier.
Cuello called the proposed penalty “basically a gun to the head of the states.”
“Congress is framing it as a choice, but the state is being coerced and really has no choice,” he said.
There are about 1.3 million people in the United States on humanitarian parole, from Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Ukraine and Venezuela as well as some Central American children who have rejoined family here. The Trump administration is trying to end parole from some of those countries. A Supreme Court decision May 30 allows the administration to end humanitarian parole for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Not many of those parolees qualify for Medicaid, which requires a waiting period or special status, but the 40 states with expanded Medicaid could be penalized anyway when they do start accepting them as they begin to qualify, said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.










It would appear that the purpose is more to punish expansion states than address any genuine concern with immigrant coverage.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of states and the District of Columbia already are considering scaling back Medicaid coverage for immigrants because of the costs.
The federal budget bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is now being considered by the Senate, where changes are likely. The fact that so many states could be affected by the last-minute change could mean more scrutiny in that chamber, said Andrea Kovach, senior attorney for health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago.
By her count, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia would be affected by the new restrictions, since they accepted some options now offered by Medicaid to cover at least some humanitarian parolees without a five-year waiting period.
“They’re all going to be penalized because they added in parolees,” Kovach said. “So that’s 38 times two senators who are going to be very interested in this provision to make sure their state doesn’t get their reimbursement knocked down.”
The change to exclude people with humanitarian parole was included in a May 21 amendment by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who chairs the House budget committee. Arrington’s office did not reply to a request for comment, though he has stressed the importance of withholding Medicaid from immigrants who are here illegally.
Need to go to the hospital? Texas and Florida want to know your immigration status.

“[Democrats] want to protect health care and welfare at any cost for illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking taxpayers,” Arrington said in a May 22 floor speech urging passage of the bill. “But by the results of this last election, it’s abundantly clear: The people see through this too and they have totally rejected the Democrats’ radical agenda.”
Some states already are considering cutting Medicaid coverage for immigrants, though Democratic lawmakers and advocates are pushing back.
Washington, D.C., Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has proposed phasing out a program that provides Medicaid coverage to adults regardless of their immigration status, a move she says would save the District of Columbia $457 million.
Minnesota advocates protested a state budget deal reached last month with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to phase out health care coverage for adults who are here illegally, a condition Republican lawmakers insisted on to avoid a shutdown.
Similarly, Illinois advocates are protesting new state rules that will end a program that has provided Medicaid coverage to immigrants aged 42-64 regardless of their legal status. The program cost $1.6 billion over three years, according to a state audit. The state will continue a separate program that provides coverage for older adults.
“Our position is that decision-makers in Illinois shouldn’t be doing Trump’s work for him,” said Kovach, of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. “Let’s preserve health coverage for immigrants and stand up for Illinois immigrant residents who have been paying taxes into this state for years and need this coverage.”
Illinois state Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Democrat whose parents are refugees from El Salvador, said many of her constituents in Chicago may be forced to cancel chemotherapy or lifesaving surgery because of the changes.
“It was a state budget, but I think the federal reconciliation bill really set the tone for it,” Guzmán said. “In a tough fiscal environment, it was really hard to set up a defense for this program.”
More States Offer Health Coverage to Immigrant Children

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is among the governors holding firm, saying that letting immigrants stay uninsured imposes costs on local hospitals and ends up raising prices for everyone.
“The costs will go somewhere. When everyone is insured it is much more helpful to keep costs down and reasonable for everyone. That’s why we’ve taken this approach to give care to everyone,” Kotek said at a news conference last month.
Medicaid does pay for emergency care for low-income patients, regardless of their immigration status, and that would not change under the federal budget bill.
Franny White, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said her state’s Medicaid program covers about 105,000 immigrants, some of whom are here illegally. She said the policy, established by a 2021 state law, can save money in the long run.
“Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventive care due to cost and often wait until a condition worsens to the point that it requires more advanced, expensive care at an emergency department or hospital,” she said.
California was among the first states, along with Oregon, to offer health insurance to immigrants of all ages regardless of their legal status. But it now is considering cutting back, looking to save $5 billion as it seeks to close a $12 billion budget deficit. In May, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment of immigrant adults who are here illegally, and charging them premiums to save money.
“It’s possible that other states will decide to cut back these services because of budgetary concerns,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research organization.
If the federal budget bill passes with the immigrant health care provision intact, states would have more than two years to adjust, since the changes would not take effect until October 2027.
“We have time to really understand what the landscape looks like and really create a legal argument to make sure folks are able to maintain their health care coverage,” said Enddy Almonord, director for Healthy Illinois, an advocacy group supporting universal health care coverage.

(Photo courtesy of Food Bank for the Heartland)People in Marsha Keene’s community are already struggling to cover the basics.
Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Federal cuts affect regional food access; more uncertainty to come

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.
In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.
But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.
Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

(Getty Images)For years, Republican lawmakers have applied a guarantee to each budget they have passed: “no new taxes and fees.”
This year they’re reconsidering the second part. In a year defined by lower projected business tax revenues, the budget passed by the House in April includes increases to a number of registration charges and levies in the state, from driver’s licenses to tractors.
Legislative leaders say the fees are a pragmatic way forward to address expected shortfalls in business taxes in the next two years — and to apply them to those who use the services. 
“In the past, we’ve kind of overlooked fees,” said Rep. Ken Weyler, a Kingston Republican, speaking to the House on April 10. “… What does it cost to register a car? Not so much. When was the last time it went up? We can’t find any history beyond 25 years.” 
But others, including Democrats, say they’re unnecessary. “I didn’t run on a platform of increasing fees,” said Rep. Matt Wilhelm, of Manchester, speaking in April ahead of the House passing the budget. “If I remember correctly from the flyers that I received in the mail … my friends on the other side of the aisle didn’t campaign on a platform of raising fees either.” 
The question is now in the hands of the Senate, where the Finance Committee is set to wrap up a final proposal for the budget in time for the whole chamber to vote on Thursday, and where senators have already put in place more optimistic revenue projections. 
Here’s a guide to what costs might go up.
Driving fees
The House has included an increase to the fee to obtain a new driver’s license: from $10 to $20. The application fee for a new motor vehicle registration would rise from $25 to $35.
The yearly cost for vanity license plates would also increase, from $40 to $60.
A number of the fee increases would affect professional drivers, specifically. 
Large commercial trucks would all see annual registration fees increase. Those trucks between 8,000 and 73,280 pounds — which include most large commercial trucks when empty — would see a 50% increase in annual fees, from $0.96 per hundred pounds to $1.44 per hundred pounds.
Registration fees for smaller trucks and vehicles would also increase, depending on the weight class. 
The House budget also includes specific registration fee increases for agricultural vehicles, from $6 to $11; for tractors, from $1.80 to $12; for cement mixers, from $6 to $11; and for saw rigs and log splitters, from $6 to $11.
Development and business fees
A number of costs for developers, businesses, and landowners might increase. 
Under the House budget, the cost for an elevator inspection would rise from $50 to $75. And developers seeking to develop subdivisions would have to pay $450 for the application fee and an additional $450 to install sewage systems; those fees are currently $300 and $290, respectively. 
For those building structures on shorelines, the application fee would increase from $400 to $600, as well as $6 per square foot of dock area; currently that amount is $4 per square foot.
Fee hikes for farm products
A number of agricultural companies could see fees increase under the House budget. 
The annual fee for pesticide dealers would increase from $20 to $60, and they would have to pay a new annual fee of $160 for each pesticide they are registering. Fertilizer producers and dealers would see similar increases — from a $50 annual fee to a $100 annual fee, while commercial feed producers would pay $120 for each product they register with the state, up from $75.
The state charges would go up for maple products, too: Those producers would face a new fee of “not less than” $33.
Fishing, dam registration costs
For those looking to fish in New Hampshire, the cost will increase slightly. While presently, out-of-state registrants must pay $15 for a one-day permit and New Hampshire residents must pay $10, they must also pay $1 toward the fisheries habitat fee. That fee would increase to $5.  
And dam registration fees would double, ranging from $800 to $3,000, depending on the hazard potential of the dam. That’s part of a push to better fund long-needed repairs.
 Democrats opposed; industry representatives divided

Weyler said the voluntary nature of fees makes them more fair to taxpayers. 
“If you don’t want to do this, you don’t pay the fee,” he said. “You don’t want to use that, you don’t pay the fee. So we went up with the fees, and it brought us about 5% more revenue, and it should be fairly painless, because if you don’t want it, you don’t, you don’t get it, you don’t pay the fee.
But to Wilhelm, raising the fees is an unnecessary corrective to the budget. “We wouldn’t need to raise these fees … if we halted the expansion of education freedom accounts to ultra wealthy Granite Staters who don’t need taxpayer dollars to subsidize their choice to send their kids to a private school,” he said, referring to efforts in the Legislature to extend the school voucher-like program to all income levels. 
Some industry representatives have strongly criticized the fees. Jasen Stock, the executive director of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, spoke against the increased costs for truck owners.
“To increase truck registration fees by as much as 50 to 60% in one fell swoop is a very big pill to swallow, particularly given the economic impacts that our industry has seen with respect to the markets, tariffs and so forth,” Stock said at the Senate hearing. He asked that the fees be increased more gradually if necessary. 
But Rob Johnson, policy director at the New Hampshire Farm Bureau Federation, said his group is not so concerned about the potential new fees. Even when some have doubled or quadrupled, they still do not rank highly on the list of pressing expenses for farmers, Johnson said.
More pressing, he argued, is the need to restore a proposed $50 million cut to the university system, which Johnson worries could hurt the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension, which supports farms.
“It has an effect (on farmers), but it’s minimal,” Johnson said of the state fees. “And overall, generally, we would rather pay it as a user fee, as opposed to an increase on the property-tax payer.” 
But Bob Scully, the official spokesman for government affairs for the New Hampshire Motor Transport Association, spoke against the fees for trucks and large vehicles, and said lawmakers were effectively passing a tax by another name. 
“There seems to be some discussions that fees are fine and taxes aren’t. If you’re the individual, the money’s coming out of your pocketbook. It’s the same thing.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/countingcash-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Dozens gathered on the west lawn of the Ohio Statehouse to raise awareness that a massive spending bill passed by Republicans in Congress could end up ending health care for more than 750,000 Ohioans.
“People say, ‘Oh, I’m not on Medicaid,'” said Bria Bennett of the Ohio Organizing Collaborative. “But when they hear Caresource (Ohio’s biggest Medicaid managed-care provider), they say ‘Oh yeah, my kids are on Caresource.’ That’s a problem everywhere. People are so focused on ‘How am I getting to work? Is my car going to get me to work? Is my uniform clean for work?’ They’re worried about all those things that trying to dip into the policy things that our politicians talk about is difficult.”
The U.S. House-passed Republican reconciliation budget — President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — would hand out $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. The University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the richest 10% of Americans.
Republicans, such as Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, have denied that the budget would cut health benefits for Americans. But then she undermined her own argument by saying “We all are going to die.”

Parts of the bill, including a strict new work requirement, led the independent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to conclude that it would cost about 10 million Americans their health insurance. That’s nearly half of the 24.6 million Americans who are covered under the Medicaid expansion that was passed as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.
Most Medicaid recipients have jobs, and a 2018 assessment in Ohio said that health coverage made it easier for those people to seek and keep employment.
Meanwhile, work requirements have been shown to be ineffective for anything other than hassling people off of the system. Researchers at Harvard University and the Urban Institute found that Arkansas’s work requirement did nothing to boost employment in the state.
The federal government covers 90% of the cost of the Medicaid expansion. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine proposed that if a significant portion of that funding were eliminated, the state would cut those people off — ending health coverage for 770,000 Ohioans.
That’s nearly 7% of the state. 
It might come as a surprise for many, but 26% of Ohioans are on Medicaid, and low-income residents are so numerous that 30% of households make 200% or less of the federal poverty level.
Bennett of the Ohio Organizing Collaborative said it’s jargon like that that obscures the dire reality in which millions of Ohioans live.
“I don’t know what 200% of whatever is,” she said. “That’s just a number to me. We’re trying to make things relatable because people don’t necessarily know that it affects them.”
For the record, for a family of four 200% of the federal poverty level is $62,400 a year.
Bennett said such households would be devastated if they lost Medicaid benefits.
“I know folks who have four-plus kids. Because of what they make, all of their kids are on Medicaid,” she said. “If that’s taken away, there are no more doctor’s appointments. There’s no more dentist’s appointments.”
And, she said, those life-saving services shouldn’t be axed to pad the pockets of the wealthy in an era of exploding income inequality.
“We should not be giving tax breaks to the wealthy when the poorest and most vulnerable of us cannot even afford health care,” Bennett said.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)In the most recent UNH Granite State Poll, New Hampshire residents said housing is their top concern. 
More than three times as many people cited housing compared to the next most important issue, taxes.  Yes, we are experiencing a statewide crisis of housing affordability. This crisis constrains economic growth and community vitality. Yet the New Hampshire Senate is poised to vote on a state budget that turns its back on housing, cutting funding for important programs that help our cities and towns meet their housing challenges and missing opportunities to help developers build housing that Granite Staters can afford.
The Housing Champions program was created by the Legislature in 2023 with a $5 million appropriation to provide grants to cities and towns to help them voluntarily change their zoning ordinances to be more “housing friendly.” Communities that made these changes were recognized as “Housing Champions” and are eligible for additional funding, such as grants for infrastructure improvements. So far, 18 communities have achieved this distinction, and others are poised to follow. Despite this celebrated success, the Senate has proposed zeroing out this program. This shortsighted decision takes away the principal incentive (“carrots, not sticks”) for our cities and towns to make important zoning changes. 
Earlier this year, the Senate passed Senate Bill 81 (then tabled it to add it to the budget) increasing the annual allocation to the state’s affordable housing trust fund from $5 million to $10 million and making an additional appropriation of $25 million to the trust fund. The annual increase acknowledges the rising cost of building homes — the same money just doesn’t go as far as it once did. The additional one-time appropriation acknowledges the housing deficit we’re in — we need to build many thousands more homes just to meet current demand and help our economy grow. Even with good zoning, the developments that house our workforce require significant financial resources. Witness the several developments that have stalled recently in Concord because of higher costs. Senators gave themselves the opportunity to add SB 81 to the budget and then ignored it.
Finally, the Senate has proposed reducing funding to the Housing Appeals Board, an innovative approach to addressing appeals of local planning and zoning decisions.  The Legislature created the fast-track of the Housing Appeals Board in 2020 recognizing the delays that housing developments faced when local decisions were appealed to court. Time is money, and delays add to development costs. The Housing Appeals Board has been nationally recognized as a light-touch, small-government approach, and it has shown to be an effective and efficient means of hearing appeals. In the midst of a housing crisis, it is nonsensical to pull back on a proven way to speed up final decisions on development proposals.
Our current lack of sufficient housing is a drag on economic growth and is hurting New Hampshire’s families. It’s time for the Senate to put its money — our money — where its mouth is: fund these vital housing programs and help move the Granite State out of its current housing crisis and toward a better, brighter future.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/housing-1024x669.jpg,,,2025-06-03 06:06:58.657393

(Photo via Getty Images)A new study of Ohio Medicaid showed the Affordable Care Act expansion group of nearly 770,000 would bring the state an economic benefit of $1 billion if it survives cuts at the federal and state level. But Ohio Republicans might include a trigger in the state budget to cut the expansion if Medicaid budget cuts come down from Congress.
The Ohio Senate is expected to release its proposed state operating budget in the next few days, a proposal that will then be compared to and combined with the Ohio House’s version already passed last month, before a final draft heads to the governor for his signature.
The Ohio House’s version of the budget absorbed a proposal by Gov. Mike DeWine in his executive budget that creates a trigger effect, eliminating Group VIII, or the Medicaid expansion eligibility group, “if the federal government sets the federal medical assistance percentage below (its current level of) 90%,” according to budget documents.
Child health programs including even pediatric cancer research see cuts in Ohio House budget draft

The expansion group, which was introduced administratively in Ohio in 2014, represents adults aged 19 to 64 who earn less than 138% of the federal poverty level but aren’t eligible for Medicaid in other categories. For a family of two, the poverty level stands at $21,150 in Ohio and other contiguous states.
The federal budget, which is being reviewed by the U.S. Senate, could include a larger state contribution to the Medicaid program than seen in the past, dropping the federal contribution, called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP, from its current share of 90%. If that is passed into law, and if the state budget is passed and signed with the trigger in place, the expansion population would face cuts.
According to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio’s newest policy brief, written by Amy Rohling McGee, the 10% the state currently pays to support Medicaid stands in juxtaposition to revenue and state savings generated by the program.
After accounting for the savings the state nets as a part of the program and revenue created, researchers found that the state share is effectively 1.4%.
“Discontinuing expansion would save substantially less than the state share amount, it would reduce federal funds coming to Ohio by over $42 billion over five years, and would leave an estimated 435,000 Ohioans without coverage,” Rohling McGee wrote as part of the HPIO’s 2025 Ohio Medicaid Expansion Study.

The economic activity that results from those in the Medicaid expansion group having their health insurance covered “is projected to generate over $1.1 billion over the next five years in state general revenue from personal income taxes, sales taxes and gross receipts taxes,” according to HPIO researchers.
State revenue would drop in a number of other ways without the expansion group, according to the HPIO Medicaid study. The population brings state revenue through health insuring corporation (HIC) premium taxes and franchise fees, along with prescription drug rebates.
“As part of the federal Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Ohio’s Medicaid program receives rebates from drug manufacturers in exchange for the program’s coverage of most of the manufacturer’s drugs,” the HPIO wrote. “These rebates offset the costs of most outpatient prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid patients.”
Money the state receives from drug rebates goes back into the Medicaid budget to support spending, according to the study.
Along with drops in economic health for the state, the loss of the Medicaid expansion group could negatively impact the state’s overall health, dropping the number of insured Ohioans. The institute’s research said Ohio’s uninsured rate “would potentially increase by 80%” in fiscal year 2026 without the existence of Medicaid expansion.
Those in the expansion group can include students, Ohioans with chronic health conditions, and older residents. Almost 50% of the Ohioans covered under the Medicaid expansion are among the state’s workforce, according to the Center for Community Solutions.
If the Medicaid expansion remained as it is now, the policy institute found Ohio would get more than $42 billion from the federal government over five years to fund the population in that expansion.
“The state would have to raise considerable revenue to be able to fill the gap that elimination of expansion would leave,” the study stated.

(Photo by Morgan Trau.)Ohio is “weak” on policies to strengthen elementary teachers’ math instruction, according to a new report by the National Council on Teacher Quality.
Ohio is one of 25 states that received a “weak” rating by the NCTQ report that was released Tuesday. Only Alabama received a strong rating and seven states earned an unacceptable rating — Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, and New Hampshire, according to the report.

The states earned their ratings based on these five policies — 

 Set specific, detailed math standards for teacher preparation programs. 
 Review teacher preparation programs to ensure they are providing robust math instruction. 
 Adopt a strong elementary math licensure test. 
 Require districts to select high-quality math curricula and support skillful implementation.
 Provide professional learning and ongoing support for teachers to sustain effective math instruction.

A weak rating means a state has some of those policies in place, but not all. Ohio was strong in teacher preparation programs and received a moderate ranking in having a strong elementary math licensure program, according to the report.
“Ohio’s made significant investments in professional learning for teachers in reading, but much fewer investments in financially supporting professional learning in math instruction,” said NCTQ President Heather Peske.
This past school year was the first year Ohio school districts were required to teach the science of reading curriculum, which is based on decades of research that shows how the human brain learns to read and incorporates phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. 
Some of the Ohio’s 2023 two-year budget went toward the science of reading — $86 million for educator professional development, $64 million for curriculum and instructional materials, and $18 million for literacy coaches. 
“You can do two things at once,” Peske said. “It’s really important to kids that they have strong reading instruction and strong math instruction, so it’s high time that Ohio focused on improving math instruction, especially at the elementary level.”
Student math scores predict future earnings better than reading scores, Peske said. 
“Strong math skills add up to better reading scores, stronger college readiness, and eventually even higher earnings for students,” she said. 
Ohio math scores are below pre-pandemic levels, according to the Nation’s 2024 Report Card. Approximately 235,000 fourth-graders from 6,100 schools and 230,000 eighth-graders from 5,400 schools participated in the 2024 math and reading assessments between January and March of last year. 
In Ohio, the average fourth-grade math score was 239, two points higher than the national average and one point higher than the state’s fourth grade math scores in 2022. The scale for NAEP scores is 0-500. 
The state’s average eighth-grade math score was 279, seven points higher than the national average and three points higher than the state’s 2022 test. 
“If we want to improve student math outcomes, we really need to better prepare and support elementary teachers in their math instruction,” Peske said. 
Ohio lawmakers are paying attention to student math scores. Ohio Senate Bill 19 would require school districts or individual schools to come up with a math achievement improvement plan if they don’t have at least 52% of students receive a proficient score in math comprehension. 
The bill has had three hearings so far in the Senate Education Committee.

Stock photo from Getty Images.Ohio utility regulators are gearing up for hearings on FirstEnergy’s role in the House Bill 6 scandal. Former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder is behind bars — although seeking a presidential pardon — for overseeing the largest corruption case in state history.
FirstEnergy funneled about $60 million to a dark money group controlled by Householder. The former speaker used that money to secure his own leadership position and influence passage of HB 6. The measure propped up a pair of nuclear plants and aging coal facilities by tacking a rider onto consumers’ monthly bills.
But that’s just the broad strokes. Nearly five years on from Householder’s indictment, questions remain about how exactly the scheme unfolded and where FirstEnergy officials got the money for it. Half a dozen former FirstEnergy officials in government affairs and c-suite positions are set to testify in a PUCO hearing next week. Four of them previously pled the Fifth and have since received immunity from a Franklin County judge.
At the heart of the case, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel wants to demonstrate whether FirstEnergy used the money it got from average consumers to bribe state officials.
What to expect
In January, former FirstEnergy executives Charles “Chuck” Jones and Michael Dowling were indicted on federal racketeering charges. Last year, state officials filed more than 40 charges against the executives as well as the man they bribed, former PUCO chairman Sam Randazzo. Last week, a judge in Summit County dismissed theft charges against Jones and Dowling, but they still face several other state criminal charges.
The PUCO proceedings focus on the employees one rung below Jones and Dowling, attempting to show how money moved in the scheme by gathering testimony from the foot soldiers who answered to FirstEnergy’s leadership.
Four of the witnesses previously refused to testify, citing their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. A Franklin County judge ordered them to testify and granted them “the broadest possible immunity” from prosecution.
Ohio indictments provide a better picture of squalid relationships that spurred massive scandal

The PUCO will also hear from Steven Strah, the former CFO who took over FirstEnergy following Jones’ ouster, and Robert Reffner, the company’s chief legal officer at the time of the scandal.
The Ohio Consumers’ Counsel subpoenas argue consumers were wrongly charged more than $6.6 million, and another $7.4 million was incorrectly listed as a capital expenditure. Compelling testimony, the filings argue, “will help establish how and why FirstEnergy improperly misallocated House Bill 6 costs to the FirstEnergy Utilities.”
“We look forward to getting answers for FirstEnergy consumers and holding FirstEnergy accountable,” Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis said in a statement. “Justice for FirstEnergy consumers is long overdue.”
Just over a month ago, state lawmakers voted to put an end to the House Bill 6 rider tacked on to ratepayers’ monthly bills. The legislation won’t take effect until August. Democrats in the Ohio House, meanwhile, argue the door remains open for next House Bill 6.
“No law in Ohio prevented this scandal,” state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, argued at a press conference last month. “And since, not one law has even remotely been truly attempted to fix this massive injustice.”
Sweeney, and state Reps. Chris Glassburn, D-North Olmsted, Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, and Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, have filed bills that would require contribution disclosures to or so-called dark money groups, institute penalties for undermining signature gathering campaigns and bar companies that make contributions from receiving state contracts.
The PUCO will hold a procedural hearing this morning, with the evidentiary portion of the case beginning next week, on June 10. The hearings themselves will likely take several days.

U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kansas
Me neither, Sen. Dole.
But they’re at it again. Last year, Republicans on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, with the support of Kansas Rep. Tracey Mann, wrote a Farm Bill. It went nowhere, not even a vote in the full House of Representatives. The Senate Ag Committee didn’t even write a bill. Congress missed its second deadline to extend the 2018 Farm Bill.
Why? That bill destroyed the coalition that has united to pass every farm bill of the last 50 years. Farm interests join supporters of food assistance programs to back one comprehensive piece of legislation. Nutrition advocates revolted against the draconian cuts in food stamps — now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP — and farmers don’t have the votes by themselves to pass a Farm Bill in the House.
With the extension of the extension ending in just four months Republicans are running the same play and running scared. They have raided SNAP of $60 billion for new farm subsidies, plus another $230 billion for tax cuts for the wealthy. Low-income families lose $5, with $1 going into a farmer’s pocket and $4 into a rich taxpayer’s bank account. The House Agriculture Committee passed it on a party-line vote; the Republican Mann voted yes while Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids voted no.
Two strikes are enough. Farm lawmakers are using money dedicated to putting food on hungry families’ tables like a bottomless checkbook — a private cookie jar — to increase subsidies to millionaire farmers. Now that the House has passed pieces of the Farm Bill as part of President Trump’s tax cut package (the Kansas delegation split along party lines), the Senate is taking a look. Then, the House should rewrite its rules to take food stamps and nutrition assistance, along with overseas food aid, out of the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee.
It’s probably time to move SNAP out of the USDA, for good measure.
Aggies justify the monstrous boost in spending as necessary to protect farmers from “dire circumstances.” But maybe the circumstances wouldn’t be so dire if farmers were not facing a trade war triggered by Trump’s tariffs. Remember Trump Trade War I and the $20 billion shelled out to make up for that fiasco?
Instead of preventing a replay, Congress went along. Kansas Republicans in the House voted to support Trump Trade War II when they voted for a provision preventing the House from even considering legislation to end the tariffs. Kansas Sens. Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran twice voted against a measure in their chamber that would have done the same.
They saying they’re simply putting “farm back into the Farm Bill,” a quaint description of shoehorning $60 billion in new farm payments into one catch-all piece of legislation. The proposal includes every legislative cat and dog the president and the Republicans can corral — from tax breaks for millionaires to more money to carry out the Trump draconian, damn-due-process mass deportation scheme. (If anyone thinks Congress is taking its responsibilities seriously, look at the sophomoric title its backers gave the bill-a name I refuse to dignify by repeating.)
Lawmakers claim they’re simply asking SNAP recipients to work in exchange for benefits. That sounds reasonable. Democrats favor work too, along with ensuring workers are paid a living wage. However, there is little evidence the requirements the House champions will themselves work. Most research is ambiguous, but it suggests that paperwork and reporting requirements will deter prospective workers.
Moreover, the bill’s transfer of administrative costs to states may lead to even more cuts in cuts in assistance.
If you’re thinking how catchy the “putting the farm back into the Farm Bill” mantra sounds, consider: In the past 10 years, the top three Kansas farm program recipients cashed checks from Uncle Sam totaling more than $30 million. That doesn’t count payments they earned last year and their share of the $10 billion in emergency payments Congress appropriated in December.
The average Kansas SNAP beneficiary receives a little more than $200 per month, and none of them can “eat tariffs” to survive. Meanwhile, the House’s new Farm Bill will boost by $30,000 the limit on a single farmer’s payments. That’s not the maximum amount — that’s just the increase in the maximum amount.
Kansas representatives and senators have never shied from supporting farm spending. It’s Kansas Politics 101. Despite partisan differences, it’s one thing Sens. Dole, Kassebaum and Roberts and Reps. Glickman, Keys, Sebelius and Slattery all had in common. They also all supported a sound, effective, amply funded food and nutrition safety net.

It was a rhetorical question. Kelly DuFour, the voting and elections manager at Common Cause Ohio, knew the proposed legislation wasn’t drafted as a solution to any glaring flaw in Ohio elections. 
So did the overflow crowd hastily assembled in the middle of a day (with little advance notice from the committee) to register overwhelming opposition to SB 153. 
So did the two GOP state senators who co-sponsored the legislation, Bowling Green Republican Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner of Delaware. They see the same data on statewide voting the public does. They know rampant voter fraud or noncitizens casting ballots en masse is not an Ohio problem.  
They know the checks and balances that scrupulously safeguard the administration of free and fair elections in the state routinely produce problem-free elections with 99.9% accuracy. 
They ought to know the 2020 presidential election was not stolen in Ohio from the sore loser whose lies led to a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Gavarone and Brenner also ought to know that there is not a scintilla of evidence that noncitizens are brazenly violating federal and state election laws at the polls.  
Ohio officials who combed through years of voting records in the state were able to identify only six possible noncitizens — one of whom was dead — who cast ballots out of 8 million registered voters between 2008 and 2020. 
A Brennan Center analysis concluded that “even if every one of those cases is proven, that’s less than one noncitizen vote in a million in any given election.” Even Ohio’s partisan hack/elections chief Frank LaRose acknowledged the infinitesimal percentage of potential voting cases involving noncitizens were probably due to mistakes, i.e., being wrongly registered, and not intentional.
Why would noncitizens, who risk much to live free, jeopardize everything with nefarious subterfuge at the polls? They wouldn’t and don’t. 
Proof is the handful of supposed infractions flagged over a 12-year period in Ohio that will likely never rise to prosecutable offenses. The reality is Buckeye elections have been laudably conducted with meticulous rigor to diligently ferret out any suspected discrepancies or irregularities. 
County boards of election across Ohio report that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent in the state — no noncitizens voting, no voter impersonation, no drop box sabotage. 
But that hasn’t stopped the Ohio Senate’s most prolific sponsor of anti-voting legislation from proposing ever-restrictive solutions to nonexistent election problems.

Gavarone is a career climber who jumped on the Trump propaganda train about rigged elections that weren’t and never looked back. After the Big Lie took hold among MAGA faithful, she and other Trumpian opportunists amplified the deception to advance voter suppression measures in state and federal government. 
The senate majority floor leader joined Republicans in statehouses across the country to exploit the unfounded doubt seeded by Trump and his GOP toadies to delegitimize democratic elections long considered the envy of the world. 
Like other MAGA Republicans angling for attention, Gavarone used the Republican-planted mistrust over (baseless) election fraud rhetoric with a spate of bills, including one that produced the strictest voter ID law in the nation and led to the current Senate Bill 153, arguably her most extreme effort yet to limit voting in Ohio.
As a second term senator, Gavarone religiously parrots her party’s talking points about “working to improve the integrity and confidence of Ohio’s elections” as though she really believes them and the charade she adopted in the wake of Trump’s lawless attempt to overturn a legitimate election. 
Her hollow justifications for manipulating the phantom menace of pervasive voter fraud to enact severe voting restrictions that purportedly strengthen “trust and integrity in our institutions” are a parody of trust and integrity. 
But her latest handiwork, with co-sponsor Brenner, is a manifest assault on the voting rights of all Ohio voters. 
It mirrors the travesty passed by U.S. House Republicans — the so-called Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act or SAVE Act — that would severely restrict voting access by making it harder for all American citizens and registered voters to cast a ballot. They’d have to provide documentary proof of citizenship in person to register or update their voter registrations for federal elections. 
Convenient registration options by mail, online, at the BMV, and community options would be eliminated, forcing voters to register only at county election boards. 
The SAVE Act (which saves no one) would disproportionately impact women who’ve changed their names, rural residents, older Americans, Black voters, military personnel, people with disabilities, and students. 
Gavarone’s SB 153 creates the same hoops for those voters and worse. It bans ballot drop boxes so “people don’t have the ability to sabotage our elections” — despite zero drop box threats in the state. It hobbles direct democracy with new barriers for statewide citizen initiatives and referendum campaigns. It creates impossible bureaucratic and financial burdens on county boards of election.
What made-up election problem is Ohio Senate Bill 153 is trying to solve? None. “It’s about keeping people who don’t agree with the people in power from voting,” wrote an alarmed voting advocate in Gavarone’s hometown. Nailed it.

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
 ‘I’d probably close the doors’

The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.

For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
‘The lifeblood of the community’: States invest to save rural grocery stores

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
Federal cuts affect regional food access; more uncertainty to come

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
 ‘It’s time to sound the alarm’

Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

Early voting began May 27 and will end June 13. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)For the first time since 2020, Georgia voters have a chance to decide who will represent them on the Public Service Commission. This delayed election comes after a lawsuit challenged the statewide elections used to elect commissioners, arguing it diluted the voting strength of Black voters.
Despite each commissioner hailing from a specific geographic district in Georgia, voters across the state are eligible to vote for each member. This year, District 2 and 3 seats are on the ballot. The 2025 election comes as commissioners face criticism for signing off rising rates for Georgia Power customers. After June’s primary election, winners will advance to the general election in November that will coincide with municipal elections across the state.
With early voting already in full swing, about 18,000 people have cast a ballot as of Monday, according to the Secretary of State’s data hub.
 When is the election?


The primary election will take place on June 17. Early voting began May 27 and will end June 13. If a candidate does not receive at least 50% of the vote in the primary, a runoff election will be held on July 15.
Voters can check their registration status, polling information and sample ballots on the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page.
What is the Georgia Public Service Commission?
The PSC is a five-member commission that is tasked with regulating electric, telecommunication and natural gas services. 
Why is this an important election for voters?
The commissioners’ decisions and outcomes directly affect how much people in Georgia pay for necessary utility services. Their website points out that “very few governmental agencies have as much impact on peoples’ lives as the PSC.”
Despite this impact, PSC elections tend to have low visibility and voter turnout across Georgia. University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock attributes that partly to limited campaign capability.
“I’ve often said that most Georgians [are] probably not fully aware we have a public service commission, don’t know that it has five members, and couldn’t name a single one of them,” Bullock said.
With limited campaign finances and awareness, it can be tough for candidates to reach voters. As a political scientist, Bullock said he often uses the PSC as an example when trying to identify what partisan division exists in the state. He says that when people vote for the PSC election with limited knowledge they tend to fall back on their preferred party.
“Georgia is still more Republican than Democratic, so I think ultimately, probably the incumbent Republicans are going to win,” Bullock said. “It also helps that once we get to the general election ballot, it’ll have the ‘I’ beside their name, indicating they are the incumbents.”
 What will my ballot look like?


In District 2, incumbent Commissioner Tim Echols is running for re-election. If elected, this would mark the beginning of his third term as a commissioner. Echols will face Lee Muns on the Republican ballot. Alicia M. Johnson is running uncontested on the Democratic ballot. District 2 goes as far north as Hart County and as far south as Savannah. 
In District 3, which includes Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties, incumbent Commissioner Fitz Johnson is the sole candidate on the Republican ballot this month. Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Johnson to the seat in 2021.
All the action in this race is on the Democratic side right now, with four candidates trying to clinch the nomination. 
Daniel Blackman, who served as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Southeast regional administrator during the Biden administration, is fighting to remain a candidate. Blackman was disqualified after Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger agreed with an administrative court judge that he did not have the adequate residency qualifications to run. A Fulton County Superior Court judge granted an injunction allowing Blackman to remain on the ballot for now. A hearing on Blackman’s appeal is set for June 10. 
Other Democratic candidates include Peter Hubbard, who is the founder of the clean nonprofit Center for Energy Solutions, former utility executive Robert Jones and Keisha Sean Waites, who is a former Atlanta City Council member and ex-state representative.
Why are there separate ballots for the PSC primary election?
The PSC primary is a partisan election and requires voters to choose a Democratic or Republican ballot. The primary election will not occur at the same time as any municipal elections. This will not be true for the general election. For cities with municipal general elections also occurring on Nov. 4, different ballots will be offered for each election.
The partisan nature of the primary election often contributes to low voter turnout. 
“Many people do not turn out for primaries,” said Travis Doss, president of the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials and Richmond County’s election director. “They do not feel that they have an affiliation with a party, so there’s always confusion when it comes to primaries. People argue with us that they should be able to vote for both sets of candidates.”
This was true for a Richmond County woman who recently came in ready to cast her vote but ended up telling Doss that she would not be picking a party. 
Why is this an irregular election cycle? 
A 2020 lawsuit brought forth by Black voters in Atlanta delayed years of PSC elections and challenged the electoral process that allows statewide voters to elect district-specific commissioners. Plaintiffs argued that this is a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and dilutes the voting power of Black Georgians. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately decided not to hear the case, and the at-large method of electing commissioners remains in place. 
 What are some issues surrounding the current PSC?

Critics and consumer watch groups have continued to express concerns over rate prices, growing electricity demands and the spread of data centers. According to previous Georgia Recorder reporting, the average Georgia Power residential customer pays about $43 more to cover base electric rate increases, recover excess fuel expenses, and cover the cost of completing two new nuclear power generators at Plant Vogtle.
PSC staff and Georgia Power reached a proposed agreement to “freeze” base electric rates from 2026 to 2028.  
Critics have pointed out that Georgia Power customers could still see an increase on their utility bill after the approval of funds for storm damage and fuel recovery expenses.

“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
 ‘It’s time to sound the alarm’

Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown warned in mid-April that the Trump administration’s actions put the country near the “precipice of a constitutional crisis.”
His comments alongside fellow state attorneys general in Colorado came shortly after the White House defied court orders to return a Maryland man the federal government had wrongfully sent to El Salvador under the president’s immigration crackdown. 
Six weeks later, Brown shies away from using that term, but says President Donald Trump’s disregard for some court rulings, especially in immigration cases, has made the circumstances around how he is wielding executive power “much more dangerous.”
“Whether or not we’re in a constitutional crisis, you know, that’s somewhat of an academic debate,” the Democratic attorney general told reporters before a town hall Monday alongside his counterparts from Oregon and California. “In my mind, we are in a crisis. Call it what you want.”
It’s been a whirlwind few months for Brown, who took office in January. Later that month, the day after Trump took office, Brown sued over the president’s executive order seeking to restrict birthright citizenship. 
Since then, he’s filed 19 more lawsuits, over threats to gender-affirming care, election systems and cuts to a host of federal agencies and funding opportunities. Some of that litigation is playing out in federal courtrooms in Seattle.
Those cases have led to court orders blocking Trump’s actions, but are not fully settled.
Oregon and California are plaintiffs in even more lawsuits than Washington.
Brown guaranteed more litigation to come.
At Monday’s event in Seattle, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield recalled a meeting he had with his governor, Tina Kotek, in January. She didn’t want him to be the next Bob Ferguson, who during Trump’s first term served as Washington attorney general and brought dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration. This raised Ferguson’s profile before he was elected governor last year. 
“During the first Trump presidency, I kept looking on the news all the time, and I kept seeing Bob Ferguson every single day,” Kotek told Rayfield. “You’re not going to do that to me, are you?”
Rayfield told the crowd, “I stand here in Washington to tell you I am the Oregon version of Bob Ferguson.”
At the town hall, the trio of western states’ top legal officials heard concerns from locals about cut public health funding, increasingly brazen immigration enforcement, disinvestment in climate policy, and congressional attacks on reproductive health care.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that it’s a heavy time for people opposed to Trump. 
”We shouldn’t feel hopeless, because we’re not helpless,” he added. “We have power.”
Where things stand
Last month, Brown was in Washington, D.C., when the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments over challenges to Trump’s order seeking to restrict birthright citizenship. The arguments focused on the legal issue of lower court orders blocking actions nationwide, versus only in the places from which plaintiffs are suing. The justices haven’t yet ruled on the matter.
Meanwhile, Brown’s office will be in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle on Wednesday, arguing to maintain such a preliminary injunction indefinitely stopping the federal government from implementing the birthright citizenship order. 
The attorney general has also been at the forefront of defending so-called “sanctuary” policies that states and cities have enacted to stop local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Brown said his lawsuit against an eastern Washington county that aided immigration agents was “the most difficult case that I have had to bring.”
Last week, the Trump administration included Washington, about three dozen of the state’s counties and a handful of cities on a nationwide list of sanctuary jurisdictions that it feels hinder the work of immigration enforcement. Listed on the inventory was the nonexistent “Swinomish County.” The president has threatened to withhold federal funding from these state and local governments.
Over the weekend, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security took down the list’s webpage amid pushback from police officials.
In a call Monday, Brown and other attorneys general laughed over the administration’s sloppiness.
“We will survive Donald Trump,” Brown said. Still, he felt the need to knock on wood after saying Trump wouldn’t be on the ballot in 2028.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 04:21:35+00:00,CT Mirror,CT budget: House OKs $55.8B spending plan investing in children,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/ct-budget-house-vote/,"The House adopted a budget that scales back increases to health care providers, reforms ‘fiscal guardrails’ and invests in children.","This story has been updated.
The state House of Representatives adopted a $55.8 billion two-year budget early Tuesday that invests in child care and K-12 education, provides a $250 tax cut to working poor families and increases hospital taxes in hopes of securing more federal Medicaid grants before Washington caps that program.
The biennial plan, which the Senate is expected to debate Tuesday, increases payments to health care providers who treat the poor but offers a more modest boost than legislative leaders had pledged. Similarly, the budget includes no general increase next fiscal year for nonprofit social service agencies, though it features a $76 million cost-of-living hike in 2026-27. That delayed increase comes with an asterisk, though, since many expect Connecticut’s fiscal picture to change dramatically before then due to shrinking federal aid.
Corporations would pay an extra $213 million in taxes over the next two years combined due to changes in income reporting and other rules. And a corporate tax surcharge that was supposed to expire would be extended to 2028, raising another $128 million over the coming biennium.
The budget, which would spend $27.2 billion next fiscal year and $28.6 billion in 2026-27, would curb aggressive state spending controls. That means $1.2 billion that would have gone toward reducing pension debt over the coming biennium would be redirected into the General Fund. 
The Democratic-controlled House voted 99-49, largely along party lines, to approve the budget shortly after midnight following a debate that lasted more than seven hours. Because of those changes to state budget caps, the package had to be approved by a three-fifths margin, which requires a minimum of 91 positive votes in the 151-member House.
The plan also relies on borrowing and several accounting maneuvers to ensure the plan stays under the constitutional spending cap by a narrow $1 million — 1/240th of 1% of the General Fund — in the first fiscal year and by $75 million in the second.
“While we are unable to fund everything we’d like to fund, we do invest in the things that matter to people,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “We are proceeding with a budget that values the health and well-being of families, that values the education and early childhood education, that values the needs of children with special needs, that values child care.”
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the plan crafted by Democratic legislative leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration subverts the spending cap — which is supposed to keep budget growth in line with household income and inflation — and other controls that have added $4 billion to reserves and reduced $8.6 billion in pension debt since 2017.
“It rises to the level of deception and promotion only second to P.T. Barnum,” Candelora said during his pre-session press conference. “This budget eviscerates all of our ‘fiscal guardrails.’”
‘The single-greatest investment in children that I have ever seen’
But increasing numbers of Democratic legislators and advocates for various programs have argued in recent years that these budget controls excessively weaken education, health care, social services and other core programs.
Those “guardrails” were last fixed in 2017 and designed to end a string of budget deficits and prevent future tax hikes after big increases were ordered in 2015, 2011 and 2009.
But they’ve gone far beyond that, capturing an average of $1.8 billion per year since 2017. Analysts project a $2.4 billion surplus, equal to 10% of the General Fund, for this fiscal year, which ends June 30.
Connecticut entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, a burden created by more than 70 years of inadequate savings before 2011. And critics say one generation cannot pay off the pension debt created by three.
“It’s important that we all realize that change is inevitable,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, longtime co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. State officials have used $2.8 billion in emergency federal pandemic grants, which could be spent outside normal budget rules, to support core programs since 2021. But those funds have been exhausted.

And while this dynamic has blocked legislators from bolstering many programs, the new biennial package makes “the single-greatest investment in children that I have ever seen,” Walker said.
That involves taking about $220 million from this fiscal year’s surplus and creating a new fund — also outside the traditional budget and spending cap — to fund future increases in early childhood development programs.
The new budget continues ongoing efforts to bolster the Education Cost Sharing program, the chief grant to support K-12 school districts’ operating costs. ECS payments would grow by $90 million next fiscal year. That funding would ensure no district would receive less money than it got this year, even though a legislative formula had called for 81 communities to lose aid in 2025-26.
Legislators from both parties ordered an extra $40 million in special education grants to local districts earlier this winter to mitigate a funding crisis in that program.
The new budget continues that $40 million hike and adds another $30 million for special education in each of the next two fiscal years.
“This budget shows that we’re delivering real impactful change where it counts,” said Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London.
No child tax credit for middle class; poor families get $250 relief
Democratic legislators acknowledged in April that they likely would not approve the full $600-per-child income tax cut many lawmakers endorsed for low- and middle-income households. Analysts estimate that would cost the state more than $300 million per year.
But as recently as two weeks ago, leaders still hoped to provide hundreds of thousands of income-eligible households with income tax relief equal to $150 per child.
That proposal, which would have cost about $80 million per year, also was deemed too expensive this past week, especially given the potential for eroding aid from Washington.
Democratic lawmakers settled on a $250 increase in an existing income tax credit for Connecticut’s working poor — the Earned Income Tax Credit — but only for those filers that have children or other dependents. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Saturday the payment likely would be $200 total for eligible households, regardless of how many dependents they would have. But leaders later adjusted that relief to $250, a benefit that will cost the state $35.5 million per year.
Connecticut has about 195,000 households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the working poor cover basic needs and increase savings. The state credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts. 
Most EITC-eligible households have children and earn between $50,000 and $63,000 per year.
State Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, one of the legislature’s most vocal advocates for the broader child tax credit, nonetheless praised the $250 tax relief for working poor families as a step forward.
“There is immediate relief for many people in our towns who are most vulnerable … to pay for the food, to pay for the housing, to pay for that needed health care,”  she said.
Requests for health care, social services scaled back
The budget also increases the Medicaid rates paid to doctors and other providers who treat Connecticut’s poor. But the plan is much smaller than legislative leaders proposed shortly after the 2025 session began in January.
The budget allocates $15 million to boost rates for most providers next fiscal year. The extra funding would grow to $45 million in 2026-27.
Connecticut hasn’t comprehensively adjusted its provider rates since 2007, a problem that critics say has left many poor adults and children on HUSKY — the state’s Medicaid-funded insurance program — unable to find physicians willing to treat them.
Leaders initially proposed spending an extra $300 million in payments to providers by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
The hundreds of community-based nonprofits that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to people with developmental disabilities or facing mental health or addiction issues also had to settle for less.
They sought $264 million extra in the new budget. The industry insists it misses out on hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t kept pace with inflation for decades.
Legislators didn’t order any general rate hike for nonprofits in 2025-26, but they are slated to get $76 million more in the second year of the plan. 
The biennial package also includes $34 million in the first year and $66 million in the second year for nonprofits that run group homes for residents with developmental disabilities. 
But the funds for those nonprofits must be used to increase caregivers’ wages. 
The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed last month to suspend planned strikes at more than 190 group homes and 51 nursing homes after Lamont pledged to boost funding for caregivers in these two service areas.
Lawmakers also included an extra $30 million in the second year of the new budget specifically to bolster nonprofits serving clients with mental health and addiction issues or providing counseling to formerly incarcerated people reentering society.
“The budget is not everything we requested, but in the context of this year’s discussions about budget restrictions, we are grateful for their choice to support programs that will improve thousands of lives and even save some,” said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance.
Gambling on a hospital provider tax increase
Hospitals were unhappy with the new budget, arguing it makes dangerous assumptions and lacks clear details on what the state would do to the industry.
The plan asks hospitals, starting in 2026-27, to pay an extra $375 million per year in taxes.
That doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing for the industry. Connecticut has an unusual tax on hospitals that currently helps both sides. 
It already involves collecting more than $800 million annually from hospitals and redistributing those funds back to those facilities. This back-and-forth arrangement, which most states employ, helps Connecticut qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars yearly in federal Medicaid reimbursements, which it also shares with hospitals.
Lamont proposed back in February increasing the tax by $140 million per year and redistributing those funds back to facilities, estimating it would increase federal Medicaid payments to Connecticut by $94 million. The state would be the chief beneficiary of this bounty, but hospitals also would come out $10 million ahead under the governor’s proposal.
But what if Congress caps this arrangement or reduces the amount states can receive?
State officials have been bracing for months for big cuts in Medicaid payments from Washington as the Republican-led Congress seeks to slash federal spending to save $880 billion over the next decade.

State Comptroller Sean Scanlon, whom Lamont asked to negotiate details of a provider tax hike with the Connecticut Hospital Association, said Monday that the state’s best option is to try to get more from Washington before the door is shut.
“People in our position in every state capitol in America would be fools not to have a conversation about how we might work with this,” he said.
But under the plan, that tax hike is up to $375 million. Between 2012 and 2018, under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, the state reneged on what it pledged to return to hospitals, prompting an industry lawsuit. It would be settled when Lamont took office in 2019, but hospital officials remain wary.
Further complicating matters, state officials still hadn’t shared any details by Monday evening with the hospital association showing how much each facility might gain if Connecticut secures extra Medicaid funds or what would happen if the state does not.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said “it is our intention to ensure that hospitals are no worse off than they currently are under this tax. We will be discussing plans further with them over the next year.”
But industry officials wanted hard numbers.
“We have made it very clear that we have not signed off on the tax increase contained in the budget or the comptroller’s plan to reduce payments to hospitals as drafted in the budget bill,” the hospital association wrote in a statement. “The state has provided no other estimates, runs, or numbers related to how hospital Medicaid reimbursement would change.”
Connecticut has budgetary safety nets to protect state and hospital finances if Washington caps the provider tax system.
Besides a record-setting $4.1 billion rainy day fund, Connecticut also has a savings program that’s expected to capture more than $700 million in income and business tax receipts next fiscal year and more than $650 million in 2026-27.
Reforming excessive savings programs or risking fiscal stability?
Republicans noted that Connecticut’s safety net is getting smaller quickly.
The savings program that captures income and business tax receipts had been projected to collect $1.3 billion in 2025-26 and $1.25 billion in the second year of the biennium.
Lamont, who has been reluctant to adjust the state’s budget caps, compromised with his fellow Democrats in the legislature and agreed to scale these back to bolster other programs.
The new budget also includes several maneuvers to circumvent the constitutional spending cap.
For example, majority Democrats and Lamont both planned to underfund contractually required health care benefits for retired state workers by about $230 million over the next two fiscal years. Scanlon said he hopes to mitigate that gap by negotiating savings with insurance providers, but any remaining deficit would be taken from the retiree health care trust — meaning the cost, plus interest, would be covered by future taxpayers.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, couldn’t hide her frustrations about learning a last-minute adjustment to new budget effectively raids that health care trust by another $7 million.

Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, the ranking House Republican on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, chastised Democrats for not working harder to curb spending, given clear signals from Washington that Congress is asking states to get by with less aid.
“Instead of looking for savings in our budget,” he said, “we’re looking for new revenue. That is not a sustainable way to run a state.”
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, offered an amendment to remove funding that supports health care for undocumented residents and transfer the resources, about $58 million per year, into special education grants for cities and towns.
“It comes down to what you want to be a beacon for,” Fishbein said. “I would like to be a beacon for funding for special education for our children in this state. If you want to be a beacon for illegal alien health care, you know, then you vote down this amendment.”
Rep. Geraldo Reyes, a Waterbury Democrat, urged Fishbein to revise his language and refer to those residents as “undocumented.”
“They are human beings, just like everybody in this chamber,” Reyes said. “They do live here in Connecticut with us. They contribute a great deal to this state, to this economy.”
“This is a budget that is based on values … of being accepting, of being understanding, of seeing people who are undocumented as being worthy of respect, as being worthy of health care,” Rojas said.
The House rejected the amendment in a 99-46 vote along party lines.
Republicans also objected to business tax hikes in the plan.
Changes to the corporation tax would require companies to pay an extra $131 million next fiscal year and $81.4 million above current levels in 2026-27.
Connecticut also has placed surcharges on its corporation tax system for decades, often pushing back previously approved expiration dates. That happened again in the new budget.
A 10% surcharge set to expire was extended to 2028. This will force companies to pay $128 million over the next two years combined that they had been hoping to save.
As negotiations on this budget were wrapping up this past week, Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said “we’re just ignoring the spending cap when all is said and done and not making hard decisions” to cut spending.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the finance committee, said Democrats made difficult choices, balancing the needs of residents against the limits of the budget caps and vanishing federal aid.
“We cannot do everything in this budget,” she said. “We are in a moment of constraint.”
Public colleges universities must tap reserves
One area that legislators constrained involves public colleges and universities, which will be forced to tap their reserves over the next two fiscal years to mitigate program cuts and to avoid fee increases.
The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges, four regional universities and online Charter Oak State College, would receive $479 million next fiscal year and $485 million in 2026-27, appropriations that mirror the $479 million in traditional state funds the system received this fiscal year.
But Lamont and legislators also propped up CSCU spending this year with $140 million in emergency federal pandemic relief, which won’t be available in the coming biennium.
Still, legislators warned system administrators they likely would face a cut. The Connecticut Mirror reported in late March that the CSCU system entered this fiscal year with $611 million in reserves, an amount that represents more than half of its current operating budget.
The University of Connecticut and its Farmington-based health center had more modest reserves but still entered this fiscal year with $171 million and $297 million, respectively.
The new state budget would reduce overall aid next fiscal year by $58 million for UConn’s main campus in Storrs and its regional campuses and by $55 million for the health center. Their funding would drop in 2026-27 by another $15 million and $4 million, respectively.
Rep. Gregg Haddad, D-Mansfield, co-chairman of the legislature’s Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, supported the budget, but warned that inflation has been outstripping the growth in state funding for public colleges and universities for years. 
UConn and the CSCU system have ordered significant tuition and fees hikes in recent years, and tapping higher education reserves, he said, isn’t a long-term solution.
“We’re shifting the burden of funding our public institutions to students,” Haddad said, adding that leaves them with “greater debt, less opportunity and more risk. We need to do better.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0602_SR_Session_013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 01:00:20.190763

However, what happens when those in power find the light disruptive? Can they turn it off, leaving the water dark?
This question proves central to the case of Dilan Gohill, a student journalist at Stanford University. In 2024, Gohill entered a building to report on the pro-Palestinian protest. He did not chant slogans, vandalize property, or resist authorities. Yet, when police arrived, they arrested him along with the protesters. 

Ehsanullah Hadi
In determining the validity of Gohill’s arrest, one must address three key questions:

Do journalists deserve special legal protection?
Does intent matter?
Would criminalizing Gohill set a precedent that endangers press freedom?

No one, not police officers, politicians, or journalists, is above the law; however, certain roles sometimes require special legal protection. For example, police possess “qualified immunity to enforce laws” (NCSL). Journalists, tasked with holding power accountable, must be protected not with immunity, but from laws used to suppress reporting. 
In Houchins v. KQED (1978), the Supreme U.S. Court ruled that the press has no special right to restricted areas. Stanford may argue this precedent justifies Gohill’s arrest. However, Houchins does not state that reporting from within a restricted area, strips journalists of First Amendment protections when it relates to a public concern.

Does intent matter?

Yes, in Bartnicki v. Vopper (2001), the court ruled that journalists could publish illegally obtained recordings. This decision was a result of the court reasoning that the public’s right to know outweighs concerns about how information was acquired. Similarly, Gohill did not break in; he intended to report, not to participate. This strengthened his case, and importantly, the protest addressed both a matter of public concern and public significance.

Would criminalizing Gohill set a precedent that endangers press freedom?

Yes, governments have long used laws to suppress uncomfortable truths. In Jean v. Massachusetts State Police (2005), a journalist filmed police brutality, only for officers to raid her home and seize her footage. 
The Court ruled in her favor, recognizing that punishing journalists for exposing the truth threatens democracy. The First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press, and history has shown that when journalists uncover uncomfortable truths, those in power often find ways to suppress them. 
From the early days of the republic to landmark cases, such as New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), the press has repeatedly clashed with the government over its right to report without retaliation. If Gohill’s conviction stands, it sends a clear message. Journalists covering protests risk arrest simply for being present. 
In Bursey v. United States (1972), the Court ruled that press independence must be protected from government interference. If laws can erase the difference between reporting and activism, then journalists will self-censor out of fear, and the public will suffer. Individuals argue that granting journalist protection creates loopholes, and what stops activists from claiming to be reporters?
Journalism is not simply holding a press badge, it means gathering information in the public’s interest.
A lighthouse does not take sides, it reveals the dangers. Punishing Gohill’s reporting will deter journalists from covering protests, government misconduct, and abuse. Journalists are not above the law, but neither are police. Just as officers have immunity to enforce laws, journalists must be able to report without fear of suppression. 
If society allows the lighthouse to be shut down, the water will grow dark, not just for the journalists but for all of the public.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Repeal CT’s law that denies justice to injured inmates,Alexander Taubes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/03/repeal-connecticuts-law-that-denies-justice-to-injured-inmates/,No one should be denied access to justice because of a procedural rule that serves no constructive purpose.,"On November 8, 2022, Marvin Minter was pinned against a wall by a malfunctioning elevator door at the New Haven Correctional Center. The aging elevator, unserviced since 2020 despite numerous complaints, abruptly slammed shut and crushed Marvin’s arm while he was doing his prison job. A correctional officer rushed him to get medical care, but the damage was done —Marvin’s arm is now severely impaired. 
Connecticut’s sovereign immunity laws generally bar individuals from directly suing the state for negligence, unless the state grants permission. That permission typically comes from the state’s Claims Commissioner, an official who acts as a gatekeeper for lawsuits against the state. Because of this, Marvin, who was seriously injured by a faulty elevator while incarcerated, had to file a claim with the Claims Commissioner instead of going directly to court. In other words, he couldn’t simply sue the state agency responsible; he first had to ask the Claims Commissioner for approval to seek compensation.
Seeking some measure of justice, Marvin filed a claim with the Connecticut Claims Commissioner, aiming to hold the state accountable for its negligent maintenance of its elevator.  
The Claims Commissioner, taking the position of Attorney General William Tong, refused to even consider the merits of his claim. 
Why? 
Not because of any factual dispute or lack of evidence, but because of a cruel technicality. Under a 2016 state law, incarcerated individuals cannot file a claim with the Claims Commissioner until they have “exhausted administrative remedies” through the Department of Correction (DOC) internal prison grievance system. Marvin had not completed the prison’s internal grievance process before filing his claim, so the Claims Commissioner tossed it out without ever examining the evidence. 
A 2016 state law demands incarcerated people like Marvin try all administrative remedies (such as prison grievance procedures) before turning to the Claims Commissioner. The catch, however, is that the prison grievance system cannot award monetary damages for injuries. For someone seeking financial compensation for serious harm, filing a grievance is a dead end. Forcing Marvin to exhaust such a process is a classic Catch-22: he had to complete an entire grievance process—with deadlines, filings, and appeals—that could never give him the relief he needed, or else be denied the chance to have his claim heard at all.
This is not only factually absurd but also legally dubious. In fact, it directly contradicts a recent Superior Court ruling. In Mago v. Department of Correction (2024), Superior Court Judge Daniel Klau made it clear that while inmates do need to file internal grievances generally, they should not be required to do so when that process cannot provide the relief being sought – in that case, monetary compensation for injuries. 
This was common sense. Requiring exhaustion under such circumstances serves no meaningful purpose. It doesn’t advance any of the traditional goals of an exhaustion rule (like giving an agency a chance to fix a problem or reducing court case loads) when the agency has no power to grant the remedy in question. Instead, it simply slams the courthouse door on people with legitimate claims. Marvin’s case is just like Mago —the prison grievance system offered no chance of helping solve the problem, so why is the inmate required to pursue it?
Marvin’s case is not an isolated fluke — it exposes a systemic barrier that many incarcerated people face, especially people of color. Incarcerated individuals already struggle to navigate complex legal procedures. Prisons are not exactly conducive to filing paperwork: access to law libraries or legal counsel is severely limited, and strict deadlines and arcane rules can easily trip up even a trained attorney, let alone someone with limited education and likely no legal education. Language barriers frequently mean that prisoners with limited English proficiency cannot even understand the grievance instructions. Research shows that requirements like Connecticut’s create uniquely difficult hurdles for incarcerated people and these hurdles hit inmates of color the hardest. 
Connecticut, for all its progressive reputation, has one of the worst records of racial disparity in incarceration in the nation.

Black residents in Connecticut are incarcerated at a significantly higher rate — nearly ten times higher — than white residents. With a prison population so disproportionately Black and brown, any law that makes it harder for inmates to seek redress will inherently have a disproportionate impact on people of color. 
The 2016 exhaustion requirement is a prime example. It slams the courthouse door on incarcerated individuals, a group in which people of color are overrepresented due to systemic inequities. As the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation noted in a recent report, Black incarcerated victims are “less likely to bring a claim or recover damages because of the insurmountable barriers” imposed by stringent grievance requirements. This makes logical sense: when the process is made onerous to the point of futility, many people will simply give up, and injustices will go unaddressed. Connecticut should be working to eliminate such barriers, not entrench them in state law.
The legislature’s immediate step should be to address Marvin’s individual case. Under Connecticut law, the General Assembly can review the Claims Commissioner’s dismissal and decide to authorize Minter to pursue his claim in court or even order appropriate compensation for him directly. Lawmakers should do exactly that. Correcting this injustice will not only help Minter; it will also send a message that Connecticut stands on the side of justice rather than pointless bureaucracy. It would reaffirm our state’s commitment to the principle Judge Klau underscored in Mago v. DOC. 
Beyond the resolution of one man’s claim, Connecticut must confront the broader policy failure here. The 2016 administrative exhaustion requirement (now codified in Conn. Gen. Stat. § 4-165b) should be repealed or fundamentally amended. At minimum, the law must be rewritten to waive the exhaustion requirement when the internal prison process cannot provide the relief an inmate is seeking – for example, when only monetary damages will address the harm. There is simply no legitimate purpose served by forcing people through a grievance process that is guaranteed not to help them. All it does is create delay, deny justice, and generate unnecessary litigation expenses that ultimately waste taxpayer money.
Repealing this law would realign Connecticut with basic principles of justice and with our own stated values. It would not mean opening any floodgates of frivolous lawsuits – claims filed by inmates would still have to meet the same standards of merit as any other claim. It would only ensure that meritorious claims are not thrown out on a technicality before they’re even heard. It would ensure that when the state harms someone through negligence, our system provides a path to make that person whole, regardless of whether the person is incarcerated or not.
No one should be denied access to justice because of a procedural rule that serves no constructive purpose. It is time for the General Assembly to fix this mistake from 2016. Repeal the futile grievance -exhaustion requirement, and let people like Marvin Minter have their rightful day in court.
In the end, this is about more than one elevator accident or one inmate’s injury. It is about affirming that justice is for everyone. When our laws inadvertently shut out the most vulnerable from the justice they deserve, those laws must change. Connecticut’s leaders have the power to remove this barrier now. Remove the hurdle. Restore common sense and humanity to the system. In doing so, Connecticut will take a modest but meaningful step toward a more just and equitable future for all its people.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand Maryland’s decade-old ban on assault weapons, over the objections of four conservative justices who were ready to review a lower court’s defense of the law that they called “dubious” and “questionable.”
“I would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America. That question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR–15 owners throughout the country,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissenting opinion. “We have avoided deciding it for a full decade.”
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, noted that the high court’s decision not to hear an appeal of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal’s August ruling “does not mean that the Court agrees with a lower-court decision or that the issue is not worthy of review.” He predicted that, with similar cases currently working their way through other circuits, the court “should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next Term or two.”
But state officials welcomed Monday’s court decision.
“The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision today to leave Maryland’s assault weapons ban intact means that a critical law that prevents senseless and preventable deaths will remain in effect,” said a statement from Attorney General Anthony Brown, the target of the appeal.
“Our Office will continue to advocate for gun safety laws at the General Assembly and will defend Maryland’s common-sense gun reforms in court. We will do whatever we can to protect Marylanders from this horrific violence,” his statement said.
Federal appeals court upholds 2013 Maryland assault weapons ban

The high court on Monday also let stand Rhode Island’s 2022 ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines. Justices Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch were also ready to hear that case, which challenged a state law that prohibits the possession, sale or transfer of a firearm magazine that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
The 2013 Maryland law banning assault weapons came one year after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 26 people, including 20 children, were shot and killed. The shooter in that case used an AR-15-style rifle along with two handguns.
Gun-rights groups quickly challenged the law, and were given more ammunition by a string of recent Supreme Court rulings that vastly expanded protections under the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.
The 4th Circuit had previously upheld Maryland’s assault weapons ban. But the Supreme Court ordered the circuit court to reconsider that ruling in light of the high court’s 2022 decision in New York State Police & Rifle Association vs. Bruen — in which it the court said citizens did not need a “good and substantial” reason to carry a concealed weapon, the burden was on the government to prove the need for such a restriction.
A divided 4th Circuit ruled 10-5 last August that Maryland’s ban on assault weapons was constitutional, even in light of Bruen. Circuit Judge Harvie Wilkinson III wrote for the majority that weapons such as the AK-47, AR-15 and Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle, “fall outside the ambit of protection offered by the Second Amendment because, in essence, they are military-style weapons designed for sustained combat operations that are ill-suited and disproportionate to the need for self-defense.”
An appeal quickly followed, but the court’s refusal to hear the case means the 4th Circuit ruling stands. In his dissent, Thomas said the appellate court “placed the burden … on the wrong party.”
“The Fourth Circuit erred by requiring the challengers to prove that the Second Amendment protects their right to own AR–15s” when, in fact, the burden is on the government to justify its regulation of the weapons, he wrote.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said in a text message he is pleased the Supreme Court upheld the state’s law “for now.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Maryland’s Assault Weapons Ban is critical for keeping Marylanders safe. These dangerous weapons like the AR-15 are military-style weapons designed for combat and not protected by the Second Amendment,” Clippinger wrote. “As a country and as a State, we still have more work to do to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. But for today, we celebrate that the Supreme Court has allowed our Assault Weapons Ban to remain.”
Nine other states, Washington, D.C., and other cities have approved similar bans on assault weapons. But Kavanaugh wrote that an estimated 15 million to 20 million Americans “possess” an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.
“Meaning that the States such as Maryland that prohibit AR–15s are something of an outlier,” he wrote.
That’s why Mark Pennak, president of the gun rights group Maryland Shall Issue, said in a brief interview Monday he agrees with Kavanaugh that other pending cases will provide an opportunity.
“Because there are other cases that are pending out there involving the same issue … let the issue percolate some more which is standard Supreme Court practice,” he said. “This issue is not over.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC03528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-03 00:03:15.685436

(Photo courtesy maryland.gov.)Former Anne Arundel County Register of Wills Erica Griswold is appealing her May shoplifting conviction, according to court documents.
Griswold, 50, remains free on a $300 bond after appealing her conviction to the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County. No hearing date has been set.
Griswold was arrested in March for attempting to leave a Severn-area Walmart with more than $160 in sheets and curtains, according to a police report filed with the court.
Prosecutors in May told a judge during a bench trial that while using a self-service checkout area at the store, Griswold failed to ring up some items and used a tag from a lower-priced item to make it appear as if she was ringing up others, citing video from the store that appeared to support the accounts of police and a store security employee.
A defense attorney described Griswold’s checkout as “chaotic.” The attorney said Griswold at times scanned items and placed them on all sides of the register and on the floor. Her attorney argued some were placed in a second empty cart provided by a store employee who was, at times, attempting to assist Griswold.

	During her own testimony, Griswold claimed she was rushing out of the store because of a call about an uncle who had just been admitted to the hospital. Under cross-examination, she told prosecutors that the call came just as she arrived at the self-checkout lane.
Video of the area did not show a phone call. Neither Griswold nor her attorney offered evidence of a call or a hospital admission.
Anne Arundel District Court Judge Shaem Spencer rejected Griswold’s explanation. As he watched a 21-minute store surveillance video showing Griswold completing four separate transactions, Spencer described in open court what he saw — Griswold scanning items the judge said he believed were lower cost. He said Griswold “concealed” other unscanned items or moved more expensive items into her cart.
Spencer sentenced Griswold to six months in jail, but suspended that sentence and tacked on 3 years of supervised probation.
Griswold was already serving a sentence of unsupervised probation stemming from a June 2024 guilty plea to misconduct in office, after she was charged with stealing $6,600 in estate taxes paid to her office when she served as Anne Arundel County register of wills.
As a result of the plea, Griswold was forced out of office. She was sentenced to 18 months in jail. The judge suspended that sentence and ordered Griswold to serve two years of supervised probation.
If her latest conviction stands, Griswold could face potential repercussions for violating her probation in the first case. No hearing has been set for a new trial for Griswold in the shoplifting case.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-03 02:33:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Legislation promising modest relief on CT electric bills clears Senate,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/02/ct-electric-rates-bill-senate-pass/,"The bill would also promote grid-enhancing technologies and lower subsidies for solar and other renewable energy, among other measures.","Connecticut lawmakers revealed the long-awaited final draft of their plan to cut residents’ electric bills on Monday, before moving quickly to advance the measure through the frenzy of the legislature’s final week in session. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 4, is expected to save utility customers between $325 million and $350 million annually over each of the next two years, according to proponents. Those numbers amount to about 1 to 2 cents per kilowatt-hour off current electric rates, potentially adding up to a $100 or more a year for many customers.
State Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, who serves as co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee, called it, “one of the most significant things we’ve done,” in the last six years of attempting to address the state’s infamously high electricity prices.
“We put money back in people’s pockets, took a hard look — and much as many of my colleagues think we can do better, I dare them to try without screwing up the system,” he added.
In addition to providing direct relief for ratepayers, the bill would make myriad changes to energy policy in Connecticut such as promoting grid-enhancing technologies, lowering subsidies for solar and other renewable energy sources, and offering utilities more flexibility in how they purchase power for their customers.
Over the long term, Needleman said, those changes will help contain costs that are passed along to residents through their electric bills. 
The Senate’s bipartisan, 34-1 vote late Monday advanced the bill to the House, where lawmakers now have just two days to agree to the legislation and send it to Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk before this year’s legislative session closes Wednesday.
“I’m glad to report that Democratic and Republican legislators and my office have made significant progress on legislation to reduce electric rates, which among other things eliminates some of the public benefits from consumers’ bills,” Lamont said in an X post Monday morning. “I encourage the legislature to approve this.”
Over the two weeks preceding Monday’s vote, lawmakers held a series of closed-door meetings with members of Lamont’s administration, utility representatives and other key stakeholders to hammer out the final details in the 134-page bill.
Throughout this year’s legislative session, Republicans have pushed for even bigger savings by removing the entirety of the public benefits charge from customers’ bills and paying for those programs out of the state’s budget. 
But the cost of doing so — roughly $1 billion each year — would have forced the state to cut spending in other areas, Democrats argued.
“Not one of us should walk out of this chamber today even close to believing that we resolved this problem,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “The public benefits charge still exists, it’s still too high and our electric rates are still too high.” 
The two biggest sources of savings in the final draft of the bill will be paid for through borrowing to cover the costs of public benefits programs and other charges that appear on customers’ bills.
The bill authorizes up to $125 million a year in general obligation bonds — to be paid back by taxpayers — to cover the costs of unpaid bills accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with an additional $50 million over two years for the rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 
An additional $135 million in estimated savings comes from the use of rate-reduction bonds to pay for storm costs and the installation of advanced metering technology. Those bonds would be paid back by utility customers through the public benefits charge, but over a longer period of time and at lower interest rates than under the current law. 
The final pot of savings, about $100 million, will result from the variety of other changes to existing policies the bill makes, including removing wood-burning biomass facilities from the top tier of the state’s renewable energy portfolio.
Haggling over details
One particularly troublesome point in lawmakers’ negotiations hinged on language in the bill describing the administrative practices and makeup of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, the state agency that oversees and approves utility rates.
Republicans argued that an earlier draft of the legislation would have given more authority to the authority’s chairperson, Marissa Gillett, to issue rulings on procedural and other intermediate matters without the explicit backing of her fellow commissioners. 
Those powers are currently subject to a lawsuit brought by both of the state’s utilities, who have accused Gillett of issuing hundreds of unilateral rulings in cases before regulators. Both Gillet and PURA have disputed those charges.  
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, had demanded Democrats remove the controversial language from the bill in order to get the blessing of Republicans, who have the ability to talk bills to death as time runs out in the legislative session. When the latest draft of the bill was released Monday morning, the section had been amended to address most of Republicans’ concerns — save for a single sentence clarifying that Gillett served as the “administrative head” of PURA.
“Now we’re back to this circular fight: does this mean she can just assign cases to herself?” Candelora said. 
By Monday evening, however, the language had been changed again to refer to to the chair as the “chief executive” of PURA, ending Candelora’s opposition.
A spokesperson for PURA was not immediately available for comment following the bill’s passage around 8:30 p.m. 
In a statement, United Illuminating spokeswoman Sarah Wall Fliotsos praised the passage of the legislation, which she said followed years of lobbying by utilities to address costs.
“It is gratifying to see that legislators have at last turned to these challenges by introducing new funding mechanisms for the Public Benefits Charge and new procurement strategies for energy supply, both of which could help stabilize cost for customers,” Fliotsos said. “New policies to increase the stability and predictability of the state’s regulatory environment can also put Connecticut on the right track to enable the investment and grid modernization in the electric grid that our customers sorely need. There remains more work to be done, but we look forward to working with our customers and the state to implement these new measures.”
A spokeswoman for Eversource said the company would reserve comment until final passage of the bill. 
In addition to the debate over the authority’s administrative practices, lawmakers have also pushed Lamont to fill a pair of vacancies that have existed on PURA’s board since it was expanded to five members in 2019. 
Earlier this year, the governor appeared to have reached a deal with lawmakers to appoint two people — state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, and former state Rep. Holly Cheeseman, R-East Lyme — in exchange for Gillett’s renomination to another four-year term. That deal fell apart, however, over the complexities involved with appointing a sitting lawmaker and Fonfara’s past business dealings before PURA.
As part of their negotiations over S.B. 4, both Candelora and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Monday that they’d reached a “handshake” agreement with Lamont to fill the two vacant positions before the start of next year’s legislative session.
No names were announced as part of the purported deal, which was confirmed by Lamont’s office. 
Fonfara was the only member of the Senate to vote against the bill on Monday, which he described as missed opportunity to take more systematic changes, particularly around energy procurement.
“We think because ‘Oh we’re at the end of the pipeline,’ we think because costs are always higher in Connecticut or in New England, that this is our fate,” Fonfara said. “It should not be our fate, we can do better.”
Nixed plans
Amid a flurry of late changes made to the bill in recent days was the removal of a proposal to borrow an additional $750 million over five years to pay for energy efficiency programs that are currently funded as part of the public benefits charge.
While the plan would have removed those costs from customers’ electric bills, opposition emerged this week from environmental advocates and some business owners who argued that a reliance on borrowing — which must be approved by lawmakers — would destabilize the state’s energy efficiency industry.
More than 44,000 people in Connecticut are employed in HVAC, electrical, weatherization and solar jobs that are funded by investments in energy efficiency, according to a report published by the utilities in March.
“It is very tough for us as business owners to shut the doors, and they reopen if  funding is not available,” said Edgardo Mejias, the owner of Energy Efficiency Solutions. “We cannot grow our businesses, we cannot offer services we provide to the individuals we serve.”
An earlier proposal in the bill would have also shortened Connecticut’s winter shutoff moratorium by one month and removed shutoff protections for people with certain medical conditions. Instead, those protections would have only been made available to people who can’t afford to pay their winter heating bills.
While proponents argued the changes would have saved additional millions of dollars while cutting down on fraud, opposition from groups such as the American Association of Retired Persons resulted in those provisions being stripped from the bill.
Another controversial proposal to implement time-of-use electric rates — which advocates argued would be harder to adopt by older people and those with medical needs — was referred to PURA to come up with a workable system. 
“I don’t like the bill, but some of the areas we fought to improve are improved to a certain degree,” said John Erlingheuser, a lobbyist for AARP’s Connecticut chapter.
Connecticut had the third highest cost of electricity of any state in May, according to data collected PowerOutage.us, with an average residential bill of $187. Every other state in New England made it into the top 10 states by cost of electricity.
Electric rates did drop slightly in May following PURA’s most recent decision to adjust the cost of the public benefits and transmission charges. Customers are likely to see an additional drop in July, due to lower supply rates that have been put forward by both of the major utilities.
However, the start of summer is also when many Connecticut residents begin to rely on air conditioning to cool their homes and businesses, driving up usage — and, with it, the cost of their electric bills.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024_0626_THM_SenateSession-13-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 23:01:41.271961

(Courtesy of the Ciattarelli campaign)President Donald Trump urged his New Jersey supporters during a virtual rally Monday night to vote for Republican Jack Ciattarelli for governor in the June 10 GOP primary, calling Ciattarelli a “true champion” for the Garden State. 
“It’s being watched actually all over the world because New Jersey’s ready to pop out of that blue horror show and really get in there and vote for somebody that’s going to make things happen,” Trump said.
Trump’s push for Ciattarelli came on the eve of the early in-person voting period for the primary, which begins Tuesday at 10 a.m. and runs through Sunday.
Ciattarelli is one of five men seeking the Republican nod for governor next week. His opponents include longtime New Jersey 101.5 radio host Bill Spadea, who also competed for Trump’s endorsement, and state Sen. Jon Bramnick, a Trump critic. Whoever wins the nomination on June 10 will compete against one of six Democrats in November to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.
The president said Monday that Ciattarelli has his “complete and total endorsement.” 
“Other people are going around saying I endorsed them. It’s not true,” Trump said. 
Trump’s support for Ciattarelli came even after Ciattarelli in 2015 called Trump a “charlatan.” Appearing on Spadea’s show last year, Trump said Ciattarelli “made some very big mistakes” when Ciattarelli sought unsuccessfully to unseat Murphy in 2021.
Spadea has said he was disappointed in Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli, and has even referenced the endorsement in a recent campaign ad, telling Republican voters that “it’s OK for you to disagree with” Trump.
Several polls have shown Ciattarelli with a substantial lead in the GOP primary. A May 15 Emerson College/Pix 11/The Hill poll shows Ciattarelli with 44% support compared to Spadea’s 18%, with roughly a quarter of voters undecided. That poll also shows Trump has a split job approval rating in the state, with 47% approving and 47% disapproving.
Trump on Monday blasted New Jersey as a sanctuary state with “crippling regulations and rampant corruption.” Just 10 days ago, the Trump administration sued four New Jersey cities and their mayors — including two Democratic candidates for governor, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop — over their sanctuary city policies.
Trump also touched on his usual rally talking points, like easing illegal immigration at the southern border, transgender issues, crime, congestion pricing, and ending the “radical left war on suburbs.”
“New Jersey’s economy will wither and die, and you’ll be living in a nightmare of chaos and crime, and you sort of have that to a certain extent now. But it’s going to be changed, and it’s going to be changed fast with Jack,” Trump said. 
Ciattarelli told the president that his first executive order as governor would be ending the Immigrant Trust Directive — that’s the state policy that bars law enforcement from assisting federal agents with civil immigration enforcement — and pledged that his attorney general won’t sue the White House. The state’s current attorney general, Matt Platkin, a Democrat, has led and joined numerous legal complaints against the Trump administration. 
“I’m honored, and I will not let you down, nor will the Republicans across New Jersey,” Ciattarelli said. “They’re going to turn out in record numbers this year because we see what’s going on across the state.”

The state’s lone public university maintains it had no role in the decision to allow the student to join a campus sorority.
The post Trump administration investigates University of Wyoming over transgender sorority sister appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration announced Monday it’s investigating the University of Wyoming for alleged Title IX violations stemming from members of a campus sorority voting to admit a transgender woman in 2022, despite the school’s insistence that it doesn’t have a say in the membership of the private organization.
Critics of the admission of Artemis Langford have, until now, focused their efforts on the sorority itself: Kappa Kappa Gamma. Six of the sorority’s members sued the organization over the decision to admit Langford in 2023, but the case was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson, who ruled the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization chooses its members. 
The lawsuit did not name the University of Wyoming as a defendant. That didn’t stop the Trump administration, which has already challenged California and Maine over transgender policies, from pursuing an investigation into the Equality State’s lone, four-year public university.
“[The Office for Civil Rights] launched an investigation into the University of Wyoming after the university allowed a man to join a campus sorority,” the Department of Education announced in a statement Monday, indicating that, at least in the administration’s view, the onus was on the university to police KKG’s membership practices, a stance that at least one attorney who focuses on Title IX issues told WyoFile was legally questionable.
The Department of Education revealed the investigation in an announcement recognizing June as “Title IX Month.” (June is more prominently known as Pride Month, a time of recognition of the LGBTQ+ community.) The department said it would “highlight actions taken to reverse the Biden Administration’s legacy of undermining Title IX and announce additional actions to protect women in line with the true purpose of Title IX.”
The school, for its part, continues to maintain that Langford’s admission is a sorority matter. The University of Wyoming’s “position has been that it doesn’t control decisions about sorority and fraternity membership,” the university said in a prepared statement. “Appropriately, the university has not been a participant in litigation in federal court regarding the legality of the sorority’s decision to admit the transgender student.”
Title IX — a federal law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in educational programs and activities — provides an exemption for the membership practices of social sororities and fraternities, according to attorney Melissa Carleton, who works with colleges and universities across the country on Title IX issues. 
The Department of Education claims that KKG lost its exemption as a sorority by deviating from single-sex membership practices by deciding to admit a transgender woman. 
Because the statute says social sororities “are outside the bounds of Title IX, it’s not clear the [Department of Education] has enforcement authority,” to define who can and cannot be a member, Carleton said.

If UW is found to be in violation of Title IX, its federal funding could be on the line, Carleton said. 
“The Office for Civil Rights’ initiation of an investigation is not itself evidence of a violation of federal civil rights laws and regulations,” UW stated. “The university believes it has been and is in compliance with Title IX but intends to fully cooperate with the investigation and will work with the Office for Civil Rights to come into compliance if needed.”
How we got here
The announcement comes just days before a deadline in an ongoing civil lawsuit against UW’s Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter that began over two years ago. 
In March 2023, six members sued the sorority for allegedly breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted Langford, a transgender woman, by a majority vote of its members. 
The plaintiffs include Jaylyn Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar. 
Reasoning that the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization determines its members, a U.S. District Court dismissed the case in August 2023. 
The suing sorority sisters appealed the decision, but the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their arguments and gave the plaintiffs two options: amend their complaint or ask the lower court for a final judgment. 
“More than nine months after the Tenth Circuit issued its decision, they have neither amended their complaint nor notified us of their decision to ‘stand on the original complaint,’ which would allow them to receive a final judgment that could be appealed,” U.S. District Court Judge Alan Johnson wrote, ordering the plaintiffs to fish or cut bait by June 9. 
The plaintiffs had not taken court action as of press time. 
The plaintiffs have, however,  developed a direct connection with the Trump administration since their initial complaint. 
May Mailman, who previously worked as their attorney, joined the White House in January as deputy assistant and senior policy strategist to President Donald Trump. 
During the time that Mailman represented the plaintiffs, she worked as legal director of the Independent Women’s Forum, a DC-based, right-wing policy group that attached itself to the case. Several of the plaintiffs now serve as “ambassadors” for the organization and can be booked for speaking events.
“With the help of Independent Women, the University of Wyoming sorority sisters have been standing up for sisterhood and to keep sororities female ever since. Their advocacy footprint has expanded reaching sorority women nationwide,” the organization said in a press release shortly following the Department of Education’s announcement. 
Langford never lived in the sorority house on campus. In a statement to WyoFile, her attorney said her client did not know what prompted the Trump administration to launch an investigation now. 
“After Ms. Langford’s sisters voted her into the sorority, some filed a Title IX complaint about her admission. Ms. Langford does not know who those sisters were,” her attorney, Rachel Berkness, said in a statement that noted the complaint was eventually dropped. “After Ms. Langford celebrated her graduation from UW last month, she is surprised to learn that the Independent Women’s Forum, a political think tank that has promoted itself through litigation against Ms. Langford, is now advertising a new Title IX investigation.”

One month later the policy became law. (Courtesy of Maine Women's Lobby)The entire Maine Legislature is so far taking the recommendations of the Labor Committee to reject significant changes to the state’s paid family and medical leave program.
On Monday, the Senate voted 20-14 to back a proposal (LD 894) to tweak the program, but rejected other bills by the same margin, including one to exempt agricultural employees from the program and another to suspend remittance for companies that plan to use private plans. That bill now advances to the House of Representatives.
Both chambers also followed the lead of the committee by backing a proposal for a constitutional amendment prohibiting the Legislature from using the program funds for any other purpose. 
Though LD 1221 was passed under the hammer by the House and Senate, it will require a two-thirds vote from each chamber for the next round of enactment votes. If secured, it would then be sent to the voters to ultimately decide on the November 2025 ballot.
LD 894, which was also endorsed by the committee, proposes a series of amendments to the current law to create certain enforcement mechanisms and penalties, as well as clarify intermittent leave. Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) introduced the bill on behalf of the Labor Department to make specific refinements to the policy that were noticed during the rulemaking process. 
“This is a bill that does the quiet, but essential work of ensuring that Maine’s paid family and medical leave program is implemented successfully,” said Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) on the Senate floor.
Though it isn’t expected to be available until May 2026, the paid family and medical leave program will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child.
Tipping said LD 894 is the only bill that “strengthens the program without destabilizing it.”
Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) urged his colleagues to support a different version of the bill that he argued would help small businesses. While Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) said while some of those suggestions are reasonable, they seem too substantial to make for a program that hasn’t been fully implemented yet. 
“Making major structural changes at this stage before a single benefit has been paid and without knowing what’s working or not working, it’s like you’re trying to redesign a plane while we’re on the runway,” Reny said. 
Across the State House, lawmakers rejected bills to repeal the program (LD 406), make it voluntary (LD 1273) and make a series of other structural changes (LD 1333 and LD 1712).

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/02/ct-budget-house-vote/,"The House is poised to adopt a budget that scales back increases to health care providers, reforms ‘fiscal guardrails’ and invests in children","This story will be updated.
The state House of Representatives was poised to adopt a $55.8 billion two-year budget Monday evening that invests in child care and K-12 education, provides a $250 tax cut to working poor families and increases hospital taxes in hopes of securing more federal Medicaid grants before Washington caps that program.
The biennial plan, which the Senate is expected to debate Tuesday, increases payments to health care providers who treat the poor but offers a more modest boost than legislative leaders had pledged. Similarly, the budget includes no general increase next fiscal year for nonprofit social service agencies, though it features a $76 million cost-of-living hike in 2026-27. That delayed increase comes with an asterisk, though, since many expect Connecticut’s fiscal picture to change dramatically before then due to shrinking federal aid.
The budget, which would spend $27.2 billion next fiscal year and $28.6 billion in 2026-27, would curb aggressive state spending controls. That means $1.2 billion that would have gone toward reducing pension debt over the coming biennium would be re-directed into the General Fund. 
The plan also relies on borrowing and several accounting maneuvers to ensure the plan stays under the constitutional spending cap by a narrow $19 million — 1/13th of 1% of the General Fund — in the first fiscal year and by $250 million in the second.
“It is a budget that continues to move the state of Connecticut forward, make critical investments where we believe they need to be made, while still working within the fiscal constraints that we have,” House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said during a mid-morning press conference previewing the budget debate.
But House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the plan crafted by Democratic legislative leaders and Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration subverts the spending cap — which is supposed to keep budget growth in line with household income and inflation — and other controls that have added $4 billion to reserves and reduced $8.6 billion in pension debt since 2017.
“It rises to the level of deception and promotion only second to P.T. Barnum,” Candelora said during his pre-session press conference. “This budget eviscerates all of our ‘fiscal guardrails.’”
‘The single-greatest investment in children that I have ever seen’
But increasing numbers of Democratic legislators and advocates for various programs have argued in recent years that these budget controls excessively weaken education, health care, social services and other core programs.
Those “guardrails” were last fixed in 2017 and designed to end a string of budget deficits and prevent future tax hikes after big increases were ordered in 2015, 2011 and 2009.
But they’ve gone far beyond that, capturing an average of $1.8 billion per year since 2017. Analysts project a $2.4 billion surplus, equal to 10% of the General Fund, for this fiscal year, which ends June 30.
Connecticut entered this fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, a burden created by more than 70 years of inadequate savings before 2011. And critics say one generation cannot pay off the pension debt created by three.
“It’s important that we all realize that change is inevitable,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, longtime co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. State officials have used $2.8 billion in emergency federal pandemic grants, which could be spent outside normal budget rules, to support core programs since 2021. But those funds have been exhausted.

And while this dynamic has blocked legislators from bolstering many programs, the new biennial package makes “the single-greatest investment in children that I have ever seen,” Walker said.
That involves taking $200 million from this fiscal year’s surplus and creating a new fund — also outside the traditional budget and spending cap — to fund future increases in early childhood development programs.
The new budget continues ongoing efforts to bolster the Education Cost Sharing program, the chief grant to support K-12 school districts’ operating costs. ECS payments would grow by $90 million next fiscal year. That funding would ensure no district would receive less money than it got this year, even though a legislative formula had called for 81 communities to lose aid in 2025-26.
Legislators from both parties ordered an extra $40 million in special education grants to local districts earlier this winter to mitigate a funding crisis in that program.
The new budget continues that $40 million hike and adds another $30 million for special education in each of the next two fiscal years.
No child tax credit for middle class; poor families get $250 relief
Democratic legislators acknowledged in April that they likely would not approve the full $600-per-child income tax cut many lawmakers endorsed for low- and middle-income households. Analysts estimate that would cost the state more than $300 million per year.
But as recently as two weeks ago, leaders still hoped to provide hundreds of thousands of income-eligible households with income tax relief equal to $150 per child.
That proposal, which would have cost about $80 million per year, also was deemed too expensive this past week, especially given the potential for eroding aid from Washington.
Democratic lawmakers settled on a $250 increase in an existing income tax credit for Connecticut’s working poor — the Earned Income Tax Credit — but only for those filers that have children or other dependents. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Saturday the payment likely would be $200 total for eligible households, regardless of how many dependents they would have. But leaders later adjusted that relief to $250, a benefit that will cost the state $35.5 million per year.
Connecticut has about 195,000 households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the working poor cover basic needs and increase savings. The state credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts. 
Most EITC-eligible households have children and earn between $50,000 and $63,000 per year.
Requests for health care, social services scaled back
The budget also increases the Medicaid rates paid to doctors and other providers who treat Connecticut’s poor. But the plan is much smaller than legislative leaders proposed shortly after the 2025 session began in January.
The budget allocates $15 million to boost rates for most providers next fiscal year. The extra funding would grow to $45 million in 2026-27.
Connecticut hasn’t comprehensively adjusted its provider rates since 2007, a problem that critics say has left many poor adults and children on HUSKY — the state’s Medicaid-funded insurance program — unable to find physicians willing to treat them.
Leaders initially proposed spending an extra $300 million in payments to providers by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
The hundreds of community-based nonprofits that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to people with developmental disabilities or facing mental health or addiction issues also had to settle for less.
They sought $264 million extra in the new budget. The industry insists it misses out on hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t kept pace with inflation for decades.
Legislators didn’t order any general rate hike for nonprofits in 2025-26, but they are slated to get $76 million more in the second year of the plan. 
The biennial package also includes $34 million in the first year and $66 million in the second year for nonprofits that run group homes for residents with developmental disabilities. 
But the funds for those nonprofits must be used to increase caregivers’ wages. 
The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed last month to suspend planned strikes at more than 190 group homes and 51 nursing homes after Lamont pledged to boost funding for caregivers in these two service areas.
Lawmakers also included an extra $30 million in the second year of the new budget specifically to bolster nonprofits serving clients with mental health and addiction issues or providing counseling to formerly incarcerated people reentering society.
“The budget is not everything we requested, but in the context of this year’s discussions about budget restrictions, we are grateful for their choice to support programs that will improve thousands of lives and even save some,” said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance.
Gambling on a hospital provider tax increase
Hospitals were unhappy with the new budget, arguing it makes dangerous assumptions and lacks clear details on what the state would do to the industry.
The plan asks hospitals, starting in 2026-27, to pay an extra $375 million per year in taxes.
That doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing for the industry. Connecticut has an unusual tax on hospitals that currently helps both sides. 
It already involves collecting more than $800 million annually from hospitals and redistributing those funds back to those facilities. This back-and-forth arrangement, which most states employ, helps Connecticut qualify for hundreds of millions of dollars yearly in federal Medicaid reimbursements, which it also shares with hospitals.
Lamont proposed back in February increasing the tax by $140 million per year and redistributing those funds back to facilities, estimating it would increase federal Medicaid payments to Connecticut by $94 million. The state would be the chief beneficiary of this bounty, but hospitals also would come out $10 million ahead under the governor’s proposal.
But what if Congress caps this arrangement or reduces the amount states can receive?
State officials have been bracing for months for big cuts in Medicaid payments from Washington as the Republican-led Congress seeks to slash federal spending to save $880 billion over the next decade.

State Comptroller Sean Scanlon, whom Lamont asked to negotiate details of a provider tax hike with the Connecticut Hospital Association, said Monday that the state’s best option is to try to get more from Washington before the door is shut.
“People in our position in every state capitol in America would be fools not to have a conversation about how we might work with this,” he said.
But under the plan, that tax hike is up to $375 million. Between 2012 and 2018, under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, the state reneged on what it pledged to return to hospitals, prompting an industry lawsuit. It would be settled when Lamont took office in 2019, but hospital officials remain wary.
Further complicating matters, state officials still hadn’t shared any details by Monday evening with the hospital association showing how much each facility might gain if Connecticut secures extra Medicaid funds or what would happen if the state does not.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said “it is our intention to ensure that hospitals are no worse off than they currently are under this tax. We will be discussing plans further with them over the next year.”
But industry officials wanted hard numbers.
“We have made it very clear that we have not signed off on the tax increase contained in the budget or the comptroller’s plan to reduce payments to hospitals as drafted in the budget bill,” the hospital association wrote in a statement. “The state has provided no other estimates, runs, or numbers related to how hospital Medicaid reimbursement would change.”
Connecticut has budgetary safety nets to protect state and hospital finances if Washington caps the provider tax system.
Besides a record-setting $4.1 billion rainy day fund, Connecticut also has a savings program that’s expected to capture more than $700 million in income and business tax receipts next fiscal year and more than $650 million in 2026-27.
Reforming excessive savings programs or risking fiscal stability?
Republicans noted that Connecticut’s safety net is getting smaller quickly.
The savings program that captures income and business tax receipts had been projected to collect $1.3 billion in 2025-26 and $1.25 billion in the second year of the biennium.
Lamont, who has been reluctant to adjust the state’s budget caps, compromised with his fellow Democrats in the legislature and agreed to scale these back to bolster other programs.
The new budget also includes several maneuvers to circumvent the constitutional spending cap.
For example, majority Democrats and Lamont both planned to underfund contractually required health care benefits for retired state workers by about $230 million over the next two fiscal years. Scanlon said he hopes to mitigate that gap by negotiating savings with insurance providers, but any remaining deficit would be taken from the retiree health care trust — meaning the cost, plus interest, would be covered by future taxpayers.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, couldn’t hide her frustrations about learning a last-minute adjustment to new budget effectively raids that health care trust by another $7 million.

Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, the ranking House Republican on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, chastised Democrats for not working harder to curb spending, given clear signals from Washington that Congress is asking states to get by with less aid.
“Instead of looking for savings in our budget,” he said, “we’re looking for new revenue. That is not a sustainable way to run a state.”
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, offered an amendment to remove funding that supports health care for undocumented residents and transfer the resources, about $58 million per year, into special education grants for cities and towns.
“It comes down to what you want to be a beacon for,” Fishbein said. “I would like to be a beacon for funding for special education for our children in this state. If you want to be a beacon for illegal alien health care, you know, then you vote down this amendment.”
Rep. Geraldo Reyes, a Waterbury Democrat, urged Fishbein to revise his language and refer to those residents as “undocumented.”
“They are human beings, just like everybody in this chamber,” Reyes said. “They do live here in Connecticut with us. They contribute a great deal to this state, to this economy.”
The House rejected the amendment in a 99-46 vote along party lines.
But Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the finance committee, said Democrats made difficult choices, balancing the needs of residents against the limits of the budget caps and vanishing federal aid.
“We cannot do everything in this budget,” she said. “We are in a moment of constraint.”
Public colleges and universities must tap reserves
One area that legislators constrained involves public colleges and universities, which will be forced to tap their reserves over the next two fiscal years to mitigate program cuts and to avoid fee increases.
The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which includes community colleges, four regional universities and online Charter Oak State College, would receive $479 million next fiscal year and $485 million in 2026-27, appropriations that mirror the $479 million in traditional state funds the system received this fiscal year.
But Lamont and legislators also propped up CSCU spending this year with $140 million in emergency federal pandemic relief, which won’t be available in the coming biennium.
Still, legislators warned system administrators they likely would face a cut. The Connecticut Mirror reported in late March that the CSCU system entered this fiscal year with $611 million in reserves, an amount that represents more than half of its current operating budget.
The University of Connecticut and its Farmington-based health center had more modest reserves but still entered this fiscal year with $171 million and $297 million, respectively.
The new state budget would reduce overall aid next fiscal year by $58 million for UConn’s main campus in Storrs and its regional campuses and by $55 million for the health center. Their funding would drop in 20260-27 by another $15 million and $4 million, respectively.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0602_SR_Session_013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 22:02:24.386964

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.
Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”
At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.
“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”
A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”
“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”
At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.
“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.
Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.
J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”
“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”
FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.
“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.
All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.
“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A Milwaukee man was charged Monday after writing a letter to the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that threatened to assassinate President Donald Trump. Demetric Scott told investigators that he wrote the letter claiming to be 54-year Ramón Morales Reyes, a Mexican-born Milwaukee resident who does not have permanent legal status. Scott was already incarcerated in the Milwaukee County Jail for armed robbery and aggravated battery and allegedly victimized Morales Reyes when he committed that crime. 
WISN 12 reported that Scott told investigators that he wrote the letter framing Morales Reyes because he didn’t want Morales Reyes  to testify against him during his trial in July. Scott reportedly told a person during a recorded jailhouse call that if Morales Reyes “gets picked up by ICE, there won’t be a jury trial so they will probably dismiss it that day. That’s my plan.” 
The letter Scott authored was written in perfect English, with only a few misspellings. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans,” it stated, adding, “I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 (sic) to shoot your precious president in the head – I’ll see you at one of his big ralleys (sic).” The letter was likely referring to a 30-6 (pronounced 30 odd six) high caliber rifle round, and appeared to be an assassination threat against the president. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On Friday, lawyers representing Morales Reyes and local immigration advocates from Voces de la Frontera held a press conference, asserting that Morales Reyes could not have authored the letter. The 54-year-old father, who works as a dishwasher, comes from a rural part of Mexico where he received little formal  education. He does not speak English and cannot read or write proficiently even in Spanish. 
After Morales Reyes was arrested by ICE, his daughter contacted Voces de la Frontera and shared information about his background. Days after the arrest, Department of Homeland (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem issued a press statement, condemning Morales Reyes as having threatened President Trump’s life. Noem said  the letter was part of a  series of  dangerous threats to the president. 
Morales Reyes’ attorneys and Voces de la Frontera called on DHS to retract Noem’s  statement and clear his name. It’s unclear why Noem issued the statement, as CNN reported that MPD was investigating the likelihood that the letter was a fake on the day Morales Reyes was arrested. Scott told investigators that he did not receive any help in writing the letters. 
Democratic U.S. Reps. Gween Moore and Mark Pocan visited the Dodge County jail, Wisconsin’s only ICE detention facility Monday, on a  congressional oversight visit. They were not permitted to talk to anyone incarcerated there and did not receive any response to their questions from ICE.  
“In this facility, ICE is still detaining Ramón Morales Reyes despite being wrongfully accused of a crime,” Moore and Pocan said in a joint statement.  “ICE is also working without transparency to Congress, which was only magnified by today’s visit when we tried to call the local Milwaukee field office number on its website, but the number was disconnected. It is unacceptable for ICE to be inaccessible to Members of Congress. As members of Congress, we will continue using all tools available to conduct oversight.”

They’ve warned it could result in hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage and SNAP benefits.,"State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D-Philadelphia) decried the ""Big, Beautiful Bill""  during a press conference outside Pennsylvania Capitol. (Capital-Star photo by Vincent DiFonzo)Pennsylvania Democrats stood on the Capitol steps in Harrisburg Monday and called on Republicans to oppose cuts to entitlement programs that are working their way through Congress.
“They don’t want to talk about this massive negative impact it’s going to have on the quality of life of so many Pennsylvanians,” Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny), said. “It’s not too late for them to join us, to be part of the discussion that says ‘no.’”
The proposed federal spending cuts are part of what Republicans call their “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a budget reconciliation package that includes much of President Donald Trump’s agenda. The bill has already passed the U.S.House, and can pass the U.S. Senate with a simple majority vote, which Republicans can muster without Democratic support.
The bill would renew Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire and increase funding for immigration enforcement. To offset the costs, it includes dramatic spending cuts, especially to entitlement programs. Though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found it could add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. 
Democrats in Harrisburg say the bill’s spending cuts will have dramatic impacts in Pennsylvania. They’ve warned it could result in hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage, and tens of thousands losing access to food assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The state, they say, does not have the funds to make up for that.
Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia), the minority chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there is little room to make up for potential federal cuts with state funding.
“Knowing the state budget the way I know it, we know that we have no capacity to backfill any of those cuts,” he told the Capital-Star. 
According to the left-leaning think tank Pennsylvania Policy Center, the bill includes roughly $600 billion in cuts to Medicaid spending over 10 years, and would institute new work requirements for people covered through the program. They say the result could mean more than half a million Pennsylvanians would lose health care. 
Currently, around 23% of Pennsylvanians, or around 3 million people, are covered by Medicaid, according to the state Department of Human Services.
Rep. Arvind Venkat, (D-Allegheny), who is also an emergency physician,said before the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid, 20% of his patients didn’t have health insurance. 
“They would come into the emergency department too late for me to treat them, and that is a real thing,” he said. The reason some gave him was the fear of medical debt that they’d accumulate because they were uninsured.
He worries that will happen again if more people lose insurance 
“We need to call out the cynicism from our Republican colleagues in Congress. On the one hand they’re saying they don’t want to take coverage from anybody,” Venkat said. “But then they’re happy to brag that they’re going to save $1.7 trillion in decreased federal funding. And the only way that happens is if people lose insurance or stop seeking healthcare when they need it.”
The bill’s Republican defenders say that the cuts are the result of eliminating fraud and waste, and will ultimately reduce spending to help bring a ballooning budget back in line. 
Republican Sen. Dave McCormick did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star, but addressed the bill at a televised debate with Democratic Sen. John Fetterman Monday morning.
He said entitlement spending has been on the rise, and attributed that to an uptick of claims by people for whom benefits were never intended.
“Those are working-age men without dependents, and those are illegal immigrants in a number of cases,” McCormick said. “So what I’m arguing for is that we need to cut out the use of those programs … by people for whom they weren’t designed.”
The reconciliation bill would also cut SNAP spending by nearly $300 billion, according to the Pennsylvania Policy Center, by reducing the federal government’s share of spending. It would also expand work requirements. As it stands, parents raising dependent children under 18 are not required to meet them, but the bill would lower the age of qualifying dependents to 7. People 55 and older are also not required to meet work requirements, but the bill would change that to 65 and up.
Pennsylvania Department of Human Services Secretary Val Arkoosh has warned that 140,000 Pennsylvanians could lose access to the food assistance program with the changes to work requirements. According to the Department’s most recent data, in 2023, around 2 million Pennsylvanians received SNAP benefits every month.
“This bill would be the largest cut ever to food assistance in U.S. history,” Costa said. 
He added that the bill could mean cuts to the Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which pays farmers to provide fresh food for seniors and people who receive Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutritional assistance programs.
Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D-Philadelphia), the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, called on Republicans to join his party in opposition.
“I think we have an opportunity to stop this, but the problem is it’s only Democrats out here,” he said. 
Spokespeople for Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star.
As it stands, the U.S. Senate is likely to make changes to the bill before returning it to the House. A number of Senate Republicans have raised concerns over how much the bill could add to the deficit.
Populist Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) raised concerns about cuts to Medicaid, which he called “morally wrong and political suicide.”
Gov. Josh Shapiro also warned of a steep impact if the House version of the bill is passed. He said that it could impact not just patients, but hospitals that rely on Medicaid funds.
“We’ve got 25 rural hospitals that right now are operating on a deficit that likely would have to shutter if these Medicaid cuts go in effect,” Shapiro said at a press conference Monday morning in Harrisburg.
“It is certainly my hope that our federal representatives wouldn’t vote for something that takes something away from Pennsylvania students or Pennsylvania seniors and everybody in between,” he added.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DDA1E9C2-C557-4B90-BEA5-18F677DA993D-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 20:59:44.009172

(Photo by Craig McCaa/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)The Trump administration plans to lift environmental protections on roughly half of the National Petroleum Reserve on Alaska’s North Slope, reopening the area to possible oil and gas drilling.
The new move would reverse actions taken during the Biden administration to restrict development in the 23 million-acre reserve.
The plans, announced Sunday in Utqiagvik and formally on Monday by the U.S. Department of the Interior, open a public comment period, with final action to come later. The plans were announced as three of the Trump administration’s top officials visit Alaska.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, are in Alaska this week for a series of events, including a speaking engagement at Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s annual sustainable energy conference, which begins Tuesday in Anchorage.
During a brief question-and-answer session with reporters on Sunday, U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, sat alongside the three cabinet members and called the effort to restrict development in NPR-A the “most egregious effort of the Biden administration,” adding that “one of the top priorities is to get the NPRA back to where it was supposed to be by the intention of Congress, to develop oil and to remove all the regulations that the Biden guys put on NPR-A, and that is a huge priority.”
While large oil companies have expressed little interest to date in drilling within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which lies to the east of the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, there has been interest in drilling within the reserve, which lies to the west. 
Since the first days of the second Trump administration, federal officials have said that they are prioritizing an effort to eliminate obstacles for companies interested in digging or drilling for natural resources in Alaska.
Burgum, Wright and Zeldin traveled to the North Slope after meeting with state officials in Anchorage on Sunday and were scheduled to tour Pump Station No. 1 of the trans-Alaska Pipeline System before returning to Anchorage on Tuesday to participate in the governor’s energy conference.
The two-hour Anchorage event was largely closed to the public, but reporters were able to listen to closing remarks and ask limited questions at the end.
There were no new details about the potential construction of a trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, and officials did not address the Trump administration’s decision to freeze or rescind grants awarded to renewable energy projects in Alaska.
Burgum, speaking in Anchorage, noted that Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport offers direct flights to 16 countries and talked about the “rise of the Pacific” in terms of global commerce.
“Alaska can play such a huge role in this, but we’ve got to get the federal government out of your way. That’s what the three of us are here to do,” he said.
In response to a question, Burgum said the administration plans to prioritize development of the planned Ambler Road, a 211-mile mining access road through the Brooks Range, and the proposed King Cove Road, an 11-mile road connecting King Cove to the Cold Bay airport, among other projects. 
On Monday, environmental groups responded to the NPR-A decision with scorn and concern. 
Grandmothers Growing Goodness, an environmental group that supports Indigenous communities in the Arctic, said that the repeal of the Biden administration protections would significantly impact Teshekpuk Lake and its surroundings, which are important for the Teshekpuk caribou herd. “The area is also integral to Indigenous subsistence practices, supporting hunting, fishing, and gathering,” they said, in an email statement with the announcement
Protest demonstrations are planned in Anchorage for Monday and Tuesday to oppose the proposed Alaska LNG pipeline project and “other fossil fuel projects promoted by Gov. Dunleavy’s ‘sustainable energy conference,’” according to organizers. 
“It’s hard to overstate the havoc this could wreak on the Western Arctic’s undisturbed habitat for caribou, polars bears and belugas,” said Marlee Goska, Alaska attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Trump’s fixation on plundering Alaska’s ecosystems for short-term gain is matched only by the stupidity of turning this precious place into a fossil fuel extraction site. Alaska’s vast expanses of wild lands are a big part of what makes our state so special, and we’ll do everything possible to protect these places.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/49159199058_5167f11791_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 20:59:44.009172

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The deputy secretary of public health services is leaving the Maryland Department of Health this week after two years serving under the Moore Administration and more than a decade in both private and public health services in Maryland, state officials confirmed Monday.
Tuesday will be Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman’s last day with the department.
“We thank Dr. Kalyanaraman for raising his hand to serve the people of Maryland — especially through the COVID pandemic — as a dedicated champion for public health,” according to a spokesperson for Gov. Wes Moore.
His departure is the latest in a string that began in February, when then-Secretary Laura Herrera Scott left amid several controversies at the department, including oversight issues at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, a high-security hospital that has been riddled with complaints of patient abuse and violence.
Secretary Meena Seshamani, a former top official with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, took the reins of the department in April.
Just last week, Erin McCullen left her position as the department’s chief of staff, a position she’s held since 2023. McCullen also worked in the department in various positions from 2013 through 2017. Chase Cook also left his job last week as the department’s director of communications, following several years in the position.
Former CMS administrator takes helm of controversy-laden health department

As the deputy secretary of public health services, Kalyanaraman has spoken on a wide variety of health and safety issues throughout the years — from heat illnesses and dental health workforce to bird flu threat levels and more.
Before working with the Moore administration, Kalyanaraman served as the health officer for Anne Arundel County from September 2019 through March 2023, leading the county through the COVID-19 pandemic.
“He was a really, really good resource for the issues that we dealt with during COVID,” said Sen. Pam Beidle (D-Anne Arundel), chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “He was always willing to do a webinar with us and our constituents. I think he did a really good job guiding our county through COVID.”
Before his time in local government, Kalyanaraman served from 2012 to 2019 as the chief health officer for Baltimore-based Health Care for the Homeless, a nonprofit that provides health care and housing support to 10,000 people in the region annually.
He leaves a health department that’s trying to pull itself out of a series of controversies and challenges. During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers grilled Kalyanaraman for answers about one of those controversies — a significant backlog of nursing home annual inspections.
Kalyanaraman argued that the department had been making progress on the backlog of state inspections, but lawmakers remain concerned that some facilities had not received annual inspections for over four years, putting vulnerable senior citizens at risk of inadequate care.
Kalyanaraman declined Monday to comment on his departure.
Neither McCullen nor Cook responded to a request for comment. But McCullen said in a social media post about her departure from the health department that she was “filled with immense gratitude for the privilege of serving alongside such dedicated public servants.”
“The experience has been invaluable, and I am forever thankful for the opportunity to contribute to the health and well-being of Marylanders alongside some of the best people you will ever meet,” she said.

The Senate vote follo[...]","The Connecticut legislature’s omnibus special education bill, which would reform how private providers charge for services and increase oversight of special education programs, is headed for Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk to be signed into law after unanimously passing out of both chambers.
House Bill 5001 passed the Senate 35-0 Monday evening. The Senate vote followed just days after the legislation also unanimously passed the House of Representatives late last week.
The bill’s final passage is the culmination of a legislative session in which leaders of the Education Committee pledged, from the outset, to bolster special education funding and services in the coming biennium. Earlier in the session, lawmakers also passed emergency legislation adding $40 million to the current year’s budget for special education.
“It’s not just oversight. It’s not just accountability. We’re investing in education because this is our priority in our state. Our children are the future we’re investing in,” said Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, who served as a co-chair on the legislature’s Select Committee on Special Education. 
Gadkar-Wilcox added that while “meeting the needs of the students, that’s our primary goal, it [also] has to be sustainable.”
The bipartisan bill called for changes to several aspects of the Connecticut special education system. Among the lawmakers’ priorities was to augment state oversight of districts that outsource special education services to private providers.
“[This bill] puts us on a path of reform in a way that provides better quality and helps us control costs,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk. “We are working to make sure every tax dollar is spent in the best way possible. But at the same time, we’re getting the best results for our students.”
“What I enjoy about the bill that is before us here this evening is it’s really focused, not so much on the funding mechanisms, … but more of the policy points that will, I think, help control costs,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, added Monday evening.
Financial oversight
Once signed into law, the bill will prohibit cost increases from private providers in the upcoming school year and require state agencies to define “reasonable costs” for services, including speech, behavioral and occupational therapies. it will also establish a rate schedule for direct special education services, which would limit how much providers can charge, and create a billing standard for special education transportation costs.
“It’s not to set a minimum. It’s not to set a cap,” Gadkar-Wilcox said Monday. “Step one is to understand what is, in fact, reasonable when you have a complex system of services that are required.”
Rate setting was a controversial proposal earlier this year, with critics of the measure saying it would “destroy” private programs and potentially harm the state’s students with the most severe disabilities.
Gadkar-Wilcox said Monday the rate setting process would not be rushed. She said “the nuances” would be considered so rates wouldn’t be set so low that private providers would be unable to serve high-need students.
“It’s also going to be up to the state department, in consultation with the [Office of Policy and Management], in consultation with those stakeholders to understand the nuance of it as well — the intensity of these services, the quality of these services, when you add on multiple of these services for multiple students with the same provider, how do you factor that in?” Gadkar-Wilcox said. 
The bill also allots an additional $60 million in the next two fiscal years for school districts to expand in-district special education services. The $30 million allocated for 2026 will be added to $221 million already in the budget for special education that year. 
Program standards
The bill will also require the state Department of Education to establish licensure standards for private special education providers, with Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker assigned to supervise the programs.
The state Education Department will also be responsible for conducting site visits of private special education providers, creating a “workload analysis” for teachers and school service providers and providing public data on excess cost projections twice a year, which is expected to help boards of education predict estimated special education costs in their budget seasons.
The data will give lawmakers a “better sense of where we need to invest and what interventions are the most important,” Gadkar-Wilcox said.
Sen. Eric Berthel, R-Watertown, ranking member on the Education Committee, said lawmakers haven’t “given enough coverage” in state reimbursement for special education costs and that “this bill, in my humble opinion, begins to appropriately address these issues,” he said.
The Office of Dyslexia and Reading Disabilities within the Education Department will also be required to report to the state legislature’s Education Committee next year with best practices on evaluations, interventions, student outcomes and teacher preparation measures.
Private special education providers will be responsible for submitting annual enrollment reports to the state, and local boards of education will likewise need to annually report information about their out-of-district placements.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney called the annual reports important for oversight and accountability.
“We know in many cases there’s children, especially poor children whose parents may not be as skilled as advocates or may be working multiple jobs,” Looney said. “We need to know that those children will have someone looking out for them with a system to make sure that their care is appropriate, their placement is appropriate, their evaluation is appropriate.” Looney said the bill provides “greater accountability at all levels.”
Changes to diagnosis age, hearing rules
House Bill 5001 also raises the age by which a child can be diagnosed with a developmental delay from age 5 to age 8.
“In some cases, we don’t know — when a child that comes to school — whether it is a developmental disability or whether it’s perhaps just the product of prior years of neglect, in terms of not being part of a quality preschool or daycare program,” Looney, who favors the change, said.
The bill also makes changes to due process hearings, which seek to resolve disagreements between school district officials and parents regarding a student’s special education services.
Currently, under state law, the district and parents must participate in a pre-hearing — to resolve the issues and narrow the scope — and disclose specified information at least five business days before the specified date. The two parties must disclose their evidence, witnesses and completed evaluations and recommendations prior to the hearing.
The new proposal will now require all claims to be disclosed before the start of the hearing, require hearing officers to consider all the claims and limit hearings to four days.
Looney said the changes would “make sure that children’s rights are protected.”
“A hearing can be a daunting place for a family that does not have legal representation or may not be adept in all of the kinds of legal infighting that goes on in these hearings,” Looney said. “So these are procedural protections.”
The bill also will require local boards of education to provide behavior assessments, and make or update a behavioral intervention plan for students with “challenging behavior” before they’re placed with an out-of-district provider.
Some efforts failed
Earlier this session, other proposals regarding special education passed out of the Education Committee, but were not taken up in the House or Senate. 
Among those proposals were bills that sought to codify 504 plans into state law and another that would have shortened the amount of time a student with a disability could stay in the public school system beyond their senior year of high school.
Lawmakers also considered codifying protections under what’s known as Section 504 for certain students with disabilities. House Bill 7219 came at a time where the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which lays out protections for this group of students, has come under attack.
In September, a group of 17 states sued the federal government, challenging the constitutionality of the federal law. The lawsuit came shortly after then-President Joe Biden finalized a rule to include gender dysphoria under Section 504 of the law in early 2024.
Nearly 48,000 students in Connecticut have 504 plans, according to the state Department of Education. Unlike an Individualized Education Plan, which provides specialized instruction, children with 504 plans do not require special education services. In schools, a 504 plan instead outlines accommodations for a student with disability, including things like preferential seating, assistive technology or extended time on tests.
Despite receiving broad support, the proposal ultimately fizzled. Education Committee Co-chair Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, said lawmakers are “waiting to see what happens with the federal case.”
House Bill 7076, a bill that would shorten the time students spend in transitional special education programs, also passed out of the Education Committee 42-3 earlier this year.
Currently services for students with severe disabilities can last through the end of the school year during which they turn 22. Instead of finishing out that school year, H.B. 7076 proposed ending transition services as of a student’s 22nd birthday.
The bill gained support among superintendents who say these services are costly, but it also had strong opposition at its public hearing from over 100 parents and special education advocates who say the services are crucial for some the states highest need children.
While some provisions in House Bill 7076 were included in omnibus education bill House Bill 7009, the language that proposed the age  change was removed.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0602_SR_Session_008-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 20:02:01.564936

Adam Smith in the 2026 election.
At her campaign kick-off in Seattle, Sawant called for a $25 an hour minimum wage, universal health care and a halt in U.S. military aid to Israel for its ongoing offensive against Hamas. Sawant did not seek re-election in 2023 as she established Workers Strike Back, an activist group focused on pro-labor causes and other issues.
The Seattle resident vowed, if elected, to “flip the script on how to use elected office” as she did as a city leader from 2014 to 2024. 
“My socialist city council office went to war for working people to defeat the strenuous opposition from both big business and the Democratic Party,” she said in a statement. “Our experience in Seattle shows that we can defeat the rich and their political servants.”
Sawant filed as an independent with the Federal Election Commission.
Smith, who’s served in the U.S. House since 1997, said Sawant’s candidacy will offer voters “a clear contrast.”
“Her record on the Seattle City Council is defined by extreme, divisive tactics and policies that left lasting harm,” he said in a statement.

Sawant hit hard Monday, saying that because the Democrats and Republican parties have backed U.S. support of Israel “to the hilt,” they both are “responsible for what is in reality a new holocaust” in which thousands have died and Gaza has been reduced to rubble.
Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, has “blood on his hands” for fully endorsing the policies, she said.
He, in turn, said Sawant bears responsibility for Republican Donald Trump winning the presidency because she actively campaigned against former Vice President Kamala Harris’ bid for the office, undermining Democratic efforts to defeat Trump.
“I have constantly fought against Donald Trump and the devastating policies he is forcing on the American people,” Smith said.

(Photo by Getty Images)Colton George felt sick. The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown (D-Ohio). “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
The high cost of foodborne illnesses
Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas. “This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak involving peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
‘Life or death for our son’
E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers ended the 2025 legislative session Monday, celebrating a balanced budget achieved over a major projected deficit and the passage of more than 200 bills.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista, marking the end to the 89-day session, thanked his colleagues for their work, and centered them on what he has already identified as the “biggest challenge” for 2026, the same as in 2025: the state budget.
He said fiscal numbers often change in the two-year budget cycle, and “there is considerable uncertainty in the world that could make accurately predicting our fiscal future more difficult.”

Lawmakers are projected to end the next two fiscal years, through mid-2027, at a $4.15 million surplus. Lawmakers are facing a projected $129.1 million hole in the following two fiscal years, from mid-2027 through mid-2029, which future lawmakers will need to address.
Just five months ago, lawmakers faced a $432 million projected deficit for the 2025-27 fiscal years, which had grown by the time the budget passed in May.
“There is always more work to do and more opportunity to make Nebraska an even better state in which to live our lives and build our dreams,” Arch said in his closing address. “It was hard work this session, but you proved that you can do the hard work. Next session will be no different.”
Arch told senators to pay attention to fiscal dynamics in Washington, D.C., which could fall back on Nebraska, and to the next state revenue forecast this Oct. 31, on Halloween. 
Multiple state senators have noted congressional talks on Medicaid and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits could pass costs back on to Nebraska.
Gov. Jim Pillen and Arch agreed that budget adjustments for the 2025-27 fiscal years “will be a priority” in 2026. That agreement came after Pillen unsuccessfully tried to line-item veto multiple items from the state’s budget bills. Lawmakers rejected the vetoes as not having been properly filed with the Legislature, and Pillen ultimately withdrew his vetoes.
As of this time, neither Pillen nor lawmakers have announced plans for a 2025 special session. 
A total of 204 bills passed this session, according to a count by the Legislature. Arch said 113 more bills were amended into those bills that have or will soon become law. Most bills that do not have a set date to take effect will become law Sept. 3, three months after adjournment.
Pillen has committed to not vetoing any of the bills sent to him before Monday. 
Arch said senators requested more than 1,600 amendments and 845 fiscal notes during the session. While 715 bills, 18 constitutional amendments and six more policy-based resolutions were introduced this session, Arch said 374 more proposals were drafted but not introduced.
Any legislation not passed in 2025 will return in 2026, such as slowing down voter-approved annual increases to the state minimum wage, increasing paid family and medical leave for teachers, requiring health care facilities to cremate or dispose of aborted fetal remains or creating second chance relief for certain state offenders.
Arch told his colleagues to consider over the next seven months what they want to bring to the 2026 table, including what issues are most important to constituents and the state generally.
“Think about how we’re going to work together as a diverse group of individuals,” Arch said, “with differing opinions, different life experiences, but with a common goal of building consensus and crafting a policy that even makes this state of Nebraska better and better.”
Lawmakers will reconvene Jan. 7, 2026, and stay for up to 60 legislative days, or around mid-April.

Days before Pennsylvania lawmakers advanced Gov. Josh Shapiro’s plan to expand the commonwealth’s renewable energy resources, the Trump administration ordered a fossil fuel-fired power plant outside Philadelphia to keep running past its planned retirement date.
The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday ordered Pennsylvania’s electricity grid operator PJM Interconnect and owner Constellation Energy to keep the Eddystone Generating Station in Delaware County ready to meet peak power demands. It was scheduled to cease operations Saturday.
The order highlights challenges facing Pennsylvania policymakers as they work to ensure there’s enough electricity for industry and residents while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Legislation that would set a more ambitious goal for renewable energy production in what Shapiro describes as an all-of-the-above approach to meeting demand passed a state House committee on Monday.
House Bill 501 would enact the Pennsylvania Reliability Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS), which is part of Shapiro’s broader energy policy dubbed the Lightning Plan. It would require 35% of the state’s energy to come from clean sources including solar, wind, nuclear and other emerging technologies by 2040.
Other aspects of the plan would provide tax credits for renewable energy development and establish a dedicated board to streamline energy permitting to incentivize developers to prioritize clean energy.
While President Donald Trump has backed the oil, gas and coal industries since he campaigned for his first term in 2016, the DOE order to keep the Eddystone Generating Station online cited an “emergency situation” as PJM warned that electricity demand in the 13 states it serves could soon outpace the opening of new power plants.
PJM projects its peak demand will grow by about 70,000 megawatts to 220,000 megawatts by 2040. The growth is being driven by the increased electrification of transportation and industry and the proliferation of data centers to satisfy the demand for computing power from artificial intelligence and other technologies. 
PJM’s process to authorize new power plants to connect to the grid faces a backlog including hundreds of gigawatts of renewable energy while about 20% of its existing generating capacity is expected to retire in the next five years.
Starting this month, consumers in Pennsylvania and the rest of PJM’s footprint will see electric bills increase by 10% to 20% as a result of soaring prices in last July’s capacity auction, in which electricity generators bid to provide generating capacity.
Pennsylvania, meanwhile, lags behind most of the nation in renewable energy development. An analysis of federal energy data by PennEnvironment put the commonwealth behind all but Washington and Alaska, which tied for last place. 
Debate on the renewable energy legislation Monday in the House Environmental and Natural Resources Committee demonstrated the tension between Pennsylvania’s energy future and its past.
Republicans argued the goal of obtaining 35% of the state’s energy from clean sources by 2035 is unrealistic. Natural gas and coal provide reliable electricity while helping to drive Pennsylvania’s economy, they said.
Rep. Tim Twardzik (R-Schuylkill) said renewable energy sources including solar and wind power would take up too much land. And subsidizing them at the expense of established fossil fuel sources would hurt workers and consumers by taking away jobs and increasing prices. 
“It’s just going to waste money and not solve our problems,” Twardzik said.
Democrats said diversifying the state’s energy portfolio is essential to staving off an energy crisis. 
“We are at a crossroads,” Rep. Chris Pielli (D-Chester) said. “I think that we should be looking at many forms of energy, nuclear, geothermal, and even using our gas and our oil.”
Pielli rebutted claims by Republicans that the renewable energy legislation would create winners and losers. He argued Pennsylvania’s gas industry benefitted from a subsidy when lawmakers chose not to impose an excise tax on gas production, forgoing billions in revenue.
Deeply conservative Texas, Pielli noted, leads the nation in both natural gas production, wind and solar energy.
“Let’s look at that … recognizing that this bill is an opportunity that we can fine tune, where we can use any and all of these resources to protect our consumers going forward when it comes to our power,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wind-farm-1536x1026-1-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 20:02:01.564936

(Screenshot of Charleston County Sheriff's Office livestream)Two alleged cartel members and one person wanted by Interpol for murder in Honduras were among at least 80 people arrested during a weekend sting operation at an unlicensed nightclub in Charleston County.
Federal, state and local law enforcement raided the Alamo nightclub, located in an industrial area outside the town of Summerville, around 3 a.m. Sunday. The club had no license to operate or to sell alcohol.
About 200 people were there at the time of the raid. The investigation, dubbed “Operation Last Stand,” continues, Charleston County Sheriff Carl Ritchie said during a news conference Monday.
They included 10 juveniles as young as 13 — including one reported as missing — as well as potential human trafficking victims. They were turned over to social service agencies. Officers also seized guns, cocaine and cash, Ritchie said, without giving details on the amounts.
Those arrested included two people believed to be “high-level cartel members” associated with the Mexico-based Los Zetas cartel and the Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua gang, said U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent Cardell Morant.
He referred to the club scene as a “cartel afterparty.” More than 80% of those arrested are living in the United States illegally, he said.
The law enforcement agencies went in with 116 warrants for 80 people.
Five people were arrested for criminal offenses, Morant said.
Law enforcement officials did not provide names of those arrested or a list of charges.
“Some of these individuals have been charged with serious offenses,” which include the person wanted internationally for murder, Morant said. Other charges made in the raid include “assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, possession of a controlled substance and a felon in possession of a firearm,” he said.
The investigation began in November with officers looking into noise complaints and reports of assaults occurring in the parking lot, Ritchie said.
“Bad guys like to celebrate too. So, this was their way to let off some steam, and they were, unfortunately, doing it right here in the community,” Morant said.
“This operation was not only about immigration enforcement. It was also about restoring order, removing threats from our streets and ensuring the safety and well-being of Charleston-area residents,” he added.
About a dozen local, state and federal agencies participated in the raid.

(NPS/Jacob W. Frank)A record number of out-of-state visitors spent roughly $5 billion while traveling to Montana in 2024, money that drives one of the state’s strongest economic sectors through tourism-oriented businesses.
That’s according to the latest report on nonresident visitation to Montana conducted by the University of Montana’s Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research (ITRR), released last month. The quarterly nonresident research has been ongoing since 2009 and involved 11 surveyors conducting nearly 22,000 surveys at airports, rest areas and gas stations across the state in 2024. 
In 2024, roughly 13.8 million visitors — a record number by a million — spent around 10% less during their travels through the state compared to 2023, showing a lower impact to the state’s economy than in recent years, but still representing a substantial jump from pre-pandemic trends. 
The $5.0 billion out-of-state travelers spent in Montana directly supported $3.9 billion in local economic activity in the state through purchases of gasoline, groceries and retail, and use of services such as lodging, outfitters and guides and costs of license and entrance fees. 
Visitor spending directly supported an estimated 38,240 jobs, according to ITRR data, comprising roughly 1-in-15 Montana workers, but lower than an estimated 48,340 the year before. Visitors also generated more than $308 million in state and local taxes, and reduced the average tax burden on Montana households by $680, down from last year, but in line with 2022 figures.

The visitation figures track with recent data released by the National Park Service showing that both Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park saw the second highest number of visitors on record in 2024. The two parks are listed as top attractions by visitors, serve as anchors for the state’s outdoor economy, and are crucial to their respective regions’ local communities.  
Results from the ITRR continue to track with data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that show Montana’s outdoor recreation sector makes up 4.6% of the state’s economy, the third highest contribution of any state. 
According to ITRR, nonresident tourism had a more than $6.1 billion contribution to the state’s economy, combining direct spending from tourists, indirect impacts from travel-related business purchases and “induced impacts” from employees in adjacent industries. 
Here are some highlights from the 2024 visitor spending data.

Jim Pillen, center, greets State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil on the final day of the 2025 legislative session. June 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, in his end of session speech to state lawmakers, called the state budget “historically conservative.”
Pillen portrayed the session as “positive,” highlighting the passage of some of his priorities this session, including limiting high school and college sports participation to sex at birth, banning lab-grown meat, prohibiting cell phones in schools and a merger of the state’s agencies in charge of overseeing water quality and quantity. He also praised a budget with a two-year average general fund spending growth of 1% a year. 
“I believe we are setting the Cornhusker State up for success, and when we commit to strong fiscal conservatism and reduce the tax burden for Nebraska families, the potential of this place for generations to come is beyond our understanding,” Pillen said.
Pillen said he and state lawmakers worked together to pass a “budget package that said no when we needed to say no” and put the state’s “idle pillowcase money to work.” 
Nebraska lawmakers balanced the budget mostly by using the state “rainy day” cash reserve fund and a series of cash transfers and spending cuts to fill budget holes. Democratic lawmakers have compared the budget to “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” a fairy tale where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing. Pillen tried and then withdrew his intended $14.5 million in general fund line-item vetoes to the budget.
Property tax relief, a top Pillen priority, was dealt a blow when the Legislature’s last shot at meeting his pledge to keep property taxes flat this year fell short last month, Nebraska’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would have shifted sales taxes toward property tax relief. 
That bill became the third property tax package in the past year to propose and lack support for broadening the sales tax base to lower property taxes. Pillen’s push for “Winner-Take-All” failed, as grabbing too few votes to overcome a filibuster. 
The governor, whose family owns a major hog operation based in Columbus, alluded to addressing property taxes in future sessions. 
“We can decrease spending and actually fix our tax system — and we have to fix it because it is badly broken,” he said. 
Pillen achieved some of his culture war-related goal issues, including the school sports law, a law against foreign agents, age verification for future social media accounts and the ban on lab-grown meat. 
Pillen didn’t directly address some of the session’s controversies, among them several heated debates as the GOP-majority Legislature pushed back against a handful of ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters, including new laws requiring paid sick leave, raising the minimum wage, repealing school vouchers, and legalizing medical marijuana. 
He said he would continue to work with lawmakers to serve the people of Nebraska — and this time made no mention of a possible special session.
“I’m really proud to have partnered with you all on many of these initiatives,” Pillen said, “So good news in just seven or so months, we all get to do it over again.”

(Photo provided by Southern University)The Louisiana Legislature has approved legislation to increase mandatory anti-hazing training for fraternities, sororities and other college student organizations from one hour to two hours. 
House Bill 279 by Rep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, originally would have required all college students to take a one credit-hour anti-hazing course. Because of the potential cost , it was amended to double the training students in campus organizations receive. It is not expected to cost anything more as the courses are already in place. 
These groups are already under mandate to have each member complete a one-hour course on the dangers of hazing. 
Boyd’s bill passed both chambers with just one lawmaker, Rep. Rodney Schamerhorn, R-Hornbeck, voting against it. It next goes to Gov. Jeff Landry for approval.
Boyd’s bill was filed in the wake of the death of Southern University student Caleb Wilson, who was killed in a hazing incident for a fraternity he was pledging. 
Lawmakers will also convene a task force named after Wilson to study hazing and  submit a report to the legislature by Jan. 31 next year. Its members will evaluate current state and federal laws on hazing and policies against it at colleges and universities. They will also review best practices from across the country and make recommendations for policies for Louisiana to adopt.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of the Kansas Legislature You Tube channel)TOPEKA — Filing reports of suspected child abuse or neglect is the most difficult part of Marcus Stratton’s job as a school counselor at a Kansas middle school.
Stratton is a mandatory reporter, the title given to educators, health care workers, social workers and members of law enforcement who are required by law to report any suspicion of neglect or abuse. Teachers and school staff are the most frequent reporters of child neglect and abuse in Kansas, but minimal feedback, communication and transparency from the state foster care agency have left more questions than answers.
Testifying before the Joint Committee on Child Welfare System Oversight, Stratton asked lawmakers Monday for more training for mandatory reporters and greater clarity on how the process of investigating allegations of abuse or neglect works within the state’s foster care agency, the Kansas Department for Children and Families.
“When I get to a point where I have to make a mandatory report for a child, I can no longer meet the needs of the child in a public school setting,” Stratton told lawmakers.
Teachers are taught not to investigate when they suspect potential abuse or neglect. Once a report is made, Stratton said he rarely knows the outcome. He only knows whether or not it has been assigned for investigation.
“Once we make the report, we may be meeting our legal obligations to do that, but we still have the relationship with the student that we have to maintain,” he said.
Stratton is a counselor at Pauline South Intermediate School in Wakarusa, and he was not speaking as an official representative of the school. With concern for the wellbeing of students, he regularly questions how to navigate the opaque mandatory reporting process. He said the process can only be as good as those who are making the reports and those who are receiving them. 
Of the 71,000 reports of potential abuse, neglect or a family in need of assessment to the Kansas Protection Report Center in 2024, about half are assigned to an investigator, according to DCF data. Almost 30% of reports come from educators.
In his nine years as a counselor, Stratton has never been called to court to testify in a child’s case after filing a report. His experience with the Kansas Department for Children and Families has been good about 90% of the time, he said.
“In the years that I’ve been making mandated reports, I haven’t come up with a magic formula,” Stratton said. “There’s so many different types of situations, so many different types of people. There’s just no way that I think you can perfectly legislate something like this.”
The more information, the better, he said. He suggested training for mandatory reporters to understand how DCF’s process of investigation works and what qualifications and training an investigator might have.
Eudora Republican Sen. Beverly Gossage, a former teacher and chair of the committee, said Stratton’s concerns resonated with her. She relayed her experience with an old student who came to her sixth-grade class with a “belt mark” across his face. He always had a story, Gossage said.
After the second time, she filed a report.
“It does put you in an awkward position,” she said.
The process can be a gray area for mandatory reporters, who may not know the consequences of filing a report and whether their anonymity will be maintained.
It can be difficult to be specific when filing reports, said Monique Young, a Missouri educator who has also worked in Kansas. In Missouri, counselors, teachers and administrators participate in required training to recognize when a student needs help, but it can be a tough balance, Young said, when no central system exists within schools to ensure the best outcomes for both reporters and students.
Often, information regarding investigations is confidential, said Tanya Keys, the deputy secretary of DCF. But she took Stratton’s suggestions in stride, indicating there might be opportunities for educators to gain insight into the mandatory reporting system. 
Before Stratton left the committee room Monday, Gossage gave Keys and Stratton homework. She requested they meet again outside of the committee setting to discuss Stratton’s concerns and find solutions that can apply to all mandatory reporters.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-02-at-4.34.48 PM-1024x557.png,,,2025-06-02 19:06:00.364371

Megan Hunt of Omaha speaks on the floor of the Legislature on May 19, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner).LINCOLN — Two Nebraska bills most vulnerable to a governor’s veto in the waning hours of the 2025 Nebraska Legislature are about to become law without his objection.
The pair — separate priority bills from Omaha State Sens. Megan Hunt and Terrell McKinney — were among a late wave of 26 bills approved by the full Legislature and awaiting action by Gov. Jim Pillen as lawmakers adjourned for the year. Both the Hunt and McKinney bills cleared final votes Friday by less than the number needed to override a veto.
Pillen, in a letter early Monday to the Clerk of the Legislature, said all the bills on his desk “will become law without my objections in the coming days.” Included in the 26 bills Pillen is expected to approve were three sent to his desk Monday.

That negated any need for veto override attempts on the Legislature’s final day.
Hunt said she was “surprised,” and excited to see her Legislative Bill 275 cross the finish line.
The bill reforms the use of Social Security benefits received by eligible Nebraska foster children, in part strengthening communication between the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and the youth’s representative. Hunt described recipients as among the state’s most vulnerable, because the benefits are related to the death of a parent or guardian or a physical or mental disability.
DHHS currently intercepts the Social Security benefits bound for those kids and uses the funds to offset the state costs of the youths’ care. LB 275 requires DHHS to set aside at least 20% of all Social Security benefits in a separate trust fund, beginning when the foster youth is 14, with the percentage increasing gradually to 50% at age 18. Meant to ease transition to adult independence, it brings Nebraska “in line with federal law to provide further accountability, transparency and conservation of a portion of the funds in a trust account for the youth’s own use when they exit state care.” 
Hunt said she thought LB 275, which advanced to Pillen’s desk on a 29-19 vote, might be in jeopardy partly because of a roughly $1 million in annual notification and operational costs estimated in a fiscal note and also because of a pattern of Pillen’s vetos, which she said have been “less about policy and more about the introducer.”
McKinney said Monday that he was unsure what Pillen might do on LB 48, his bill aimed at helping to keep youths out of the criminal justice system. He said he was happy to see it unobstructed by a veto, and proud of the accomplishment.

“It’s good legislation that’s going to help a lot of families and juveniles, keeping them out of the system,” he said.
LB 48 calls for an around-the-clock Family Resource and Juvenile Assessment Center pilot program in Omaha. The goal is two sites that will address family dynamics, mental health, substance abuse and educational challenges to juvenile delinquency. 
The bill faced resistance and near demise during earlier legislative debate. It passed final reading on a 27-21 vote.
Of 26 bills awaiting Pillen’s signature Monday, two others passed final legislative debate with 33 votes; four passed with vote tallies in the mid to upper 30s, and the rest secured 40 or more votes.
Said Hunt: “I’m excited now to breathe a sigh of relief and move on to the next issue.”

Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, lead sponsor of the bill to ban assault-style weapons, during a House Committee on Judiciary on Wednesday, March 26, 2025. Knight's amended bill is set for a vote on Tuesday, June 3. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)After securing a big win at the federal level Monday, Rhode Island’s gun safety advocates are hoping the momentum continues  at the State House Tuesday when a House panel will consider an amended bill to ban assault-style firearms.
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge by gun rights advocates against the state’s 2022 law banning firearm magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement he’s grateful the court did not overturn the ban.
“As the Rhode Island General Assembly prepares to vote on the assault weapons ban, it is my hope that this office’s successful defense of the large-capacity magazine ban inspires our leadership to act, and act boldly,” Neronha said. “One life lost to gun violence is one too many.”
The 15-member House Committee on Judiciary meets Tuesday at 3 p.m. to consider advancing amended legislation sponsored by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, to the floor for a full vote by the chamber.
Knight’s bill has support from 38 of the House’s 75 members. Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has previously indicated support for a ban on assault-style weapons. 
The proposal includes revisions based on feedback from a March 26 Judiciary Committee hearing where hundreds of Second Amendment advocates in yellow T-shirts outnumbered gun safety advocates.
Under Knight’s bill, assault weapons are defined as semiautomatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns equipped with accessories such as pistol grips, folding stocks, or threaded barrels. The amended version removed bayonet mounts and certain .22 caliber rimfire rifles and Olympic-style target pistols from the definition.
The amended legislation now takes effect July 1, 2026, rather than Jan. 1, 2026. Knight said the new date was picked in order to give store owners more time to prepare for the change, and for state and local police to develop a voluntary firearm certification program for assault-style weapons acquired ahead of the ban.
Knight’s original legislation proposed that grandfathered weapons be registered with state or local police. Weapons acquired ahead of the ban would continue to be exempt from the legislation, but the amended bill also exempts firearms passed down through a family.
The amended bill now exempts retired law enforcement officers. That’s in addition to active police and members of the armed forces who would be allowed  to keep assault-style weapons under the original bill.
“We got rid of one or two things upon reflection we probably did not need,” Knight said in an interview Monday. 
“The vast majority of Rhode Islanders want this policy change,” he added, acknowledging two recent polls that found widespread support for banning assault weapons.
A University of New Hampshire poll released May 29 found that 55% of the 653 residents surveyed were in favor of banning the sale and manufacture of firearms with “military-style features.” A February poll conducted for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO found 64% of Rhode Islanders support the ban.
‘It’s our responsibility’
Knight has backed legislation to ban assault-style weapons since 2018 — the same year then-Gov. Gina Raimondo established a gun-safety working group after a gunman killed 17 students in Parkland Florida with an AR-15.
“You see random acts of violence that involve multiple victims stepping up,” Knight said. “It’s our responsibility as a legislature to provide public order and safety.” 
What’s not changing in the amended bill: Violators of the proposed ban would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and forfeiture of their assault-style weapon. 
“It’s a good bill,” Melissa Carden, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence, said in an interview. “This is really momentous. This is the reason that the coalition was formed, it’s been our priority for a really long time.”
But Knight’s changers are still not enough to appease gun rights advocates, who remain opposed to the proposed ban. 
“Their concern is passing a bill for the win, and not reducing gun violence,” Glenn Valentine, president of the Rhode Island Second Amendment PAC, said in a text message Monday.
The Gaspee Project, a nonprofit that touts its opposition to progressive and “special interest” policies on its website, took to social media Friday evening to urge gun owners to keep opposing Knight’s legislation.
“This amended version is just as awful as the original,” the group wrote on X.
Companion legislation is filed in the Senate by Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, where the bill has 23 additional sponsors — including Senate President Valarie Lawson. DiPalma’s bill was heard by the Senate Committee on Judiciary on May 14 where it was held for further study
The bill has not been scheduled for the committee’s consideration as of Monday.

(Screenshot/SEIU 1199NE  video) Two days after their work-sponsored health insurance expired, striking Butler Hospital workers marched two-and-a-half miles from the Providence psychiatric hospital to the headquarters of its parent company, Care New England.  
The demonstration marked week three of the strike, which began on May 15 and has seen approximately 800 unionized members SEIU 1199 New England cease work to protest what they call unfair labor practices, including subpar wages and inadequate safeguards around workplace violence.
“We remain ready and willing to settle a fair contract and return to the patients who need us,” Niki Anthony, a registered nurse and member of the union’s bargaining committee, said in a statement Monday, adding that the workers marched on the headquarters to make the entire management team “stop the delays and end the bad faith bargaining.”
Striking Butler Hospital workers take labor dispute to Rhode Island State House

According to a statement from Butler President and COO Mary Marran, negotiations will resume on Wednesday, June 4.
“Butler believes productive dialogue on meaningful issues is the best way to reach an agreement,” Marran wrote. “We are returning to the table with a steadfast commitment to constructive dialogue and the goal of reaching a fair and sustainable agreement.”  
Marran also briefly described the tensions from last week’s attempts at negotiations, in which both parties sat down with agents of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to hash it out. Wednesday and Thursday saw negotiating sessions take place over 11 hours, with no conclusion agreed upon even with the feds’ help. 
“On the evening of May 29, 2025, after conferring with the parties, FMCS mediators recommended concluding the bargaining session in order to allow the parties the opportunity to consider modifications to their positions,” Marran wrote.
But union members alleged the new set of contract proposals they offered that Thursday were strategically declined by the hospital.
“It’s crystal clear management is using our access to healthcare as a weapon to break our resolve,” said Dan Camp, who works in behavioral health call intake, in a statement Friday. 
Since then, workers’ health insurance has been officially terminated by the hospital. A May 19 letter from Butler management first informed union members they could lose medical, dental, and vision coverage on May 31 if they remained on strike. Other benefits — including disability, life, and accident insurance — had already lapsed on May 14.
Hundreds of striking workers have since enrolled for new health coverage via HealthSource RI, the state’s insurance marketplace. According to SEIU 1199 New England, the union organized a crisis team to assist workers with one-on-one enrollment support ahead of the May 31 deadline.
After negotiations stalled last week, Gov. Dan McKee issued a statement on the strike Friday, and penned a letter to the leaders of both sides.
“As I said before this strike began, my priority as Governor is the health and well-being of all Rhode Islanders — I know you share that commitment,” McKee wrote in his letter to Marran and SEIU 1199 Executive Vice President Jesse Martin.
“That is why I strongly urge both hospital leadership and the union to immediately return to the bargaining table to reach a fair and timely agreement,” McKee’s letter continued. “I know that you both take your responsibilities seriously and want what is in the best interest of the people you serve.”

A new law would get the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources more actively involved in regulating Vermont farms to meet federal water quality requirements, but critics say it doesn’t go far enough.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont is violating the federal Clean Water Act. Will a new state legal framework for regulating farm runoff help?.","Rep. David Durfee, D-Shaftsbury, chair of the House Agriculture Committee, explains details of a farming regulations bill to the House Democrat caucus at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday, May 27. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn December 2019, state agriculture investigators observed manure from Iraburg’s Nelson Farms, a dairy in the Northeast Kingdom, running into a local waterway. The staff from Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets were required under a 2017 interagency agreement to report the runoff to Vermont’s Agency of Natural Resources immediately. But they failed to do so until four months later, according to a petition filed to federal officials by environmental advocates. This misstep wasn’t uncommon. A month earlier, the agricultural agency had inspected the McKnight Farm in East Montpelier and found agricultural wastes flowing through a barnyard and entering surface water, but didn’t refer the matter for over a month.The mistakes are part of a broader problem in Vermont, state environmental advocates say, in which a conflict between the agencies that govern natural resources and agriculture has thwarted a regulatory system that’s required under the federal Clean Water Act. Since January, they have urged the Legislature to step in. “I feel strongly that this is not a choice,” Elena Mihaly, vice president for the Vermont chapter of the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a legislative committee hearing on May 15. “We’ve gone too long trusting that this system is working and it is not.”Last summer, the federal Environmental Protection Agency agreed that the state has been violating the law.The only way to come into compliance, the EPA told the Agency of Natural Resources, would be to put the state environmental agency in charge of inspecting farms and issuing permits related to water quality — dramatically shrinking the agriculture agency’s role. This legislative session, a debate about how to fix the system has been playing out in Montpelier. A bill, S.124, which cleared the Vermont Legislature on Friday and is headed to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk would give the Agency of Natural Resources a greater role. If the bill becomes law, the agency will be authorized to hire three new staff members who would lead some farm investigations. The agency would also be tasked with undertaking a new permitting program to align with federal law and with forming a stakeholder group to work on water quality regulations that includes environmentalists and farmers. The leadership of both of the state agencies have backed the bill.But critics say this solution may not move the needle. Beyond these changes, the bill looks much like the ghost of regulations past: by maintaining a familiar split between agencies, it could also amount to maintaining the status quo. “We’re in the middle of a long-term process to build a better regulatory program,” said Scott Sanderson, director of Conservation Law Foundation’s farm and food initiative, in a statement. “This bill takes important first steps and creates a needed stakeholder process, but it doesn’t confront what EPA identified as a root cause of Vermont’s broken system: the division of jurisdiction over agricultural water pollution between the Agency of Natural Resources and the Agency of Agriculture.” READ MORE
‘Zero is unique’Under federal law, farms are allowed to  send runoff into local waterways only if the farm is monitored under a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation, or CAFO, permit. Vermont has more than 140 medium and large animal operations that could be CAFOs, defined as where animals have been stabled or confined for at least 45 days, which includes most  dairy farms. Another 1,000 small farms are potential CAFOs and need to be monitored for unpermitted waste discharge, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.For more than half a century, the Environmental Protection Agency has delegated the authority for ensuring that farms, waste systems and waterways comply with the federal Clean Water Act to the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources. In a small state, Vermont’s authority to administer the 1974 federal law meant it could staff its state agencies with experts more capable of managing rural places than federal officials traveling in from outside regions, according to Julie Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources.The Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets oversees state monitoring of water quality on farms. The CAFO program is the natural resource agency’s vehicle for that federal regulation, but the state has never issued a single CAFO permit.This fact, and the corroborating examples, became the foundation of a 2022 petition filed by the Conservation Law Foundation, along with the Vermont Natural Resources Council and Lake Champlain Committee, that claimed Vermont was polluting its waterways in violation of the Clean Water Act. The Environmental Protection Agency studied the state for the following two years, launching its own investigation into Vermont farms and the two agencies in charge of monitoring them. In the EPA’s 2024 response to the petition, they wrote that the failure to implement this law was caused by “the division of Vermont’s agricultural water quality program between ANR and AAFM, which has resulted in ANR’s nonperformance of delegated duties,” along with insufficient resources given to ANR to administer the federal program. If the agency didn’t make significant changes, the state’s authority to implement the Clean Water Act would be revoked and the federal government would take over, according to the EPA’s 2024 letter in response to the petition.EPA staff conducted 10 on-farm investigations and found several farms “had evidence of ongoing or recent discharges that appear unaddressed.” EPA staff also looked at 113 complaints about discharge received by either agency between February 2021 and January 2023. Many complaints described discharges to surface waters, but almost a quarter of these complaints were unresolved, and about 45% were concluded without a violation notice from ANR, according to the EPA. Only 7% were noted as Clean Water Act violations, and even then, the farm was allowed to correct the violation without a penalty or CAFO permit requirement.“Us issuing zero is unique,” said Moore of the lack of CAFO permits in the state. But even with a better system, still only a small subset of farms would likely be required to obtain a CAFO permit. In neighboring states like New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, a vast majority of farms are not regulated as CAFOs, Moore said.While the agriculture agency has no authority to enforce the law, it has nine staff at least partially responsible for investigating farms for pollution to surface water, known as discharges, while the natural resources agency only has two. Because of their limited staffing capacity, ANR has long relied on agriculture officials to report discharges back to them.“If we’re going to have a robust CAFO program, we don’t have enough capacity currently,” Moore said. By the end of 2026, ANR will have to report back to EPA on what they think they’ll require in staffing, according to their corrective action plan. While the EPA gave four options to remedy the problem, the federal agency said the only viable option that would allow the state to stay in charge of enforcement was “consolidated agricultural regulatory authority with ANR,” meaning ANR should be the lead agency monitoring water quality on farms.The Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets declined an interview request for Secretary Anson Tebbetts and instead sent a comment over email.“The Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets is working closely with the Agency of Natural Resources to address the issues raised by the EPA,” wrote Scott Waterman, director of communications for AAFM. “We are proud of the work of our Vermont farmers who are doing the hard work to improve our environment. That work will continue today and well into the future.”Julie Moore, Vermont’s secretary of the agency of natural resources, speaks during a roundtable hosted by U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held to discuss the role of agriculture in addressing climate change and water quality at the ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain in Burlington on Aug. 19, 2021. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerSource of pollution mattersThe split between the two agencies goes back to the split between how Vermont monitors water quality, distinguishing between two kinds of sources of pollution: nonpoint and point sources. Nonpoint pollution is diffuse, like runoff from rain or snow flowing over land, while point source pollution comes from a singular and identifiable source, like a pipe or ditch. For decades, Vermont has regulated farms with this separation in source pollution. Nonpoint sources are regulated by the state’s agricultural agency, while point sources are meant to be regulated by ANR.CAFOs are considered point sources due to the amount of waste they produce and how that waste is stored, in lagoons or spread as fertilizer over farm fields. When manure or waste is discharged into a waterway, the CAFO needs a permit. In the last five years, the state Agency of Agriculture has reported 170 potential discharges to ANR, according to the agriculture agency’s attorney, Steve Collier. But neither agency knows how many of those were investigated, nor how many showed evidence of an actual discharge, according to attorneys for both agencies who testified in front of the House Environment Committee in May.Farmers have long worked with the agricultural agency and have developed trust that its officials are working to protect their interests as agriculture faces increasing challenges from global economic rifts and climate change. They’re not as used to working with ANR, largely because Vermont’s CAFO program is underfunded and understaffed, meaning farmers have interacted less frequently with ANR than they might have under a more robust program, according to Moore.“I anticipate there are some farms that would require CAFO permits,” Moore said. “But part of our challenge as we sit here today is that we don’t know what we don’t know as far as the number of farms.”Because no permits have been issued before, implementing such a system has struck a nerve in the farming community.“It doesn’t exist, but people worry about the worst version of it,” Moore said. “Most Vermonters prefer not to be regulated.”Collier told lawmakers in May that it wasn’t a victory for the state to issue a CAFO permit. “It’s a victory to have farms not discharging,” Collier said.But as the 2022 petition and the EPA response showed, farms are discharging, and a CAFO permit is meant to predate a discharge. Without the permit, that discharge is illegal under the Clean Water Act. Therefore a CAFO permit could be a protective measure for farmers, but only if they’re issued.“We all agree that (the agency of) agriculture’s program is pushing farms to achieve a no discharge standard, so the question is what happens when they don’t, and if they need time to come into compliance,” Moore said.Caroline Sherman-Gordon, the legislative director for Rural Vermont, a group that advocates for small farmers, said farmers would adhere to CAFO permitting if necessary: “They’ll bite into the sour apple,” she said.Rep.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger’Dysfunctional and broken’This isn’t the first time Vermont’s approach to monitoring water quality on farms has been put under a microscope.Challenges can be traced back to 2008, when the Vermont Law School Environmental and Natural Resources Clinic filed a petition  that resulted in a 2013 corrective action plan. Vermont agreed to improve its approach to farms under the requirements of the Clean Water Act.But by 2016, both agencies were attending a bureaucratic version of couples counseling. The  Center for Achievement in Public Service began hosting a series of meetings and retreats for staff members. Early in that process, the center noted the two agencies had divergent missions and cultures and a lack of a shared vision. It noted a history of errors, exclusions, misunderstandings and misinterpretations that “was long and unaddressed,” according to details in the 2022 petition.After a retreat a month later, the center concluded that the Agency of Agriculture focused on promoting farms and supporting people, the other focused on policy and enforcement. When issues arose, so did groupthink: each agency “tended to rely on assumptions about the other group’s motivation,” according to the center.For example, when an ANR officer expressed frustration that an agricultural officer had failed to contact him about a point source discharge in a timely manner, after some back and forth the ANR officer emailed, “It seems pointless to discuss these details anymore when we are both working within such a confusing and highly flawed system.”More emails in 2019 showed that the agricultural agency had called ANR’s work “a waste of taxpayer dollars,” in an email quoted in the petition.Moore wrote in an email to agricultural secretary Tebbetts: “The assertions that our work is either poorly conceived or nefarious makes [it] extremely difficult to engage constructively and needs to stop.”A year later, Moore wrote a memo in response to the governor’s call to improve efficiency across state agencies. She said the dual oversight was fact-intensive, time-consuming, and reduced clarity for the farming community. She proposed transferring agricultural staff responsible for inspections under the Clean Water Act to ANR to create a single program because the division had “led to tension and conflict between the agencies, regulatory uncertainty for farmers, and more time-consuming outcomes for water quality resulting in more pollution.” She suggested it would save two inspector positions and an estimated $350,000.In an email to Secretary of Administration Susanne Young, she called the challenges that existed between the agencies not only institutional and statutory but “at times, even personal.”The Vermont Agency of Administration declined to act on Moore’s suggestion.“It’s really easy to write it in a memo and much more challenging to implement as it involves real humans and changing where they work and who they work for,” Moore said of the memo five years later. “It raised concerns in the agricultural community that they don’t have the same relationship with ANR and therefore we haven’t built trust in that community yet.”But by 2022, the petition was filed by three environmental organizations to the EPA alleging that the relationship was “dysfunctional and broken.”“All Vermonters are harmed by AAFM’s stubborn rivalry with ANR, including farmers,” the petitioners wrote.The EPA report noted that for over 15 years, Vermont has had “ample time and opportunity to cure longstanding program deficiencies” but failed to do so. The EPA concluded that consolidating the authority to implement the agricultural water quality program into ANR “is the only workable solution” to avoid losing the state’s ability to oversee the Clean Water Act.‘This is crazy’Early in the current legislative session, a different bill, H.146 — endorsed by the environmental organizations that filed the 2022 petition — suggested an easy answer: entirely transition the state’s water quality regulation and enforcement to ANR and require all large and some medium farms to obtain federal permits. That bill never left committee.Sherman-Gordon, the legislative director for Rural Vermont, said her organization opposed the original House bill.“What we often hear is that if farmers have to deal with ANR, then they feel less heard and less seen,” Sherman-Gordon said. She said farmers feel historically underrepresented in the legislature, and she doesn’t feel that farmers were appropriately consulted or invited to testify on H.146. “The issue is that ANR hasn’t been doing the job they’ve been told to do, and instead of holding them accountable, the discourse is can we take away jurisdiction without hearing from farmers.”Instead, by mid-May, the compromise bill, S.124, was being discussed in the House Environment Committee as members tried to determine whether to add language that could make the bill more stringent. On May 21, when the committee was voting on that amendment, Collier, with the state’s agriculture agency, interrupted the meeting with a raised hand. In a previous meeting, he’d told the committee that the Agricultural Agency felt the regulatory work was getting done. He argued that the only reason they were discussing this issue was because “the advocates filed a petition and they want ANR to do all the work.”“We have some of the most restrictive water quality regulations in the country so the question is not about whether ANR should do more, it’s whether anyone should do more,” Collier told the committee on May 21.“That’s crazy,” said committee chair Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, clearly frustrated. “We’ve been confronted with a petition that has been years in the making. We have water quality issues, staff are under stress. We need to be engaged in this and empowering the agency to take responsibility,” Sheldon said. “Under the current political regime, ANR hasn’t taken responsibility, and we’re saying they need to take responsibility.”Rep. Rob North, R-Ferrisburgh, encouraged his fellow committee members to “take a breath.” “There’s been a fair amount of animosity pointed towards these two departments that are trying to work together,” said Rep. Christopher Pritchard, R-Pawlet. He claimed that the advocates who wrote the petition had “no skin in the game” and wouldn’t have to deal with the repercussions of the amended bill.“From the point of view of the advocates, the skin in the game we all have is that if we want to have better water quality in our state, this is how to go about it,” Rep. Larry Satcowitz, D-Randolph, said in response.While the EPA’s most recent letter supported S. 124, it acknowledged that it would likely require more legislation in the future. Moore said she expected more information from the federal agency in the coming weeks. ANR plans to do 10 farm inspections this summer and take the lead on inspections required on medium and large farms next year under its revised corrective action plan with the EPA. If the EPA approves of the legislation, ANR will draft a new document that will outline the agreement between the dual agencies by September 1. That document could give ANR new authorities related to inspections and establish a more thorough stakeholder process to help the agencies coexist and reconcile their responsibilities.In the background is an unsettling federal landscape under President Donald Trump’s administration. In committee meetings, legislators have wondered about including language from the federal Clean Water Act into state law. That way, if the federal law is overturned or changed, the state law will remain strong.“There’s real value in having people on the ground doing work that are familiar with the specifics of Vermont and our rural nature and the small, small size of many of our systems,” Moore said. “A lot of that would be lost if the programs were returned to EPA.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont is violating the federal Clean Water Act.

Deidre Grzymala states in her legal complaint that library board member Tammara Hamby defamed her in violation of an agreement between Grzymala and the county upon her resignation as Crawford County Library System director in February 2023. The agreement said Grzymala and the county would refrain from “criticizing, denigrating or disparaging each other.”
At an April 18 library board meeting, Hamby claimed Grzymala was responsible for a First Amendment lawsuit against the county, the library board and others over the library’s segregation of children’s books with LGBTQ+ themes into “social sections.” Three parents sued over the segregation in May 2023, and a federal judge ruled in their favor in September 2024.
The Crawford County Quorum Court voted unanimously at a special meeting in April to accept the library board’s offer to pay nearly $113,000 in legal fees, ending months of dispute over who would foot the bill for losing the case.
Crawford County Library will foot the bill for lawsuit over segregation of LGBTQ+ children’s books

Hamby was among the board members to support the payment and previously supported the segregation of LGBTQ+ children’s books. The county quorum court appointed her to the library board in early 2023, replacing one of three members that resigned en masse after the creation of the “social sections.”
Hamby said April 18 that Grzymala “lied to” her and “caused the lawsuit.” These “defamatory statements… were communicated to thousands of Arkansas citizens” via the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette’s River Valley bureau, Grzymala’s complaint states.
In addition to Hamby and Crawford County, the lawsuit lists “John Doe 1-5” as defendants. Grzymala’s attorney, Christopher Hooks, signed an affidavit attached to the complaint, stating that all the relevant defendants in the case are as yet unknown and will be named in the case upon Hooks learning their identities.
Hooks previously alleged a violation of Crawford County’s “separation agreement” with Grzymala in an April 23 letter to the county seeking $100,000 in damages over Hamby’s remarks.
Grzymala’s lawsuit seeks punitive damages, alleging she has faced “damage to [her] reputation as a librarian/library director, damages to reputation in the community, loss of wages, loss of earning capacity and business opportunity, incidental expenses, mental anguish, [and] extreme emotional distress.”

Grzymala complaint 
The complaint requests a jury trial in the circuit court of Washington County, where Grzymala now lives.
Hamby and her husband, Jeffrey, co-wrote a December 2022 letter to Crawford County pastors, saying LGBTQ+ library books within children’s reach is “grooming a generation of children to feel this is normal and an accepted way of life.”
This was part of a “pressure campaign” to force the library to segregate the books, an action publicly framed as a “compromise,” Grzymala alleges in her complaint.
The county lost a separate lawsuit over Act 372 of 2023, which would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene.” The 18 plaintiffs who sued the state, including Crawford County Library patrons, cited county officials’ statements that Act 372 was a reason to maintain the “social sections.”
A federal judge blocked the challenged portions of Act 372, citing First Amendment violations, in December. The legal fees facing Crawford County defendants in both lawsuits exceeded $575,000, library board chairman Keith Pigg said in April.

Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers together just two weeks after they finished work in […],"GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs (Anna Spoerre/The Missouri Independent).The opening of the legislative special session Monday put partisan and intraparty fights in the Missouri Senate on display as Democrats called for expanded storm relief and Freedom Caucus members called for tax cuts as the price for supporting stadium subsidies.
Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers together just two weeks after they finished work in the regular session to consider a package of tax incentives intended to convince the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to stay in Missouri. 
Kehoe is also asking lawmakers for a $235 million spending bill with $25 million for disaster relief as well as a special tax deduction for the cost of meeting insurance deductibles after a disaster. 
The brief opening session didn’t feature any sharp exchanges, but the bills filed — and the statements made about them — show where the battle lines are being drawn.
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, told reporters that members of his caucus aren’t willing to talk about stadium funding until an appropriations bill and other disaster relief measures are on Kehoe’s desk.
“When that happens and it’s through the House and on the governor’s desk, then we can talk about it,” Beck said.
Members of the Freedom Caucus said they are holding out for a tax cut that benefits all Missourians before considering a stadium plan, said state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance.
Schroer filed a bill to cut the top income tax rate to 4% — it is currently 4.7% — and make the tax flat across all incomes.
“​​The members of the Freedom Caucus, plus the other conservative members that are not necessarily in the caucus, they’ve all expressed that whether it’s income tax, personal property tax or real property tax, for us to sit at the table, and allow tax credits for billionaires to move forward, the little guy needs to get something in return,” Schroer said.
The regular session ended in acrimony when Republicans twice invoked a rarely used procedural move to shut off debate. Democrats had blocked a proposed ballot measure to restore Missouri’s ban on most abortions and a bill repealing the paid sick leave law passed by voters in November.
Democrats vowed that the move ended their cooperation with Republicans and gave a taste of what that meant last week when they stalled the final paperwork of the regular session.
Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers have 60 days to complete work on items in a special session and Kehoe has said he won’t try to impose an artificial deadline. Because of the uncertainty of action in the Senate, the Missouri House won’t convene until next week and will only remain in session if the Senate has passed a bill for it to consider.
But the Chiefs and Royals have only until the end of the month to answer an offer from Kansas to fund new stadiums. Kehoe hopes to have his plan for tax incentives worth about 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums to be passed by then.
The plan for the Chiefs and Royals would take tax money already generated from activities at the stadiums — $28.8 million annually as estimated by the Chiefs and $15 million annually by an estimate from the Royals — and commit it to bond payments for 30 years for the new or upgraded facilities.
The economic activity associated with the Chiefs supports 4,500 jobs, Kehoe contends, and a new stadium for the Royals would generate about 8,400 jobs. 
The spending bill Kehoe wants passed would use $25 million of general revenue to support a new research reactor on the University of Missouri’s Columbia campus, plus funding for a new livestock display barn at the State Fairgrounds in Sedalia and about $50 million to help with construction of a new mental hospital in Kansas City.
The funding for the reactor is $25 million less than Kehoe proposed. State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, introduced an appropriations bill with $75 million for the reactor, plus all the other general revenue projects that died when Missouri House Republicans refused to bring the construction spending bill up for a vote.
“If there is going to be a $25 million variance on agreements made in this chamber, we ought to go $25 million in the other direction,” Webber said.
Webber also introduced a bill imposing a 1% income tax surcharge on incomes greater than $1 million, which he said would bring in about $400 million over three years to support disaster relief.
“There is obviously a belief, among some, that billionaires should be given a sweetheart deal. I would disagree with that,” Webber said. “There is also some concern about whether we can fund disaster relief for some communities in our state that were desperately hit. So what I’ve tried to do is build a bridge between those two issues.”
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican who chairs the Freedom Caucus, introduced a bill to finance the stadiums entirely from donations. He called it the “No Taxation, All Donation Act” and included incentives for giving.
“So if somebody gives over $10,000 to this stadium, then they are able to obtain free parking to be able to get into that stadium,” Brattin said.
The next step will be to send the bills to committees for hearings. That will happen tomorrow and the first hearings will occur soon afterward.
Senate Majority Leader Tony Luetkemeyer, a Republican from Parkville, seemed happy to have gotten past the first day without a filibuster.
“Today went smoothly,” Luetkemeyer said. “And then we’ll just take it day by day and see where we go from here.”

“I am committed to providing safe, secure, and humane environments that support rehabilitation and public safety,” Foreman said in a news release.
Foreman is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served as a sergeant with infantry and security forces for over six years before beginning his corrections and law enforcement career. 
After his military service, Foreman worked with the Federal Bureau of Prisons for more than two decades. He worked at several correctional facilities, including serving as associate warden for FCI Tallahassee, a low-security federal prison for female inmates in Tallahassee, Florida.
Following his time with federal institutions, Foreman went on to work for public correctional facilities such as jail administrator for Jackson County Correctional Facility and assistant warden at Jefferson Correctional Institution in Monticello, Florida. Both facilities have multiple security levels ranging from minimum to medium.
“The Iowa State Penitentiary is a cornerstone of our institution system, and we are confident that Mark is the right leader to guide it into the future,” Iowa DOC Director Dr. Beth Skinner said in a news release.

(Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin on Monday said he could not certify a proposed constitutional amendment related to direct democracy because it violates a new state law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. 
Act 602, which became law in April, prohibits the attorney general from certifying a proposed ballot title with a reading level above eighth grade as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
“The ballot title you have submitted ranks at grade 11.5. Thus, your ballot title requires significant revisions before it complies with the Act,” according to Monday’s opinion, which was prepared by Assistant Attorney General Jodie Keener and approved by Griffin. 
Monday’s opinion identified additional issues with the proposal, including ambiguity regarding the Arkansas General Assembly’s authority and how conflicting measures become law. 
The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment, sponsored by the Protect AR Rights coalition, would amend Article 5 Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution, the section that governs the state’s initiative and referendum process. It would designate as a “fundamental right” the right of voters to propose laws and constitutional amendments that can be put to a statewide vote.
Among its various provisions, the measure would require petition signatures be gathered from at least 15 counties instead of 50 and would explicitly prohibit the Arkansas General Assembly from amending or repealing a constitutional amendment approved by voters. 
This is the second ballot measure proposed this year in response to state lawmakers approving about a dozen direct democracy-related laws during the 2025 legislative session. Supporters of the new laws have said they will ensure the integrity of the initiative and referendum process, while opponents have argued it will make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. 
The direct democracy process allows Arkansans to propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.


Let us know what you think...


 

Protect AR Rights spokesperson Bill Kopsky said in a phone interview that Monday’s decision was expected because the attorney general often rejects the first draft of a proposed ballot title. The ballot question committee intends to request a meeting with Griffin’s staff to gather feedback, Kopsky said.  
In an emailed statement, Protect AR Rights noted this was “the first step in a long process, and our coalition remains fully committed to protecting the rights of Arkansans to shape their own laws.” Griffin’s rejection of the group’s proposed amendment reinforces why it’s “so urgently needed,” according to the group. 
“We’re reviewing the AG’s feedback and will revise and resubmit our amendment. But let’s be clear: the new 8th grade reading requirement — passed by politicians trying to limit access to the ballot — is a serious barrier to a fundamental right,” the statement reads. “We believe measures should be clear, accessible, and accurate. That’s exactly why we’re fighting this provision in court.”
Court filings reveal opposition to intervening motion in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, another ballot question committee pursuing an education-focused constitutional amendment, are trying to challenge Act 602 by intervening in a federal lawsuit that challenges several other new laws governing the state’s direct democracy process. 
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed the lawsuit against the secretary of state in April. The League proposed its own direct democracy-related ballot measure this year that was thrice rejected by the attorney general, including once for violating Act 602. Griffin substituted and certified the popular name and ballot title so it met the eighth grade-reading level requirement on May 21. That means the League can begin gathering signatures to try to place their measure on the 2026 ballot.
In response to the motion to intervene, both the League and the state argued in court filings last week that Protect AR Rights lacks standing and is not entitled to intervene in the case. 
Protect AR Rights could file its own lawsuit if a judge dismisses the motion to intervene, but Kopsky said the court would likely freeze both lawsuits while deciding whether to consolidate them.
“We believe it would slow the process down substantially, which doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s interest,” he said. “So we were surprised that they opposed the motion to intervene, but our legal team is going to respond to it in a way that’s appropriate. The bottom line is we’re committed to protecting the right to direct democracy and the right to have access to ballot measures in the state.”

Claeys, a member of the Kansas Legislature for 13 years, said he accepted appointment to an administrative job in the U.S. Department of Agriculture within under President Donald Trump. He said serving the Salina area was the biggest honor of his life. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican Sen. J.R. Claeys of Salina resigned from the Kansas Legislature after accepting an administrative job with the rural business development service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Claeys, who served 13 years in the House and Senate but lost a GOP primary for secretary of state, disclosed several weeks ago his intent to quit as senior advisor to Attorney General Kris Kobach and as a Republican political consultant for Axiom Strategies.
On Monday, Claeys assumed duties at USDA as director of the Rural Business-Cooperative Service. The federal agency within USDA has responsibility for promoting economic development by supporting rural businesses and cooperatives.
Claeys said he joined the administration of President Donald Trump to “continue to fight for rural Americans.”
“I have had the privilege of serving my hometown in the Kansas Legislature,” Claeys said. “Representing the people of Saline and Dickinson counties, including Salina where I was born and raised, has been the honor of my life.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said he appreciated the role Claeys’ played in shaping the Senate’s budget and tax policies.
“He has helped lead efforts to secure key private and public sector investments into Kansas, particularly his district,” Masterson said.
The 24th District in the Senate, in accordance with Section 5 of the Kansas Constitution, was declared vacant and the process of nominating a replacement could begin. Claeys won reelection to a four-year term in November.
Claeys was the second Republican to recently depart the Legislature for employment at USDA. State Rep. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, stepped down in mid-May to begin work as deputy undersecretary for the agriculture department’s food and nutrition service.
Sedgwick County Republicans nominated Steve Brunk to complete the unexpired portion of Penn’s term. Brunk served as a state representative from 2003 to 2015.
Claeys said the central Kansas region within his legislative district experienced economic growth due to massive federal investment and an influx of state bond revenue that spurred manufacturing expansion and technological evolution. Developments included transportation projects, housing construction, downtown revitalization and growth at Kansas State University’s aviation campus in Salina.
“Rural America is not an afterthought,” Claeys said. “It is where the strongest work ethic exists in our nation. A resource more valuable than any other.”
Claeys was elected to the House in 2012 and transitioned to the Senate in 2020. He worked on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign in 2020. He ran unsuccessfully for Kansas secretary of state in 2010.
In 2012, the Salina Journal reported a company owned by Claeys was the subject of a Federal Trade Commission investigation into sales of worthless “green” certifications to more than 125 companies. The FTC concluded Tested Green, based in Washington, D.C., sold bogus environmental certifications from February 2009 to April 2010.
“This company was putting out a green certification that consumers could pay for that was deceptive,” the FEC said at that time. “It had nothing behind it to prove a company was green.”
The FTC said Tested Green certifications were backed by the National Green Business Association and the National Association of Government Contractors. Those Claeys-owned associations shared an address in the District of Columbia.
Claeys said he launched Tested Green, but turned over management to a “director” when he began the campaign for Kansas secretary of state. Claeys said he was deceived by the director, who he declined to identify.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)As a national outbreak of measles continues, South Dakota has detected its first case of the year.
The state Department of Health said Monday in a news release that the infected person is a Meade County adult who “visited several public locations.”
The department said people may have been exposed to measles in the Rapid City Medical Center Urgent Care waiting room from 7:15 a.m. to 10 a.m. Mountain time on May 28 and the Monument Health Sturgis Urgent Care waiting room from 9:45 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mountain time on May 29.
People who were in those settings should self-monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days, the department said.
‘I question it myself’: South Dakota vaccination rates fall amid mistrust and misinformation

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads through the air from an infected person. People who lack immunity from vaccination or past infection are at high risk of measles infection if they have contact with an infected person.
Measles symptoms appear in two stages. In the first stage, the individual may have a runny nose, cough and a slight fever. The eyes may become reddened and sensitive to light while the fever consistently rises each day. The second stage begins on the third to seventh day of symptoms and consists of a temperature of 103-105 degrees Fahrenheit, and a red blotchy rash lasting for four to seven days. The rash usually begins on the face and then spreads down to the trunk and out to the arms and legs.
The department said the measles vaccine “offers the best protection against infection and avoids the risks that come with infection.” The department said the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine “is highly effective at preventing measles infection, and two MMR doses usually produce lifelong immunity.”
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a measles vaccination rate of 95% is needed to prevent outbreaks, given the highly contagious nature of the virus. 
Vaccination rates have been falling in South Dakota, where incoming kindergarteners are required to be up to date on the MMR vaccine unless they have a medical or religious exemption. Ten years ago, six South Dakota counties had less than 95% of kindergarteners vaccinated for measles, with the lowest being 80%. Now, more than 40 counties in the state are below 95%, with 12 below 80% and five below 70%. 
The South Dakota measles case comes amid the most severe U.S. measles outbreak in decades. According to the CDC, there had been more than 1,000 measles cases detected this year across 33 states prior to the detection in South Dakota.
Last year, South Dakota reported its first measles case in nine years.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A super PAC aligned with statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association has put at least $40 million into an independent expenditure group backing the gubernatorial candidacy of Democrat Sean Spiller, the union’s president, according to new campaign filings.
Working New Jersey, the independent expenditure group, reported spending nearly $37.5 million in a preelection report filed with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission and made public Monday. All its money came from Garden State Forward, the teachers union super PAC.
The spending dwarfs Spiller’s own. The union leader was the only one of the six Democrats vying on June 10 for the nomination to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy to miss fundraising and spending thresholds needed to qualify for matching public funds and debates organized by the commission.
Spiller reported raising a cumulative $438,817 on his most recent campaign filing. He’s spent just $342,059 over the course of the cycle — nearly 110 times less than Working New Jersey has spent boosting his campaign.
Asked to comment, Spiller said in a statement from his campaign that his backing comes from “working folks.”
“I reject the premise that only corporations, Wall Street, and billionaires are allowed to back the candidates that represent their interests,” Spiller said. “It’s time working folks had a chance to speak too. I’m proud that my campaign is supported by tens of thousands of hard-working people all across the state who have made small-dollar donations to help us fight back against the insiders and wealthy interests who are trying to  buy this election.”
The Sunlight Policy Center, a frequent critic of the teachers union, characterized the news of Working New Jersey’s new disclosures about its spending as New Jersey teachers “being forced to fund Spiller’s vanity run.”
“All of this money comes from teachers’ highest-in-the-nation annual dues without their knowledge or consent. It’s a scandal of the first order,” said the group’s founder, Mike Lilley.
The teachers union PAC has endorsed Spiller. The union had invited all other gubernatorial candidates to screen for its backing, but only Spiller did so, it said last August.
Working New Jersey’s role in Spiller’s campaign is unusual. While candidates for high-profile offices like New Jersey’s governorship often see independent expenditures boosting or dinging their candidacies, the degree to which Working New Jersey has supplanted traditional campaign infrastructure and spending stands out.
The group has spent broadly. Its funds have paid for media buys across a range of platforms, a bevy of polls and research, and millions of dollars in consulting.
The depth of its spending may well be unprecedented. Working New Jersey’s $37.5 million in spending lags the combined spending of the race’s five other Democrats by only $818,587, though some of those candidates are also receiving outside support, if at far lower levels.
Independent spending in the 2017 governor’s primary — that was the last year New Jersey had such a race with no incumbent on the ballot — totaled just $9.1 million, according to the Election Law Enforcement Commission.
Garden State Forward, the PAC associated with the teachers union, gave a second independent expenditure group called Protecting Our Democracy $5 million between April 2022 and January 2024. Spiller appeared in ads crafted by Protecting Our Democracy to pledge to protect democracy and create affordable housing and conducted interviews on civic engagement for its social media channels.
Protecting Our Democracy did not file a preelection report — its spending predates the start of the campaign and may not have to be reported — and it’s not clear how much money it’s put into the race.
The group was last publicly active in May 2024, when it launched a 30-second ad with a voiceover from Spiller, who launched his gubernatorial campaign the following month.
Candidates are barred by law from coordinating spending with independent expenditure groups.
The race’s other Democrats have also received outside support, though none at the level Spiller has enjoyed.
Two independent expenditure groups backing Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) — Affordable New Jersey and No Surrender — have spent a combined $11.6 million boosting Gottheimer’s candidacy.
One Giant Leap PAC has put nearly $3.8 million behind Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11), while the Coalition for Progress has backed Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and Assembly candidates he’s recruited with $6.8 million.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney received nearly $4.3 million in backing from the Building Bridges Voter Project.
Early in-person voting for the primary begins Tuesday at 10 a.m., and residents have already returned more than 258,000 mail-in ballots.

José Javier Rodriguez announced Monday that he is a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for attorney general in 2026. 
“Corrupt deal makers have taken over Florida, and we are paying the price,” says Rodriguez in a video message announcing his candidacy posted early Monday afternoon.
“Our power company is planning the biggest rate hike in U.S. history. Our insurance goes up every year. Powerful interests get away with everything they want, looking out for themselves and making deals at our expense and at our children’s expense. And who do we have to stop them? Nobody. Because our attorney general, the guy who should be taking them to court, is too busy enriching himself and only looking out for himself.”
That last reference is to Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who was selected by Gov. Ron DeSantis to serve out the remainder of Ashley Moody’s four-year term in February after he appointed her to the U.S. Senate.
Rodriguez, 46, is a Miami attorney with Cuban roots who graduated from Harvard Law School before getting into electoral politics. He first ran for office in 2012, when he won a House seat representing a portion of Miami-Dade County. In 2016, he left the House and won a seat in the state Senate representing various cities in Miami-Dade (including downtown Miami).
His time in the Legislature ended abruptly in 2020 when he lost his bid for re-election to his Senate seat to Republican Ileana Garcia by just 32 votes out of more than 210,000 cast.
However, it was later exposed in state court that former Republican state Sen. Frank Artiles had orchestrated the candidacy of a no-party-affiliated “ghost candidate” named Alex Rodriguez by offering him $50,000 to enter the contest to take votes away from José Javier Rodriguez.
Alex Rodriguez received 3% of the vote that year. Ultimately, Artiles was sentenced to 60 days in jail for his involvement in that operation.
In 2021 Rodriguez was nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as assistant secretary for employment and training in the U.S. Department of Labor. He wasn’t confirmed however, until March of 2024, clearing the U.S. Senate on a narrow 50-48 vote.
Climate change
A strong advocate for combatting climate change during his time in the Senate, in 2019 Rodriguez filed a bill that would have allowed property owners to sell home-generated solar power to other people or tenants living in their homes.
Such legislation if enacted could have become a threat to investor-owned utilities like Florida Power & Light. It was later reported that then-utility CEO Eric Silagy sent an email to lobbyists for the utility after the bill was introduced, writing, “I want you to be make his life a living hell…seriously.”
Rodriguez referenced that comment in his campaign video on Monday.
“I made my career taking on the corrupt and powerful,” he said.
“When I did, they promised to make my life a living hell. Seriously. So I gave ’em hell right back. Seriously. As an attorney, fighting for janitors, security guards, and cab drivers whose wages were stolen. As a state senator, taking on special interest giants who want more and more of our hard-earned money at every turn. And as an assistant secretary of Labor, proud to fight every day for American workers. And now I’m running to be your attorney general, because Florida needs somebody in its court, and I’ve never been more ready to take on the corrupt and powerful.”
Rodriguez is the first major Democrat to announce his candidacy for the AG position, which has been held by Republican lawmakers ever since Bob Butterworth left office due to term limits in 2002.
Uthmeier controversy
Uthmeier previously served as DeSantis’ chief of staff and has already faced several controversies during his short time in office, which could invite a primary challenge from a fellow Republican. A federal judge has said that she may hold him in contempt of court for informing law enforcement officers that they don’t need to follow a court order barring enforcement of a newly enacted state immigration law.
Uthmeier has also had his name mentioned in the Hope Florida saga. Specifically, he chaired a political committee called Keep Florida Clean last year that was created to oppose Amendment 3, the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis use for adults.
Keep Florida Clean was the ultimate recipient of millions of dollars of the original $10 million that the Hope Florida Foundation received from a $67 million Medicaid overpayment settlement with the state. Uthmeier has denied any involvement in how that money came to Keep Florida Clean.
Like any Democrat now running statewide in what has become a very red state, Rodriguez will definitely be an underdog should he win the Democratic party’s nomination for AG next year.  Evan Power, the Republican Party of Florida chair, blasted the South Florida Democrat as being a “failed politician and liberal ambulance chaser.”
“José Javier Rodriguez has spent his career coddling criminals, chasing ambulances, and auditioning whatever political gig he can land,” Power said in a statement. “Floridians support fighters who protect communities, not far-left hacks who put criminals first.”

The post As leaders of state and regional organizations, we’re sounding the alarm on Trump’s attacks on the arts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS LEADERS OF statewide and regional organizations dedicated to increasing access to the arts, culture, and humanities, we are fortunate to advocate for the power of culture. We revel in the work of bold theater companies and groundbreaking museum exhibits, witness children build confidence and imagination through local arts programs, and applaud the relentless efforts of the cultural sector to improve accessibility for every resident.  Our jobs often find us celebrating the successes that unfold in communities that embrace the arts and the humanities. Today, however, we must sound the alarm. In its first 100 days, the Trump administration took steps that represent a clear and present danger to the cultural vitality of the nation and, we believe, to our democracy. We call on the people of New England to respond proactively to these threats. From executive orders to muzzle free speech to the elimination of jobs and funding, the aggressive attacks on the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services will impact communities in every state. Efforts to radically alter the missions of the Kennedy Center and the Library of Congress signal a willingness to fundamentally change how we create, tell, and share the stories of the American experiment.  We must stand up for these people and organizations. Our economic competitiveness, our educational excellence, and our role as a beacon of equality require us to protect and preserve our cultural sector. Every resident can play a role in this defining moment. While we understand that this fight will require years of shared effort, we see immediate possibilities in several areas.  We call on state and local government to protect our public libraries, parks, museums, and historic sites. These spaces serve as common ground for every resident in a time of division and misinformation.  They face a twofold threat from the federal government’s actions. First, the cuts to the federal agencies will create increased scarcity, leading to a reduction in services. Second, executive orders aimed at whitewashing our history apply pressure to the people operating these public spaces. As democracy is pushed to the brink, we cannot sacrifice the very places dedicated to ensuring a free society. State and local officials must support open access and the truth.  We ask private philanthropy to increase its support for the cultural sector during this critical period. We know that the cascading crises caused by this administration increase demand for every sector. Along with its $29.7 billion economic impact in Massachusetts alone, the cultural sector generates inspiration, helps to solve problems, and increases knowledge for residents in every community.  Our artists and organizations collaborate with sectors including health and human services, education, and climate. As we seek to combat fear and intolerance provoked by the federal government’s actions, philanthropy can ensure that children still learn to dance, that festivals still bring people together, and that the voices, songs, and visions of our artists continue to uplift us in this dark time.  We call on public and private supporters to honor the history of New England by celebrating our right to courageous dissent. We must resist the urge to sanitize artistic expression. The federal government’s efforts to intimidate everyone from theater companies to historians to elementary school teachers cannot be rewarded by the hurried erasure of our values.  We must refuse to sideline the voices of LGBTQ+ communities and people of color. Let our stages and concert halls remain safe places for every resident. Instead of revisiting tired tropes of Americana, we must continue to embrace artwork and scholarship that challenges us. We must serve as a refuge for creatives whose bodies and bodies of work do not fit into the gardens of heroes propped up by this administration.  As leaders, we know that we, too, must deepen our commitments. In our advocacy work, we will not bend in our demands for public funding that is distributed equitably. As funders, we will strive to find more resources so that we can respond swiftly during this emergency. As membership organizations, we will find ways to bring more people into our movement and give them the tools and care necessary to navigate these dangerous waters. Finally, we believe that solidarity is tyranny’s kryptonite. We commit to working collectively to ensure a united front in this struggle. Despite the damage inflicted in recent weeks, we are awash in hope. We witness firsthand the critical role that cultural organizations play in making our region a great place to live and create.   Now more than ever, we believe that the arts and humanities are essential to building a new pathway for the nation. In this perilous moment, the fearless vision of our artists, historians, and educators can define our future.  Michael Bobbitt is executive director of the Mass Cultural Council.

Coleman brings over 30 years of experience in municipal government, having worked in leadership positions across five Massachusetts communities.
His appointment follows the planned departure of current City Manager Mark Whitfield.
“Chris will be a welcomed leader to the City of Milford staff and the community,” Whitfield said. “His deep experience in local government and his strong commitment to community-centered leadership will be invaluable as we continue to grow and improve city services.”
Coleman’s career began with a summer internship in Marblehead, Ma.
He later served in various roles including Treasurer/Collector, Assistant Town Administrator, Director of Human Resources, and Assistant Town Manager.
In 2019, he was appointed Town Administrator in Westwood, a town of 16,000 residents and a $116 million municipal budget.
During his tenure in Westwood, Coleman played a key role in multiple initiatives, including the development of a new elementary school, managing the town’s COVID-19 response, and overseeing critical infrastructure projects such as a proposed new fire headquarters.
He also helped secure and manage over $4.9 million in federal ARPA funds for local improvements.
In a statement, Coleman said he was “deeply honored” to be selected as Milford’s next City Manager and praised the city’s inclusive hiring process.
Coleman is a Credentialed City Manager with the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) and is also affiliated with the Massachusetts Municipal Managers Association and the Massachusetts Interlocal Insurance Association. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Accounting from Clarion University of Pennsylvania.
“I am excited to collaborate with Mayor Culotta and the entire City Council in supporting and advancing the City’s goals,” Coleman said. “I look forward to
earning my place on this exceptional team and contributing to the work of passionate professionals who genuinely care about their city, their colleagues, and the positive impact they make every day in our community.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-02-at-6.27.07-PM.png,,,2025-06-02 19:06:00.364371

(Photo by Carlo Alberto Conti/Getty Images)The federal government is awarding Utah $3 million to purchase conservation easements in southern Utah near Zion National Park. 
The funding — awarded to the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — was announced Monday and will go toward ongoing forest preservation efforts outside of the national park. 
Called the Zion Connectivity Project, the state will direct the funding at two properties totalling 766 acres near the north section of the national park. A conservation easement — a legally binding agreement between a landowner and government that places restrictions on the land for environmental purposes — will prevent the land from being fragmented or developed. 
That will help preserve the ecologically rich stretch of forest.

The region contains a number of springs and streams, including the La Verkin Creek, which feeds into the Virgin River and eventually the Colorado River. The creek supports six native species of fish, like the Virgin River chub and Woundfin, both federally endangered. 
The forest provides critical habitat for the endangered California condor and Mexican spotted owl, and preventing the area from being segmented will help black bear, grouse, deer and elk populations. Old-growth ponderosa pines, some of them hundreds of years old, can also be found in the area.
“The strategic location of this project, combined with the presence of California condors, garnered incredible support from Zion National Park, elected officials, neighboring landowners, and other organizations. Thanks to the efforts of these private landowners and The Conservation Fund, protecting this important forested area was recognized as a priority to the national program,” said Natalie Conlin, forest legacy program manager for the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands.
The Zion Connectivity Project is part of Utah’s Forest Legacy Program, which uses conservation easements throughout the state to safeguard forests from development, protect water resources and habitat, and keep wildlife corridors intact.
The Zion Connectivity Project is sandwiched between two existing Forest Legacy projects — the Zion Overlook and Viewtop projects. The three projects create a combined 1,752-acre stretch of projected land along the northern border of Zion National Park.

Free.,"Rubio in talks for return of wrongly deported 'Cristian,' in flip for Trump administration",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rubio-talks-return-wrongly-deported-cristian-flip-trump-administration,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is personally working to facilitate the return of a man wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, at the request of the Department of Homeland Security, the Trump administration said on Monday in court documents.If successful, the man, identified in documents in federal court in Maryland only by the pseudonym of “Cristian,” would be the first deported person returned from the brutal Salvadoran Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.Bringing him back to the United States would also contradict the Trump administration's long-running argument in the courts and to the public that El Salvador has custody over hundreds of men sent there in March, not the U.S.The Trump-appointed judge in Cristian’s case on Friday had blasted the administration for not detailing to her its actions to return him.The Trump administration has made the same argument in the case of another wrongly deported man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order to facilitate his return.Trump and other top U.S. officials have alleged Abrego Garcia is a gang member, though there is no evidence of that. President Donald Trump has also acknowledged he could bring Abrego Garcia back if he wanted to do so.‘Prompt and diligent efforts on behalf of the United States’The court document in Cristian’s case filed Monday by U.S. Department of Homeland Security official Mellissa B. Harper says that Rubio “has a personal relationship” with El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele and Salvadoran government officials that dates back over a decade to the Florida Republican’s time on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.The case is being heard in Baltimore, in the District of Maryland.“Based on this deep experience with El Salvador and the Secretary’s familiarity with political and diplomatic sensitivities in that country, he is personally handling the discussions with the government of El Salvador regarding persons subject to the Court’s order detained in El Salvador,” according to the document.“Secretary Rubio has read and understands this Court’s order, and wants to assure this Court that he is committed to making prompt and diligent efforts on behalf of the United States to comply with that order,” the document continues.The document notes that DHS has asked the State Department for “assistance in complying with the Court’s order, including by entering into negotiations to facilitate Cristian’s return.”Harper, who submitted the declaration, works at Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division as the acting deputy executive associate director.Judge harshly criticized administrationThe document was filed after U.S. District Judge for the District of Maryland Stephanie Gallagher Friday slammed the Trump administration for its “blatant lack of effort to comply” with her order earlier this month to report steps taken to bring back Cristian, who in court documents is said to be 20 years old.On May 6, she affirmed her decision that the Trump administration must facilitate Cristian’s return.Gallagher, whom Trump appointed in 2018, gave the Department of Justice until Monday to comply with her order.Cristian was among roughly 300 men sent to the Salvadoran mega-prison CECOT. About 200 of those men were removed under an 18th-century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and the rest, such as Abrego Garcia, were removed under other immigration laws.Cristian arrived in the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor and was part of a class action that barred removal from the U.S. while his asylum case was pending in immigration court.Like the Abrego Garcia case, the administration said earlier it was powerless to compel the Salvadoran government to release Cristian, an argument Gallagher expressed frustration with Friday.“Defendants simply reiterated their well-worn talking points on their reasons for removing Cristian and failed to provide any of the information the Court required,” Gallagher wrote in her order.The Trump administration is paying El Salvador up to $15 million to detain removed immigrants from the U.S.“As a Venezuelan native, he is in El Salvador only because the United States sent him there pursuant to an agreement apparently reached with the government of El Salvador,” Gallagher wrote.",,,,2025-06-02 19:06:00.364371

Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) Director Karl Reifsteck on Monday appointed three people to work on the Behavioral Health Executive Committee, which is expected to meet for the first time later this month.
New Mexico this year enacted Senate Bill 3, which replaced the old Behavioral Health Collaborative with the new Behavioral Health Executive Committee, which will be responsible for reviewing and approving regional plans for delivering behavioral health services and overseeing the implementation and funding of those plans, according to an AOC news release.
Reifsteck appointed three people to the panel: Dr. Stacey Cox, of Silver City, chief executive officer of the Center for Health Innovation-New Mexico Public Health Institute; Dr. Violette Cloud, of Albuquerque, senior project associate with Policy Research Associates, Inc.; and former Democratic state Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino, of Albuquerque.
“Each of these individuals bring years of experience and valuable knowledge to the task ahead of improving how New Mexico responds to people struggling with behavioral health issues,” Reifsteck said in a statement.
Ortiz y Pino, in a statement, said he’s been working with “a great many others in the state to slow the steady stream of individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders brought before the courts who need help, not punishment.”
Ortiz y Pino described “the success of treatment courts and diversion projects” currently underway as “heartening,” and noted that now “our challenge is to find ways and resources to ramp those efforts up to full scale and to explore moving from pilots to policies.”
The executive committee will also include Reifsteck, the Health Care Authority cabinet secretary; the Behavioral Health Services Division director; and the Medicaid program director.
“This initiative is the culmination of sustained efforts by state agencies, governing bodies and community partners, and its passage signals a shared commitment to move beyond fragmented approaches and toward a unified strategy that prioritizes access, accountability, and long-term impact,” Cloud, who is also member of the New Mexico Supreme Court’s Commission on Mental Health and Competency, said in a statement.
The committee will hold meetings open to the public in Santa Fe and online every quarter, and report back to the LFC. Its first meeting will be held on June 24, AOC spokesperson Barry Massey told Source NM in an email.
“I am excited to bring the weight of my experience and enthusiasm to building behavioral health services and solutions to New Mexicans in a way that is strategic, measurable and meaningful to people’s lives,” Cox said in a statement.
Last month, AOC named Esperanza Lucero as its first-ever behavioral health integration and reform administrator, the person tasked with implementing major parts of SB3.

Scholten launched his campaign for U.S. Senate June 2, 2025 following U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst's comments on Medicaid cuts. (Photos via Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch and Iowa PBS livestream)Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, launched a run to challenge U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst Monday in the wake of her remarks at a town hall that garnered national backlash from Democrats and health care advocates.
Ernst made her controversial remark, “we are all going to die,” at a Parkersburg town hall Friday after a person in the crowd shouted “people will die” as she was discussing funding cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The cuts are included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill passed by the U.S. House in May.
Though Ernst told the crowd there would likely be changes to the bill from the Senate, she supported the cuts that “make sure that those that are not eligible by the federal standard for Medicaid are not receiving Medicaid.”
Ernst posted an “apology” video Saturday after she drew national criticism for her response. Filmed in a cemetery, Ernst posted a video on Instagram where she sarcastically said she wanted to “sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall.”
“I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth,” Ernst said in the video. “So I apologize, and I’m really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well.”
She recommended “for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”
Scholten announces run
The comments prompted Scholten, a professional baseball pitcher for the Sioux City Explorers and state legislator, to launch his campaign for U.S. Senate. In a video posted Monday, Scholten said he “wasn’t planning on doing this right now, but I just can’t sit on the sidelines” following Ernst’s comments.
“Cutting vital services to give bigger tax breaks to billionaires isn’t just bad policy, it’s theft from people like you and me,” Scholten said. “Maybe it sounds crazy to run against an insider with enough arrogance to laugh at her constituents, but I’ve ran hard races before.”
Scholten ran twice for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District seat, in 2018 and 2020. Though he lost both elections, he was short by an unexpectedly tight margin — losing 47% to 50% to former U.S. Rep. Steve King in 2018 in the longtime conservative stronghold. In 2020, backlash against King for inflammatory comments made on issues like abortion exemptions and white nationalism led to his primary defeat by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who currently holds the seat.
The Democratic state lawmaker said he is running to tackle wealth inequality and improve America’s health care systems.
“I fundamentally believe that we deserve more than a GoFundMe broken healthcare system, a JBS food system and Dollar General economy,” Scholten said. “Ultimately, this race is not about Joni Ernst, and it’s not about me. It’s about the people in Iowa who deserve better: Better representatives who fight against the billionaire elites and special interests who hurt us.”
Nathan Sage, a Mason City Democrat, and Scholten are currently the only Democrats who have announced their bids for the seat. However, more Democratic challengers are expected to join the field, including Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville. Wahls released a statement Friday criticizing Ernst’s comments, saying Iowa “need leaders who will fight for us, not gut health care funding that over 700,000 Iowans rely on.”
“It is of course true that we are all going to die, but our Senators shouldn’t be the ones killing us,” Wahls said.
National Democrats blast comments
National Democrats were quick to respond to Ernst’s comments, saying it further proved that Republicans are aware the Medicaid cuts will lead to preventable deaths. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin made a statement denouncing Ernst’s video Saturday.
“Thoughts and prayers have a new meaning for the Republican Party with Joni Ernst doubling down on her cruel words,” Martin said. “It is immoral and un-Christian to do nothing to prevent people from dying but unfortunately, Trump, Ernst, and the Republican Party are hellbent on putting their own constituents at risk.”
Iowa’s junior U.S. senator is far from the only Republican facing backlash for their support of the budget reconciliation bill that includes substantial federal funding cuts to public assistance programs. GOP members of Congress nationwide have faced fiery crowds at public events for months, met by shouts and jeers from constituents upset about actions taken by Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service and potential cuts to public assistance programs including Medicaid as well as veterans’ benefits and Social Security.
Several Iowans who depend on Medicaid for themselves or their family also decried Ernst’s comments. Patrick Kearns, a registered nurse at the Iowa City VA Medical Center who has two adult children with disabilities on Medicaid, said he wished he was surprised by Ernst’s comments, but that he was not. Kearns said he believes Ernst’s comments reflect how many Republicans view people on Medicaid, pointing to Elon Musk, a former special government employee in the Trump administration, making social media posts referring to people on federal aid programs as a “parasite class.”
“She accidentally said the quiet part out loud … People are going to die, and why are we bothering to keep these folks alive?” Kearns said. “And I mean, (to say) that I’m horrified by it is pretty mild, but I guess the worst part of it is that I’m not surprised.”
Ernst and other Republicans have presented the changes to Medicaid as a means to stop waste, fraud and abuse in the system, and limit the public health coverage to people in need through restrictions like work requirements. At the Friday town hall, Ernst pointed to “illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits” and unemployed adults who do not have disabilities as the people being removed from Medicaid through the GOP tax and spending bill.
“What we do need to do is make sure that those that are part of a vulnerable population have access to Medicaid and receive those full benefits,” Ernst said. “So what we’re trying to do is strengthen Medicaid by directing the dollars to the people that actually meet the requirements of the program.”
Kearns said he doesn’t believe the people Ernst says are abusing the Medicaid system exist, though he does think there is major fraud and misuse of Medicaid funds happening through large health provider and insurance companies. The Medicaid cuts will not target entities or individuals actually abusing the system, Kearns said, but instead push people in need to drop out of the system by adding new barriers in getting coverage.
Kearns said he and his wife are “relatively savvy” through education and years of working in the Medicaid system — but that “every time one of those quarter-inch thick envelopes arrives from from the state, we’re like, ‘oh my God.'”
Receiving Medicaid is already an arduous process for the people it is intended to serve — and adding new requirements will only make getting care more difficult for these populations, he said.
“The idea that somebody that’s able-bodied and able to work would put themselves through the process to enroll in Medicaid, I think it’s laughable,” Kearns said. “… Folks that have disabilities or that have severe medical problems that necessitate them going into long-term care or whatever else — they need social workers to help marshal them through that system. This is not something that you know the general person off the street can do.”

StebbinsGroups that provide crime victims access to emergency shelter, counseling, food assistance and more are at risk of closing as federal funding for victim services has been on a steady decline in recent years while need has increased in Michigan, nonprofit groups in the state are warning.
Prevention is a key tool in fighting against domestic and sexual violence, Betsy Huggett, director of the Diane Peppler Resource Center in Sault Ste. Marie told the Michigan Advance, but trims to federal funding have meant community programs to build awareness for violence for students haven’t been possible as the center operates in “famine” mode.
The center’s staff of 14  wear a lot of hats in order to maintain the shelter for survivors and their families and ensure individuals and their loved ones can exit dangerous living situations, Huggett said. She said she’s proud that the center has navigated many storms like keeping the majority of its staff on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic, but she wonders how much more the organization could do if it had more sustainable funding.

“We know the rug could be pulled out from under us at any time so we just keep staying in the famine mindset…there were a lot of things that we used to be able to do that made a huge impact in the community,” Huggett said.

The Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA, the main federal funding program distributing states funds to provide services to victims of crimes such as child abuse, domestic and sexual assault, elder abuse and more has seen steep decreases nationwide in recent years.
Michigan saw a 42% chop in VOCA funding for victim services last year compared to the 2023 VOCA amount which is funded by fines and penalties from federal cases, with a large portion coming from the prosecution of white collar financial crime which has been on a years-long decline, expected to decline further under President Donald Trump.
Michigan, like most states, has taken on the cost burden of keeping domestic violence shelters and other resources open by supplementing the funds lost through use of the state budget. However, Michigan is still falling short as it struggles to maintain funding levels while the cost of services has shot up, Johanna Kononen, director of law and policy for the Michigan Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence, or MCEDSV, told the Advance. 
The 2024 fiscal year Michigan state budget allocated $30 million for victim services being provided by more than 100 organizations across the state. Now MCEDSV is seeking $75 million for organizations in the state budget through a campaign, “75 Saves Lives” to encourage lawmakers crafting the next budget to recognize the consequences for crime victims if organizations aren’t able to provide services.
When it comes to topics like domestic and sexual violence, which hold stigma and shame in conversations, there can be an illusion that those kinds of crimes happen to other people and don’t impact the lives of all Michiganders, Kononen said.
But nationwide estimates find that more than half of women and almost one in three men will experience sexual violence in their lifetime while domestic violence impacts 10 million Americans annually, including intimate partner violence and child abuse.
“Oftentimes, it’s easy to [say] ‘this hasn’t happened to me and so this isn’t impacting me. Why should we prioritize this as a state?’. But unfortunately, statistically speaking, if you don’t know someone who’s been impacted by domestic or sexual violence, it’s because they haven’t told you,” Kononen said.
Nobody wants to think about sexual violence, especially when it comes to children being the victims, Melissa Werkman, President of Children’s Advocacy Centers of Michigan said, but the reality is 1 in 7 children have experienced abuse or neglect in the last year in the U.S. which equals about 300,000 of Michigan’s kids.

VOCA dollars almost exclusively fund the frontline workers at Michigan’s 40 children’s advocacy centers, Werkman told the Advance, meaning the forensic interviewers for children who’ve experienced violence, victim advocates who guide families towards healing after abuse and medical professionals who offer care, all at low to no cost.
The goal of children’s advocacy centers is to respond to violence in a child’s life in a way that is geared towards them and their healing amidst systems that were not built for children, Werkman said. When talking to the public about the value of the centers, Werkman said a lot of people expect the centers to be shrouded in discomfort, sadness and confusion, but the truth is this work helps kids get back to being kids.
“The kids are excited to come to their therapy appointments. They walk right in and they know the intake coordinator and they’re excited to see the therapy dog. That is what we give kids back. We most importantly beyond the justice aspect of it, beyond the advocacy aspect and therapy aspect, we give kids their agency back,” Werkman said.
Without VOCA, there are no children’s advocacy centers, Werkman said, because as much as 85% of a center’s budget can come from those federal funds. Given the decline in funding, children’s advocacy centers in Michigan on average are operating on a funding gap of over $100,000 and smaller rural centers providing care to multiple counties where resources are strained are most at risk of closing their doors.
Having to stop funding a counselor or close down a shelter is a terrible decision for a victim organization to face, but it’s especially ominous for tribal communities where some programs for an area have only one victim advocate and there is only one tribal domestic and sexual violence shelter in the state, Stacey Ettawageshik, executive director of Uniting Three Fires Against Violence said to the Advance.
Uniting Three Fires Against Violence, a tribal victim advocacy group providing training and advocacy for the 12 tribal programs in Michigan providing domestic and sexual violence care, has done a lot of work to get tribal issues a voice in Lansing, Ettawageshik said. For a demographic of people who experience violence at a drastically disproportionate rate than their white counterparts, Ettawageshik said tribal groups have worked 10 times as hard as other violence programs to get their portion of funding.
There’s a historic lack of trust in non-tribal organizations claiming to help Native Americans, an example being Indian residential schools in Michigan which stole hundreds of Anishinaabe children from their homes and subjected them to years of abuse and culture erasure, Ettawageshik said.

Tribal programs come from a trauma-formed approach that includes historical knowledge of how violence has impacted Michiganders from tribal communities and can administer culturally honoring services and sacred medicines like sage, cedar, sweet grass and tobacco, Ettawageshik said.
“We’ve come so far [with] tribal programs getting access to these resources in the first place that it will just be taken away in a heartbeat and where does that leave us?,”  Ettawageshik said. “That leaves us back at square one… losing that funding. Losing that support is going to make a huge impact on our communities that already experience higher levels of substance use, homelessness, increased violence and that violence is really committed most of the time by non-natives.”
While President Donald Trump’s administration has placed a strong focus on cutting what it labels as erroneous federal spending and usage of taxpayer dollars for programs not aligning with the administration’s values, Kononen said it’s imperative for residents and policymakers to understand that VOCA is funded through criminals having to pay for their crimes.

“I think it’s very easy for people to see what’s happening in the federal government and think that that’s something that’s happening really far away… that doesn’t have anything to do with me here in my town in Michigan and the services that my community needs,” Kononen said. “It’s a tricky topic to broach with people, and it makes it seem kind of academic like this is a line item in the budget when these are real people who are getting life-saving help.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DSC_0849-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

(Lori M. Nichols for New Jersey Monitor)The Senate on Monday joined the Assembly in concurring with Gov. Phil Murphy’s conditional veto of a bill that would create new criminal charges to deter disruptive pop-up parties that have harried some New Jersey towns in recent years, and the bill became law after Murphy signed it Monday afternoon.
The new law will allow authorities to charge those who provoke or attempt to provoke at least four others into disorderly conduct with inciting a public brawl or who conceal their identities to instill fear or frustrate authorities’ attempts to apprehend or prosecute them.
“This law makes it clear that if you incite a public brawl, you will be held accountable. We need to give law enforcement the tools to stop this kind of chaos before someone gets seriously hurt, or worse,” said bill sponsor Assemblyman Dan Hutchison (D-Gloucester).
Those who wear masks or disguises for medical, demonstrative, or religious reasons will not be subject to prosecution for concealing their identities.
The new law is a legislative response to pop-up parties and other large, unruly gatherings of young people that have spurred violence and chaos in some New Jersey communities in recent years. A push in favor of the law rose after Memorial Day weekend, when authorities in Seaside Heights said gangs of young people created havoc on the boardwalk.
In May, a brawl at the Menlo Park Mall broke out among 300 young people, forcing seven arrests and leaving one officer injured as locals called police from neighboring towns to bring the fracas under control, authorities said.
Later last month, officials were forced to shutter a carnival outside the Woodbridge Center after hundreds of teens responded to a social media post about the event. Authorities said they made no arrests at the scene to avoid an escalation.
“This bill is meant to make such incidents less frequent and to give our public safety officers more training and resources to help bring these situations under control,” said bill sponsor Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester).
Murphy conditionally vetoed the bipartisan bill in early May over First Amendment concerns. The earlier version would have criminalized engaging or promoting others to engage in disorderly conduct and lacked exemptions for medical and other mask-wearing.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/081123-NJM-OC-LMN25160-1024x695.jpg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.
Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”
At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.
“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”
A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”
“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”
At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.
“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.
Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.
J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”
“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”
FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.
“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.
All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.
“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

Sabina Matos’ campaign papers during the 2023 congressional special election changed her plea to no contest, avoiding potential prison time, as first reported by WPRI-TV 12.
Holly McClaren originally pleaded not guilty in May 2024 following a sealed grand jury indictment charging her with two felony counts of violating nomination papers and two misdemeanor counts of giving false documents to an agent, employee or public official. She appeared in Providence County Superior Court Monday, and was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation, according to news reports.
Court records of the plea and judge’s sentencing were not immediately available Monday.
John Grasso, McClaren’s attorney, did not return calls for comment Monday.
McClaren’s company, Harmony Solutions, was hired by Matos’ campaign during her 2023 primary run for the 1st Congressional District seat. Once considered a frontrunner in the 11-way primary for the open congressional seat, Matos ultimately finished fourth, dogged for much of her campaign in the accusations of signature fraud. 
Yet Matos maintained her innocence even as the state opened a criminal investigation into her campaign after local election administrators in three separate municipalities flagged nomination papers on the grounds of suspected signature fraud, including of dead residents.
McClaren was one of two people charged in the signature scandal, along with another campaign worker, Christopher Cotham.
Cotham also pleaded not guilty to the same four changes as McClaren. His case remains pending in Providence County Superior Court, according to the public court docket, with a pre-trial conference scheduled for June 25.
Matos in a statement Monday said the conviction has cleared her name.
“I have supported this investigation at every step in the hopes that the truth would come to light,” Matos said. “With this case settled, the facts are clear: Holly McClaren committed a serious crime that undermined the sanctity of our state’s free and fair elections. I’m grateful to the law enforcement officers who handled this investigation thoroughly and professionally and whose work ultimately led to today’s results.”

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.
Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”
At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.
“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”
A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”
“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”
At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.
“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.
Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.
J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”
“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”
FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.
“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.
All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.
“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

(Photo contributed by Aaron Lehman)Farmers in Iowa had a productive week as warmer and drier conditions allowed plenty of time for in-the-field activities, including finishing up planting and beginning to spray emerged corn and soybeans. 
Nearly 80% of soybeans have emerged across the state, which is 10 days ahead of last year’s crop and four days ahead of average pace. Corn acres across the state are 87% emerged, putting the crop nearly a week ahead of last year and one day ahead of the five-year average. 
Organic farmers like Aaron Lehman, who farms in northern Polk County, had a slightly slower start to the planting season than conventional neighbors. 
On Friday, Lehman said he hoped to finish planting his soybeans and to replant the sections of corn that “didn’t emerge very evenly” due to an above-average dump of rain that hit central Iowa during the previous reporting period.

He said with organic farming, and a need to use seeds without synthetic coatings, he has to wait for warmer soil temperatures before he can plant and roll down his cover crops. 
“So I’m on a little bit of a different calendar than some of my neighbors, but in general, field progress is pretty strong,” Lehman, who is also president of Iowa Farmers Union, said. 
Across the state, corn and soybean conditions rated 84% and 81%, respectively, good to excellent. 
Lehman said farmers in his area were concerned the rain would lead to some overripe hay, but the Monday report shows 83% of hay rated good or excellent. 
Temperatures across the state were slightly below normal, with an average of 62 degrees Fahrenheit during the May 26 through June 1 reporting period. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, smoke from the Canadian wildfires reduced solar radiation in the state, and caused a copper colored sun on several days. 
The lingering wildfire haze is expected to clear from the state by midweek. State forecasts call for several inches of precipitation across the state. 
The state average for precipitation during the reporting period was two-tenths of an inch, but soil moisture conditions dropped only slightly from the previous report, with 70% of topsoil conditions and 65% of subsoil conditions rated adequate.

Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services.Senate Taxes Chair Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, didn’t need much time to shoot down the “skinny,” 12-page tax bill proposed by Minnesota legislative leaders as they rush to button-up a two-year budget deal, without which the state shuts down at the end of the month.
“I rejected it right off the bat,” Rest said in an interview Monday. “As soon as I saw it, I told them I couldn’t vote for that and neither could half a dozen other Senate Democrats.”
The text of the bill was posted on Sunday, but Rest said it’s been obsolete since Friday morning when she expressed her opposition and asked that they continue working toward a deal.
Rest’s rejection raises the prospect of a two-year budget agreement without a tax bill, which isn’t necessary for ongoing government operations but would leave a bevy of lawmakers and interest groups fuming, their hopes for special tax treatments foiled.
The 12-page document largely maintains the status quo with a couple notable exceptions agreed to weeks ago: increasing the sales tax on cannabis 50% and repealing the electricity tax exemption for power-hungry data centers.
Those will still be in any final package, Rest said, but the “skinny” bill leaves out noncontroversial but nevertheless important policies.
For instance, more than a dozen cities are awaiting approval for local tax increment financing districts aimed at spurring development.
The skinny bill also leaves out continuing tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel, which has bipartisan support but was was absent from the leadership agreement signed off by Gov. Tim Walz, Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul.
Republican co-chair of the House Taxes Committee Greg Davids of Preston also unequivocally rejected the proposal in an interview with MPR News.
“We put five months of thought into something they put five minutes of thought into, and I know which one’s going to be better,” Davids said. “I’m just not sure why any Republican would even consider voting for this. I don’t think it would pass (the) House or the Senate.”
While the taxes working group was meeting in public, negotiations have moved behind closed doors and will likely remain so until a deal is reached, Rest said.
Building trade unions and business groups are banking on lawmakers extending sales tax exemptions for data centers on equipment purchases even as they sunset exemptions on electricity. They hope by extending the equipment sales tax exemption into the next century, the state will entice Meta, Amazon and other tech giants to build data centers in Minnesota.
The tax incentives are particularly important to the construction unions after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a public infrastructure package for the second year in a row. Building one large data center can cost upwards of $1 billion — more than an entire public infrastructure package — and create upwards of 1,800 construction jobs, according to a study of Wisconsin.
Opponents argue that tech giants will build data centers in Minnesota regardless of the tax incentives leaving regular taxpayers to subsidize some of the richest companies in the world at the expense of investing in schools, nursing homes and infrastructure.
The state expects to bring in an additional $56 million in tax revenue over the next two years by repealing the electricity exemption. The state will still exempt data centers from sales tax on equipment and software through 2042, which is expected to cost more than $200 million in forgone sales tax revenue over the next two years.
Amazon recently announced that it’s suspending plans for a large data center in Becker “due to uncertainty” — one week after lawmakers announced they were eliminating the sales tax exemption on electricity.
Lawmakers have also agreed to raise the tax on retail cannabis sales from 10% to 15%, pushing the total sales tax above 20% across the state when local and state sales taxes are added.
The tax hike would land before the state has even issued any cannabis sales licenses, although it has been collecting taxes on THC beverages and low dose edibles. Just one dispensary would be subject to the tax increase: The White Earth Nation opened its first off-reservation store in Moorhead last month after negotiating a compact with state leaders through a process exclusive to tribes.
State lawmakers voted to legalize cannabis in 2023 with a relatively low sales tax compared to other states, arguing that a higher tax would allow the black market to survive, and that cannabis sales should not generate funding for unrelated budget items.
The 15% rate would push Minnesota toward the higher end of taxes compared to the 23 states with legal cannabis sales, according to the Tax Foundation.
The bill would also repeal a law that sends a fifth of cannabis tax revenue to cities and counties to fund local enforcement costs.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrE9lzpWQAAKeSW-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

Some of the world’s largest companies and the governor’s family business received Tennessee’s biggest new business tax rebate, according to a listing released by the Department of Revenue.
Lee Company, a mechanical engineering and HVAC, plumbing and electrical services company owned by Gov. Bill Lee’s family, joined Amazon, FedEx, Nissan, Hankook Tire, 84 Lumber, AT&T and utilities such as Atmos Energy and Alabama Power in netting franchise and excise tax rebates of more than $10,000 each created by a 2024 state law. Memphis-based FedEx, with 13 subsidiaries, landed the maximum rebate for each one, and Japanese-owned Nissan filed for six subsidiaries that each received the rebate.
A governor’s spokesperson did not respond to questions Monday, but his office consistently says he put his interest in Lee Company into a blind trust during his governorship, though he could benefit when he leaves the post late in 2026.
Other notable companies among the 16,000 receiving the state’s maximum break in its business property tax include Bridgestone, Ingram Partners, Aegis Sciences, Ajax Turner, Ascension Care, BNSF Railway Co., Carhartt Inc., Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen, Coca-Cola Bottling, Denso Manufacturing, Elvis Presley Enterprises, Gannett Co., Frito-Lay Inc., Pilot and Pilot Travel Centers and Brown-Forman, the owner of Jack Daniel’s. 
Popular Nashville spots such as Frothy Monkey, Jeff Ruby’s, Von Elrod’s and Bourbon Street Blues & Boogie Bar took the rebate as well.
In all, about 60,000 companies received three-year refunds ranging from less than $750 to between $750 and $10,000.

The estimated $1.5 billion in refunds and tax cuts, a large number of them made to out-of-state companies, appears to be having an immediate impact on the state budget. Tennessee’s business tax collections on property and earnings are $335 million short of projections through the first four months of the year — 11% off the mark — according to the Department of Finance and Administration. The tax cut amounts to more than $400 million annually.
Tennessee lawmakers approved the refunds and franchise tax break in 2024 when Department of Revenue officials said the state faced legal threats over its business taxes.
Despite the shortfall, Republican Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said in a Monday statement: “I believe now, as I did at the time, that the rebates were the most responsible course due to the strong probability that the state would be in a worse fiscal position after impending litigation. Based on the advice of the attorney general, we were simply not willing to take that kind of risk with Tennessee’s financial future on the line and I stand by that decision.”
Other lawmakers such as House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, said last year they supported Gov. Bill Lee’s legislation because it was good policy, not because of legal threats. Some 80 companies reportedly sent letters to the state requesting rebates.
“Conservative budgeting and fiscal responsibility over the past decade have placed our state in a strong financial position,” Lamberth said in a statement Monday. “The significant tax cut we approved last year reinvested dollars right back into the businesses, communities and workers that fuel the Volunteer State’s economy.”
The state’s lists, which will be on the Department of Revenue website for only 30 days, don’t detail the exact amount of rebates, but the largest amount could run from $10,000 to $75,000. 
State Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Nashville Democrat, blasted the move as a “corporate tax refund scheme” and encouraged people to check the list to see which companies are benefiting. Campbell said lawmakers approved the measure without a lawsuit or court ruling,
Tennessee’s largest companies secure sales tax exemptions for everything from jet fuel to water

“Just a letter from corporate attorneys and a political class eager to please.” Campbell added the state is dealing with its biggest budget deficit of the year as a result.
The legislature refused to take action this year on grocery sales tax reductions, one sponsored by Democrats accompanied by an effort to go after offshore accounts used to hide income and one backed by Republicans that offered no way to offset the revenue loss.
“This is the real cost of trickle-down economics: corporate handouts while working families get left behind. It’s fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible,” Campbell said.
The advocacy group Tennessee For All, which supports elimination of the grocery tax, criticized the state’s refunds, saying companies are exploiting the program. 
“Instead of closing loopholes so families can get a break on groceries, the majority of legislators chose more corporate giveaways,” said Angela Wynn, a Rutherford County parent and member of Public School Strong, a partner in the Tennessee For All coalition.
The group pointed toward reports by two Democratic lawmakers using state information from 2022 and 2025 that show more than 60% of corporations operating in Tennessee pay nothing in excise taxes on income.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)New Mexico’s two U.S. senators are calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to fix rather than abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as she and other prominent officials have called for recently.
Democratic U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján wrote Noem a letter Monday outlining problems FEMA could fix, particularly regarding its response to wildfires and their aftermath, but also defending the agency as necessary to help people recover from disasters.
“We want to emphasize that serious, targeted reform is the answer to these pressing problems – not dismantling FEMA altogether,” the senators wrote. “The federal government has an important role to play in assisting state and local governments in the wake of natural disasters.”
Noem previously said she was devising ways to eliminate FEMA. She has backed off that language, though her department has cut billions of dollars in disaster resilience grants, including a $4 million allocation to New Mexico. 
The letter notes that states and local governments don’t have adequate money to pay for increasingly expensive disasters. In New Mexico, for example, a FEMA formula calculates the state can withstand only about $4 million in disaster costs before it needs the federal government to step in. 
Proposed cuts to FEMA could hurt disaster-prone New Mexico

When it comes to reforming the agency, the senators’ letter points repeatedly to the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire near Las Vegas, the biggest fire in state history. Since the fire, every rainstorm threatens to become a flash flood or debris flow that causes further damage. FEMA is not well-equipped to handle those kinds of scenarios, the senators wrote. 
“Western states face a distinct and growing threat: namely, catastrophic wildfires followed by cascading disasters such as landslides, flooding, and water system failures that compound damage and slow recovery,” the senators wrote. “These cascading events—which can happen years after an initial fire—are devastating, and FEMA has repeatedly struggled to respond effectively.”
The post-fire flooding in Las Vegas has continued each year since 2022, particularly in the summer monsoon season, after the fire destroyed vegetation and degraded the soil. The flooding has prompted the city to postpone the construction of a new water treatment plant, and caused the cancellation of Fiestas last summer, which is the single biggest annual event in Las Vegas. 
“As a result of these floods, the business community lost out on their largest income-generating event of the year,” the senators wrote. 
FEMA needs to improve its handling of “cascading events,” allowing disaster grant recipients to rebuild infrastructure equipped to handle future disasters, not just to their pre-disaster capacity. At the moment, FEMA’s Public Assistance program will only fully reimburse local governments and other public entities for the cost of rebuilding infrastructure such as bridges and culverts to the same size and specifications as they were before the wildfire. 
The federal government accidentally burned down their houses, then made it hard to come home

“While we understand the intent behind these rules—to restore essential infrastructure equitably—they do not adequately address the unique and escalating risks associated with post-wildfire environments,” they wrote. 
FEMA should also increase its disaster assistance to individuals and families, the senators wrote. During the 2022 wildfire, the maximum people could receive from FEMA, even if they lost their primary residence and all it contained, was about $37,000. 
The senators asked the agency to increase the payments, especially in light of challenges people in fire-prone areas face securing insurance. FEMA typically does not pay disaster victims if they have private insurance, but home insurance is becoming prohibitively expensive or is completely unavailable in areas like Mora and Ruidoso after wildfires there last summer. 
“FEMA must adapt its policies and funding levels and work with other federal agencies to meet the needs of those who fall into this widening gap and ensure that recovery is possible for those who, through no fault of their own, can’t obtain insurance,” Heinrich and Luján wrote.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_2094-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Creating a public medical school at the University of Rhode Island (URI) could cost the state approximately $225 million over 10 years, but a consultant draft report suggests it may very well be worth the time and effort if it helps soothe the state’s primary care shortage.
“You don’t need all this money tomorrow, but you’ll need a good $20 million right away,” Paul Umbach, founder and president of Tripp Umbach told a special legislative commission Friday afternoon at the Rhode Island State House.
Umbach told the 21-member panel appointed last year by late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio that the hypothetical school could partially relieve the physician workforce shortage problem in the Ocean State, which has one only one private medical school at Brown University. 
Rhode Island now has a shortage of approximately 300 primary care physicians statewide, as previously reported by Rhode Island Current and cited in the Tripp Umbach draft report. In 2023, there were just under 4,200 physicians in Rhode Island, and only 327 of them were in family medicine or general practice, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Per the firm’s analysis, a URI medical school could accept about 100 students a year and, if the funding falls into place, possibly graduate its first students within a decade or so.
Tuition could cost about $50,000, which the firm said is comparable to other public medical schools. But tuition wouldn’t cover all expenses — hence the need for an annual infusion of about $20 million to $25 million in state money.  
“This funding must be supplemented by clinical revenue generated through partnerships with health systems, as well as ongoing philanthropic contributions to support scholarships, faculty development, and programmatic innovation,” the report reads.
New construction can wait
Umbach told the commission his firm has helped 20 medical schools get started. He outlined the phases of financing, from initial investments to hire leadership, get accredited, and make any necessary retrofitments to existing facilities. A dedicated building wouldn’t be a must-have at first, 
“You’ll be able to use existing facilities for a time to sit your first class,” Umbach said. 
But after four or five years, a new facility would likely be required, and consume about $120 million to $125 million — a cost that used to be around $50 million to $70 million around a decade ago, Umbach said.
Still, Umbach thought that URI’s has an advantage in its existing programs in pharmacy, nursing, and public health, each of which could be integrated into a new potential medical school. The report states that medical students would be able to “train alongside future nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals in team-based care environments that reflect real-world clinical settings.” Additionally, URI has research facilities and lab space that could be repurposed for medical education.
“You already have a strong network,” Umbach told the panel.

Despite recent federal challenges to National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding, Umbach cautioned against a shortsighted or pessimistic read of possible funding challenges. He said research based on clinical outcomes, like the kind that might take place at a medical school, “seems to be in a much better place” than more traditional biomedical research in large lab settings. 
Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and the commission co-chair alongside URI President Marc Parlange, asked Umbach to expand on the school’s economic benefits.
“Let’s look at it like a rock hitting the pond,” Umbach said. “You’re building a medical school, and it’s going to have a budget of $60 (million), $70, million when it’s at maturity, and that’s going to help the economy.”
Data in the report shows existing medical schools typically generate around $150 million in economic impact and create 1,000 jobs directly and indirectly. Doctors trained at public medical schools who continue to practice locally can create $2.2 million in economic impact and subsidize 15 jobs directly and indirectly, according to the report.
But before the school can generate income or even be built, Umbach said the school needs to find a dean. The accreditation process for medical schools is tightly controlled by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), Umbach said. 
“They won’t talk to consultants. They’ll allow the president to talk if they want, but it’s really the founding dean,” Umbach said. “So your number one thing you have to do in the MD model is find the founding dean.”
After a dean is picked, the school must hire additional faculty and administrators, many of whom must be MDs or PhDs. 
“So, super expensive,” Umbach said. 
But fledgling schools can bulk up their coffers by having their new faculty practice medicine. That’s what happened at the recently accredited MD program at Roseman University in Nevada, Umbach said, where the founding dean built a self-sustaining clinical practice while the school developed toward accredited status.
“Faculty can also see patients and make money. Deans can even see patients and make money,” Umbach said.
The state’s small size, Umbach told the panel, is why the medical school needs to be envisioned as a statewide initiative, not a siloed endeavor on the URI campus. That would mean partnerships with local health systems and clinics not only to help students learn and succeed, but to firmly plant the school within the state’s wider economic context.
“If you think about this as URI’s medical school, that’s a dangerous way to think about it,” Umbach said. “Although it will be URI’s medical school — structurally, technically and in many practical ways —  it won’t work unless it’s a statewide medical school.”
To that end, the report recommends that URI “secure partnerships with a broad array of health care providers throughout Rhode Island” and work with community hospitals and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), like Thundermist Health Center in Woonsocket, to better acquaint aspiring doctors with community medicine and the needs of rural populations — something students lack when they “only see the inside of a large academic medical center, and you don’t ever leave,” Umbach said, underlining his recommendation for a community-based model.
Umbach’s firm carried out the $150,000 feasibility study for the special commission, which was created in June 2024 via a resolution from Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat. Former Senate President Ruggerio selected the panel’s 21 members in July 2024. The special commission, per the statute that created it, has until Dec. 20 to make its recommendations on a possible medical school.
 


				   A timeline and wishlist for a potential URI medical school  

The Tripp Umbach draft report outlines the decade’s worth of work ahead if the state wants to build a medical school at URI. The rough timeline as given in the report is as follows:

Years 1–2: Planning phase, including community outreach and laying groundwork for accreditation
Year 3: Apply for accreditation, and hire founding dean and leadership team
Year 4: Secure preliminary accreditation and begin recruiting students
Year 5: Enroll first class of medical students
Year 9 and beyond: First cohort graduates


It also suggests the following investments, totaling $225 million, over that 10-year period, including:

$20 million in seed funding from the community and university foundations
$40 million from a “lead” or private donor
$30 million in start-up money from the state
$25 million in annual state support
$50 million to “Seek initial legislative appropriation for feasibility and design”
$60 million in matching funds from private donors or fiscal commitments from health systems

(Courtesy of John Williams/MOFGA)The Maine Senate supported a measure to guarantee agricultural workers state minimum wage. 
On Monday, the upper chamber voted 22-12 with a couple Republicans joining the majority party in the initial passage of LD 589. The legislation will next go to the House of Representatives for an initial vote and will need enactment votes from both chambers before it could be sent to Gov. Janet Mills for approval. 
Granting minimum wage to farmworkers has been a years-long effort in Maine. Last year, Mills put forward a proposal that she ended up vetoing after the Labor Committee made changes to the bill. The bill this year mirrors the proposal Mills proposed last session. 
“With this legislation, we send a clear message, Madam President, to those who harvest our food, nourish our families and sustain our communities,” said Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland). “We say today: ‘Your work matters, your dignity is recognized, your contributions are invaluable and the state of Maine will no longer tolerate a system built on exclusion and inequity.’”
Talbot Ross, who sponsored the bill, also described the legislation as a way to “turn the page on a painful history,” referring to the historic exclusion of agricultural workers from labor rights. Later in the discussion, Talbot Ross clarified that she was not calling any individuals “racist” or “second-class,” but referring to a pattern of discrimination throughout history that excluded Black and brown workers from certain labor protections. 
The version of the bill supported by the Senate is pared back from the original proposal that also included overtime protections and a phased in overtime wage. Those were removed during the committee process. 
Multiple Republicans who spoke in opposition to the bill emphasized the importance of piecework for some farms in the state, such as the blueberry industry, which pay people based on how much they pick. 
Sen. Scott Cyrway (R-Kennebec) said that system encourages people to take pride in their work, while Sen. Joseph Martin (R-Oxford) said, “piecework is not evil.” Both voted against the legislation.
However, Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), who co-chairs the Labor Committee, clarified that the bill does not prohibit piecework. 
The other issue raised on the floor stems from broader concerns about automatically updating the state’s minimum wage with inflation, as is already the case in state law. 
Though he said he was “reluctantly” voting in favor of the bill, Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) reminded his colleagues that he believes automatic increases to the state minimum wage are hurting the economy. However, he noted that LD 589 doesn’t pertain to such cost-of-living increases. 
Bradstreet said there were components in the original draft of the bill that he did not support, but he backed the amended version because members of the agriculture industry expressed their approval to the committee. 
Tipping also noted during floor discussion that many agricultural employers in the state told the committee they already pay more than the state’s minimum wage of $14.65 an hour.

Hobgood-Wilkes said in a statement to Mississippi Today that she was removed as chairwoman over her advocacy for reforming pharmacy benefit manager practices in the state, a topic hotly debated by lawmakers earlier this year during their regular session. 
The Pearl River County lawmaker said the speaker’s decision to remove her as leader of the committee was “deeply hurtful,” because it wasn’t because of her objective performance as a legislator, but rather because she continued to speak up for her beliefs.
“I fought to lower drug costs for Mississippians and to support our independent pharmacists against the powerful PBMs working to drive them out of business,” Hobgood-Wilkes said. “I didn’t run for office to build my ego or pad my pocketbook. I ran because I love Pearl River County, and I love Mississippi.”
White, a Republican from West, did not respond to a request for comment. He replaced Hobgood-Wilkes as leader of the committee with Rep. Beth Luther Waldo, a freshman Republican from Pontotoc. 
Both chambers of the Legislature, earlier this year, introduced plans that sought to protect patients and independent pharmacists, who have warned that if legislators do not pass a law to regulate PBMs, which serve as middlemen in the pharmaceutical industry, some local pharmacies may be forced to close. They say that the companies’ low payments and unfair business practices have left them struggling to break even.
House Bill 1123, authored by the speaker, originally focused on the transparency aspect of PBMs. The Senate then beefed up the bill by adding provisions barring the companies from steering patients to affiliate pharmacies and prohibiting spread pricing – the practice of paying insurers more for drugs than pharmacists. 
Independent pharmacists, who flocked to the Capitol to advocate for reform during the session, widely supported the Senate’s version of the bill. Hobgood-Wilkes also continued to speak out in favor of stronger PBM legislation, even though White and other House leaders urged for a more middle-of-the-road approach.
Despite the legislative wrangling, a Democratic lawmaker defeated the bill by challenging it for violating procedural rules. 
It’s rare for a speaker or lieutenant governor to remove a legislator as a committee chair in the middle of a four-year term, unless there’s a vacancy or questionable behavior by the lawmaker. It’s even more notable that White, only halfway through his first term as speaker, appears to be punishing a fellow Republican over policy beliefs instead of conduct.
Another notable time a speaker relegated a House member to the sidelines was when former House Speaker Philip Gunn in 2019 appointed Rep. Doug McLeod, a Republican from Lucedale, to only one committee after he was arrested on charges of domestic violence. The former South Mississippi lawmaker was found not guilty of the charges.
White has also tweaked committee assignments for around a dozen Republicans and two Democrats, according to Rep. Robert Johnson III, the House Democratic leader from Natchez. 
White changed the committee assignments for Johnson and Rep. Daryl Porter, a Democrat from Summit. The two Democrats said they believed changing the committee makeup was to account for two new House members who were recently sworn into office and not a punishment from the leadership.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/02150256/hobgood-wilkes.jpg,,,2025-06-02 18:05:57.083779

krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images)An Iowa man who says he has no stable access to food is suing the state, alleging it has unfairly denied him access to food assistance based on a criminal conviction later voided by the courts.
Charles Hasselmann, 32, of Ankeny alleges that in 2023, he applied for food assistance while residing in a correctional facility as a result of a probation-revocation order that was premised on a finding of him being a habitual offender.
The sentence was later vacated by a district court judge, Hasselmann claims, with the judge finding the habitual-offender enhancement to his sentence on a theft conviction lacked sufficient factual basis. Because of that finding, the court also set aside the related order that revoked his probation, Hasselmann claims.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Court records indicate the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services later disqualified Hasselmann from receiving food assistance through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, for at least 12 months. It also demanded restitution for overpayment, citing “stolen” funds that Hasselmann says are due to others’ unauthorized use of his benefits card.
In his lawsuit against DHHS, Hasselmann is seeking an injunction that would award him SNAP benefits and halt any further efforts at collections for the alleged overpayments.
In his petition, Hasselmann claims he was recently released from more than two years of incarceration and now has no reliable access to food or income. The public interest, he argues, strongly favors his access to “basic nutritional support.”
The state has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, but in a related court case attorneys for the state argued that while a judge did find there was insufficient factual basis to impose the habitual-offender sentence enhancement on the conviction for theft, the court did not disturb the underlying conviction for theft.
The state’s lawyers say that under a plea deal that was later reached, Hasselmann had agreed to a prison term of no more than five years on the theft charge. The court then set aside the earlier probation violation order, the state alleges, not because it represented “an illegal sentence,” but because, through the subsequent plea deal, a five-year prison sentence had been agreed to and imposed.
Court records indicate that since 2012, Hasselmann has been charged with numerous felony and misdemeanor offenses, resulting in seven convictions for theft, five convictions for driving while barred, five convictions for forgery, two convictions for assault and two convictions for drunken driving.

When Courtney Leader gets the letter from the state each year telling her it’s time to recertify her daughter’s Medicaid eligibility, she scrambles to make sure the paperwork gets to the right place. 
Leader, of Ash Grove, considers herself adept at navigating her 8-year-old daughter’s complex medical needs and appointments, but even she has fallen through the cracks of Missouri’s safety net thanks to the state’s red tape.
Without Medicaid for her daughter, who has complex medical needs and developmental disabilities, Leader’s family wouldn’t be able to afford the thousands of dollars in monthly costs for her feeding tube and formula, specialty appointments and at-home nurses.
Yet despite Leader’s diligence, her daughter was once kicked off Medicaid after the state lost her paperwork. Even when the paperwork makes it through, she says it takes days to confirm.
She has waited hours on the phone for help, just to be automatically disconnected, and has refreshed the online chat again and again trying to get answers — knowing any delay could cost her daughter coverage.
Now, as Congress proposes changes to Medicaid that promise to add even more bureaucratic hurdles for families like hers, Leader worries about what’s in store for her daughter’s health care coverage.  
“I’m terrified that further red tape throughout the system will disrupt my daughter’s care and put her health in jeopardy,” she said…Medicaid is a lifesaver, but I’ve seen the challenges of an overburdened system firsthand, and felt the panic when my paperwork was lost.” 
‘Perfect storm’: Missouri advocates decry Medicaid application delays, coverage losses

Leader spoke on Monday alongside the leaders of several advocacy organizations gathered at the Missouri Capitol to sound the alarm on the potential ramifications of Congress’ planned changes to Medicaid. 
The federal reconciliation bill aims to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, in part by cutting at least $600 billion nationally from Medicaid over a decade.
Proposed Medicaid changes include work requirements estimated to potentially kick over 100,000 people off in Missouri — many of whom would be still eligible but could lose coverage anyway due to procedural issues. Co-pays would be added for some patients, eligibility checks would increase to twice a year and thousands of adults would need to confirm their work status each month.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would also face enormous cuts under the proposed budget, potentially cutting thousands of recipients in the state.
Missouri would be in an especially vulnerable spot, advocates said, because the state Department of Social Services has struggled for years to administer safety net programs. 
The Family Support Division, which oversees benefits administration for the state, is understaffed. The agency’s request to fund 220 new staff this year was not granted by the legislature. And failures in the administration of Medicaid and food assistance programs have earned rebukes from the federal government and possible sanctions from a St. Louis judge. 
Emily Kalmer, Missouri government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said the Department of Social Services’ struggles to administer these programs could be exacerbated by the proposed federal changes to Medicaid and SNAP. 
“With all the challenges they already have, and then this timeframe,” she said, referring the Family Support Division and the proposed implementation of work requirements at the end of 2026, “…we’re just going to have a lot of things happening at the same time, and how the legislature decides they want to use their limited budget to deal with that — it’s going to be kind of the perfect storm.”
One in five Missourians is on Medicaid, or over 1.2 million people. Missouri’s Medicaid program covers 39% of all children in the state and pays for two-thirds of nursing home care.
A single person has to make under $20,814 annually to qualify for Medicaid. 
At various points in recent years, the state has had the worst, or among the worst in the nation processing times for Medicaid applications, prompting federal scrutiny last year. 
Missouri is also being sued over its administration of SNAP, with a judge concluding the state violated federal SNAP law and the Americans with Disabilities Act for the way it runs its call center eligibility interviews. 
The average wait time for the general call line, which includes Medicaid queries, was just over one hour in March, It was 49 minutes for the line specific to SNAP interviews. 
‘Broken system’: Call center backlogs impede Missouri families seeking food assistance

Thousands of callers are automatically disconnected before getting through to a person: Over 50,000 calls were automatically ended for the SNAP interview call line in March and nearly 16,000 for the general call line.
The work requirements being considered by Congress mandate 80 hours of work per month, or various exemptions, including for caregivers and those with disabilities.
Most adults on Medicaid are already working or would qualify for an exemption. But in the states that have tried work requirements, including Arkansas, thousands lost coverage even though they were eligible. It’s estimated that over 100,000 Missourians could lose coverage due to work requirements.
Kalmer shared the story of one cancer patient who struggled to get on Medicaid because of the state’s hurdles, but wouldn’t have gotten on at all under the proposed federal changes.
The woman had been working when she fell and had spinal surgery, and then found out she had thyroid cancer. Her private insurance wasn’t going to cover anything, so she applied for Medicaid and “didn’t hear anything,” so couldn’t go to the doctor for care. She reached out to Kalmer who was finally able to get her coverage.
During the course of her treatment for cancer, the woman wasn’t able to work, and didn’t qualify for Social Security. 
That means under the work requirements proposed by Congress, she wouldn’t have qualified for Medicaid.
Kalmer said to qualify as disabled and exempt, you must be officially declared disabled by Social Security, a process that can take months or years.
“This entire time that she’s been going through this cancer journey, she would not be necessarily qualified for the exemptions that are in the bill,” Kalmer said.
Congress also wants to require Medicaid recipients to pay copays of up to $35, which could discourage very low-income patients from seeking care. 
“All of this is really just creating more and more roadblocks for the valuable health insurance that cancer patients need and rely on to get the treatment that they need,” Kalmer said.
Traci Gleason, vice president of external affairs for the progressive Missouri Budget Project, said the changes will create significant “barriers to care” for Missourians. 
“There is simply no way that they can make those kinds of cuts to Medicaid without slashing health care for Americans, slashing health care for Missourians,” she said. “And I want to be clear that the consequences to Missourians, both on Medicaid and those who are not, really, can’t be overstated.”

(Inciweb photo)An 850-acre wildfire exploded in size on Sunday about four miles north of Plains.
The Banana Lake fire was discovered on Saturday and prompted a significant response from firefighting officials. As of Monday, 17 engines, two helicopters, two hand crews, a hotshot crew and three bulldozers are all assigned to the fire. 
The Western Montana Type 3 Incident Management Team, led by Ken Parks — the deputy director of the Missoula County Emergency Management Department — assumed command of the incident on Monday.
Firefighters were busy over the weekend with structure protection. 
(Information on what structures were being protected was not immediately available.) 
The fire started near Locust Hill in Plains and is burning along Highway 28 near Rainbow Lake. Fueling the fire is open timber, and a “full suppression response” is being implemented per the fire’s Inciweb situation report.
Fire officials asked the public to stay away from the area. The state’s Department of Natural Resources and Conservation media liaison listed for the fire did not immediately return a request for comment.
Montana could be gearing up for a long fire season. National Interagency Fire Center maps predict “greater than usual” likelihood of significant wildfires for half of the state by July and nearly all of it come August.
“Wildfires are a reality in Montana each year, but thanks to increased funding and innovative technology, DNRC is more prepared than ever before to respond quickly and effectively,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a press release last week. “While our teams are equipped and ready to protect homes and communities in the event of wildfire, we also need every Montanan to take simple steps to join us in our efforts to keep our state safe.”
Gianforte signed two wildfire bills earlier this month, while vetoing two others that would have impacted local fire departments. How wildfires are to be fought is also a major topic both at the federal level and in the court system.
The state has already had several early season wildfires, including one near Wisdom that ended up burning more than 2,000 acres. According to Montana Fire Info, nearly 350 fires have burned in the state this year so far.
Rural firefighters throughout the state are starting to see things dry out. That includes Missoula Rural Fire District Lt. Phillip Mediate during an interview with the Daily Montanan regarding unseasonably warm temperatures over the weekend.
“We’ve had a pretty good wet spring,” Mediate said on Saturday morning. “We’re starting to see the spike in temperatures now. I think the fire danger has moved to moderate, just in the last couple of days, so we’re starting to see those grasses dry out … we’re starting to head into that season.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INCIWEB-PhotoBanana-1024x871.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 17:08:24.935173

David Scott, the longtime Democratic incumbent who has said he is seeking reelection. 
Clark’s announcement Monday comes at a time when Scott, who received treatment for back problems in November, faces questions about his health. Scott, who has represented the metro Atlanta district since 2003, will celebrate his 80th birthday at the end of the month.
Clark originally decided to run for a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives during the first Trump administration, setting her sights on a Gwinnett County seat that had been in Republican hands for over two decades. Clark ousted an incumbent to win the seat and went on to defend it in 2020, 2022 and 2024 – fending off a Republican challenger last year who was backed by Gov. Brian Kemp.
“I ran to be a voice for science and truth in the face of Republican disinformation and ever since I’ve been taking on the toughest fights for Georgia families,” Clark said in her campaign video.
Outside of her legislative duties, Clark is a microbiologist, mom, nursing school professor at Emory University and a podcast co-host.
Since she took office in 2019, Clark has introduced legislation that she said was intended to create  a “safer, healthier, more prosperous” state of Georgia. Clark is also a vocal defender of reproductive rights. 
As a metro Atlanta native and longtime Lilburn resident, Clark says she has always nurtured a passion for science and health care. She grew up with parents who both worked in the medical fields, watching her father work as a doctor and mother as a nurse. 
“I’ll stand up to Trump and MAGA when they try to cut Medicare, destroy Georgia jobs and gut medical research into cancer and Alzheimer’s,” Clark said in her video. “And get to work building a stronger future for all of us, not just a powerful few.”
Clark isn’t the only candidate hoping to steal Scott’s seat. Former Gwinnett County Board of Education Chairman Everton Blair Jr. and state Sen. Emanuel Jones of Decatur have announced campaigns. Jonathan Bonner, Joe Lester and Simeon Nunnally are all also planning to run. 
The primary election is set for next May. 
Scott faced six Democratic challengers in 2024 but ultimately won the primary outright with nearly 58% of the vote.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Great Salt Lake will likely have a tough summer.
The saline lake relies on mountain snow melt to fill it with water, and this winter wasn’t as good as the past two seasons. Enough snow fell in 2023 and 2024 to lift the state out of drought, fill reservoirs to above capacity and boost the withering Great Salt Lake.
It’s a different story this year. As of May 1, the amount of runoff that made its way to the Great Salt Lake basin is 72% of normal, compared with 108% at this time in 2024. Jordan Clayton, the Utah Snow Survey Program supervisor, predicted the lake would reach 4,193.7 feet by the end of the runoff season in July.
“The lake is at 4,193.3 feet right now,” Clayton said. “We’re already, unfortunately, seeing the lake past its peak in all likelihood.”



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


The lake rose about 1.5 feet from its seasonal low in November, according to the Utah Division of Water Resources. Great Salt Lake Commissioner Brian Steed said any additional runoff that makes its way to the lake won’t make much of a difference. The levels, he said, have already started to fall, and by the end of summer, the lake will lose as much – if not more – than it gained over the winter.
“I’m guessing we’re going to have probably a foot and a half more decrease this year.”
The good news, Steed said, is that the lake’s salinity is OK. When salt levels get too high, it essentially suffocates the organisms that call the lake home because fresh water carries more oxygen than saltwater.
The current projections are a disappointment to Steed and Clayton. Both anticipated water levels to creep up to at least 4,194 feet. The lake reached a historic low of 4,190.9 feet in 2022. At face value, where the lake stands now versus where it was predicted to be doesn’t seem like a big difference. But Steed’s established target range for the lake is between 4,198-4,205 feet. That allows for the ecosystem to support the survival of brine flies and brine shrimp. And keeps industries that do business on the lake, such as mineral extraction, able to do their jobs. And recreators can sail their boat or paddle their kayak without fear of hitting the lake bottom.
Bonnie Baxter, a microbiologist at Westminster University who studies lake organisms, told KUER’s RadioWest that she is seeing the ecosystem take a hit.
“We’re starting to see the shorelines recede again. We’re starting to see birds in strange places. We’re starting to see the place where the brine flies pupate, those are all being exposed,” she said. “We’re starting to see signs that we’re creeping towards that horrible place again.”
Still, Steed is grateful that “we’re not in the crisis that we were in 2022.” The last two years have bought Great Salt Lake some time, but he sees that buffer eroding. He’s also worried about impacts to the ecosystem as well as the dust from the exposed lake bed.
The summer months aren’t projected to ease the worry, either.

Climatologists are predicting a hotter-than-average summer. That means the lake will evaporate faster. Additionally, when it’s hotter, there is greater demand on Utah’s already strained water system. The upside, Steed said, is that the majority of reservoirs in the northern part of the state are full. The southern part of the state, which is back in drought, doesn’t have much impact on the lake.
Any precipitation will help Great Salt Lake’s cause. But the weather pattern is hard to predict right now.
The biggest message Utahns should take away from the summer forecast, Steed said, is to plan on using less water.
“We haven’t had the runoff that we wanted to see this year, and that puts us in a pretty perilous position heading into a dry summer,” Steed said. “That makes us all more worried about how we get more water to the lake, and it’s going to take all of us to get more water through intentional use and intentional reduction in use.”

Mike Bohacek, right, talks to Sen Greg Walker, R-Columbus, on the Senate floor on Jan. 23, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Charges are pending against Republican Indiana Sen. Mike Bohacek for a January drunk driving incident that remained under wraps for months — shielded by legislative immunity during the 2025 session.
Bohacek, of Michiana Shores, was stopped by police on Jan. 24 after a citizen reported him “drinking an open container and stumble out of his vehicle” at a Panda Express in Michigan City, according to charging documents obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. He was later pulled over near Swan Lake Cemetery on U.S. 20, where he refused a breathalyzer test. 
Police then took him to a hospital, where a blood test showed a blood alcohol content of 0.28% — more than three times Indiana’s legal limit of 0.08%.
But Bohacek wasn’t arrested at the time. Under Indiana law, members of the General Assembly are shielded from arrest in most cases during the legislative session — a protection known as legislative immunity.
That meant Bohacek’s case was kept sealed and the senator remained uncharged for months.
Porter County Prosecutor Gary Germann, appointed as special prosecutor in the case, said the charges were filed shortly after his office was appointed in May but they weren’t made public until Monday afternoon.
Two other judges recused themselves and the current Special Judge is LaPorte Circuit Judge Julianne K. Havens.
Bohacek did not respond to the Capital Chronicle’s requests for comment. A Senate communications staffer also declined to comment, saying the incident “falls into the ‘personal matter’ category.”
Details emerge
Anonymous rumors about the incident circulated online after the January incident, but details were not publicly disclosed until Monday.
Charging documents provided by Germann show that Bohacek was stopped by a Michigan City police officer just before 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 24, a Friday. The senator was allegedly speeding while driving a 2023 Dodge Charger bearing his Indiana legislative license plate.
The officer at the scene claimed Bohacek’s speech was quiet and slow; that his eyes were “red, watery (and) bloodshot,” and that he had poor balance and staggered from his vehicle. Charging records additionally note that he was “covered in food.”
Panel advances 15-and-under social media ban

Bohacek “admitted to consuming his prescription medication Tramadol as prescribed prior to driving.” Tramadol is a prescription opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain, often after surgery or for chronic conditions, according to the Mayo Clinic.
After refusing a breathalyzer, the senator’s blood was drawn at around 4:30 p.m. the same day at Northwest Health Hospital in LaPorte. Results of that test later indicated a blood alcohol content of 0.283%, and no drugs present, according to the charging paperwork.
Bohacek was back taking votes in the Indiana Senate chamber the following Monday.
Online court records show Bohacek had several prior traffic citations, including ignoring a stop sign; speeding; and driving the wrong direction on a one-way.
Bohacek was first elected to the Indiana Senate in November 2016. He represents District 8, which includes Starke County, as well as portions of LaPorte, Marshall, and St. Joseph counties. He most recently served on the Corrections and Criminal Law, Health and Provider Services, and Local Government committees.
Before joining the General Assembly, Bohacek served as a two-term LaPorte County Commissioner and was a member of the Michiana Shores Town Council.
He additionally works as an enterprise consultant with Echo Global Logistics and owns MSL Services Inc., a company based in Michiana Shores, according to his legislative biography.
What is legislative immunity?
A specific section in the Indiana Constitution states that lawmakers are immune from arrest during session in all cases except treason, felony, or breach of the peace during the legislative session, as well as while traveling to and from the Indiana Statehouse. 
The most recent session started on Jan. 8 and adjourned on April 25.
Bohacek’s charges add to a series of other alcohol-related incidents involving separate Indiana lawmakers.

In May 2023, Republican Rep. Jim Lucas was arrested after crashing his vehicle into a guardrail and driving the wrong way on an interstate entrance ramp. Lucas, of Seymour, pleaded guilty to operating a vehicle while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident, both misdemeanors. He received a suspended sentence, was placed on probation, and was removed from interim legislative committee assignments.
Lucas was reelected for a seventh term last November.
Before that, Democratic Rep. Dan Forestal was arrested in 2019 for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, resisting law enforcement, and impersonating a public servant. Forestal, of Indianapolis, died in 2021 after his legislative tenure had ended.
In 2009, former Democratic Rep. Dennie Oxley was arrested for misrepresenting himself as a state legislator to avoid arrest for public intoxication and was later convicted. Oxley claimed legislative immunity at the time of the incident, even though he was no longer an elected representative. 
And in 2002, Republican Sen. Johnny Nugent was arrested for DUI with a blood alcohol content of 0.13%. Voters repeatedly re-elected Nugent until he retired from the Indiana Senate in 2014.

Rusty Black, R-Chillicothe, chairs the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force meeting Monday afternoon (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A group of state officials and business leaders tasked by Gov. Mike Kehoe with creating a new formula to fund Missouri’s public schools gathered for the first time on Monday under an expectation that funding should be below what lawmakers approved earlier this year.
Halle Herbert, the governor’s incoming policy director, told the group that Kehoe seeks funding “consistent with what is provided in the state fiscal year 2025 budget.”
Last month, lawmakers signed off on public education funding that was $300 million higher than what the governor recommended. 
“A lot of times when you ask a school superintendent, ‘where are the problems?….’ They ask for more money,” Kehoe told the group Monday. “That is not a great answer to me… That can’t always be the answer to every problem.”
Between fiscal year 2025 and 2026, a multiplier in the formula called the “state adequacy target” increased. This number is the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s estimate of proper per-pupil funding and is calculated by looking at top-performing schools in the state’s annual performance reports.
The change was driven by a new iteration of the state’s accountability system, called the Missouri School Improvement Program, which was introduced in 2022 and became more “rigorous” for districts to score high and produced a smaller number of districts that could be deemed top performers.
The program is required by law to be phased in, making fiscal year 2026 the first year with the updated state adequacy target. This change requires an additional $300 million to fully fund the foundation formula.
Kehoe’s proposed budget this January did not include the $300 million increase, and his comments in Monday’s meeting show an intention to tamp down the rising costs of public education.
Kari Monsees, deputy commissioner of financial and administrative services, said part of Kehoe’s intention with calling for a change to the formula comes from the “unpredictability” of the state adequacy target.
State Rep. Ed Lewis, a Republican from Moberly and former educator, pointed out that there was a 12% increase in the multiplier this year — but before now, it had only increased 4% in 16 years.

Superintendents have been asking for a formula that responds to inflation for years, arguing lawmakers “manipulated” the formula to keep funding flat.
A study commissioned by the department and released in 2023 concluded that the current formula hurts districts with more low-income students. Multipliers for serving sensitive student groups were “not based on any empirical analysis,” the study determined.
The study recommends looking at other states and the cost associated with desired performance outcomes to determine whether the per-pupil funding is enough.
But Kehoe is seeking financial incentives for high performance.
Monsees said there aren’t many states with performance in school funding formulas and alluded to a lack of information on that model.
The group that met Monday was created by an executive order Kehoe shortly after taking office. He appointed members representing public schools, agriculture, business and charter schools.
One member is to represent “a non-profit organization that works on expanding school choice in Missouri,” according to the order. Kehoe chose Chris Vas, a senior director with the Herzog Foundation. The foundation “advances K-12 Christian education primarily,” Vas said Monday.
There was some discussion that the formula, which was previously intended to fund public districts, should also be responsible for funding charter schools and vouchers for private education.
Committee member Michael Podgursky, an economics professor at the University of Missouri–Columbia, said there “was an active discussion of interdisciplinary school choice.”
“How do you design a funding mechanism with school choice, which really means thinking about tying it more to kids,” he said.
Podgursky has served as a fellow with various conservative research groups, such as the Fordham Institute and the George W. Bush institute and is a director at the conservative think tank the Show-Me Institute.

The vaccine is 97% effective against measles when two doses are administered. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)The Minnesota Department of Health has documented two new cases of measles in the Twin Cities area, according to a Monday news release. One case is an unvaccinated Dakota County child who was contagious while visiting Nickelodeon Universe in the Mall of America on May 24. 
The second case is a Washington County adult who was exposed during travel within the United States. Their vaccination status is currently unknown. The child with measles has not traveled recently and does not have known exposures to the illness. 
“Anytime we confirm a case of measles unrelated to travel that has no known source it is worrying,” said Jessica Hancock-Allen, infectious disease division director at MDH. “This is because it could be a sign that measles is spreading in the community undetected by public health and health care systems.”
MDH doesn’t yet know where the child was exposed and is working with local health officials to identify others who may have been exposed. These are Minnesota’s third and fourth known cases this year. MDH urged those who visited the Mall of America on May 24 to be aware of possible measles symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a rash. Measles can lead to hospitalization and even death.
Measles is a highly contagious airborne illness that can stay in the air up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. After being exposed to measles, a person could be asymptomatic for up to 12 days. 
The Minnesota measles cases come during a resurgent time for both the disease and anti-vaccine sentiments — President Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed conflicting opinions on the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations. 
In April, Kennedy traveled to Texas, which is experiencing the largest measles outbreak since 2000. As of May 30, the Texas Department of Health has confirmed 738 cases of the illness since late January.

Two unvaccinated children have died since the outbreak began. Following the visit, Kennedy appeared to endorse the vaccine on social media. 
“The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” Kennedy said on X. 
 In an interview with CBS news three days later, however, Kennedy argued that measles cases are inevitable. 
“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said. 
While the measles case count in Minnesota remains low, MDH recommended that Minnesotans get vaccinated and check their immunization records.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1140192021-1024x7371744799798-1.jpg,,,2025-06-02 17:08:24.935173

Senate Bill 1, which also includes supports for special education, would create a new endowment for early childhood education that would draw up to $300 million from surplus funds each year. Depending on surplus funds available and how quickly the fund grows, it would eventually allow families making less than $100,000 to pay nothing for infant and toddler care and pre-K, while families making more than that would pay no more than 7% of their annual household income toward those expenses. 
The bill would also improve salaries for workers in the child care sector, and allows for funds to be spent on expanding or improving facilities. Those funds — $80 million — are expected to pass in a bonding bill. 
Gov. Ned Lamont, who is expected to sign the bill, reacted to its passage on X on Monday: “Working parents need childcare. It’s an essential part of keeping a job and growing an economy. I thank the legislature for approving my plan to enact the largest expansion of childcare access in state history. Let’s keep CT known as the most family friendly state in the nation!”
Though Lamont’s original plan was limited to an endowment for universal pre-K, S.B. 1 is the result of negotiations between his office, House and Senate Democrats, and advocates over the past few months. Those groups had started off the session with a variety of proposals to accomplish the collective goal of supporting families with the high cost of infant and toddler care and pre-K in a state where spots are often limited and providers struggle to retain workers. S.B. 1 intends to address those roadblocks by improving salaries for child care workers and investing heavily in the sector. 
The House also passed House Bill 5003 on Saturday, which would address another headache parents face: finding available spots. H.B. 5003 would create a portal to allow families to efficiently find the child care and pre-K spots they qualify for. That bill would also make it possible to care for up to 12 children, compared to the current limitation of nine children with a primary child care worker and assistant, in a child care home — provided certain requirements are met depending on the size of the facility and it has adequate staffing — and it would create a pilot program for hospitals to notify new parents of the child care centers and other services available to them.
Deputy Majority Leader Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, said she hears from constituents daily about the high cost of living in Connecticut, and that child care is a key piece of that struggle. 
“So many of our businesses know how critical it is to have affordable and accessible child care,” she said. “Families deserve access to this care, because the greatest investment we can make is in our young children.”
But the bill has been criticized by Republican lawmakers, many of whom say that while they support the cause of funding early childhood education, they are troubled by using surplus funds to do so.  
Joe Polletta, R-Waterbury, talked about the fiscal crisis that the state found itself in back in 2017, and how the implementation of fiscal guardrails have helped the state dig itself out of that hole. “Little by little over the last eight years we have chipped away at those fiscal guardrails that got us to the land of steady habits that we are in today,” he said.
“We are going to fix something that’s not broke and I think future generations are going to pay for it. And I hope I’m wrong,” Polletta said.
Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, ranking member of the Education Committee, spent more than two hours questioning the bill’s proponents. She concluded that while she believes it is “our responsibility to make sure we are providing the best for our kids, because they are the leaders of tomorrow,” she would not be supporting the bill.
“I hope that everything in here is going to make the difference that everyone says it’s going to, and I hope that our children are going to be better for it,” Zupkus said. “I hope I’m proven wrong for heaven sake.” 
Many House Democrats rose to speak in support of the bill. 
Rep. Brandon Chafee, D-Middletown, who worked on the legislation, said that “all too often in politics we think in the short term, offering a temporary program or funding that solves the immediate need but does not solve the underlying issue.” 
Chafee said he likes to think of the analogy of offering a hungry person an apple, a short-term fix, whereas planting a tree to address the deeper issue of hunger. “We’re planting a tree here to help future generations. It’s not gonna solve the immediate need, but over time as it grows, if we nurture it, if we nourish it, it will provide into the future year after year,” he said.
Farrar said that on Saturday, since school was out, the building was also full of children of legislators and advocates who had come to cheer the bill’s passage.
“There was an incredible moment, being able to walk out and meet up with the many advocates and parents in the hallways as they cheered, because this is the result of decades and decades of work,” Farrar said. 
“For too long child care was seen as something that just sort of happened and didn’t have a real importance or weight on what was going on in the rest of our communities or in our society or our state,” Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said on Saturday. 
But she said those providers are truly the bedrock of the state’s economy and, “we need to compensate them, we need to have spaces for them to work in that are safe and clean, we need to make sure that they are able to care for themselves and their family.”
The bill also includes supports for special education, based on feedback collected by the Select Committee on Special Education.
That includes a $10 million grant to create better special education programming in some districts so that students don’t have to travel out of district. And it requires programs to send out notifications when staffing changes, like substitute teachers, last more than 10 school days — disruptions that can have a big impact on special education students. It also creates an educational ombudsman who would help mediate issues that arise when families are having trouble accessing services. The special education provisions in the bill complement those in House Bill 5001.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_0717_ChildCareStory-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 17:08:24.935173

Montana health officials confirmed additional cases of measles in three counties across the state during the last weeks of May, bringing the statewide count to 15.
Gallatin County first reported cases in April — the state’s first measles outbreak in 35 years — and it reported an additional case on May 23 and another May 28. Both new cases are listed as “community acquired” by the Gallatin City-County Health Department, which states that both cases likely came from the same exposure site.
All Gallatin County cases are no longer in isolation.
In Flathead County, health officials announced Friday that a second case of the communicable disease had been confirmed in a county resident who had recently traveled outside the state.
The individual was hospitalized with symptoms of the illness and has an unknown vaccination status.
Flathead City-County Health Department investigation staff determined two locations of public exposure, and recommend anyone who visited the following locations during the specified dates and times may have been exposed:

Location: The Logan Health building, also known as “The Rock,” located at 350 Heritage Way, Kalispell, MT 59901, which includes the following Logan Health Clinics: Heart and Lung, Hematology & Oncology, Orthopedics & Sports Medicine-Heritage, Urology

Location: Logan Health Emergency Department, 350 Conway Drive Kalispell, MT 59901

Date & Time: Monday, May 26th between 6:40 p.m. – 9:10 p.m.



Those who may have been exposed can utilize the health department’s Measles Exposure SelfAssessment tool to help determine their next steps: Measles Exposure Self Assessment.
Health Officer Jen Rankosky said that any additional confirmed measles cases and associated exposure locations in the county will be posted on the health department’s website.
The Hill County Health Department in Havre also reported multiple measles cases where the individual has recovered and completed isolation as of May 30, and on June 2 confirmed two new cases with possible public exposure.
Hill County officials stated in a press release that both new cases are in unvaccinated children. Disease investigation staff determined a location of public exposure at the Walmart in Havre, on Friday, May 23, between 5:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.

Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads when an infected individual coughs, sneezes or talks. Measles can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Symptoms typically begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body.
Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:


Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

A measles infection is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97% to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The U.S. Department of Justice filed a federal hate crime charge against the man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving eight victims hospitalized.
The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.” At least one victim was described as being in critical condition.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”
A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”
“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”
Soliman is expected to face additional state and federal charges in connection with the attack. Officials said they would provide more information on the charges at a 2:30 p.m. press conference.
Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.

Jeanette Nunez was approved by FIU trustees, will become president pending Board of Governors approval. (Photo via FIU)Jeanette Nuñez’ transition from lieutenant governor to university president is one vote away from happening. 
Nuñez was named FIU’s interim president in February, stepping away from her role in the governor’s office. Monday, university trustees unanimously approved her as the institution’s official leader. 
“I’m honored, I’m humbled, and I’m excited about the opportunity to serve my alma mater,” Nuñez said, thanking trustees. 
An FIU alumna and adjunct professor, she’s been applauded by trustees for her political experience and connections in Tallahassee. She served in the Florida House from 2010-2018.
“I think you’re an amazing addition at this point in time for this university and I am 100% positive you’re going to do an amazing job,” Board of Trustees Chair Roger Tovar told Nuñez. 
Nuñez’s presidency is expected to start on June 19, the board said, if the university system’s Board of Governors votes to approve her the day before. 
The former lieutenant governor is set to earn a base salary of $925,000 and up to $400,000 in performance incentives. In addition, her contract provides a $245,000 annual retirement supplement, $12,000 car stipend, and $25,000 moving stipend. 
Kenneth Jessell, the president who resigned when Nuñez took the interim job, was paid an annual salary of $650,000 with a $175,000 performance bonus. 
Relationship with the governor
With Gov. Ron DeSantis term-limited out in 2026, Nuñez now has a job with a, likely, clear future.
Tovar said in February, “The governor’s office has contacted me and suggested that we consider Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as the next leader for FIU.”
Nuñez was the sole publicly announced finalist. According to FIU, two others were selected as finalists but declined to be announced publicly unless they were the sole finalist.
At least one trustee predicted the outcome of the search. In February, Trustee Dean Colson said “the probable results of the search are already known.”
Monday, Colson renewed that sentiment, acknowledging that Nuñez’s service as interim president and the governor’s involvement could have deterred other candidates from applying.
“I believe she will be a very successful president. And to be honest, if we don’t pick her as our president, I suspect tomorrow we’re going to find out who the governor’s office second pick is, and I really like our first pick, so why would I take that chance?” Colson said. 
Nuñez to FIU is another example of DeSantis pushing for close control over state schools. He’s set his focus on New College of Florida and the University of West Florida, vowing “big changes” to the Pensacola school, and to make each more conservative.
“As trustees, we are trying to provide fiduciary oversight in a political era very different than just a few years ago,” Colson said. 
“Everyone has their hands in higher education these days, and there are a lot of different viewpoints. We are trying to figure out how to do what’s best for the institution and then hoping our decision aligns with what the people in the governor’s office want, and this is tricky. As a public university, saying ‘no’ to the governor, in most instances, is not a pathway to success.”
Matt Marr, an FIU associate professor of sociology, expressed concerns during the public comment period about the politics of higher education. 
‘Interventions by state government’
“My experiences at FIU have changed in recent years because of what I see as interventions by the state government and embraced by the board of trustees,” Marr said, citing the Stop WOKE Act, faculty unionization efforts, post-tenure review, general education course reclassifications, 287(g) agreements, and the way that Nuñez was installed as president. 
“I feel that shared governance and academic freedom are being undermined, and this has diminished morale among faculty and conscribed the kind of education and research that we can do,” Marr, who has been at FIU since 2008, said. 
Trustee Noël Barengo, who represents the Faculty Senate and was the lone “no” vote against Nuñez when she was up for interim president, said she has been “approachable” and responsive to his communications and has learned “really really fast.”
“She’s ready to work with us, and we are ready to work with her, on all these challenges and issues identified. Building trust will take some time,” Barengo said. “She is very strong in Florida, she knows the politics, and that’s her strength. Probably less strong, her track record on academic leadership, but I am convinced she will learn that. No one is born as a president.”
Tovar announced during the meeting that he will submit his resignation from the board of trustees in the “next few days,” saying, “The last thing I want to do is overstay my welcome.” He joined the board in 2017. He started a five year term in 2023.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)A host of top law enforcement officers briefed reporters in Tampa on Monday about their concerns about senior citizens in Florida being scammed by prisoners — alhough they offered few details. 
They did say that the culprits exploiting older Florida residents are state prisoners whose weapons in these cases are contraband phones, cryptocurrency, and drone devices.
According to Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister, a 92-year-old man has been robbed of more $800,000 over a two-year period and one of the perpetrators is an incarcerated individual. He added that more information would come later.
“We will have formal charges, but it got to the point where we started connecting the dots and realized we need to put the public on notice that a lot of these calls and outreach to seniors, it could very much be a scam,” said Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Ricky Dixon announced that in conjunction with the attorney general’s office and other agencies, “Operation Triple Threat” took place last week in three correction facilities containing approximately 3,000 inmates to search for illegal cellphones.
All told, he said, officers captured 400 phones. He did not name the prisons. Nor did the Department of Corrections respond immediately to an inquiry.
When asked asked how many cases involve prison inmates taking financial advantage of seniors, Uthmeier said “at least three known cases,” although he added that no formal charges have been brought to date. 
“We’re still expanding to see how far it goes, but at least a few different perpetrators and likely several more than that as far as victims,” he said.
Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey and Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Mark Glass also appeared at the media availability.

Free.,Homeland Security’s list of 'sanctuary cities' pulled down after sheriffs object,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/homeland-securitys-list-sanctuary-cities-pulled-down-after-sheriffs-object,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security over the weekend took down a public list of cities and jurisdictions that the Trump administration labeled as “sanctuary” cities, after a sharp rebuke from a group representing 3,000 sheriffs and local law enforcement.On Saturday, National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahue slammed the list as an “unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement.”“The completion and publication of this list has not only violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement, but it also has the potential to strain the relationship between Sheriffs and the White House administration,” Donahue said.DHS published the list Thursday and it was unavailable by Sunday. It’s unclear when it was removed, but internet archives show Saturday as the last time the list was still active.In a statement, DHS did not answer questions as to why the list was removed.“As we have previously stated, the list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly,” according to a DHS spokesperson. “Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens.”DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Fox News Sunday did not acknowledge that the list was taken down, but said some localities had “pushed back.”“They think because they don’t have one law or another on the books that they don’t qualify, but they do qualify,” Noem said. “They are giving sanctuary to criminals.”List followed Trump executive orderLocal law enforcement aids in immigration enforcement by holding immigrants in local jails until federal immigration officials can arrive.The creation of the list stems from Donald Trump’s executive order in April that required DHS to produce a list of cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration officials in enforcement matters, in order to strip federal funding from those local governments.Those jurisdictions are often dubbed ""sanctuary cities,” but immigration enforcement still occurs in the city — there’s just no coordination between the local government and the federal government.The jurisdictions are often a target for the Trump administration and Republicans, who support the President Donald Trump campaign promise of mass deportations of people without permanent legal status.Congressional Republicans in March grilled mayors from Boston, Chicago and Denver, on their cities’ immigration policies during a six-hour hearing before the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.'Strong objection'Local officials were puzzled by the list.One law enforcement association in North Dakota questioned why several counties — Billings, Golden Valley, Grant, Morton, Ramsey, Sioux, and Slope — were listed as sanctuary jurisdictions because those areas cooperate with federal immigration officials.In a statement, the North Dakota Sheriff's and Deputies Association said the “methodology and criteria used to compile this list is unknown,” and there has been no communication from DHS “on how to rectify this finding.”“The elected Sheriffs of these counties take strong objection with language in this release characterizing them as ‘deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities,’” according to NDSDA.“The North Dakota Sheriff’s and Deputies Association is working to gather more information regarding the lack of transparency and reasoning as to why the Department of Homeland Security did not fact check prior to incorrectly naming these North Dakota counties.”Local advocacy groups also noted the problems with the DHS list.“I assume they've removed (the list) because they were bombarded with complaints about inaccuracy and how and why these various jurisdictions got on the list,” Steven Brown, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, said in an interview Monday.According to the Internet Archive website Wayback Machine, the states, as well as the District of Columbia, that were on the list included Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and Wisconsin.Christopher Shea and Amy Dalrymple contributed to this story.",,,,2025-06-02 15:08:57.151931

(Photo by Getty Images)A new statewide poll found that Maine voters are overwhelmingly worried about the cost of living — more than any other issue by a wide margin. 
According to the poll from Pan Atlantic Research, 67% of respondents cited cost of living as their top concern. Immigration was second, with 39% identifying that as one of the top issues Maine is facing, while 33% said housing and 31% said high taxes are their top issues of concern. 
The poll asked Mainers an array of questions about policy and included favorability ratings of Maine’s congressional delegation, Gov. Janet Mills, President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. 
It was conducted May 12-26, surveying 929 adult Mainers (840 of whom are likely voters) and offers a snapshot of an electorate. Respondents were divided on whether the state is headed in the right direction, whether they approved of federal government oversight into Maine policies and the transgender athlete debate, which has put Maine in the national spotlight.
Musk and Trump receive unfavorable ratings
Despite growing discontent over living costs, the state’s top political figures maintain relatively strong approval ratings, with only President Donald Trump and billionaire advisor Elon Musk having more negative responses than positive. 
Independent Sen. Angus King leads with a +38% net favorability rating, and Rep. Chellie Pingree was popular in her district, with a 29% net positive rating. 
Mills fell slightly from a net favorability rating of +11% in September 2024 to +8%, while Sen. Susan Collins rose from +2% net favorability to +4%. 
Overall, Rep. Jared Golden was still favorable by a small margin, with 48% of 2nd Congressional District voters viewing him very or somewhat favorably, compared with 41% rating him as very or somewhat negatively.
But Mainers largely disapproved of Trump, with a net rating of -9%, and Musk, who has said he’s stepping back from his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, had an approval rating of -19%.
The poll asked respondents about Maine’s inclusive transgender athlete policy, which allows students to play on teams aligning with their gender identity in adherence to the Maine Human Rights Act. The policy was the reason behind several federal agencies threatening the state with loss of federal funding, and is being challenged in courts by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
A majority of respondents (53%) said that they believe that Maine should comply with the federal demands to change its trans athlete policies to avoid losing federal education funding. Thirty-two percent of respondents said that Maine should not comply with federal demands, while 14% were undecided on this question. 
The responses roughly fell along political lines, with 82% of Republicans, 52% of independent voters and 32% of Democrats agreeing that Maine should comply with federal demands.
Overall, a majority of Mainers did not think the federal government’s involvement in Maine policy was beneficial, according to the poll results. Forty-nine percent of Republicans, 20% of independents, and 17% of Democrats said that federal government involvement is “generally beneficial.”
Insights into the 2026 gubernatorial primary
The poll also asked respondents to weigh in on candidates for next year’s gubernatorial election, for both rumored and confirmed candidates. 
Among likely Democratic voters, businessman Angus King III, son of the independent U.S. senator,  led the field, with 33% of voters saying they would “likely support” him, and 47% said they would consider supporting him.
Twenty-four percent said they would likely support Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, and another 50% said they would consider it. Twenty percent also said they would support former Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Hannah Pingree, with another 39% saying they would consider supporting the congresswoman’s daughter, though she has yet to officially announce a run.
Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson, who recently joined the race, came in fourth among the potential Democratic candidates, with 31% of respondents saying they would either likely or consider voting for him.
State Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn), who also has not officially joined the race, led the Republicans, with 27% saying they would likely support her and 28% saying they would consider it. Former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin polled similarly, with 23% percent of respondents saying they were likely to vote for him and 36% saying they would consider it.
Businessman and former Republican gubernatorial candidate Shawn Moody was a close third, with 21% and 34% respectively saying they would likely vote for him, or consider it.
The only official Republican candidate included in the survey is Bangor resident Bobby Charles, who previously worked in the federal government during the George W. Bush administration. Forty percent of likely Republican voters said they would likely or consider supporting Charles.
Divided reactions on state’s direction
Republicans and independents were more skeptical compared with Democrats about the direction the state is headed in. Overall, 39% of respondents said the state is headed in the right direction, while 41% feel it’s on the wrong track, and 20% remain unsure. 
That is a significant drop compared with 2022, when 47% of respondents thought the state was headed in the right direction, according to the poll results.
The division is more pronounced along political lines, with 66% of Democrats expressing optimism, contrasted with only 25% of independents and 20% of Republicans sharing that view. Forty-five percent of residents in the more liberal 1st Congressional District feel positive about the state’s direction, compared to 35% in CD2.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier says it’s pretty basic why he won’t tell local law enforcement officers in Florida to stand down from enforcing a new state law on immigration enforcement, as a federal judge ordered him to do earlier this year.
He says it’s because he’s not their boss.
“These guys — they don’t work for me,” Uthmeier said on Monday in Tampa, referring to two Florida sheriffs standing next to him: Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey and Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister. 
“They’re independently elected county officers and they do a great job, but at the end of the day, they are their own officers. I’m not going to direct them when I don’t have the authority and I don’t believe the judge has the authority to do so.”
Uthmeier spoke just days after U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams heard legal arguments about whether she should hold him in contempt of court regarding the implementation of a new state law on immigration (SB 4-C), which makes it a misdemeanor for people in the U.S. illegally to enter Florida. 
Following a legal challenge by attorneys representing immigrant rights organizations, Williams blocked enforcement of the law on April 4.
The issue that remains tethered to Uthmeier is a letter he sent to state law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs on April 23, when he wrote that he couldn’t stop them from making arrests under the new law, and that, to him, “no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Florida’s new illegal entry and reentry laws.”
Judge Williams has said that Uthmeier not above the law and must abide by the court’s orders. 
Uthmeier said on Monday that the issue goes to the separations of powers and legal jurisdictions.
“Nobody respects the rule of law more than me,” he said in response to an inquiry by a Phoenix reporter. 
“But on your first day in law school you learn about the jurisdiction that judges have. And the orders of judges apply to parties before the judge in the case. The case in question in the Southern District. There have been prosecutors that have been sued in that case but no law enforcement agencies. So, when that judge asked me to direct law enforcement to stand down on enforcing the law, I’m not going to do that, because I do not have the authority to do that.”
A job to do
Uthmeier’s office as well as the statewide prosecutor and state’s attorneys have appealed Williams injunction barring enforcement of the law to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
“Again, I’m abiding by the court’s order, but law enforcement has a job to do, and as long as they’re not a party in the case and there’s no injunction that is lawfully binding them, then I’m not going to stand in the way,” he said.
Uthmeier, a former chief of staff to Gov. Ron DeSantis, was appointed by the governor to succeed Ashley Moody and become Florida’s attorney general in February. He has already announced that he will run for a full term next year.
DeSantis is backing Uthmeier’s stance in this case, saying last month in Tampa that the federal judge in this case has gone beyond her authority in calling on Florida law enforcement agencies to stop making immigration arrests.
“She’s trying to exercise authority that she does not possess. Fine,” DeSantis said at the time. “There’s parties to the case and she’s rendered a decision even though it’s a flawed decision that will be appealed. … You can’t go out and then say some sheriff in the Panhandle is somehow subject to your order — they were not involved in the litigation at all.”

The secretary of state operates the state’s elections, keeps official records for the state government and is third in succession behind the governor and lieutenant governor. Term limits bar current Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, finishing her second consecutive term, from running again.
Smith will be the third candidate seeking the Democratic nomination in the June 2, 2026 primary election, alongside Doña Ana County Clerk Amanda Lopez Askin and Santa Fe County Clerk Katharine Clark. As yet, no Republican candidates have announced runs for the office.
Trump administration efforts to change election rules, such as requiring proof of citizenship and changes to mail-in ballots, motivated Smith’s campaign, she told Source NM.
“The biggest threat to elections is people feeling safe and secure and that their right to vote is protected,” Smith said. “Our vote is our voice, and what we’re facing right now is the elimination of that.”
Smith received a bachelor’s in health services management from Norfolk State University and a master’s degree in health care compliance from Argosy University. She served as a combat medic with the United States Air Force Reserve in the first Gulf War, and worked in state health care before joining the New Mexico Department of Health, guiding the agency’s COVID-19 testing team. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appointed Smith to lead the New Mexico Veteran’s Department as its cabinet secretary in October 2020. She stepped down in November 2022, citing the need to care for her mother in her home state of Virginia. Smith returned to New Mexico after her mother’s death a few months ago.
Smith said her experience in election administrations is limited to “just being a voter,” but said her work in the Lujan Grisham administration gave her the necessary leadership skills required, including relationships to pass stronger legislation.
“I believe that my experience as a former cabinet secretary with statewide experience is just as valuable as having clerking experience,” Smith said.
According to the latest campaign finance records, Smith reported no donations or campaign expenses. She’ll formally announce her candidacy at an event Thursday.

Each year, the most important piece of legislation approved by the North Carolina General Assembly is the state budget bill – a massive document running to hundreds of pages that details billions of dollars in appropriations and scores of substantive law changes. It’s the kind of legislation that ought to feature days – if not weeks – of discussion and debate.
Unfortunately, that’s not how things have worked on Jones Street in recent years. Indeed, when members of various House Appropriations subcommittees voted on the budget the week before Memorial Day, they had only seen the 400-plus page document for the first time an hour or so before.
Despite this daunting situation, some members did their best to speed-read the budget and craft amendments on the fly and one lawmaker who proved most adept at this task was one of the House’s newest members – Wake County state Rep. Phil Rubin. And soon after the House finished with the budget, Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with Rubin for a special extended conversation to learn more.
In Part One of the conversation with Wake County State Rep. Phil Rubin, we discussed the state budget bill approved by the North Carolina House right before Memorial Day – including both the rushed process employed by GOP leaders and the fact that many Democratic members ended up supporting the bill because they saw it as a big improvement over the version passed earlier in the spring by the state Senate.
In Part Two, we dug deeper into some of the details of the budget proposal, including provisions that would politicize the state Board of Elections, as well as how the state plans to continue rebuilding parts of western North Carolina ravaged by Hurricane Helene, the big and worrisome new burdens that Congress and the Trump administration are soon likely impose on state government, and a pair of bills that could transform North Carolina government for the better – if only legislative leaders would allow them to be considered.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Another former South Dakota state employee has been charged with allegedly committing a crime related to their job — the sixth such case since last summer.
Alexandra Feiner, 24, of Pierre, is charged with three felonies and one misdemeanor for allegedly forging and approving her own medical marijuana card recertification without a doctor’s approval and avoiding the renewal fee. The standard fee is $75 annually.
South Dakota voters legalized medical marijuana by citizen initiative in 2020. The program is overseen by the state Health Department. Cardholders must meet requirements certified by a medical provider, such as suffering a debilitating illness, before they can be issued a card.

“The defendant is charged with using her position of trust as a Department of Health employee for her own personal benefit,” said Attorney General Marty Jackley. “This type of conduct reflects poorly on those state government employees who work hard for South Dakotans.”
According to a news release Monday from the Attorney General’s Office, Feiner’s criminal activity occurred between March 2024 and March of this year. 
The Attorney General’s Office was tipped off about the case by a Pierre resident and former state Department of Health employee, according to court documents. Feiner worked with medical cannabis cards in the state Department of Health and was able to create and issue them. She legally obtained a medical cannabis card in 2023 but allegedly reissued the card to herself in 2024 without a medical provider certification.
Feiner turned over her card to law enforcement, according to court documents. She is no longer an employee of the state, according to Open SD, the state government financial transparency website, and her initial court appearance hasn’t been scheduled.
Feiner faces up to nine total years in prison if convicted of the three felony charges, including forgery; offering a false or forged instrument for filing, registering or recording; and possession of a forged instrument. She faces up to one year in county jail if convicted of the misdemeanor charge of falsification of public records by a public officer or employee.
The Feiner case is among six criminal prosecutions Jackley has filed against former state employees since last year for allegations related to their work for state government.
One former employee, Lonna Carroll, used her position at the Department of Social Services to steal nearly $1.8 million over the course of 13 years. A jury found Carroll guilty of grand theft, and she’s scheduled to be sentenced in July. Other criminal allegations against former state employees included creating fake vehicle titles to avoid excise taxes, falsifying food service inspections, and the personal use of foster family food vouchers.
In response to the run of prosecutions, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during the recent legislative session that will expand the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthen the Board of Internal Controls; institute mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and establish protections for whistleblowers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order in April mandating the creation of a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal will deliver whistleblower reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
Lawmakers also passed legislation this year strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.
Last year, then-Gov. Kristi Noem added an extra internal control officer position to the executive branch and ordered state employees to undergo annual training aimed at preventing criminal activity.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-02 17:31:33+00:00,Mississippi Today,"With no runoff, Jackson’s June 3 general election is ‘last call’ for votes",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/02/with-no-runoff-jacksons-june-3-general-election-is-last-call-for-votes/,Mississippi does hold runoffs in general elections for statewide races – such as for governor – but not municipal.,"Out of six candidates on the mayoral ticket in Jackson’s June 3 general election, the one who takes home the most votes will be elected to office, even if he or she does not win a majority of the ballots cast. 
That’s because unlike primary elections in Mississippi, local general elections generally do not feature runoffs. This fact might surprise some Jackson voters, since the race that typically generates the most excitement each election season – the Democratic primary for mayor – often results in a lively runoff between the top-two vote-getters. 
“Everybody needs to be aware that Tuesday is the last call for drinks in municipal races,” said Brandon Jones, the director of political campaigns at the Southern Poverty Law Center. “If you’re planning on voting in a municipal election this cycle, this is your shot.” 
In Mississippi primaries, when no candidate receives at least 50% plus one vote, the election advances a few weeks later to a runoff in which the two candidates who finished with the most votes go head-to-head. Mississippi does hold runoffs in general elections for statewide races – such as for governor – but not municipal.
In fact, runoffs are unusual in the United States, and especially rare in general elections. Mississippi is one of just seven states to require primary candidates to win a majority of the votes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Even fewer states – including Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi – hold runoffs for general elections, but in Mississippi, that requirement does not apply to municipal elections.
Most of the states requiring winners to secure a majority of votes are Southern due in part to Jim Crow, when white officials deployed runoffs to prevent Black candidates from winning, said Byron D’Andra Orey, a political science professor at Jackson State University. 
“Whites would split the vote and African Americans might end up winning, so when they did the runoff, all of the whites came together who split the vote and they were able to defeat the Black candidate,” he said. 
This Tuesday, Jackson voters will choose between the winners of the Democratic and Republican primaries – state Sen. John Horhn and police officer Kenny Gee, respectively –  plus four independent candidates, businessman Rodney DePriest, musical artist Zach Servis, child care operator Lillie Stewart-Robinson and radio host Kim Wade. (Wade recently announced he was dropping out of the race but his name will still appear on the ballot).

With the ballot split six ways, it’s theoretically possible for one of these candidates to win  by a plurality – the greatest number of votes – despite not securing over 50% of the vote. 
But the chances of that hurting the Black Democratic candidate – which historically wins the mayor’s race in the majority Black city  – are low, Orey said. 
While he speculated that white Jacksonians may be motivated to vote for Hohrn’s white challengers, particularly DePriest, Orey said these voters likely won’t have the numbers to influence the election. 
“In the past, it’s always been the case that it was just a landslide,” he said. 
Jones said he’s seen a proliferation of independent candidates winning mayoral elections in the southeast, but that scenario depends on the unique politics and voting format of a city – and Jackson doesn’t quite have the conditions for a historic outcome like that. 
“I just don’t know of a format for voting that is going to prevent John Horhn from getting elected mayor of Jackson,” Jones said. “When you win by a plurality, that would still require someone to have more votes.” 
The only scenario in which Jones could see another candidate securing more votes and winning, he said, was if an independent candidate had a significant amount of Democratic support — and a Republican candidate was popular. 
“That’s just not the case here,” Jones said. 
Orey said he is curious to see how the lack of a runoff could impact the city’s council races, particularly the contested race in Ward 1, given that turnout among Black Jacksonians typically falls for the general. 
“There’s so much racially polarized voting, and one could play with the idea that turnout is typically low and it’s low amongst Blacks,” he said. “But it could be low amongst whites, because when you’re in a majority jurisdiction, you tend to think of yourself as a permanent loser.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/27215644/Candidates-Forum-3.jpg,,,2025-06-02 14:09:45.262393

(Will McClelland for Alabama Reflector)Former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Jay Mitchell announced Monday he is campaigning for the Alabama Attorney General’s Office.
Mitchell, a Republican who served on the Alabama Supreme Court from 2019 until his resignation in May, said in a statement that he is a “proven conservative and a warrior for President Donald J. Trump and the America First agenda” and is running to “stop the lawlessness, restore order, and dismantle Joe Biden’s radical left wing policies.”
“This isn’t just my race – it’s our fight for Alabama’s future. I’ll take on the radical left, advance the Trump agenda, and never stop fighting for our state,” Mitchell said in a statement.
He describes himself as a “law and order conservative with the guts to protect our Constitution” in the campaign launch video.
Mitchell claimed a “tough-on-crime approach to law and order” in his campaign announcement. Mitchell also said he plans to “aggressively pursue mass deportations.” His campaign video stated that Mitchell “will work with President Trump to make Alabama the state criminals and illegals hate most.”
On social issues, Mitchell said he would “defend the sanctity of life” and “fight the woke agenda,” saying that “no matter the cost, I will stand firm to protect the unborn.”
Mitchell in February 2024 wrote the majority opinion ruling that frozen embryos outside the womb are “children,” forcing several in-vitro fertilization (IVF) providers in Alabama to pause services temporarily. Mitchell wrote that there was no exception for frozen embryos under an 1872 law allowing civil lawsuits for the wrongful death of children, or under a 2018 state constitutional amendment that required the state to “ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child.”
“The upshot here is that the phrase ‘minor child’ means the same thing in the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act as it does in everyday parlance: ‘an unborn or recently born’ individual member of the human species, from fertilization until the age of majority,” Mitchell wrote in the opinion.
Attorney General Steve Marshall, who was appointed in 2017 by former Gov. Robert Bentley and reelected in 2018 and 2022, is term-limited but announced he would run for the U.S. Senate. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a first-term senator, also announced he would run for governor.

It’s now been eight months since Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc in western North Carolina and permanently altered numerous communities. And while the recovery work continues, one vitally important area that deserves much greater attention than it’s receiving is preparation for the next natural disaster.
As veteran journalist Laura Sullivan explains in a new PBS/NPR documentary entitled “Hurricane Helene’s Deadly Warning,” while the federal government spends tens of billions of dollars every year to repair damage caused by severe storms, much of the money goes to areas that are repeatedly flooded. Meanwhile, efforts to build back stronger and more resilient are often foiled by private interests and politicians who are only looking at the near term. The documentary is available on both the PBS and NPR websites. And recently, NC Newsline caught up with Sullivan – who spent months in western North Carolina after Helene hit – to learn more.

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A Sioux City physician accused of sexual harassment has agreed to pay a $2,500 civil penalty and submit to monitoring of his practice.
Last year, the Iowa Board of Medicine accused Dr. Phinit Phisitkul, an orthopedic surgeon, of sexually harassing a medical student at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) while employed there in 2017. The board charged Phisitkul with unprofessional conduct, sexual harassment and violations of Iowa’s mandatory reporting law.
According to the board, a UIHC committee found that Phisitkul violated the hospital’s policy on sexual harassment. In April 2025, Phisitkul underwent a psychological evaluation that concluded that he posed an “extremely low” risk of repeating the events of 2017 and asserted there was no significant expectation of any harm to the public.
To resolve the board’s charges against him, Phisitkul recently agreed to a $2,500 penalty and one year of monitoring that will entail a chaperone being present during all examinations and consultations with female patients. He also agreed to complete educational courses on professional boundaries and medical ethics.
Court records show that in February 2021, Phisitkul and the Sioux City clinic where he worked, Tri-State Specialists, were sued by Colleen Kissinger, then 67 years old, who alleged the clinic fired her from her job as an administrative assistant after she endured years of derogatory, age-related comments.
Kissinger alleged that Phisitkul had expressed a desire to hire younger, pretty nurses for the clinic and that after she was fired in March 2020, her position was filled by someone roughly 20 years younger.
As part of that lawsuit, Tri-State’s former CEO, Lee Hilka, gave a deposition and testified that Phisitkul had told him that he had been asked to resign from the University of Iowa Hospitals after two female students complained about him.
“When I met with him, he told me, he said, ‘Well, I’ve got a problem,’” Hilka testified, referring to Phisitkul. “I go, ‘What’s your problem?’ I knew this was coming, right? And he said, ‘I asked a student out for lunch, and she filed a complaint against me.’ Well, OK. And I said, ‘You want to expound and expand on that?’ He said, ‘No. And another girl also said the same thing, and the university asked me to leave.’”
In his own deposition, Phisitkul testified he has never been asked to leave any of the positions he has held in the medical profession, but he refused to answer questions about the UI students, arguing that such matters were irrelevant to the case at hand.
The court later ruled that Phisitkul had to answer the questions, but that given the “potentially embarrassing nature of the answer,” the information he provided would be sealed from public view.
During his deposition, Hilka also testified that he and Phisitkul were observing the Tri-State receptionists one day when Phisitkul told him changes needed to be made.
“We were staring at the receptionists, and there was the three people that I hired, all in their 60s,” Hilka testified. “And he said, ‘We’ve got to have more attractive — ,’ you know, he said, ‘more attractive, better-looking people up front.’ I said, ‘Well, first of all, the people that we have there are mature. They have been doing this job for, like, 20 years. They know how to diffuse a situation if a patient is upset. You know, a young person probably would panic. They know all about the insurance. They know all about co-pays. I would rather have that — you know, and they are always smiling. I would rather have that than somebody young, attractive, and that doesn’t know what a co-pay is, you know.’ And he said, ‘Well, we need younger people.’ And I said to him, you know, ‘Look, you know, you have had this issue before at the University of Iowa, and we don’t want to go there.’”
The lawsuit was eventually dropped by Kissinger with no public disclosure of any settlement that may have been reached.



State board sanctions doctors
Other Iowa-licensed physicians recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Medicine include:
— Dr. Pedro Rodriguez, an Iowa-licensed physician who currently works in Illinois as a plastic surgeon, has been fined $4,000 by the board. According to the board, Rodriguez was acting as the medical director of a central Iowa medical aesthetic services spa in which had an ownership interest. According to the board, he provided no on-site review of medical services at the spa while living and practicing in Rockford, Illinois. The available board records give no indication as to when Rodriguez violated the board’s regulations, and they do not identify the spa with which he as affiliated.
However, civil court records indicate Rodriguez is affiliated with MDJD Inc., a Rockford, Illinois, company that acquired Skin Body Soul Management, or SBSM, which had locations in Ankeny, West Des Moines and Coralville. In federal court filings, MDJD asserted that Rodriguez, as the company’s designee, “became the medical director of the spa” after the previous medical director resigned in 2022.
According to board records, Rodriguez denied being employed as the spa’s medical director. The board says Rodriguez agreed to the civil penalty to avoid the expense and uncertainty of pursuing the matter to a contested case hearing.
— Dr. Mark Fenzl, an Iowa-licensed physician who has practiced in Florida, recently agreed to surrender his license to practice in Iowa. According to the Iowa Board of Medicine, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration notified Fenzl of its intent to suspend his certificate of registration more than two and a half years ago, in August 2022.
DEA records indicate the suspension, which took effect in March 2024, was tied to findings that Fenzl improperly issued an extensive number of prescriptions to four patients at two clinics over the course of nearly two years. He allegedly did so without taking appropriate action to address “clear and repeated signs of (drug) diversion and abuse,” according to the DEA’s final order in the case. “Even when patients arrived at their appointments with vital signs indicating a medical crisis or emergency, (Fenzl) failed to address their dangerous medical situations and continued the same prescribing.”
Ohio’s medical board subsequently revoked Fenzl’s license to practice in that state, citing the “reckless prescribing of opioids in very high morphine equivalent doses in combination with benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DOCTOR.jpg,,,2025-06-02 14:09:45.262393

Employees received an email Monday morning from Grove announcing the buyouts, which are targeted towards experienced employees: in order to qualify for the buyout, an employee’s age plus their years of service must equal at least 65.
Although workers often fear that buyouts are a precursor to layoffs, Grove wrote in the email to employees that the company is seeking a refresh. 
“Every media company in the country is going through tremendous transformation right now in the face of unprecedented challenges and new opportunities. We’re no different,” Grove wrote. “If we’re going to come out stronger, we need to own our future. That means bringing our workforce into a new era and making space to bring new talents and skills into the company to help us survive and thrive.”
In the email, and when reached for comment via a spokesperson, Grove didn’t say how many employees were offered the buyout.
Employees who take the buyout will receive a $10,000 payment plus other benefits based on their position and tenure, including continuation of medical benefits and severance pay.
Grove took over the Star Tribune in 2023; he had been commissioner of the Department of Employment and Economic Development under Gov. Tim Walz following a career in Silicon Valley. He has spearheaded an overhaul of the 157-year-old newspaper, with a focus on reaching more readers and improving the company’s digital presence.

Despite complying with the demands of the federal investigation that prompted the funding freeze, Converge leaders have heard nothing about the status of their case and say they must continue operating as if the money won’t come through. That means laying off 10 members of their staff, as well as stopping funding streams to the dozens of clinics around the state that rely on the grant to offer preventive reproductive health services to low-income Mississippians.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told Mississippi Today on May 14 that the agency was reviewing the submitted documents to assess compliance with the law and the president’s executive orders. When asked for an update Monday, the department declined to comment. 
Title X, a federal program that has been providing money for family planning services to states for over 50 years, flows through Converge to 91 clinics around the state. On March 31, HHS told Converge it was withholding $4.5 million intended for Mississippi’s Title X program indefinitely pending an investigation into the organization’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. 
Seven states, including Mississippi, had Title X funds completely withheld, while another sixteen had their funds partially withheld. An estimated 834,000 people nationwide would be affected if the funds are never disbursed, Guttmacher estimates.  
In 2024, Title X funded 30,000 visits in Mississippi, the organization’s head told Mississippi Today. 
Since they received the letter, Converge leaders sent in the documents they were asked for, met with members of Congress, fundraised, and furloughed half their staff with the hopes of reinstating those employees if the federal funding came through before June 1. But now that it has not, the organization was forced to institute permanent layoffs.

“I thought that it would not come to this,” said Jamie Bardwell, co-executive director of Converge. “Because the accusations were so bizarre, we naively thought that all we had to do was show what we’re doing and we could get the money unfrozen. And I think that that was wishful thinking.”
Bardwell said Monday she has not heard from HHS since submitting all the requested documentation. 
The nonprofit is relying on fundraising to offer services like telehealth availability and pop-up clinics in the meantime.  
“I think often about the fact that we all feel so helpless right now, like, everything seems to be crumbling,” she said. “And the idea that we can do something, as individuals and as an organization, to help people in these dire moments, feels so good. And we’re going to channel that for Converge to create something that is useful for people, even though we never imagined this is how we’d need to do it.”
The next pop-up clinic will take place July 26 at the Jackson Medical Mall and will include physical exams, testing for sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy tests and preconception counseling, and prescriptions for birth control. All services will be available on a sliding scale. 
The team will have reproductive health kits available that include emergency contraception, condoms, a pregnancy test and feminine hygiene products. They will also be giving out free three-month supplies of Opill – the first over-the-counter birth control pill.

As more states reckon with the history of Black land loss, the Virginia General Assembly has been taking a rare, state-sanctioned approach: formally examining how the creation or expansion of public university campuses has displaced Black communities.
A 19-member legislative commission met last month, its first convening since a mandatory hiatus during the 2025 legislative session was lifted. Enacted last year, the commission received an additional $200,000 in the state budget signed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin in May, a major bump from the $28,760 it was initially allocated. As it prepares to enter its second year, the group is poised to deliver Virginia’s only known comprehensive statewide examination to date of how public universities displaced Black communities — and what forms of redress may be appropriate.
In Newport News, a separate task force has also been working since last year to address the displacement of a once-thriving Black neighborhood that was usurped to make way for Christopher Newport University. The neighborhood, enclosed by Shoe Lane and three other streets, was home to several generations of families who were forced to move when an all-white city council voted to seize a large portion of the area through eminent domain in the 1960s, paving the way for the school’s construction. The university’s expansion over time led to the acquisition of remaining homes. Today, only five remain.
The local response to probe this history, running parallel to the state-level work, is led by the city and university and has laid bare ongoing tensions among some impacted residents of the neighborhood and their descendants. The community members have raised integrity questions about the task force’s work, and frustrations remain high for some who say they are still waiting for the impact of their displacement to be fully acknowledged and addressed.
“We’ve done this before, time and time again,” said Angela Mickel, one of several attendees of a March documentary screening and discussion on Black community displacement, who expressed frustration toward public officials over long-term inaction on the issue. Like others in attendance, Mickel said she felt formal recognition of the community’s complete loss was long overdue.
“We have many stories that we need to tell, and Newport News needs to reconcile with its own history.”

Mapping ‘a pathway toward healing and repair’
While Virginia’s state commission and the Newport News task force have indicated that engagement with impacted residents will be critical to their work, both are still navigating how best to do so.
At the state level, the legislative commission has created a subcommittee focused on African American displacement in Virginia. When they reconvened in May, members adopted a formal work plan outlining how the commission will gather input from those directly affected by university expansion. That could include in-person public hearings, virtual comment periods, or an online platform for submitting written testimony.
“This particular work is pivotal to the work of the committee,” said Del. Karen Keys-Gamarra, D-Fairfax, who suggested that outside experts — not legislators themselves — take the lead on organizing and facilitating community engagement. “I would not assume that the legislators would be responsible for that … that would speak to the level of integrity of the work that comes out of that committee.”
All four subcommittees — tasked with conducting research, liaising with universities, documenting community displacement, and exploring forms of relief — have meetings scheduled through the summer and fall, with the goal of presenting recommendations for the full commission to consider ahead of the 2026 legislative session.
Commission Chair Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, expressed optimism about the direction of the work, particularly with the additional funding recently approved by the General Assembly.
“We are moving in the direction of and the process of acknowledging history, and listening to those who have been impacted, and seeking a pathway toward healing and repair,” she said.

A date for a public forum is still being determined in Newport News, where the city-university task force formed in April 2024 has faced criticism over limited transparency and slow outreach — largely due to lack of public access to its meetings and sporadic updates on its progress.
The task force has said outreach to families is ongoing, though members have also acknowledged that coordinating those meetings has taken longer than expected.
In a February city council work session, as members raised questions about the task force’s outreach efforts, the group’s co-chair, Vice Mayor Curtis Bethany, said the group wanted to prepare before beginning “full-blown” outreach, calling the issue “extremely sensitive” and noting task force members didn’t want to approach the community with a “half-baked pie.”
Public remarks from at least one task force member have indicated that the impending public meeting would involve gathering community feedback.
“We want to get the input from the citizens, from the families that lived on Shoe Lane, and from other families that grew up in Newport News,” said task force member Councilman Cleon Long at the March event.

Virginia mirrors a nationwide pattern of Black displacement
As Newport News formally examines the impact of university expansion on Black families, stories of similar displacement are reemerging from other parts of the state.
Adrienne Jackson-Franklin said her father, Otis, was young when her grandparents were among those forced to relocate when Longwood University in Farmville expanded into a bordering Black community in the mid-20th century. Former residents and locals in the area recall that the university cleared community blocks in phases to build dorms and academic buildings, displacing many families by threatening or using eminent domain.
“You lose friends, you lose connections, you now have to rebuild, and it’s almost like starting over,” Jackson said. She told the Virginia Mercury that she’d be willing to speak with the commission and believes it’s important that the state group address generational “deep-seated trauma” that may exist among families impacted by the displacement.
Lamberts Point, a once-thriving middle-class Black community in Hampton Roads, was partially razed in the 1960s and ’70s to make way for a branch campus of the college of William & Mary — now the main campus of Old Dominion University (ODU) in Norfolk. Thomas Harris, a longtime resident who moved to the area in the 1970s, said he has worked with remaining neighbors to address the continuing impacts of the expansion.
“I think they should have a whole lot to say about it,” Harris said of displaced families. “It tore up their homes. It tore up their families—they had to leave and go somewhere else to start all over again.”
Longwood and Old Dominion have both said they have worked to improve relationships with communities impacted by their expansion.
Longwood pledged to end its use of eminent domain for campus expansion in 2004, according to a spokesperson. ODU offers financial support for Lamberts Point residents admitted to the university, including scholarships either specifically for neighborhood residents or those that prioritize them.
Across the country, efforts to reckon with university-led displacement of communities of color vary. Davarian Baldwin, a historian and urban studies scholar, said Virginia’s statewide investigation stands out nationally as few other states have sanctioned similar examining bodies.
“In my research I haven’t heard of another one,” Baldwin said. “There could be commissions in almost every state in the union (but) a reparations commission around urban renewal is singular.” Baldwin co-founded the Renewal Project, a national network launched in 2022 to support local responses to campus-related displacement, including efforts in states like Kentucky and Colorado.

In both states, impacted residents are directly involved to some degree in reconciliation efforts. Descendants of the displaced Jonesville community in south Kentucky sit on a reconciliation workgroup led by Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, which was established in 2022 to identify ways to address the lasting impacts of the neighborhood’s destruction in the 1960s.
In Denver, descendants of a Latino community displaced from the former Auraria neighborhood in the 1970s hold the majority of seats on a nine-member council formed last year comprising representatives from several universities involved in the original displacement, including the University of Colorado Denver. The council oversees the future use of homes and a church that were saved from demolition, now part of a historic park.
What’s next
The months ahead may bring key developments in both the state and local investigation.
In addition to the impending public forum, members of the Newport News task force have publicly said a website could launch this spring or summer to make their research findings publicly accessible.
At the May meeting, the commission was still working to acquire responses to a survey it distributed this winter to most of the state’s 45 public institutions of higher education listed by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV). The survey included several questions about campus expansion, including queries on schools’ knowledge of displacement in Black communities. The Virginia Mercury polled the 15 four-year public institutions and 23 community colleges on that list. A majority said they had responded or planned to respond to the commission’s survey, including Christopher Newport, Longwood and Old Dominion University.
McQuinn said she expects the additional funding received from the amended budget will allow the commission to bring in more resources which could support the subcommittees work including hiring consultants or, if needed, project managers.
“One of the reasons that we were not able to make as much progress as I think we needed to make was because there was limited funds,” McQuinn said.
“The additional dollars are going to be essential in us feeling that the outcome (is) something that is worthy of the community.”






Davarian Baldwin, a historian and urban studies scholar, outlined figurative and tangible acts of repair universities, the state and localities could enact as they address the long-term impact of Black community displacement statewide.

Repair for property-impacted residents could take structural forms such as: direct payments to affected families; scholarships for descendants of those displaced; community development initiatives like affordable housing and community centers; and Community Benefit Agreements ensuring job training and procuring contracts from small businesses.
Given that universities are often property tax-exempt, an alternative approach could involve redirecting Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) directly to affected communities rather than the city.
Commemorative efforts could include integrating the community’s history into university curricula; placing historical markers; renaming buildings; and other forms of public recognition that acknowledge the past while fostering ongoing community engagement.

Jennifer Nelson filed a lawsuit in Caldwell Circuit Court last week, saying the state violated her daughter’s privacy. 
Nelson is asking for a declaration from the court that adoption records are confidential and that “adoptive parents are the only legal parents.” She also wants the court to block any future letters from being sent and other damages. 
Her daughter, 14, identified by the pseudonym Ann in the lawsuit, has been living at a Louisville residential facility since June 2024, Nelson said. 
“I’m so torn because in my heart, I want her home, and it hurts me when I leave her,” she told the Lantern. “We visit often, but when I leave, she’s okay. That’s home, and that hurts. But I’m also very grateful that she sees that as home. She is … in a living environment where she is not different than anybody else there. She has severe behavioral issues, but that is the norm there.” 
Nelson, a lawyer who is representing herself, names several state and local officials, including outgoing secretary of the CHFS Eric Friedlander and Department of Community Based Services Commissioner Lesa Dennis. 
A CHFS spokeswoman said that as of Thursday, the cabinet hadn’t been served with the lawsuit and couldn’t comment directly on it. 
“Team Kentucky is committed to the well-being of children and families across the commonwealth,” said Kendra Steele, the executive director for the cabinet’s Office of Public Affairs. 
“Once an adoption case is final, it is sealed to protect the identities of the child and their new family,” Steele said. “Very few employees within the Department for Community Based Services can access those cases. The department takes the sensitivity of these cases very seriously.” 
‘A higher level of assistance’
Jennifer and her ex husband, Jared, adopted Ann and her biological brother in May 2012, and Ann was “never in the legal or physical custody of her biological parents,” the lawsuit states.  
“Jared and Jennifer met Ann at the hospital on the day she was born,” according to the lawsuit. “The parental rights of both Ann and her sibling were involuntarily terminated.” 
It was soon “clear” to Nelson that Ann had special needs, she said, citing “cognitive impairments” and “various mental, behavioral and emotional problems.” 
“After years of documented and observed struggles with behavioral issues, cognitive impairments and mental health disorders, it was evident that Ann required a higher level  of assistance than either parent could provide, and that Ann had become too dangerous, putting herself and others at risk of harm, to be in a private home setting without intervention,” the lawsuit says. 
In August 2023, the couple reached out for help from the Post Adoptive Placement Stabilization Services (PAPSS), a state program that lets adoptive parents put their child in a residential facility without giving up custody, according to the CHFS. 
But over the course of eight months, the lawsuit says, the Nelsons and PAPSS tried to find a facility for Ann, but she “was rejected by every facility in Kentucky, multiple times,” over her IQ level and documented behavior issues. 
By that time, Ann “had become unmanageable in the home and was a safety risk to  herself and others,” the lawsuit states. “A symptom of Ann’s illness includes unprovoked attacks upon family and teachers. For example, Ann would routinely be suspended from school for hitting,  biting, crying, yelling and attacking both students and staff. At home, Ann would be  violent with her siblings and her family. On multiple instances she attempted to throw herself from moving vehicles.” 
In April 2024, the Nelsons took Ann to the children’s hospital at Vanderbilt in Tennessee after she “attacked teachers in her special education classroom and attempted to use scissors against students and staff,” the lawsuit states. The hospital kept her under observation for five days and then wanted to discharge her.
Nelson was “adamant with the hospital staff that the child was too violent and that Ann needed treatment. Jennifer stated that she would not leave without getting Ann help,” according to the lawsuit. 
Eventually, after the hospital filed a report — later unsubstantiated, according to the suit — of neglect against Nelson, she filed a custody petition with the state, asking CHFS to take temporary custody of Ann. 
That petition was approved, and the CHFS became Ann’s temporary custodian in April 2024, with a goal of getting her admitted to a facility and getting her stabilized so she can come home, the lawsuit states. 
“I love her. I want her better, but I want her fixed, because I’m going to die one day, and when that happens, she’s going to be in prison, or she is going to be in some group home, strapped to a bed, and I don’t want that,” Nelson told the Lantern. “I want her treated now so that I don’t have to worry about her being killed or arrested or strapped to a bed.” 
While in the state’s custody, Nelson says in her suit, the cabinet sent at least 60 letters to people — including biological and adoptive family — seeking placement for Ann. One went to Jared Nelson, Ann’s adoptive father, saying he had been identified as a “potential father,” according to the lawsuit and a copy of the letter shared with the Lantern. 
Nelson wonders what if one of the letter recipients had said yes? And who accessed the private adoption information in order to identify and write to Ann’s biological parents? 
Kentucky law states adoption records are to be kept confidential by the parties involved, their lawyers and cabinet representatives who are given permission by a court to examine them. 
“I think that they — the social workers on the ground — believe that they have to send these letters, but in order to know who all to send them to the biological relatives they would have to have access to TWIST,” Nelson said. 
TWIST is a computer database, iTWIST, that houses information on abuse and neglect cases and has itself been the center of a debate between the cabinet and the auditor’s office of late over who should have access to it. 
The incident led Nelson to believe there is a disconnect in policy and law. 
“I work with a lot of social workers, and I think the ones that are on the ground are doing what they can with what resources they have,” she said. “And I don’t know why there is such a block between the regs, the policy and the law.” 
For now, Ann is scheduled for a neurological evaluation in June, which Nelson hopes will provide answers to what, specifically, Ann needs treatment for. Right now, staff suspect schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mood disorder, autism and other diagnoses. 
The hope and goal remains: bring Ann home, a goal Nelson said she’s “devastated” to not yet be able to do. 
“Until we can figure out a regimen of both behavioral therapy and medication that will, at least, ensure her safety and everyone else’s,” Nelson said, “then … she’s where she needs to be.”

(Photo by Chris Trotman/LIV Golf)The Louisiana Legislature looks likely to spend at least $7 million of the state’s public money to bring the controversial LIV Golf League tour, owned by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to New Orleans next summer. 
The Louisiana Senate Finance Committee inserted the golf tournament spending into the proposed $49 billion state operating budget Sunday. Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said the Louisiana Economic Development agency, overseen by Gov. Jeff Landry, requested the money. 
Of the money Louisiana is putting up for the LIV Golf event, at least $2 million would be spent to upgrade the Bayou Oaks golf course at New Orleans City Park, where the tournament would be held. Another $5 million would be given directly to LIV Golf as a hosting fee, Henry said in an interview with reporters Sunday night. 

Henry said the money is going to help “get the course up and running for a LIV quality event.” 
In exchange for the money, Henry said the LIV Golf event is expected to generate about $60 million in spending for New Orleans. The tournament would be held in June or July 2026, at a time of year when city tourism is down and the hospitality industry is typically struggling. 
“It’ll drive significant economic activity at a time when the city is usually pretty slow,” he said. 

News of a LIV Golf tournament coming to New Orleans was first reported by WDSU-TV in March. 
LIV’s owner, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world with nearly $1 trillion in assets. Saudi Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman controls the money and the fund started LIV Golf in 2021 to compete with the PGA Tour, the preeminent professional league based in the U.S. 
The new tour has been seen as an effort by Saudi Arabia to “whitewash” the country’s record on human rights.

After becoming the de facto Saudi leader eight years ago, the crown prince enacted more liberal policies for women – they gained the privilege of driving in 2018 – but has engaged in a wirdespread crackdown on dissidents and critics of the Saudi government, according to a Human Rights Watch report.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Prince Mohammed’s personal reputation was also damaged in 2018 when Saudi officials killed U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi while he was visiting a Saudi consulate in Turkey to get documents for his upcoming marriage. 

Khashoggi had been critical of Prince Mohammed in his monthly columns for The Washington Post, and U.S. intelligence officials concluded the crown prince was involved in Khashoggi’s death, according to the Associated Press. 
LIV Golf’s debut upended the golf world in 2022. With its vast resources, Saudi Arabia’s leadership offered pro golfers far larger sums of money than the PGA tour could afford, including multimillion-dollar signing bonuses that led some of the sport’s biggest stars to leave the PGA Tour. 
Yet for all of its assets, LIV has not succeeded in making much of a dent with the PGA Tour audience of late. Its television ratings have been a fraction of what the PGA has garnered this year, according to Golf.com. Talks of merging the LIV Golf League and the PGA Tour have stalled in spite of President Donald Trump personally encouraging the deal. 

Louisiana is trying to sign a multi-year contract with LIV for the City Park tournament, but the state’s $7 million allocation would be devoted mostly to the first year of expenses in 2026, Henry said. 
Some of the Landry administration’s enthusiasm for LIV Golf League might be related to Trump, who considers Prince Mohammed a personal friend and who the Louisiana governor is eager to please. 
Trump’s private golf resort in Doral, Florida, was the site of LIV Golf League tournament the president personally attended earlier this year. One of the president’s first trips abroad since returning to office was to Saudi Arabia for meetings with Prince Mohammed last month. Trump made a similar trip early in his first term.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 

The $7 million Louisiana is putting toward the LIV golf tournament comes from the state’s major events incentive fund, which provides public funding for large tourist attractions. In the past, it has been used to lure the Super Bowl, Essence Festival and NCAA Final Four for men’s basketball to Louisiana. 

Other events getting money from the fund in the proposed state budget for the year that starts July 1 include the U.S. Bowling Congress Tournament ($5 million), an Ultimate Fighting Championship event ($1.5 million), the 2026 Southeastern Conference Gymnastics Championship ($750,000), the U.S. Gymnastics National Championships in New Orleans this August ($750,000), the Barksdale Defenders of Liberty Air Show ($500,000) and the State Fair of Louisiana in Shreveport ($100,000). 
Another $250,000 in public funding from a Jefferson Parish tourism promotion account is also going to the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, a decades-old PGA Tour event held each spring at the TPC Louisiana golf course in Avondale.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LIV-Golf-Adelaide-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 13:11:56.391394

Ole Miss and Southern Miss baseball teams both will play later today for the right to host NCAA Super Regionals this weekend. Meanwhile, late Sunday night Mississippi State announced the hiring of Virginia’s legendary baseball coach Brian O’Connor in an effort to get the Bulldogs back to Omaha and the College World Series.
Ole Miss and Southern Miss dug themselves deep holes last Friday night by losing in the first rounds of the Oxford and Hattiesburg regionals. Both try to complete the rigorous climb out of those holes tonight.
Ole Miss will play Murray (Ky.) State at 5 p.m. in Oxford. Southern Miss will play Miami at 8 p.m. in Hattiesburg. Both games are sold out. Both will be televised. The Ole Miss game will be on the SEC Network and ESPN+. Both ESPN+ and ESPNU will televise Southern Miss-Miami.
After losing to Murray State 9-6 on Friday, the Rebels have won three straight games. They beat Western Kentucky 8-6 Saturday, before defeating Georgia Tech 11-9 and then Murray 19-8 on Sunday.
After losing to Columbia 11-4 on Friday, Southern Miss then came from behind to edge Alabama 6-5 on Saturday. The Golden Eagles then trounced Columbia 8-1 Sunday afternoon and then, despite losing two key infielders to injuries, pummeled Miami 17-6 Sunday night.
Should Ole Miss defeat Murray, the Rebels would face Duke in a Super Regional this weekend with the winner advancing to the College World Series.
Should Southern Miss defeat Miami, the Golden Eagles would host Louisville in a Super Regional with the winner advancing to Omaha.
Meanwhile, Mississippi State has hired a new coach quite familiar with Super Regionals and Omaha. O’Connor has taken Virginia to seven College World Series and his Cavaliers won the national championship in 2015. Already inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame, O’Connor, 54, has an overall coaching record of 917 victories, 388 defeats and two ties, a winning percentage of just over 70 percent.
MSU president Mark Keenum, in a press release, said: “At Mississippi State, we have a long tradition of success in baseball. The ‘M over S,’ the Maroon and White, and hosting postseason in Starkville is woven into the very fabric of who we are and what we expect of our baseball program. Brian O’Connor is an elite level coach that aligns perfectly with our elite level program. His past certainly speaks for itself, but his clear understanding of the evolution and future of college baseball is clear. We are in the pursuit of championships. I am thrilled for Coach O’Connor, our student-athletes and Bulldogs everywhere as this is a historic day for Mississippi State.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/02111101/southern-miss-crowd-shot.jpg,,,2025-06-02 13:11:56.391394

Kennedy Jr., who is not a scientist or doctor, says you don’t need the COVID vaccine, but experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection still put you in a high-risk group of people who ought to receive boosters. The science is on the side of the shots.
Pregnant women who contracted COVID-19 were more likely to become severely ill and to be hospitalized than non-pregnant women of the same age and demographics, especially early in the pandemic.
A meta-analysis of 435 studies found that pregnant and recently pregnant women who were infected with the virus that causes covid were more likely to end up in intensive care units, be on invasive ventilation, and die than women who weren’t pregnant but had a similar health profile. This was before covid vaccines were available.
Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and the director of the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said he still sees more bad outcomes in pregnant patients who have covid. The risk of severe covid fluctuated as new variants arose and vaccinations became available, Silverman said, but the threat is still meaningful. “No matter what the politics say, the science is the science, and we know that, objectively, pregnant patients are at substantially increased risk of having complications,” Silverman said.
A request for comment regarding the scientific literature that supports covid vaccination for pregnant women sent to HHS’ public affairs office elicited an unsigned email unrelated to the question. The office did not respond when asked for an on-the-record comment.
Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before joining the Trump administration, announced May 27 that covid vaccines would be removed from the CDC’s immunization schedule for healthy pregnant women and healthy children. His announcement, made in a video posted on the social media platform X, blindsided CDC officials and circumvented the agency’s established, scientific processes for adding and removing shots from its recommended schedules, The Washington Post reported.
There’s still much unknown about how covid affects a pregnant person. The physiological relationship between covid infections and mothers and fetuses at different stages of a pregnancy is complex, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.

The increased risk to pregnant patients comes in part because pregnancy changes the immune system, Rasmussen said.
“There is natural immune suppression so that the mother’s body doesn’t attack the developing fetus,” Rasmussen said. “While the mother does still have a functioning immune system, it’s not functioning at full capacity.”
Pregnant patients are more likely to get sick and have a harder time fighting off any infection as a result.
In addition to changing how the immune system works, being pregnant also makes women five times as likely to have blood clots. That risk is increased if they contract covid, said Sallie Permar, chair of pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine.
The virus that causes covid can affect the vascular endothelium — specialized cells that line blood vessels and help with blood flow, Rasmussen said. In a healthy person, the endothelium helps prevent blood clots by producing chemicals that tweak the vascular system to keep it running. In a person infected with the covid virus, the balance is thrown off and the production of those molecules is disrupted, which research shows can lead to blood clots or other blood disorders.
Permar said that those clots can be especially dangerous to both pregnant women and fetuses. Inflammation and blood clots in the placenta could be connected to an increased risk of stillbirth, especially from certain covid variants, according to studies published in major medical journals as well as by the CDC.
When the placenta is inflamed, it’s harder for blood carrying oxygen and nutrients to get to the developing baby, said Mary Prahl, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine.
“If anything is interrupting those functions — inflammation or clotting or differences in how the blood is flowing — that’s really going to affect how the placenta is working and being able to allow the fetus to grow and develop appropriately,” she said.
It makes sense that we see the effects of covid in the placenta, Silverman said. “The placenta is nothing more than a hyper-specialized collection of blood vessels, so it is like a magnetic target for the virus.”
Blood vessels in the placenta are smaller and may clot more easily than in the mother’s circulatory system, he said.

Permar said recent data suggests that pregnant women sick with covid still have a higher risk of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and miscarriage, even with existing immunity from previous infection or vaccination. Covid, she said, can still land women in the hospital with pregnancy complications.
Prahl said the connection between stillbirth and covid may be changing given the immunity many people have developed from vaccination or prior infection. It’s an area in which she’d like to see more research.
There’s already strong evidence that both mRNA-based and non-mRNA covid vaccines are safe for pregnant women.
Prahl co-authored a small, early study that found no adverse outcomes and showed antibody protection persisted for both the mother and the baby after birth. “What we learned very quickly is that pregnant individuals want answers and many of them want to be involved in research,” she said. Later studies, including one published in the journal Nature Medicine showing that getting a booster in pregnancy cut newborn hospitalizations in the first four months of life, backed up her team’s findings.
Prahl expects more evidence will be available soon to support the benefits of mothers receiving a covid booster during pregnancy.
“I can say, kind of behind the scenes, I’m seeing a lot of this preliminary data,” she said.
She blames the delay in part on the Biden administration’s scaling back of federal efforts to track covid. “A lot of the surveillance of these data were pulled back,” she said. The Trump administration is further cutting money used to track covid.
But because the vaccines give a pregnant woman’s immune system a boost by increasing neutralizing antibodies, virologist Rasmussen is confident that getting one while pregnant makes it less likely a pregnant woman will end up in the hospital if she gets covid.
“It will protect the pregnant person from more severe disease,” she said.
Getting a covid vaccine while pregnant also helps protect newborns after birth. Pregnant women who get vaccinated pass that protection to their young babies, who can’t get their own shots until they are at least 6 months old.
According to data released by the CDC in 2024, nearly 90% of babies who had to be hospitalized with covid had mothers who didn’t get the vaccine while they were pregnant.
As recently as April 2024, research showed that babies too young to be vaccinated had the highest covid hospitalization rate of any age group except people 75 and older.
The Trump administration’s decision to remove the covid vaccine from the list of shots it recommends for pregnant women means insurance companies might no longer cover it. Pregnant women who want to get it anyway may have to pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket.
“I don’t want to be that doctor who just says, ‘Well, it’s really important. You have to vaccinate yourself and your kids no matter what, even if you have to pay for it out-of-pocket,’ because everyone has their own priorities and budgetary concerns, especially in the current economic climate,” Silverman said. “I can’t tell a family that the vaccine is more important than feeding their kids.”
But he and his colleagues will keep advising pregnant women to try to get the shots anyway.
“Newborns will be completely naive to covid exposure,” he said. “Vaccinating pregnant women to protect their newborns is still a valid reason to continue this effort.”

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis signed two bills on Monday that allow hotels and business property owners to have police remove squatters.
Under SB 606, police can remove a person from a hotel and arrest them after receiving a written notice that they need to leave if they fail to check out on time and refuse to pay for their stay. Similarly, SB 322 allows a business space owner to submit a form to the local sheriff to remove someone unlawfully occupying the property without a lease.
“What we’ve seen is hotel guests just not pay and squat in the hotel,” DeSantis said during the bill signing ceremony in Sarasota. “This forces the owner of the hotel to go through basically a traditional eviction process.”
Retail property owners will have to pay the sheriff’s office for serving the removal notice to the people squatting and for law enforcement to stay while the people leave. However, the alleged squatter can sue for wrongful removal and collect damages if any of their belongings are damaged, and recover their attorney fees.
Both measures go into effect on July 1.
Hotels and restaurants will have to inform guests about any service charges, such as automatic tips, on their menus and receipts under the bill sponsored by St. Augustine Republican Tom Leek.
Gil Reyes, Suncoast chapter president of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association and general manager of the hotel where the ceremony took place, thanked the governor for signing the bill.
“This legislation is a win for Florida’s hospitality industry,” he said. “It brings our laws in line with current practices, offers clear guidance, and supports both property rights and consumer understanding again.”

Why, rank-and-file legislators even have difficulty getting a spreadsheet that clearly shows what’s being proposed until just before they are expected to vote on the more than 100 bills — thousands of pages — that make up the multi-billion budget. 
Budget info is on a need-to-know basis in the Mississippi Legislature, and unless you are one of a small handful of negotiators, you don’t need to know. And the public or press? Forget about it. 
Shockingly, we’ve seen in recent years that mistakes get made in this hurried, harried and secret process. Big, multi-million dollar mistakes. Things get sneaked into budgets that clear headedness, deliberation and transparency would have prevented. Ditto for things that get left out. 
Earlier this year, the Mississippi Legislature overhauled the entire state tax code by accident, because of typos not caught in the secretive, hurried process. Instead of deliberating and fixing the mistakes, the governor and legislative leaders rolled with it, because the typos were inadvertently close to what they wanted. 
That’s a helluva footnote in the history of Mississippi governance and fiscal policy, one big, beautiful clerical error.
Mississippi budget secrecy hit another crescendo last week that had rank-and-file lawmakers on both side of the aisle angered. In a chaotic two-day special session scrum, lawmakers passed a $7.1 billion budget with nearly no deliberation and little adherence to proper parliamentary procedure. 
Most lawmakers don’t know exactly what they passed in the budget last week. 
The process already produced one major snafu: Lawmakers passed a $1.9 million line item in the Department of Health budget that, if signed into law would threaten the loss of more than a billion dollars of the state’s draw down of federal Medicaid dollars.
READ MORE: House passes bill that threatens Mississippi’s Medicaid funding, then skedaddles, leaves Senate holding bag
But because of the hurried, secretive budget process, the Senate was practically forced to pass the measure anyway, because the House had hurriedly passed all its budget bills in the wee hours of the morning then left the Capitol. Lawmakers said they secured a promise from the governor that he will line-item veto the mistake. They abdicated their purse string responsibility and passed the measure on to him.
It wasn’t always like this.
Not that many years ago, the Legislature’s budget process was a more transparent, egalitarian affair. While final haggling and passage of the actual budget bills has always been a late-night, last minute hectic affair, the budget process was more considered and open.
The Joint Legislative Budget Committee would hold weeks of public hearings on agencies budget requests and provide some scrutiny — again, in public hearings — on said agencies’ spending for the past year. 
Lawmakers, even rank-and-file, spent much more of their time on budget deliberations and generally, budget proposals were not a state secret. 
But what started as months of hearings and deliberations over time shrank to weeks, then, most recently, just a couple of days. Now, just a few agencies — the process of their selection is unclear — show up and give very and often superficial presentations to the JLBC.
The process has become more and more closed, secretive, or as one lawmaker put it recently, the “mushroom treatment” for most legislators — and certainly for the public. 
Legislative leaders have vowed to open the budget process up, or at least slow it down. But so far, that appears to have been lip service. Rank-and-file members from both legislative chambers, and both sides of the aisle, are growing more frustrated with the process.
Politics are politics, and they can’t be removed from the legislative process. But a state budget shouldn’t be full of secrets and mushrooms and political strat-e-gery. 
And huge mistakes.
Freshman Sen. Rod Hickman has penned an op-ed in which he summed things up nicely.
“On the day we returned to the Capitol, legislators were handed nearly 100 appropriations bills totaling over $7.8 billion in public spending — and were expected to vote on them immediately,” Hickman wrote. “No time for review. No chance for public input. No opportunity to amend. That is not governing — it’s rubber-stamping. And it disrespects both the legislative process and the people we serve.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/07090750/Mississippi_State_Capitol_building-e1507578089596.jpg,,,2025-06-02 12:24:07.550456

Kennedy of Macon has become the latest prominent Republican to declare his candidacy for lieutenant governor.The race for Georgia’s next lieutenant governor is heating up, with current President Pro Tem John F. Kennedy of Macon becoming the latest prominent Republican to declare his candidacy. 
Kennedy, a civil litigator who was first elected to the state Senate in 2014, has served as the second-ranking leader in the chamber since 2023. This year, he was also the lead sponsor of Gov. Brian Kemp’s legislation aimed at overhauling Georgia’s civil litigation system, which was signed into law in April after months of contentious debate. 
The lieutenant governor is elected on a separate ticket from the governor and presides over the state Senate. Because members of the Senate determine how much power a lieutenant governor has, a Republican candidate could wield immense influence in the Republican-controlled chamber.
While other candidates for the seat emphasized their loyalty to President Donald Trump and MAGA policies, Kennedy took a different approach, focusing on his conservative values and work in the state legislature.
“My first priority has always been to put hardworking Georgians first, and that’s what I will continue to do as Georgia’s next Lieutenant Governor,” Kennedy said in a statement posted on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. “I’ve never shied away from tough fights in the state legislature, and this campaign will be no different.”
In the Republican primary, he will face Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega senator who launched his campaign last month. Other Republicans are expected to join the race. Appropriations Chair Blake Tillery has filed paperwork to run for the seat but has not yet officially launched his campaign. Democratic State Sen. Josh McLaurin of Sandy Springs is currently the only prominent Democrat to have announced his candidacy.
The candidates are hoping to succeed incumbent Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones, who is widely expected to launch a bid for governor this summer. If he does, he’ll join a slate of candidates that currently includes Republican Attorney General Chris Carr and Democratic Sen. Jason Esteves of Atlanta.

Republicans in Congress are considering making major cuts to Medicaid. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Medicaid managed care in North Carolina has resulted in fewer “preventable admissions” to hospitals — hospitalizations for certain conditions that can be prevented with good outpatient care, according to a UNC researcher. 
“We’re talking about real money that’s being saved through this change in utilization,” said Sandra B. Greene, professor of the practice of health policy at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at UNC. “This is fantastic news.”
After the state expanded Medicaid, hospitals saw a decline in uninsured patients, Greene said. That means hospitals are now treating fewer people for whom they don’t receive payment, she said. 
Rapid changes, encouraging results
Researchers, community advocates, and policy makers saw an overview of how the rapid changes to Medicaid in North Carolina over the last few years have altered the health care landscape at a symposium hosted by the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at UNC and the NC Department of Health and Human Services on Friday. 
The state switched to Medicaid managed care for most enrollees in July 2021. That means that companies receive a certain amount of money per Medicaid enrollee and that health care providers are no longer paid for each medical procedure under a system called fee-for-service. 
The state expanded Medicaid to add more low-income adults in December 2023. Since its launch, more than 600,000 people have enrolled in expanded Medicaid.
About 3 million North Carolinians use Medicaid as their health insurance.
Rural residents disproportionately rely on Medicaid for their insurance, and many rural hospitals struggle financially. 
One of the arguments for Medicaid expansion was the opportunity it offered to strengthen rural hospital finances. Data from the first six months of expansion found that’s what happened, said Mark Holmes, Sheps Center director. 
“Expansion led to a substantial increase in revenue for all hospitals, more so in rural, and more so for the financially challenged hospitals,” Holmes said.  
More changes are looming
More Medicaid changes may be coming. A giant bill that passed the U.S. House includes work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. North Carolina Republicans are also actively considering work requirements. The state Senate passed a bill on Medicaid work requirements and included a work requirements provision in its budget. A state House committee has approved a work requirements bill. 
Work requirements have been criticized because they have been found to not increase employment but to result in working people losing their insurance.  
Susie Gurzenda, a doctoral student at Gillings, presented results of research on the work status of North Carolina adults before Medicaid expansion that showed 42% were working full time or part time; 26% were not working due to illness or disability; 10% had children; 5% were in school; 4% were looking for jobs; and 10% not working for some other reason. 
“Health Opportunities” project in jeopardy despite positive results
DHHS is trying to save a project it launched in three mostly rural regions of the state in 2022 called Healthy Opportunities. It aims to lower health care costs and improve the health of Medicaid enrollees by helping them secure food, transportation, and housing, and help those experiencing interpersonal violence.
Healthy Opportunities saved $85 per person per month in health care costs, according to an evaluation by Dr. Seth Berkowitz, an associate professor at the UNC School of Medicine.
Neither the House nor the Senate budget proposals include money to continue and expand Healthy Opportunities, though three legislators who attended the symposium said they were interested in it.  
The lack of Healthy Opportunities funding in the budget “has been a huge concern of mine,” said Rep. Sarah Crawford (D-Wake). 
“People are healthier because of Medicaid expansion,” she said. “We have more work to do.”
Rep. Tim Reeder (R-Pitt), an emergency physician, said he sees value in Healthy Opportunities, and has talked with DHHS about “how we can continue to demonstrate the value of the program.”
“I think, right now, we’re just trying to find sources of revenue to help continue the program,” said Reeder, a chairman of the House Health Committee. 
State House and Senate are far apart on the budget
Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett), a chairman of the Senate Health Committee and of the chamber’s Health and Human Services budget committee, said he wants money for Health Opportunities, but raised the question whether House and Senate Republicans would agree on any spending plan for next year. 
The two chambers’ budgets differ greatly on proposed taxation and spending. The two chambers must reach a compromise before sending a budget to Gov. Josh Stein for his consideration. 
“We’re far apart,” Burgin said. “Somebody asked me yesterday, ‘Will we have a budget?’ I don’t know. It’s the furthest apart I’ve ever seen it in my time.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Doctor-and-patient-Getty.jpg,,,2025-06-02 12:24:07.550456

(File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — For students hoping to study building and construction, Midlands Technical College has only 11 seats remaining in the program for the coming fall semester. The welding program is already at capacity. And a second enrollment surge in August is still expected, meaning additional incoming students will likely be waitlisted.
The Columbia-based technical college hopes to fix its capacity problems with a building expansion planned over the next several years.
More space for Midlands Tech students training for a job in the building trades and a Greenville Tech center that merges manufacturing and technology skills are among the largest projects for South Carolina’s technical colleges in the 2025-26 state budget. Legislators spent $16 million on each.
In all, the spending package sent to Gov. Henry McMaster last week provides South Carolina’s technical colleges with more than $150 million in one-time aid for building projects, maintenance and renovations. (See information box below.)
Training in automotive, industrial electricity, heating and cooling, as well as welding and construction have all seen a surge in demand the last five years, said Robbie Sharpe, who heads Midlands Tech’s building construction program.
“Students are having to wait a semester or two just to get into these programs, because we just don’t have any more space,” Sharpe said. “Our programs are busting at the seams.”
SC tech schools seek $5M to expand dual enrollment for high schoolers in poor, rural districts

For more than a decade, industry and educators have struggled with how to address a shortage of new workers in the trades as existing employees reach retirement age. Now it seems that recruitment effort is paying off, as long as technical schools in the Palmetto State can find the space to train them.
“The market is there. The jobs are there. The placement is there for our students,” Sharpe said. “They’re making really good wages coming out of these programs with virtually zero debt. It’s just, we’re just at the end of our rope.”
In the meantime, Midlands has raised enrollment caps and added night classes.
For example, Sharpe twice doubled the number of seats available in the construction program for the school year that just ended — going from 20 seats to 40 seats for first-year students in the fall and then going from 40 seats to 80 seats in the spring. He filled all but five of them.
They’ve also asked students to start with math and English courses that fulfill general education requirements as they wait for seats to open up in their trade-specific classes.
“We’re out of all of our creative options, and this isn’t something that’s going to go away anytime soon,” Sharpe said.
For years, Sharpe said, parents and educators were pushing high school seniors to pursue a four-year degree while trade education fell to the wayside.
“I’ve seen the mentality of students change over the last decade, but I’ve never seen this much momentum behind it,” Sharpe said. “People now realize that these are not second-rate jobs. They’re honorable careers.”
While the cost of a bachelor’s degree has soared, scholarship programs for technical colleges, such as the $5,000-per-year S.C. Workforce Industry Needs (WINS) Scholarship that comes on top of other financial aid, are covering students’ full tuition. When they graduate two years later, those same students are walking into jobs that pay upwards of $50,000 a year starting out.
SC colleges have frozen tuition for several years. University presidents say that’s not sustainable.

Legislators approved $91.4 million for WINS Scholarships in the coming school year: $57.2 million from lottery profits and $34.2 million from the general fund.
“Now we have to kick it in high gear to get caught up (to demand),” Sharpe said.
The $16 million legislators included in the state budget that takes effect July 1 for Midlands Tech is expected to fully cover the cost of expanding an existing building to add more classrooms and workshop space on its campus near the airport in West Columbia.
But it will take the college several more years to design the space and complete construction.
AI in manufacturing
While all of the state’s technical colleges have trades programs, those at Midlands Tech and Greenville Technical College are among the largest in the state.
At the Upstate tech school that feeds major employers, such as BMW, Michelin and Lockheed Martin, efforts are focused on building a new $41 million Center for Industrial Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence.
The state budget would cover $16 million of that cost.
The purpose, according to Greenville Tech’s spokeswoman Becky Mann, is to give the technicians who keep manufacturing lines up and running some expertise in cybersecurity and data science as artificial intelligence and other technologies become more ingrained in operations on the factory floor.
“Greenville Technical College will merge these two, high-demand skill sets in the Center for Industrial Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence, so that cybersecurity skills and artificial intelligence analytics protect plants against cyberattacks while anticipating and addressing maintenance needs and problems before they have a chance to occur,” according to a statement from the school.
The school cited IBM’s Threat Intelligence Index, which has ranked manufacturing as the most targeted industry for four years in a row. The sector accounted for 26% of all cyberattacks worldwide in 2024, exceeding finance, insurance, and energy.
Other funding
Among other major projects at South Carolina’s tech schools is a $15 million “Technical High School Workforce Center” at Central Carolina Technical College.
The money is meant to fund a partnership for a future technical high school in Sumter to give those student access to college programs offered by Central Carolina’s Industrial Department, according to budget documents provided to the SC Daily Gazette.
“CCTC supports initiatives that expand access to technical education and strengthen our state’s workforce,” college spokeswoman Nicole Miles wrote in an email.
No other details were available.



There are 16 technical colleges statewide. Here’s a breakdown of how the budget doles out $150 million to 14 of them for projects, maintenance and renovations. Two schools receive nothing in one-time aid in the budget that starts July 1: Denmark Technical College and Northeastern Technical College.

• Central Carolina Technical College: $23.5 million
• Florence-Darlington Technical College: $4 million
• Greenville Technical College: $24 million
• Horry-Georgetown Technical College: $8 million

Byrum’s campaign to seek the Michigan Democratic Party nomination on Monday announced that it has received support from Washtenaw County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum, Genesee County Clerk Domonique Clemons, Saginaw County Clerk Vanessa Guerra, Kalamazoo County Clerk Meredith Place, Muskegon County Clerk Karen Buie, Bay County Clerk Katie Zanotti, Midland County Clerk Ann Manary, Marquette County Clerk Linda Talsma, Menominee County Clerk Marc Kleiman, Lansing City Clerk Chris Swope and Westland City Clerk Richard LeBlanc
Former Ingham clerk Mike Bryanton, former Presque Isle clerk Ann Marie Main and former Ontonagon clerk Stacy Preiss also issued support for Byrum.
“It is so humbling to be recognized by your peers and supported in my candidacy,“ Byrum said in a statement. “This bipartisan group of election administrators represents all parts of the State and a diverse array of our residents. These clerks know what it takes to run elections and I am honored that they believe that I am the right choice to be Secretary of State.”
Buie said in a statement that Byrum has “the experience, knowledge, commitment, and integrity to be our next Secretary of State.”
Kleiman, the past president of the Michigan Association of County Clerks, in a statement praised Byrum’s wealth of experience as an invaluable asset.
“Barb has been a leader in the election administrator community and has a strong grasp of election law and how to practically apply it to ensure that our elections are smooth and secure,” Kleiman said.

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Good Shepherd Food Bank says federal cuts increase need for more state investment

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids. 


– Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
‘The lifeblood of the community’: States invest to save rural grocery stores

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
Federal cuts affect regional food access; more uncertainty to come

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)A state lawmaker is asking the top federal prosecutor in New Mexico to reopen a case that allowed the American government to take millions of acres of commonly owned land promised to New Mexicans in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
Rep. Miguel Garcia (D-Albuquerque) on May 28 sent a letter to U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico Ryan Ellison asking him to reopen a 128-year-old court case called United States v. Sandoval.
Garcia is asking Ellison to attend one of this year’s interim legislative Land Grant Committee hearings, at which land grant attorney Narciso Garcia will present the legal arguments and questions surrounding the case to either Ellison or his designee, and the committee will ask him to intervene.
Last Friday, at the committee’s first meeting since this year’s legislative session, Garcia said he took it upon himself to make the request, and that Ellison’s office is deliberating how to respond to it.
Ellison’s office declined to comment.
The case deals with commonly owned land — locally managed lands meant to sustain communities — in seven areas in New Mexico granted by the Spanish Empire and later recognized by Mexican law.
The justices ruled that the common lands were actually owned by the Spanish Empire, and therefore became the U.S. government’s property as a result of the the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo at the end of the Mexican-American War.
During this period, land speculators, including U.S. government officials, took advantage of adverse U.S. Supreme Court decisions to defraud communities of their common lands, Arturo Archuleta, director of the New Mexico Land Grant Council and the University of New Mexico Land Grant-Merced Institute, told the committee.

The Sandoval decision resulted in the seven land grants shrinking from an average of 450,000 acres to 1,500 acres, Garcia wrote.
He wrote that the ruling was a travesty of justice, and told the committee that it resulted in the depopulation of some land grant communities who could no longer herd as many cattle and sheep or produce as many forestry products.
“This was devastating for these communities because this is what brought on poverty in our state,” Garcia told the committee. “This is a good example of how our land grant communities were turned from a vibrant, self-sustaining community to an impoverished community.”
Garcia attached to the letter a 2018 working paper written by John Mitchell, who argues that after Mexico ceded the Territory of New Mexico to the U.S., Congress failed to incorporate it and allowed a temporary government to grant common lands to the inhabitants, which took away jurisdiction from the U.S. Supreme Court concerning land titles in the territory.

“Ultimately, the decision still belongs to the New Mexico Supreme Court who could hold that the de facto government did in fact grant common lands under existing law,” Mitchell wrote.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Multiple people were injured Sunday in downtown Boulder when a man reportedly lit them on fire, according to local police.
Eight victims ranging in age from 52 to 88 were transported to hospitals in the region, police said. One was described as being in critical condition, with other victims’ injuries ranging from serious to minor.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Saliman, was taken into custody by police and was treated for minor injuries at a hospital, Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, said during a Sunday evening press conference.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Michalek said.
The attack took place near the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall, an area in the heart of the city that typically attracts hundreds of people on the weekend. The first calls about the attack came at 1:26 p.m., Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier Sunday.
“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”
Participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, were the apparent target of the attack.
Michalek said the suspect was “heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.” He called it a “targeted act of violence” and said the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.
Kash Patel, director of the FBI, earlier on Sunday called the incident a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said it was a “heinous act of terror.”
Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the U.S. House, characterized the attack as targeting Jewish people.
“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, also indicated the group was targeted.
“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser said in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado.”

SPRINGFIELD – More than 150 bills moved through the General Assembly in the final week of the legislative session and will make their way to the governor, including measures touching on drug approval, college admissions and foster placement.

House Bill 3637 aims to protect medical providers who prescribe drugs that were previously approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration but had the approval revoked, provided the drug is still recommended by the World Health Organization.

The bill is part of a larger trend of blue states adopting “shield” laws — legislation guaranteeing the legal backing of medical providers from federal and interstate litigation, typically over abortion medications or vaccinations.

HB 3637 is sponsored by Rep. Dagmara Avelar, D-Romeoville, and has more than two dozen co-sponsors. Under the bill, if the FDA pulled its approval of a drug any time after Jan. 1, 2025, it can't be considered “adulterated” as long as it’s still recommended by the WHO.

“This current administration has made it very clear that there are certain drugs that they would like to pull approval from,” Avelar said.

When a drug is considered adulterated, that means it’s generally not normal or made to “conform with good manufacturing practice,” like an FDA approved drug. Doctors, nurses and other medical providers can lose their licenses for providing adulterated drugs.

But the bill would make it so the providers would not be subject to the penalties provided in law for prescribing such drugs.

The law also includes provisions that the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation can’t revoke or suspend the ability to practice medicine from a slew of medical professions based solely on the person’s license, registration or permit status.

Speaking in opposition, Rep. Bill Hauter, R-Morton, a practicing physician, said it was dangerous to base a drug’s safety on a WHO recommendation.

“It's not just for a small amount of drugs here, it’s for all the drugs,” Hauter said.

Rep. Jackie Haas, R-Kankakee, also voiced concerns about whether insurance companies and Medicaid would cover non-FDA approved drugs when they’re prescribed to patients.

The bill language does not touch on the formula for Medicaid or any requirements about what insurance companies must cover. However, Medicaid is required to cover the cost of any FDA-approved drug.

The bill passed the House 76-39, cleared the Senate 38-19 and awaits the governor’s signature.

Automatic university enrollment

If signed by the governor, a bill would mandate high school seniors and community college students automatically be offered enrollment to all state schools for which their GPA qualifies them.

The bill does not change universities’ and colleges’ GPA standards or admission requirements. Schools can revoke a student’s automatic admission if, after reaching out to the student, they discover they don’t meet other eligibility requirements.

The main sponsor of House Bill 3522, Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, said the state wants to encourage students not to leave Illinois for other institutions.

“Every student who is what we – I don't love the term – but college material, for lack of a better term, knows the opportunities that they have in higher education in the state of Illinois,” Stuart said.

If it becomes law, the Illinois Board of Higher Education and the Illinois Community College Board would start the program during the 2027-28 school year.

It passed the House by a vote of 103-10.

Foster placement excluding traffickers

A bill clarifying that the Department of Children and Family Services can’t place children in a household with anyone who has a history of human trafficking or sex trafficking is one step away from becoming law as well.

House Bill 871 cleared both chambers without opposition. Its chief sponsor Amy Briel, D-Ottawa, said it was brought forward because of an incident in her district.

However, House Republicans pointed out that a bill with the same intention, House Bill 4095, was introduced in a previous General Assembly by Republicans. Their draft came after a report was published by CBS News Chicago about DCFS placing a 16-year-old sex trafficking victim with a 24-year-old man with sex trafficking charges.

While the current bill and previous bill were similar, the previous bill would have amended one law. Briel’s bill would amend two laws – the Child Care Act of 1969 and the Children and Family Services Act.

Rep. Steve Reick, R-Woodstock, and the old bill’s sponsor Rep. Tom Weber, R-Lake Villa, called everyone to vote yes for the bill despite criticisms toward Democrats.

“This bill could have been passed two years ago,” Reick said. “And I'm wondering how many kids that this bill could have helped keep them out of bad situations.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago says that while the United States may be heading towards stagflation, there is still a strong economy hidden underneath a layer of uncertainty.
Austan Goolsbee, speaking at last week’s Mackinac Policy Conference, pointed to low unemployment rates and inflation hitting targets to suggest that rates should be “well below where they are today” within the next few years.
But he said that’s at risk due to the uncertainty caused by constantly shifting federal economic policies, like President Donald Trump’s will-he-won’t-he approach to tariffs – which he said Michigan is the most exposed state to in the country.
“If we can get the dust out of the air, I do still think that underneath there is a strong dual mandate economy,” Goolsbee said, referring to the Fed’s responsibilities to stabilize prices and maximize employment. “The longer we go contemplating really big changes, like some of the ones that have been discussed, the more that fades into the background.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Goolsbee compared it to when he started going to the gym and asked his trainer how long it would take for him to develop a six-pack.
“Everyone has a six-pack underneath. The problem is not the lifting of weights; it’s you’ve got to get all of what’s on top of there off before you can see it,” Goolsbee said. “And I feel a bit like that on the economy, you know, if we can just get this off of there, there’s a six pack.”
While Goolsbee said that the economy is currently heading in the direction of stagflation – with inflation rising at the same time employment is deteriorating – he said it will likely not be anywhere near as dramatic as the stagflation of the 1970s, when inflation was at 13% with an 8% unemployment rate.
But he said any decision the Fed has to make can have a large impact on people’s lives.
“What the Fed decides affects regular people. It is not just a game to be played out in the stock market,” Goolsbee said. “It affects construction, it affects purchasing cars, it affects whether you can buy a house.”
Ultimately, he said that while it would be easier to make those decisions with more stability, he said the Fed will adapt to whatever conditions they are presented with.
“I always say that our model at the Fed is the same as the Midwest, that there’s no bad weather, only bad clothing,” Goolsbee said. “You tell me what the conditions are, and I’ll tell you what jackets you’re supposed to wear.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMR_2362-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 11:23:58.216500

Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– Marsha Keene, CEO, Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)House Republicans on Sunday tapped Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, as their new caucus leader, handing the reins to a seasoned strategist from Southwest Virginia just as the party gears up for a high-stakes election year when each of the chamber’s 100 seats are on the ballot.
Kilgore’s election comes on the heels of Minority Leader Todd Gilbert’s recent announcement that he was prepared to step aside amid his pursuit of a federal appointment. A former House Speaker and longtime power broker in the General Assembly, Gilbert is under consideration for the U.S. attorney post in Virginia’s Western District.
“I’m honored by the trust my colleagues have placed in me,” Kilgore said following the vote. “We need disciplined leadership, a unified message, and a clear strategy to take back the House. I’m ready to get to work.”
Kilgore, 63, has represented the far southwestern corner of Virginia since 1993 and served as House Majority Leader when Republicans controlled the chamber from 2022 to 2024. He currently serves on the Commerce and Labor, Courts of Justice and Rules committees. His ascent to the caucus’ top job marks a return to frontline leadership, with a mission focused squarely on retaking the House majority later this year.
“We have no time to waste,” he added. “The 2025 elections are around the corner, and we need to operate like a team ready to win. That starts now.”
The vote followed weeks of speculation after Gilbert, 54, told colleagues in May that he might need to step away from elected office “on short notice” if nominated for the federal role. In a statement at the time, he stressed the importance of continuity. “This mission is bigger than any one person — and we’re going to make sure it stays on course,” he said.
On Sunday, Gilbert endorsed Kilgore in a message posted to X, formerly Twitter: “Leading our caucus in various capacities has been the honor of my lifetime. I wish Leader Kilgore all the best and look forward to helping in any way I can.”

Gilbert has represented  what currently is Virginia’s 33rd House District in the Shenandoah Valley since 2006. As Speaker from 2022 to 2024, he helped steer House Republicans through a period of divided government under Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Democratic control of the Senate.
In a statement posted on X Sunday, Youngkin applauded both men.
“Thank you to @cToddGilbert for your years of principled leadership as Speaker and Republican Leader. Your strong voice for common sense has made a lasting positive impact. Big Congratulations to @DelTerryKilgore… Your deep experience will serve Virginians incredibly well as House Republicans lock arms to win and lead.”
Virginia Scope reported that Sunday’s vote followed behind-the-scenes lobbying by several potential contenders, including Dels. Joe McNamara, R-Roanoke County; Kilgore; and Michael Webert, R-Fauquier. Ultimately, only Kilgore and Webert formally pitched their cases to fellow Republicans before the vote. A spokesman for the caucus declined to comment on “internal caucus affairs.”
Though he fell short, Webert expressed support for the outcome, writing on X: “Virginia’s House Republicans are strong with @delterrykilgore at the helm! I’ll be forever grateful for @cToddGilbert leadership and mentorship, but our team is ready to work together and win!”
Kilgore, who holds degrees from the University of Virginia’s College at Wise and William & Mary Law School, played a key role in avoiding a leadership clash after the 2021 election by stepping aside in favor of Gilbert, who was elected Speaker and then backed Kilgore’s bid for majority leader. Their mutual support helped maintain internal unity, a dynamic Kilgore now hopes to build on as he charts the GOP’s next steps.
With federal confirmation still pending for Gilbert’s potential nomination, the timeline for his departure remains uncertain. But with Sunday’s vote, Republicans have made clear they’re preparing for every possibility — and positioning themselves for an uphill battle to win back the House majority in November.

(Photo provided by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Police)A Kodiak fisher has been sentenced to spend a year in jail for illegally shipping thousands of pounds of tanner crab, much of it infected with a parasitic disease, out of Alaska to Washington state, federal officials said.
The fisherman, Corey Potter, was also sentenced to two years’ supervised release following his jail term, during which he will be barred from commercial fishing anywhere in the world, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
The investigation was led by NOAA Fisheries’ Office of Law Enforcement. The sentence was imposed on May 13 by U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Burgess in Anchorage.
The case concerns tanner and Golden king crab harvested in 2024 in Southeast Alaska. Potter owned two vessels, one of them captained by his son, Kyle Potter, and the other by employee Justin Welch.
Rather than unload the crab catch in Alaska, as is required by state law, the three men kept the live crab in the vessels and took the catch to Washington state, passing through Canadian waters along the way. The motivation was to fetch higher prices for their catch, according to prosecutors’ documents.
At the time, according to evidence presented in court documents, the men knew that a large proportion of the catch was infested with Bitter Crab Syndrome, a parasitic disease that usually kills the crabs and renders their meat inedible. Bitter Crab Syndrome is not toxic for people, but infected crab meat can be bitter and eating it is likened to chewing on aspirin.
That evidence included text messages from other Alaska fishers who cautioned Potter and his son against bringing infested crab to market, with one expressing concerns that their actions would hurt the reputation and marketability of all Alaska crab.
Bitter Crab Syndrome affects numerous species, and it is considered a possible contributor to the crash of Bering Sea snow crab and king crab stocks that led to an unprecedented string of harvest closures between 2021 and 2024. The main reason for the stock crashes, scientists believe, was the warmth in the habitat, which led to crab starvation. In the years leading up to the fishery closures, however, there was an increase in Bitter Crab Syndrome. The disease is linked to warming waters and climate change, according to scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Kyle Potter and Welch pleaded guilty last year. In October, Kyle Potter was sentenced to five years’ probation and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine; Welch was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.
Ultimately, the loads of crab they delivered never made it to any market. They were seized by Washington state law enforcement officers and deemed unfit for sale or consumption. Of the Golden king crab, 42% of the catch was dead upon arrival; of the tanner crab, so much was infested that the entire load was disposed of in a landfill, federal officials said.
Potter pleaded guilty in February to two counts of violating the Lacey Act, the federal law that concerns transport of wildlife and fish across state lines. Prosecutors identified him as the leader of the scheme and therefore requested heavier penalties.
Potter, in a presentencing memorandum, asked for probation rather than jail time, arguing that his long career of fishing in Alaska has now ended and that at the age of 64, he is now financially ruined. “As a result of last year’s terrible crabbing season, which included the instant offense conduct, he has been financially destroyed. One of the boats involved in this offense was foreclosed on, and the other is believed to have been seized by the state. He has been reduced to relying upon family for assistance and has no viable means to support himself,” the May 6 defense memo said.
But prosecutors, who argued for 18 months imprisonment, said actions with the diseased crab fit Potter’s yearslong pattern of sloppy maintenance and unsafe behavior.
In their presentencing report, also filed on May 6, prosecutors listed numerous past problems with the vessels Potter owned. They have been cited for chronically leaking oil, broken down at sea – requiring crew members to be rescued – and sunk in different sites, the report said.
“The defendant’s track record as a vessel operator in Alaska is abysmal. He has shown a total disregard for the safety of his crew, the safety of Alaskan waterways, and the health of the marine environment,” the prosecutors’ presentencing report said.
Yet to be determined is the amount of restitution that Potter will be ordered to pay for the trafficked crab. The government is seeking $187,187 in restitution. A hearing on that subject is set for July 15.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Secretary of State Scott Schwab takes exception to anyone insisting on a state criminal investigation of Kansas elections based on the assumption evidence of misconduct waited to be found.
Schwab, the state’s top election official and a candidate for the Republican Party’s nomination for governor, said Kansas elections were secure, fair and accurate. He was aware GOP rival Doug Billings said if he were elected governor in 2026 that he’d order the Kansas Bureau of Investigation to launch an inquiry into election irregularities. Billings asserted anyone who said Kansas didn’t have election integrity issues was lying or ill-informed.


“He’s not attacking me,” Schwab said on Kansas Reflector’s podcast. “He’s attacking the lady that’s retired, that volunteers at church and wants to volunteer as a poll worker. That’s who he’s attacking. And, if that’s who you’re attacking, your character is seriously in question. If you’re calling her a liar, OK, that’s between you and God.”
He said anyone running for Kansas governor should be familiar enough with state government to know the KBI was under jurisdiction of the attorney general — not the governor.
Schwab, 52, of Overland Park, graduated from Fort Hays State University, worked for a medical equipment company and entered the Kansas House in 2003. He unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination to a U.S. House seat in 2006, but returned to the Kansas House in 2009. He left the Legislature after elected secretary of state in 2018 and was reelected to that job in 2022.
He declared his Republican gubernatorial candidacy in January and revealed he was being treated for cancer in March. He said testing showed a lung abnormality that required surgery.
“They said, ‘Wow, we caught this thing really early. We’re rounding up to stage one lung cancer, but we’re gonna go in, take some significant margin, and you’re good,'” he said.
 
2026 governor’s race
Aside from Schwab, the most prominent politician preparing for the GOP gubernatorial primary in 2026 was former Gov. Jeff Colyer. He replaced Gov. Sam Brownback when he resigned in early 2018 to work in the first administration of President Donald Trump. Colyer, who lost the GOP primary for governor in 2018 to Kobach, was recently endorsed by former Trump cabinet Secretary Ben Carson.
Schwab said Colyer hadn’t held public office for years, and “he doesn’t win primaries.”
Other potential GOP candidates for governor included Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, state Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara, businesswoman Stacy Rogers and former Wichita school board member Joy Eakins. Only Billings has paid the filing fee to be a candidate.
Schwab said it was significant U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, U.S. Reps. Derek Schmidt, Tracey Mann and Ron Estes and former U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner wouldn’t enter the governor’s race.
“Suddenly, what was considered a very crowded field doesn’t get nearly as crowded,” Schwab said.
He said candidates expecting to mount a competitive campaign would need to raise about $1 million this year.
 
Taxes, abortion
Schwab said he would campaign on a platform that included a commitment to lowering the property tax burden on Kansans. He said the county-by-county property appraisal process needed to be updated. He previously criticized the 2025 Legislature and Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly for not taking substantive action to get a handle on property taxes.
On abortion rights, Schwab said he remained an opponent of abortion. He said a fetus deserved personhood status and legal protections afforded Kansans at birth.
“The question we’ve got to ask yourself is, when does a person get access to constitutional and legal protections? Is it after they’re born? A minute before they’re born?” he said. “Personally, I believe when there’s implantation into the uterus, and then because there’s a connection to the mother, that exists. That’s my personal religious belief.”
The Kansas Supreme Court issued an opinion in 2019 that said the Bill of Rights of the Kansas Constitution contained a fundamental right to bodily autonomy and that women in Kansas had the right to end a pregnancy. In 2022, Kansas voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have nullified the state court decision.
“I know where I would like to go, but it’s unrealistic, and I get it. I want everybody in the world to love Jesus. That’s unrealistic. I get it. I accept that. Does that make me an extremist? No, no,” he said.
 
Election reforms
Schwab said he was comfortable with Kansas voters casting ballots ahead of Election Day, but would prefer ballots were deposited in drop boxes operated by county election offices rather than relying on the U.S. Postal Service.
“There’s a few people that’ll say, ‘Hey, Election Day should be Election Day. Nothing early. Nothing by mail.’ But that’s an extreme minority. There’s three ways to vote in Kansas: In-person on Election Day, in-person early or vote with an advanced mail ballot. We don’t need more ways.”
Kansas lawmakers approved a bill requiring special elections to be conducted in early March, at the August primary or the November general election.
Schwab welcomed a law granting access to information from the Kansas Department of Revenue’s motor vehicle division to better identify noncitizens registered to vote. In addition, legislators said online obituaries could be used by election clerks as a reference source for removal of deceased individuals from voter registration rolls.
Schwab said he was disappointed the Legislature declined to enact his recommendation to make it a crime to harass an election worker.
“These are volunteers who are getting paid, but not much,” the secretary of state said. “To threaten them when they’re just doing what they were trained to do, it’s pretty ridiculous. Some people are just mean.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5210799-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-02 11:23:58.216500

But as Lindly’s dementia progressed, Gaskell quickly realized he needed help taking care of her.
Lindly was 70 in April 2018 when she was diagnosed with a dementia-related illness. At the time, she and Gaskell lived in Ruidoso, where they had lived since about 2006 after relocating from Houston. 
“I could tell in Ruidoso that she was starting to repeat the same words…She was starting to ask the same questions, say the same things. But the real turning point was when I came home one evening after work and there was smoke in the house,” Gaskell told Source NM. “I walked in and there was a pan on the stove and there was nothing in it, but the burner was on…and she had no clue.”
The couple moved to Las Cruces, where Lindly had better access to medical care. Gaskell said he asked his wife how she wanted to move forward with her diagnosis, and she said she wanted him to take care of her.
“She said, ‘I want you to be my caregiver.’ She said, ‘I don’t want to go into a home or facility,’” Glaskell recalled. “I proceeded to walk into the doors of Home Instead to apply for a job because I wanted to learn how to be a caregiver. Never done anything like that before.”
Gaskell started working with the Las Cruces healthcare service, which provides in-home care. He worked with several patients for two and a half years, until he decided he needed to be home with Lindly full-time.

“Those were the times where she wouldn’t know who I was. She’d say that I needed to get out of the house,” he said. “You learn real early on not to take anything personally.”
Gaskell told Source that his prior work as a crisis intervention counselor, as well as his experiences with recovery and sobriety, gave him a foundation on which to build his knowledge. But he also quickly learned that he couldn’t continue to care for Lindly alone. 
“One of the first things that I figured out I had to do is I had to find a support system and I had to find it quick, because all the folks I knew were in Ruidoso, I didn’t know anybody here,” Gaskell said. “The senior center was really…kind of our gateway, if you will, to building that support system.”
The couple started going to Munson Senior Center every day for lunch and events like dances, which the center hosts. They met people and connected with the staff, which Gaskell said benefited both him and Lindly. They were assigned a case manager through the senior center, who helped coordinate assistance for them.
Serving seniors

Assistance started with respite care, he said. A caregiver working with an agency the senior center contracts with would spend a couple of hours each week with Lindly so Gaskell could take care of his own medical appointments, go shopping, walk the dogs or just take a much needed nap. The caregivers would not only keep Lindly company and ensure her safety, but “went above and beyond” by doing light housework too.
When Lindly reached the point at which she couldn’t be left alone at all, Gaskell said he paid out-of-pocket for more in-home caregivers to assist each day. 
“What I found through the process was that as you go through it, you need more and more time away to rejuvenate,” he said. “Just the amount of support of people coming in that were just willing to sit with Galdine, willing to be there with her, wanting to be there with her. So I was very, very blessed.”
Lindly’s dementia continued to progress and Gaskell explained that she went through periods of time when she didn’t know who he was, to knowing him again. When Lindly couldn’t remember who he was and threatened to call the police on the “stranger” in her home, Gaskell realized it would be proactive to alert the local police about their situation.
Gaskell learned just how strong his support system was last May when he suffered a heart attack and had to stay in the hospital. Respite care for Lindly for several hours a week became 24/7 care while he recovered from an operation and continued when he returned home. 
“As far as having your heart ripped out [while caregiving], it made sense that’s the organ that failed,” he said. 
According to a report published by the National Institutes of Health, over 6 million people live with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia in the U.S. and experts project the number to grow exponentially in the next 20 years. The New Mexico Caregivers Coalition reports that about 419,000 family caregivers in New Mexico provide unpaid care annually, an economic value estimated to be about $3.1 billion.

By September 2024, Lindly started eating less and less, until she completely stopped eating and was placed on hospice care. By December, the hospice nurse told Gaskell it was time for family and friends to start saying their goodbyes. 
“I remained with her in the bed the entire time, as did the pups,” he said. “And then her breathing slowed and she took a deep breath, and then there was a pause, and then she would exhale. And she did that three times and then that was it. And it was as peaceful as you can imagine. And that was…this sounds crazy to say, but that was probably the easiest part of the whole process.”
Lindly passed on Jan. 7, 2025 at the age of 77.    


 

Since then, Gaskell has turned his efforts to helping others in situations similar to what he experienced. He told Source that the caregiver support groups he was initially directed to were largely attended by women and, while he gleaned information from the sessions, he said he felt there should be a similar space for men to share their experiences.
He started working with the Alzheimer’s Association’s New Mexico chapter a couple of years ago and now facilitates a men’s caregiver group at Munson Senior Center once a month. 
“One of the first things that I always try to do at the person’s first meeting is I always try to get him hooked up with as many different services as I can,” he said. “Going through the experience of seeing the person that you love most in the world just deteriorate in front of your eyes every single day, it’s painful.  And so you have to have some sort of outlet.”
Gaskell said he continues to visit the Munson Center, tries to help other caregivers as much as he can and spreads the word about services available to people in his community. 
“I can’t see doing anything else because so many people have helped me. So many people have helped me along during the journey that now it’s just a matter of giving back to others,” Gaskell said.

Planned Parenthood clinics were sent scrambling, cancelling abortion appointments and working with patients to ensure access in other states — a return to the way things operated before voters enshrined reproductive rights in the state constitution last year. 
Anti-abortion advocates, meanwhile, celebrated the return of regulations but acknowledged the win could be temporary. 
With no clear indication of when — or if — access to abortion will be restored, and a GOP-crafted amendment banning the procedure heading for the ballot next year, advocates on both sides are navigating the uncertainty and gearing up for the fight ahead. 
“…anti-abortion politicians in Jeff City have once again weaponized our political system against Missourians. What’s really clear here is the confusion this will cause among patients was the whole point,” said Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, later adding: “Missourians proved at the ballot box that what we want is access to abortion. This is not over, and I’m confident that ultimately abortion care will continue in Missouri.”
Sam Lee, a longtime anti-abortion advocate with Campaign Life Missouri, expressed relief that state regulations are back in place but cautioned that the only way to “safeguard the lives of unborn children” is to amend the constitution next year. 
“While it is good news that abortion has ended in Missouri – at least for now – it would be a mistake for the pro-life movement to rely on the state courts to keep these health and safety laws and regulations in place,” he said. 
Missouri Supreme Court order reinstates ‘de facto abortion ban’ across the state

While the court last week imposed what abortion providers called a “de facto ban,” it didn’t actually weigh in on the constitutionality of state regulations. The decision was procedural, calling into question the legal standard a Jackson County judge used to justify blocking certain abortion regulations enacted over the years by state lawmakers.
The injunction was vacated and the judge was ordered to re-evaluate the case using the standards the Supreme Court laid out last week. A new injunction could be issued, or access could be left in limbo while the case makes its way to a January 2026 trial.
Fifty-two percent of Missouri voters in November approved Amendment 3, which said “the right to reproductive freedom shall not be denied, interfered with, delayed or otherwise restricted unless the government demonstrates that such action is justifiable by a compelling governmental interest achieved by the least restrictive means.”
The amendment made Missouri’s abortion ban unconstitutional, at least until the point of fetal viability, which is generally considered at or around 24 weeks. 
Attorney General Andrew Bailey acknowledges this in his appeal to the Supreme Court, writing that among the laws which are no longer enforceable because of Amendment 3 are “Missouri’s prohibitions on abortion before viability.”
But myriad other restrictions remained on the books, including wait times before abortions and constraints on where abortions could be performed.
Planned Parenthood affiliates in Missouri sued in December to overturn the state’s Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers, or TRAP laws. Over the course of a decade before an outright ban on abortion was put in place, those laws resulted in the number of abortions performed in Missouri falling from more than 5,000 to less than 200. 
Over the course of two rulings — one in December and one in February — Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang pointed to the voter-approved constitutional amendment in issuing the temporary injunction.
Most notably, Zhang struck down licensing requirements for abortion clinics, arguing the regulations were “unnecessary” and “discriminatory” because they do not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.
She left in place a requirement that all abortion providers have a medical license.
Zhang’s ruling opened the door for procedural abortions to resume in Planned Parenthood’s Kansas City and Columbia clinics. Medication abortions, which nationally make up two-thirds of all abortions, have not been available as the clinics have been unable to get the state to approve a required complication plan. 
The state Supreme Court order, signed by Chief Justice Mary Russell, means even procedural abortions are now inaccessible in Missouri. 
“This is not the end of the legal battle, but it is a critical victory for every pro-life Missourian,” said Brian Westbrook, executive director of Coalition Life.
Abortion may be inaccessible in Missouri, but “the good news is that this court ruling does not affect other reproductive and sexual health care provided at Planned Parenthood health centers across the state,” said Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.
The hope, Baum said, is that the court’s order is only a “temporary setback.” In the meantime, she said access to abortion is still available in Kansas and Illinois and that Planned Parenthood will support patients “who need lodging, transportation and other resources to access sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion.”

(Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)Alaska school districts are ramping up international hiring. For some, that means sending their own recruiters to the Philippines. In Part 2 of this five part audio series, Mabuhay sa Alaska, KMXT’s Brian Venua reports that the process can be pretty complicated, and it’s only getting more stressful.
Julieth Tapado was one of hundreds of teachers waiting for the chance to impress recruiters from Alaska school districts earlier this year. She drove about an hour from Cavite City to the recruiting event in Manila, then waited even longer to get in. She said Alaska was at the top of her list — she hadn’t applied anywhere else in the U.S.
“I’m curious and excited to work in Alaska because I believe the tradition and the culture is still not like other states,” Tapado said. She said she’s heard the people are more genuine in places like Kodiak.
This is Tapado’s third attempt to get a job in Alaska. She has friends and family that have been successful in Alaska, and she wants to join them.
“There are a lot of school districts looking, so I might be one of those blessed aspirants!” she said.

Serjoe Gutierrez has taught in Kodiak for the last three years. Now he also helps Alaska districts fill vacancies with teachers from his home country.
“This is the start of your dreams,” he told Tapado and 120 of her peers at the start of the event. They were the first of six groups about that size that the recruiters would meet on their 2025 recruiting trip. The administrators asked candidates about classroom management and how they connect with families. They were also looking for skills like English fluency and the ability to respond to questions quickly.
Each candidate had less than 10 minutes with recruiters. They could earn more time through a callback, but less than a third were asked for one.
  Recruiters split into multiple groups in the first rounds of interviews to meet with up to 240 people in a single day. (Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)
That’s where the process shifts to the bureaucracy around immigration.
“You need to go through (the) Visa Application Center, get your biometrics, get your pictures done,” Gutierrez said to the crowd of applicants. “And once you’re done, you need to schedule a U.S. Embassy interview.”
Teachers also have to pay hundreds of dollars in application fees to the U.S. embassy and work with the Philippine government’s Department of Migrant Workers and its licensed agencies.

After arriving in the U.S., but before starting in classrooms, new teachers have to file for teacher certification and Social Security numbers.
All of the paperwork gets pretty complicated.
That’s why at least seven Alaska districts, including Kodiak’s, work with immigration lawyer Russell Ford. Ford, of FordMurry Law, is based in Maine but has public school districts and private schools across the country as clients.
He helped his Alaska clients figure out which visa was most appropriate.
“When we met them, most of their teachers were on J1,” Ford said.
J1 visas are supposed to promote international cultural exchange. They allow foreign nationals to live and work in the United States for three years and can be extended up to five years.
A former J1 visa holder can reapply after returning to their home country for two years. In the past, many Alaska school districts hired from abroad through third-party recruiting agencies that used J1 visas.
Now that administrators are recruiting directly with Ford’s help, many have shifted to using H1B visas. Those are designed for high-skill jobs like teachers and allow for longer careers in the U.S.
“If everything is working out, then there’s the possibility of sponsorship for permanent residence or a green card,” Ford said.
That opens the door for districts and communities to build long-term relationships with international hires.

Neil Frank Rivera Ferrer is the Philippines’ consulate general in San Francisco and provides immigration services for Philippine nationals across 10 states, including Alaska. He said switching to the H1B visa is the right call.
“We would prefer if those that are coming to Alaska and coming to the U.S. in general, for work purposes, should get a work visa – the H1B visa instead of a J1 visa, which is really more of a temporary, cultural, short term visit to the U.S.,” Ferrer said.
But U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services issues a limited number of H1B visas each year. And President Donald Trump’s administration has sworn to deport millions of illegal immigrants. Some legal immigrants have been caught in his crosshairs, too.
Ford said that’s left his clients with more uncertainty about living in the U.S..
“I’m having conversations that are a little tougher – it’s about people’s fears,” Ford said. “It’s about – ‘Can I go home? Should I go home? Can I travel? Do people want me here?’ So I’m doing more counseling, and not from a legal sense, but just having someone to talk to.”

Ford said H1B applications have had a few more delays than before, but he’s trying to run business as usual. He just makes sure to remind clients to be extra careful to follow the law and avoid attracting negative attention.
At least one Filipino migrant in Kodiak was arrested by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, in April. Elsewhere, ICE has deported legal Filipino immigrants.
But for candidates like Julieth Tapado at the recruiting event in Manila, the work is worth it. This wasn’t her year — again — but she’s already planning to try again next year.
“I’m still hoping that somehow, in God’s time, in God’s beautiful time, I could be able to achieve my dream working in Alaska as an English teacher,” Tapado said.

Barton, 69, a long-time Montpelier resident, passed away peacefully on May 18, 2025, in her son’s home surrounded by love and family until her last moments. Already missing her profoundly are her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren whom she adored above all else. Her siblings, nieces, and nephews in Maine and Georgia are also deeply mourning — Susan put family first in all that she did, accepted everyone on their own terms and loved them no matter what. Her kindness, generosity of spirit, and dedication to family is her legacy — those of us who knew and loved Susan aspire to live up to these same values.Born and raised in Maine with three sisters and two brothers, Susan went international for a short time and moved to Eel River Bar, a Mi’kmaq First Nation in New Brunswick, Canada and then married her husband, Thomas Caplin. They moved back to Maine and then to Vermont in the early 80s to raise their family of two with a third on the way. As the universe would have it, they parted ways. Susan then met her longtime life partner, Walter Baldwin Sr., and added two more children to the clan, and they raised the five youngsters together: Tin, SueAnne, Jennifer, Crystal, and Walter Jr. Being a Catholic Irish-American, Susan always wanted a large loving family: she is survived by 5 children, 6 granddaughters, 2 grandsons, 3 great grandchildren and 2 more on the way! Susan cherished all her family and traveled frequently to Maine to visit her extended family, while camping and visiting Old Orchard Beach. She especially enjoyed spending time at her beloved younger sister Peggy’s home where she spent days visiting with family. She was predeceased by her sister Peggy, her mother Margaret, her father Charles, and her partner Walter.Susan was a dedicated and hard worker. She found her passion in cleaning: “Cleanliness is next to Godliness” was a phrase heard often in her home — while her family were holding their noses and complaining that she used too much bleach! She successfully turned this value into employment as a commercial custodian and was happy to go to work each day for decades. She was proud to work with Keurig DR Pepper (formerly Green Mountain Coffee Roasters) as a contractor then a full employee for 23 years where she was awarded and recognized for her positive spirit, hard work, dedication, and loyalty. When Keurig moved out of Vermont, she transitioned to a career with the State of Vermont Buildings and General Services Department providing custodial services in several buildings where human services were provided. She said she felt it was her duty to keep things sanitary to help people stay healthy. She doubled down on this commitment through the pandemic being an essential worker. And her new employment brought co-workers who soon became part of her extended family.Susan spent much of her life raising her children and working, but she liked to let her hair down every so often and periodically played Bingo or scratch off tickets and took the occasional trip to a regional casino. She loved the thrill and excitement of possibly winning big bucks!  But even when she won — no matter the amount — she would always split the winnings with her friends and family. She also liked to go shopping for others, finding special gifts for those dear to her. She had a special admiration for angels — her shelves nearly overflowing with angel statutes! She had an artistic and crafty side that she rarely got to express, but one year she skillfully sewed three coordinated Easter dresses for her daughters. She also loved flowers – and though she wouldn’t have considered herself a pro-gardener, she spent many summers digging in the dirt with her children and grandchildren. Her son learnt gardening from her and student became teacher with large gardens and each spring a colorful “Tulipmania” blooming in his yards: her final days were filled with daily bouquets from these gardens. Most of all though, Susan liked gathering family for Sunday dinners or BBQs or birthday parties — she just loved sitting around the table and chatting while sharing coffee and food.Though filled with love, Susan’s life also included some significant hardships — at times being a single mother, living for periods with inadequate economic resources, being homeless three times, and experiencing intimate partner violence — and yet she always remained resilient and worked hard for a better, brighter future. And these hardships along with her faith also galvanized in her the desire to go the extra mile to help anyone else in need. She regularly “adopted” the neighborhood kids and welcomed them to the dinner table just as one of her own. She loved life and would never let anything stop her.  Even when diagnosed with breast cancer and then lung cancer, she resisted the need to be out of work wanting to remain active and maintain her normal routine. And she fought hard to return to work in this final year — she didn’t like sitting idle or letting down her work team, especially as she now considered them family. The support and grace her work colleagues offered as her health declined was a blessing she so appreciated even when hard to accept. For her entire life, Susan gave all of herself to anyone she loved and to anyone in need — and in the end, she was able to finally realize there was so much love and beauty in accepting help too.Susan was dearly loved and is deeply missed by all who knew her.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Susan J.

Jim Clyburn talk to reporters at Clyburn’s annual fish fry Friday, May 30, 2025. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care and encouraged people to get involved, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn’s annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.
“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.
“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.
Walz also spoke at the South Carolina Democratic Party’s annual convention on Saturday.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said.
In 2019, the fish fry drew 21 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency, aided by Clyburn’s endorsement. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
‘Cleanup hitter’ 
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows the state won’t keep it. He doesn’t care if the state is first, he said, just that it’s early.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event.
“I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third,” he said. “Please, let us be at least four.”
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South, potentially behind contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset.
Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.
Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. However, they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker of Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tonya Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 cannabis convictions, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.

From CalMatters politics reporter Yue Stella Yu: 
Boos. Heckles. Accusations. 
At the California Democratic Party convention in Anaheim over the weekend, some Latino Democrats waged a contentious referendum on their leaders — and won.
Nilza Serrano, a Los Angeles consultant, was elected chair of the party’s Latino caucus, upsetting longtime activist Carlos Alcala, who had chaired the caucus for more than a decade. Serrano was among a dozen Latinos who won caucus leadership positions during the convention under the banner of “La Nueva Voz” — “the new voice” in Spanish.
Instead of settling political differences, the fight was more a referendum on leadership style, as incumbents ran on a platform emphasizing their experience. But the newcomers’ victories exposed deep frustration among Latino Democrats with the exodus of Latinos from the Democratic Party last November, as well as a widespread perception that the party had failed to cement Latino support. The caucus is tasked with building the Latino base for Democratic candidates in California. 

Serrano, to CalMatters: “We did not get the messaging that we were supposed to get (out). There wasn’t a big effort on getting younger people involved in the party, and I think that’s key to our success.”

The election also followed an intense drama between the incumbent caucus officers and the challengers, so acute that the state party had to intervene. Challengers accused Alcala of cheating by allowing some delegates to vote remotely even though they didn’t have disabilities, in violation of party and caucus bylaws. Party officials ruled against Alcala. 
But Alcala decried the decision and argued remote voting was necessary to protect delegates terrified of flying due to their immigration status or those on a limited income, drawing boos.
The Latino caucus’ fight wasn’t the only sign of reckoning at the convention, as Democrats licked their wounds from November and tackled how to step up the party’s ground game ahead of challenging midterms.
Young Democrats also expressed frustration with the party’s failure to resonate with their age demographic. At the convention, they said that in order to mobilize young voters, party leaders and candidates should focus on California’s affordability issues, be willing to tackle progressive issues, and keep the messaging simple.

Carter Beardsley, an 18-year-old Bakersfield resident: “At the end of the day … people want to vote for someone who’s going to make their lives easier.”

Changes for prison searches and death row cases

Let’s dive into some criminal justice news:

Prison searches: Beginning today California prisons will subject anyone entering their facilities, including visitors, staff and attorneys, to a canine search. The new policy is to curb the “introduction of illegal drugs and contraband” into prison facilities, according to a corrections department memo. But criminal justice advocates and family members of incarcerated people argue that increased searches will negatively impact the ability to visit incarcerated people. Said the executive director of California Public Defenders Association: “The contraband is coming from the employees of the institution. But they are blaming everyone else.” Read more from CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.


Death penalty policy change: Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson has moved to walk back resentencing recommendations for people on death row, according to records obtained by CalMatters. The recommendations were originally filed by the previous district attorney, Pamela Price, who was recalled in November. Price recommended resentencing 30 people after being required to launch a review of death penalty cases for prosecutorial misconduct. Since then, 20 were resentenced. But in one of the first major signs that the office is departing from Price’s policies, Jones Dickson is withdrawing the recommendations for at least four of the remaining 10, arguing that her predecessor made flawed legal arguments.

Feds plan to revoke Chinese student visas

Amid growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, one of President Donald Trump’s latest actions is sowing fear among international students, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
The Trump administration on Wednesday said it is working to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” including those connected with the country’s communist party or “studying in critical fields.” The directive has the potential to affect as many as 50,000 students in California.
Because international students pay higher tuition than in-state students, and they help boost local economies, revoking these visas has the potential to reduce by 3% the budgets of the University of California and the California State University system. UC Davis, for example, is the UC with the highest number of Chinese international students, with more than 3,600 students, or over 9%, accounting for its student body.
Some international students also said they were concerned that the new policy would lead to more discrimination.

Huhu, a Chinese international student at UC Santa Barbara: “If we’re in a state where our visa could be canceled at any time, it’s an action that encourages people to discriminate against the international student community.”

The Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office said on Friday that it will not file DUI charges against state Sen. Sabrina Cervantes. The Riverside Democrat was involved in a car crash in Sacramento and police officers cited her for driving under the influence of a drug. Cervantes denied this, and a blood test revealed that she had “no measurable amount of drugs or alcohol in her system.” 
While some are urging the Sacramento Police Department to apologize to Cervantes, the department said officers “remained professional throughout.” Read more from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.

For many Asian Americans, it’s around 84 — on par with life expectancies in Japan and Switzerland.
Americans’ health has long been unequal, but a new study shows that the disparity between the life expectancies of different populations has nearly doubled since 2000.
“This is like comparing very different countries,” said Tom Bollyky, director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations and an author of the study.
Called “Ten Americas,” the analysis published late last year in The Lancet found that “one’s life expectancy varies dramatically depending on where one lives, the economic conditions in that location, and one’s racial and ethnic identity.” The worsening health of specific populations is a key reason the country’s overall life expectancy — at 75 years for men and 80 for women — is the shortest among wealthy nations.
To deliver on pledges from the new Trump administration to make America healthy again, policymakers will need to fix problems undermining life expectancy across all populations.
“As long as we have these really severe disparities, we’re going to have this very low life expectancy,” said Kathleen Harris, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina. “It should not be that way for a country as rich as the U.S.”
Since 2000, the average life expectancy of many American Indians and Alaska Natives has been steadily shrinking. The same has been true since 2014 for Black people in low-income counties in the southeastern U.S.
“Some groups in the United States are facing a health crisis,” Bollyky said, “and we need to respond to that because it’s worsening.”
Heart disease, car fatalities, diabetes, COVID-19, and other common causes of death are directly to blame. But research shows that the conditions of people’s lives, their behaviors, and their environments heavily influence why some populations are at higher risk than others.
Native Americans in the West — defined in the “Ten Americas” study as more than a dozen states excluding California, Washington, and Oregon — were among the poorest in the analysis, living in counties where a person’s annual income averages below about $20,000. Economists have shown that people with low incomes generally live shorter lives.
Studies have also linked the stress of poverty, trauma, and discrimination to detrimental coping behaviors like smoking and substance use disorders. And reservations often lack grocery stores and clean, piped water, which makes it hard to buy and cook healthy food.
About 1-in-5 Native Americans in the Southwest don’t have health insurance, according to a KFF report. Although the Indian Health Service provides coverage, the report says the program is weak due to chronic underfunding. This means people may delay or skip treatments for chronic illnesses. Postponed medical care contributed to the outsize toll of covid among Native Americans: About 1 of every 188 Navajo people died of the disease at the peak of the pandemic.
“The combination of limited access to health care and higher health risks has been devastating,” Bollyky said.
At the other end of the spectrum, the study’s category of Asian Americans maintained the longest life expectancies since 2000. As of 2021, it was 84 years.
Education may partly underlie the reasons certain groups live longer.
“People with more education are more likely to seek out and adhere to health advice,” said Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, and an author of the paper. Education also offers more opportunities for full-time jobs with health benefits.
“Money allows you to take steps to take care of yourself,” Mokdad said.
The group with the highest incomes in most years of the analysis was predominantly composed of white people, followed by the mainly Asian group. The latter, however, maintained the highest rates of college graduation, by far. About half finished college, compared with fewer than a third of other populations.
The study suggests that education partly accounts for differences among white people living in low-income counties, where the individual income averaged less than $32,363. Since 2000, white people in low-income counties in southeastern states — defined as those in Appalachia and the Lower Mississippi Valley — had far lower life expectancies than those in upper midwestern states including Montana, Nebraska, and Iowa. (The authors provide details on how the groups were defined and delineated in their report.)
Opioid use and HIV rates didn’t account for the disparity between these white, low-income groups, Bollyky said. But since 2010, more than 90% of white people in the northern group were high-school graduates, compared with around 80% in the southeastern U.S.
The education effect didn’t hold true for Latino groups compared with others. Latinos saw lower rates of high school graduation than white people but lived longer on average. This long-standing trend recently changed among Latinos in the Southwest because of covid. Hispanic or Latino and Black people were nearly twice as likely to die from the disease.
On average, Black people in the U.S. have long experienced worse health than other races and ethnicities in the United States, except for Native Americans. But this analysis reveals a steady improvement in Black people’s life expectancy from 2000 to about 2012. During this period, the gap between Black and white life expectancies shrank.
This is true for all three groups of Black people in the analysis: Those in low-income counties in southeastern states like Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama; those in highly segregated and metropolitan counties, such as Queens, New York, and Wayne, Michigan, where many neighborhoods are almost entirely Black or entirely white; and Black people everywhere else.
Better drugs to treat high blood pressure and HIV help account for the improvements for many Americans between 2000 to 2010. And Black people, in particular, saw steep rises in high school graduation and gains in college education in that period.
However, progress stagnated for Black populations by 2016. Disparities in wealth grew. By 2021, Asian and many white Americans had the highest incomes in the study, living in counties with per capita incomes around $50,000. All three groups of Black people in the analysis remained below $30,000.
A wealth gap between Black and white people has historical roots, stretching back to the days of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and policies that prevented Black people from owning property in neighborhoods that are better served by public schools and other services. For Native Americans, a historical wealth gap can be traced to a near annihilation of the population and mass displacement in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Inequality has continued to rise for several reasons, such as a widening pay gap between predominantly white corporate leaders and low-wage workers, who are disproportionately people of color. And reporting from KFF Health News shows that decisions not to expand Medicaid have jeopardized the health of hundreds of thousands of people living in poverty.
Researchers have studied the potential health benefits of reparation payments to address historical injustices that led to racial wealth gaps. One new study estimates that such payments could reduce premature death among Black Americans by 29%.
Less controversial are interventions tailored to communities. Obesity often begins in childhood, for example, so policymakers could invest in after-school programs that give children a place to socialize, be active, and eat healthy food, Harris said. Such programs would need to be free for children whose parents can’t afford them and provide transportation.
But without policy changes that boost low wages, decrease medical costs, put safe housing and strong public education within reach, and ensure access to reproductive health care including abortion, Harris said, the country’s overall life expectancy may grow worse.
“If the federal government is really interested in America’s health,” she said, “they could grade states on their health metrics and give them incentives to improve.”

“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Columbia Democrat and chief sponsor of a bill to double state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks.
SC House tries again with 12 weeks of paid parental leave for state workers

Co-sponsored by House GOP leaders, the bipartisan bill cleared the supermajority-Republican chamber by a vote of 86-18 on April 30, a week before the session ended. It awaits action next year in the Senate.
The House vote came three years after the South Carolina Legislature passed a law providing state employees six weeks of paid leave. That was followed in 2023 with a law making South Carolina the first state in the Southeast to extend that much parental paid leave to K-12 public school teachers.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years.
Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously.
The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the Southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one.
For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
Advocates say SC law protecting pregnant employees is working

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
But it only requires the time off. The leave can be unpaid.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Ultrasounds, pregnancy tests and parenting classes: SC funding for pregnancy centers questioned

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer.
While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, offers paid leave only to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.
Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.

South Carolina state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, vice-chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson, R-Campobello, told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the Legislature almost unanimously. That legislation, also sponsored by Bernstein, started out as a 12-week bill. The Senate cut the maximum time off in half, and the House agreed to the change to get the measure to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk.
During the floor debate in April, other Republicans backed the renewed effort for 12 weeks, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

,California,2025-06-02 12:33:00+00:00,CalMatters,Zombie bills: Why California lawmakers bring back legislation governors kill,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/newsom-bills-vetoed-california-legislature/,CalMatters found dozens of examples of previously vetoed legislation returning in subsequent years. A twice-killed bill about driverless trucks exemplifies why.,"In summary
CalMatters found dozens of examples of previously vetoed legislation returning in subsequent years. A twice-killed bill about driverless trucks exemplifies why.


The bill was dead. Twice dead, in fact: Two times in the past two years, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed legislation to ban California companies from deploying driverless trucks.
Yet lawmakers have resurrected the idea and inserted it into a new bill — with the Teamsters union hoping the third time will be the charm.
There’s no indication Newsom has changed his mind. Still, Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, representing the Davis area, said she brought the autonomous trucking bill back because it’s good policy aimed at “protecting our public safety and our jobs.” She said it has nothing to do with the Teamsters’ large donations to lawmakers.
Assembly Bill 33 is an example of a phenomenon in the California Legislature: Even when a bill dies one year, and even if a governor kills it, there’s a strong likelihood it will return, especially if big money interests like labor unions and business groups want it signed into law.
A CalMatters analysis using the Digital Democracy database that tracks the more than 2,000 bills introduced this year found at least 80 measures that are similar – some identical – to legislation that Newsom or other governors have vetoed in previous years. Around a quarter of the resurrected bills had support from prominent labor groups; an almost equal number were backed by business.
CalMatters relied on the Legislature’s bill analyses to determine whether a measure had been vetoed before. If a previous veto was not noted in the bill analysis it wouldn’t show up, meaning the figure is likely an undercount. The analysis didn’t tally the dozens of other resurrected bills pending in the Legislature this year that already died before reaching the governor’s desk. 
The previously vetoed bills tackle issues large and small including dangerous cigarette lighters, prevailing wage, jury duty for probation officers, colorectal cancer screenings, reproductive health care access, groundwater use at duck-hunting clubs, statewide guaranteed income, newspaper ads and environmental, labor and social justice measures.
The number of failed bills returning year after year helps fuel one of the Legislature’s most troubling issues. The massive number of bills introduced each year contributes to lawmakers rushing through the democratic process and fosters a culture of secrecy at the Capitol. As CalMatters reported, lawmakers routinely silence members of the public during hearings in order to jam through the huge volume of bills. Lawmakers also regularly make their decisions behind closed doors, in part because there is so little time to debate their hundreds of bills in public.
Experts say that doesn’t necessarily mean bills shouldn’t come back after failing. Some good ideas take time to gain political support. Alex Vassar, a legislative historian at the California State Library, noted that it took decades of failed legislation to pass laws that eventually built the state’s highway system and that gave women the right to vote.
“You can keep an issue on the front of the public’s mind, keep it alive in Sacramento, by using the vehicle of the bill to advance conversations happening outside the capital,” said Thad Kousser, a former California legislative staffer who’s now a political science professor at UC San Diego. “Sometimes, it’s part of a longer-term strategy to move policy forward.”
‘Not here to serve the lobbyists’
The Teamsters union is a major funder in the California statehouse, contributing at least $2.7 million to lawmakers’ campaigns since 2015. Aguiar-Curry received at least $15,950 in campaign cash from the Teamsters and its affiliate unions in that time, according to the Digital Democracy database.
But she said that didn’t influence her decision to try again on autonomous trucking.
“I’m not here to serve the lobbyists,” she said.
Aguiar-Curry said she hopes that tweaks she made to the latest legislation could appeal to Newsom, who has tended to be friendlier to Big Tech companies than legislators are to big labor. The latest proposal would prohibit driverless trucks from delivering commercial goods directly to a residence or to a business, instead of barring all driverless trucks over 10,001 pounds as in previous legislation. Newsom’s press office declined to do an on-the-record interview for this story.

“The governor’s veto messages speak for themselves,” his spokesperson, Izzy Gardon, said in an email. “And our office does not typically comment on pending legislation.”
Citing polling that shows Californians are leery of fully autonomous trucks, supporters say that if Newsom vetoes it again, they’ll just keep bringing it back until he signs it – or until the next governor does. 
“We’re right on this issue,” said Peter Finn, the Western region vice president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. “The only person that’s wrong on this issue is the governor, and just because one person is choosing Big Tech over people and drivers doesn’t mean we should stop pursuing this issue.”
This year’s bill easily passed the Assembly floor on Thursday with only a handful of Republicans voting “no.”
Doctors again fight private equity
Business groups, meanwhile, are pushing at least 20 other bills that Newsom or other governors have vetoed.
A prominent example is Senate Bill 351, co-sponsored by the California Medical Association, which lobbies on behalf of the state’s physicians. The organization wants to regulate private equity groups and hedge funds when they try to buy medical and dental practices.
Last year’s legislation sought to give the California attorney general power to block the sale of health care companies to for-profit investors.

In vetoing the measure, Newsom said it wasn’t necessary. This year’s bill doesn’t go as far, but it contains nearly identical language that would prohibit investors from “interfering with the professional judgment of physicians or dentists in making health care decisions,” according to the bill’s analysis. The measure also would allow the attorney general to sue if an investment firm violates the rules.
“Private equity firms are gaining influence in our health care system, leading to rising costs and undermining the quality of care,” Erin Mellon, a spokesperson for the medical association, said in an email.
CMA has given at least $3.5 million to legislators since 2015, according to Digital Democracy. The doctors lobby also has donated at least $9,500 to this year’s author, freshman Democratic Sen. Christopher Cabaldon, the former mayor of West Sacramento. 
Cabaldon said in an interview that he introduced the bill because it’s about “taking care of the patients.” 
“Doctors and other health care providers,” he said, “are leaving their practices, or in some cases, leaving the industry altogether, because their ability to practice as clinicians and deliver the best possible care has been under threat by overly aggressive private equity operators who are putting the profits first.”
Cabaldon’s proposal passed the Senate last week with Republican opposition.
Lawmakers bring back passion topics
While wealthy groups push for their favored bills to come back, other pieces of legislation return simply because a lawmaker is passionate about the subject matter.
That’s why Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher, who represents the Chico area, reintroduced a bill Newsom vetoed last year that would have given families legal authority to visit loved ones in health care facilities during pandemics. Gallagher said he hated not being able to visit his dying aunt during the Covid-19 outbreak. 
“It’s wrong, man, especially if it’s a loved one,” he said. 
Newsom vetoed the first measure, saying that California’s pandemic visitation policies struck the right balance, and he was concerned Gallagher’s bill would “result in confusion and create different access to patients.”
Gallagher’s newest version of the bill didn’t get a hearing this year. 
For Assemblymember Tom Lackey, a Republican representing the Palmdale area, it bothers him that victims of the 2020 Bobcat Fire in his district have to pay state taxes on settlement payments they received from the power company whose lines started the fire.
“It’s brutal,” he said. “I mean, ‘Here’s your money to try to restore yourself, but, oh, by the way, you can’t have it all. We want some of it back.’ … It’s a second kick in the mouth.”
It’s why he reintroduced a settlement tax relief bill this year after Newsom vetoed it last year along with a number of other similar bills. 
Lackey said he hopes his latest bill is unnecessary. Newsom noted in his veto message that the settlement tax provisions “should be included as part of the annual budget process.” Newsom’s proposed budget this year includes tax breaks for some disaster settlements. Lackey hopes that will include the Bobcat Fire.
Social justice bills come back
Other previously vetoed bills seek to address social justice issues that are important to lawmakers. They include proposals to create anti-discrimination awareness campaigns, putting non-English language accent marks on government forms and diversity audits for gubernatorial appointees. Newsom has vetoed “substantially similar” diversity audit bills six consecutive times.
Democratic Assemblymember James Ramos, representing the San Bernardino area, is the Legislature’s first Native American member. He believes that California’s first peoples have been silenced and marginalized for too long.
It’s why he’s authored two bills that have been previously vetoed. One would remove requirements from school administrators to approve the cultural regalia students wear at graduations. Former Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a similar bill, saying “principals and democratically elected school boards” should decide what’s appropriate to wear. Another previously vetoed Ramos bill seeks to expand tribal police forces. He’s also a co-author of a previously vetoed measure seeking to provide resources to locate missing Indigenous people. 
Ramos said he applauds Newsom for doing more than other governors have to apologize for the historic harms done to Native people, but more work needs to be done.
“When the state became a state, they did not include the voices of California’s first people,” he said. “So these bills do a lot more than other bills in the Legislature. These bills educate, and they move forward for reckoning and atonement.”
Should Newsom decide to veto Ramos’ bills again – or any of the others he or other governors have previously killed – it’s unlikely lawmakers will push back.
As CalMatters reported, nearly all of the 189 bills Newsom vetoed last year had support from more than two-thirds of lawmakers — a threshold large enough to override the governor’s veto.
But that almost never happens. The last time the Legislature overrode a governor’s veto was in 1979 on a bill that banned banks from selling insurance.

Young Californians were disillusioned with Democrats last November. The solution? A simple message, a focus on cost-of-living and progressive causes, and a reckoning with the party’s age problem, say young Democrats.


At age 24, Alan Vargas wants to lead the California Democratic Party. 
Sporting a beige cowboy hat and a pink shirt, the young progressive running for party chair evoked waves of cheers as he vowed to shake things up at the Democrats’ annual convention in Anaheim this weekend.
“I feel our party has moved away from its roots,” he told Democrats Saturday. “We cannot rely on fear to gain votes, nor can we assume the support of any minority, so we must act.”
It was a long shot: Incumbent Rusty Hicks, who did not even show up to make a campaign speech, secured another term swimmingly. Among 2,600 delegates, Vargas persuaded just over 600. 
But Vargas’ attempt sends a clear message: Young Democrats are growingly frustrated with the party’s struggle to resonate with their peers, especially after Democrats hemorrhaged support from young voters, who either shifted toward President Donald Trump or sat out the November election altogether. Turnout plunged among young Californians, particularly Democrats.
Party leaders took notice. Hicks, who deemed the low turnout “gut wrenching,” said Democrats must speak up for marginalized communities and reach out to young voters year round. 
The stakes are high: As California Democrats aim to retake the U.S. House in battleground districts next year, young voters could be key to their victory. Some candidates for governor are already courting their support: Veteran lawmaker Toni Atkins and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra headlined the California Young Democrats reception at the convention. Both of them called young people the “now” — not just the future — of the party.  
“You are my future, and I am counting on you,” Atkins told young Democrats Saturday night.
Others hope their affordability-focused policy proposals will resonate. 
All the gubernatorial candidates pledged to build more housing faster to lower costs. Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction running for governor, pointed to his push for students to attend college free and to pay back tuition later as well as his advocacy for paid internship programs and workforce training. Former state controller Betty Yee touted her experience managing California’s bank account and stressed her focus on making more reproductive options affordable. Becerra pointed to his effort negotiating with drug companies to lower medical costs. 
But party officials delayed considering a resolution urging a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians, to the disappointment of many young Democrats who feel disenfranchised and fear many elected officials are getting too old to be effective. 
“When you have 70-year-olds and 80-year-olds running for office, how is that supposed to inspire us when we are living in a completely different world than they ever did?” said Lauren Hassett, an 18-year-old college student from Orange County.
To make inroads with young voters, party leaders and candidates must focus on making California affordable and not shy away from progressive issues that resonate with young people, according to a dozen young Democrats who spoke to CalMatters at the convention. Some stressed that campaigns must also reach young voters at town halls and on campuses and learn to use social media and podcasts to engage them.
But most importantly, the message must be simple.
“At the end of the day, politics is personal, and people want to vote for someone who’s going to make their lives easier,” said Carter Beardsley, 18, from Bakersfield.
Simplifying affordability
There’s a consensus among young Democrats that the party got pummeled on cost-of-living issues in November. Latinos, particularly young Latino men, flocked toward Trump, in part because of economic pain at the grocery store and at the gas pump. 
Feeling like Democrats were absent on “working-class issues” was what inspired Vargas, a son of Mexican immigrants and a content creator from Corona, to run for party chair. While Democrats did try to address economic concerns, the messaging was too complex, Vargas argued.
“A lot of working people don’t have the time to do the research working two or three jobs,” he said. “I think we need a message in a way that is much easier and more digestible for our working communities, so they can listen to it on the radio rather than having to go on the phone and research five different articles.”

Hassett said many Democratic politicians have been criticizing Trump’s economic policies, such as tariffs, without offering digestible policy alternatives. Nor have they successfully explained how their own policies would benefit voters instead, she argued. 
Last November, there “was a lot of ‘Here’s what Trump’s going to do and we are going to do the opposite,’” Hassett said. “A normal voter is not going to know really what a tariff is, really how a tariff is going to impact their life.”
Affordability is still top of mind for many delegates, including young ones. Carter Beardsley, 18, from Bakersfield, said rising health care costs could deter young people from going to the doctor or having a child. And college students fear a hike in tuition, especially as Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from public university budgets.
“Students who might be living off Top Ramen can’t afford that increase,” Beardsley said.  
Despite polls showing that the electorate is shifting away from liberal social views, young Democrats this weekend said they want to see candidates take progressive stances on issues such as LGBTQ rights and the war in Gaza. Young Democrats in California are generally more liberal than their older peers.
Some grew frustrated at Newsom’s comments on his podcast, where he said allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls’ and women’s sports is “deeply unfair.” Trump is threatening to withhold funding from California for allowing trans athletes to participate.
“That’s not an area that I think there’s common ground to be found on,” Beardsley said. “We need to protect trans kids, period.”
And many want to see candidates who will fight to stop the United States from supplying weapons to Israel. At last year’s convention, pro-Palestinian activists flooded the venue as they called on Democrats to support a ceasefire in Gaza. This year’s protest was more muted, with just a dozen pro-Palestinian signs dotting the halls as speakers avoided mentioning the war. 
Let’s talk about age
Though the topic of age was in the air, Democratic leaders postponed discussing a resolution backed by San Francisco Democrats to explore capping the age for state and local officials. The resolution’s  author said it was born out of frustration that former President Joe Biden, 82, remained in the presidential race too long last year, and that some older Democrats — namely former U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein who died at 90 — held onto their seats instead of yielding to younger peers.
Hicks, the party chair, brushed aside concerns about age and defended the party’s decision to delay the discussion.
“At the end of the day, whether you are 25 or 75, the question is: Are you delivering for those that voted for you?” he told reporters.

Some young Democrats agreed, pointing to the success of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, 83, and former U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, 78, who was recently elected mayor of Oakland, in connecting with young progressives. 
George Balan, 17, the chair of the California High School Democrats, said what ultimately matters is how much young people feel like they can benefit from someone’s policies.
Many Democrats running for governor argued that age is just a number. Becerra, speaking to a roomful of young Democrats on Saturday night, repeatedly defended Biden’s performance. “Joe Biden will tell you he’s old. But can you deliver?” Becerra said.
Becerra’s speech did not sit well with Annie Koruga, a Bay Area delegate in their early 20s. Being able to deliver is the “whole point of being in elected office,” Koruga argued, and old age could cloud a politician’s ability to do just that.
Koruga noted that several older Democratic members of Congress have died in office since 2022.
“I’m trying to be respectful, but when we have people who are 85, 90 years old in these offices, many of them are not able to effectively perform their functions,” Koruga said.
And other young Democrats told CalMatters they feel turned off when the candidate field is crawling with seniors.

California prisons will make more use of canine searches on visitors and staff as they attempt to stem the flow of drugs and other contraband among the incarcerated population.


Anyone entering a California prison — including visitors, staff and attorneys — will be subject to a canine search under a new policy rolling out today across the state. 
CalMatters obtained a California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation memo from March 10, announcing the statewide implementation of the policy.
It said the canine searches are meant “to combat the introduction of illegal drugs and contraband into (prisons) and reduce the overall level of narcotics, contraband, and criminal activity within the incarcerated population, thereby enhancing the safety and security of all institutions,” the memo stated. 
Now, visitors and attorneys will not be permitted to visit an incarcerated person in a way that would allow for close contact if they refuse a search. In some cases, a refusal “may lead to exclusion from all (California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation) institutions,” according to the memo.  
All searches, including of staff, will be at the discretion of prison officials.
In recent years, the corrections department has faced mounting pressure over drugs making their way into facilities, but it has been criticized for its approach to managing the crisis.
Last year, a woman received a $5.6 million settlement after she was sexually violated during a strip search while she was trying to visit her husband at a prison  in Tehachapi. 
An oversight agency in 2023 found that drugs continued to get inside prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic when public health protocols prohibited visits. 
“We know where the contraband is coming from,” said Kate Chatfield, executive director of California Public Defenders Association. “People who work in the institutions know where it’s coming from. The contraband is coming from the employees of the institution. But they are blaming everyone. This will have a real adverse impact on the ability of people to visit incarcerated people.”
The Office of Inspector General in its report issued a set of recommendations, including one related to canines. The agency reviewed the department’s strategies to prevent drugs from entering prisons and found that it did not “take full advantage of its canine program.” 
“We understand that reducing the prevalence of drugs in California’s prison system is an ongoing challenge for the department,” the audit stated. “However, drugs have entered prisons even after the department implemented COVID-19 response efforts and suspended in-person visiting.”
Shaun Spillane, spokesperson for the Office of Inspector General, said in a statement to CalMatters that the new memo “is silent regarding the frequency of the searches, so it is unclear how often canines will be used to carry out these drug interdiction efforts.”
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation found contraband including manufactured weapons, drugs and escape tools in a recent sweep at 11 prisons, said spokesperson Emily Humpal in a statement to CalMatters.
The department “oversees, manages, and is responsible for the safe and secure housing of incarcerated individuals and therefore continues to evaluate ways to improve consistent statewide application of detection and intervention systems,” said Humpal.
The department’s new direction has raised widespread concern among advocates and family members of incarcerated people, who said that random search selection leaves room for bias and will disproportionately target visitors.
“This is scary,” said Christina Brown, executive director of the nonprofit Bridges of Hope. “Families already endure emotional and financial strain to maintain a connection to their loved one. Being subject to these searches, even if they’re innocent, deters future visits because they won’t want to go back.”

Like thousands of other families, in January we lost our Pacific Palisades home to wildfire. Within minutes, every house on our side of the street was reduced to ashes, while those across the street were left untouched.
Five months later, the harsh realities of recovery have set in. We are entangled in a bureaucratic maze: FEMA, the EPA, Army Corps of Engineers, IRS and a patchwork of state and local agencies.
Our home was covered by two insurance policies — one through California’s FAIR Plan and one through a private company — but the multiple federal, state and private agencies don’t coordinate. Even getting someone on the phone can take hours. It’s turned seeking information into a part-time job.
To their credit, most government employees have been courteous and helpful. But the private sector has been another story. For example, we’ve been approached by opportunists offering to file simple forms that require no negotiation — for a 10% cut. In our case, there’s nothing to negotiate: The home is gone and the settlement is fixed.
Our worst experience, however, has been with our mortgage company.
Soon after the fire, the insurer issued a settlement check, but it was made out to us and the mortgage lender. Following instructions, we endorsed the check and mailed it in for co-signing. Instead, the lender cashed it and kept the money.
Now they’re demanding a mountain of paperwork — permits, architectural plans, contractor invoices — before releasing any funds. They refuse to let us use our insurance settlement to pay for the very services required to begin rebuilding. 
Meanwhile, they earn interest on our money. The longer the delay, the more they profit.
We’re not alone. Many fire victims are trapped in the same situation. Assemblymember John Harabedian, with support from Gov. Gavin Newsom, introduced legislation requiring lenders to pay back any interest earned on withheld insurance proceeds to homeowners. The logic is simple: If they delay disbursement intended for rebuilding what was lost, they should not profit from a disaster.

Learn more about legislators mentioned in this story.


 John Harabedian
 Democrat, State Assembly, District 41 (Pasadena)



Are these tactics legal? Technically, yes. Like many homeowners, we signed a flurry of complex documents while refinancing — a clause naming the lender as a co-payee on insurance claims buried among them. It was not made clear to us that this allows them to hold the funds in escrow and release them at their discretion. 
But California law requires that lenders act in good faith by not unreasonably withholding funds. State civil code makes this clear.  A California appellate court ruling in Schoolcraft v. Ross reaffirms the lender’s responsibilities.  
Harabedian’s bill could make a real difference. In the Palisades, many homes were insured for more than $1 million. At 5% interest, that’s $50,000 a year — up to $200,000 over the four years it can take to design, permit and rebuild a home.
People often ask how they can help. Here’s one answer: Contact Harabedian, Newsom and other state lawmakers. California leaders need to be reminded that the exploitation of disaster survivors must stop. 
Losing your home to wildfire is devastating. Losing your insurance settlement afterward is unconscionable.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/011525-Palisades-Aerial-TS-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)The Hollywood movie studios seeking $1.4 billion in transferable tax breaks over 15 years have clearly not received a red carpet rollout from the Nevada State Legislature.
Assembly Bill 238, which proposes a twelvefold expansion of the state’s transferable film tax credit program, passed the Assembly late Friday in a 22-20 vote, the thinnest margin allowable since a tie would mean not passing. That left the high profile bill three days to pass the Senate. However, two whole days came and went, leaving the bill with less than 24 hours to make it across the finish line.
The Senate Finance Committee on Sunday appeared to be gearing up for a late night hearing on the film tax credit bill, but instead the full Senate withdrew the bill from the committee and allowed it to take a procedural step it needed in the full chamber.
The bill would massively expand Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film studio currently referred to as the Summerlin Production Studios Project (after the Las Vegas neighborhood where it would be located). Hollywood giants Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery are attached to the project. Howard Hughes Holdings is developing.
A small army of lobbyists for film studios could be seen entering the Senate Democrats office after the lawmakers adjourned for the night.
Nevada’s film tax credit program is currently capped at $10 million per year. AB 238 would raise that cap to $120 million per year, for 15 years, beginning in 2028. The majority of those tax credits, $95 million per year, would be reserved for productions at the Summerlin studio; $25 million per year would be for productions not attached to the studio.
Altogether, that’s equivalent to $1.8 billion in public subsidies for the television and film industry. If approved by the Senate and signed into law by Gov. Joe Lombardo, the legislation will be the largest public subsidy approved by the State of Nevada, surpassing the $1.25 billion approved by lawmakers in 2014 for Tesla Motors.
While tax credits aren’t issued to companies until they prove they’ve met the qualifications for them, the state must treat them as “negative revenue” when forecasting expected state revenue. That means they do impact the state budgeting process.
Here’s where other high-profile bills stand going into the last day of the session:
Budget bills
All five state budget bills have all passed the Nevada Legislature. Senate Bill 502, known as the capital improvement program (CIP) bill, crossed the legislative finish line on Sunday. The CIP bill must be passed by a two-thirds majority, so it is often used by the minority party as leverage in broader negotiations. That was the case in the 2023 session, when the CIP bill failed to pass the Senate before midnight on the last day. That forced a one-day special session.
The state’s other four budget bills (Senate Bill 500, Assembly Bill 591, Assembly Bill 592, and Senate Bill 501) all passed the Legislature within the last week and have been signed by the governor.
Education bill becomes group project
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Gov. Joe Lombardo reached a compromise on their competing omnibus education bills.
Cannizzaro’s Senate Bill 460 was amended to include components of Lombardo’s Assembly Bill 584, including his proposal to establish a statewide accountability system and a salary incentive program for educators and administrators. Components of Cannizzaro’s bill that made it past the amendment include revised evaluation procedures for educators and administrators and additional transparency and assessment requirements for schools receiving funding through the state’s quasi-voucher system, known as Opportunity Scholarships.
The Senate unanimously passed the bill Sunday, and the bill now heads to the Assembly.
Cannizzaro said the bill represents the state taking “significant strides” toward accountability and transparency. Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus also spoke on the floor in support.
Also on the education front: Senate Bill 161, a Clark County Education Association priority bill carried by state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas), passed the Legislature with some bipartisan support and was signed by Lombardo in the last week of the session. The bill establishes an expedited arbitration process for teachers unions and school districts, and, perhaps more consequentially, establishes a pathway for K-12 public school teachers to legally go on strike.
With the passage of SB 161, CCEA will withdraw a ballot measure it had qualified for the 2028 general election ballot. That ballot measure, if approved by voters, would have given teachers the right to strike. The teachers union had previously said it was prepared to defend the ballot measure next year but would prefer to bypass it through legislative action.
It marks the second time the union has pulled this move. In 2021, CCEA qualified two ballot measures — one to raise the gaming tax, another to raise the sales tax — only to pull them after the Legislature established a new mining tax that directly funds the state’s K-12 per pupil education fund.
Lombardo’s other bills

Assembly Bill 540, Lombardo’s housing bill, is currently in the Senate Government Affairs Committee. It has received a hearing but no action has been taken. The bill has already cleared the full Assembly.
Senate Bill 457, Lombardo’s criminal justice bill, passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sunday after receiving a major amendment. The bill needs to pass the full Senate and the full Assembly.
Senate Bill 495, Lombardo’s health care bill, is prepped for a vote by the full Senate. It will need to be approved by the Senate, then by the Assembly.
Senate Bill 461, Lombardo’s economic development bill, is currently in the Senate Revenue and Economic Development Committee. It received a hearing but no action has been taken.

Banking bill bombs
On Friday, a banking bill sponsored by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager fell short of the required two-thirds approval it needed to pass the chamber. Assembly Bill 500 would allow for payment banks, a new type of financial institution that focuses solely on payment processing rather than lending.
The Assembly vote was 25-17, a simple majority but three votes short of the two-thirds it needed because it would raise state revenue. On Sunday, AB500 returned to the Assembly floor with an amendment that removed the two-thirds requirement. The amendment was adopted but, in a bizarre turn of events, the vote failed 20-22. The vote was attempted a third time and also failed.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC06367-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

The First State’s finest dogs are getting a new task.
The Delaware Department of Correction (DOC) plans to redeploy all canine units across the state exclusively for contraband detection.
The transition marks a significant change from the department’s longstanding use of patrol-focused K-9s for facility security and crowd control.
The shift is part of a broader initiative to improve safety and reduce the presence of illegal drugs, electronics, and other contraband within Delaware’s prison system.
The change is already underway and will be implemented gradually over the next year.
“Our K-9 program transition to a universal contraband detection and mitigation mission aligns with national correctional K-9 best practices and better supports our broad goal of enhancing the safety, security, and wellness of all who live and work within Delaware’s correctional system,” said DOC Commissioner Terra Taylor.
Currently, 18 of the DOC’s 28 K-9 teams are assigned to patrol duties, while the remaining 10 focus on contraband detection.
Under the new policy, all future K-9s will be trained for detection work only.
Unlike patrol dogs, which are bred to be aggressive and are mainly used for deterrence and perimeter control, detection dogs are more social and can operate safely in high-traffic areas such as gatehouses, housing units, and even individual cells.
These dogs are trained to sniff out narcotics, electronic devices like cell phones, and other prohibited items.
DOC officials say the transition will mostly occur through natural attrition as patrol dogs retire.
In two recent cases, younger patrol dogs were exchanged for detection dogs.
All retired dogs are adopted into pre-screened homes, with families receiving financial support for ongoing care under legislation passed in 2023.
The department says this move is supported by a decade of investment in modern, intelligence-based security measures.
These include thousands of new surveillance cameras, improved information-sharing, verbal de-escalation training for staff, and the use of less-lethal tools for conflict resolution.
In addition to providing a safer and more flexible security presence, detection dogs also offer a psychological benefit: their presence alone serves as a powerful deterrent against smuggling efforts.
Officials hope that the expanded deployment of these dogs will help reduce overdoses and other risks associated with contraband inside facilities.
The move is expected to be fully completed by 2026.
“This transition is a clear-eyed response to the persistent threat of illegal and dangerous contraband to our correctional facilities,” Taylor said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-02-at-8.07.25-AM.png,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

At their headquarters, on a small scale, they show how it’s done.
With the Climate Innovation Center, inaugurated in Salt Lake City last summer, the nonprofit not only searched for a facility that reflected its decarbonization efforts, but one that would create “a teaching tool and living laboratory,” inviting Utahns to watch the workings of a real-life, ultra-efficient, zero-emissions building.

After receiving many industry professionals to showcase the two-story building, with its extensive solar panels and a room with a battery to make intermittent energy available day and night, the organization opened its doors for the first time to the public for an open house on Friday.
“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday. “So there’s zero emissions that come from running the building. It’s all electric and all solar powered.”

Not only does the center produce enough energy to power its operations and even electric vehicles in its parking lot with about 39 kilowatts of solar capacity, but it has the ability to help utilities optimize their operations with a 90 kilowatt hours capacity battery. 
That battery, sitting in a small room alongside a heat pump water heater, is part of Rocky Mountain Power’s Wattsmart batteries program, which pays users to incorporate their energy storage into the utility’s smart power grid.
“We think it’s important for our building to be kind of a flexible, interactive, kind of extension of the grid,” Emerson said. “And because ultimately, we want that to be a standard practice, where batteries are located across the electric grid to incorporate more effectively all the renewable energy that you will keep adding.”
Additionally, there’s no gas combustion in the premises. All water features use conservation systems and even the washer and dryer machine installed in the janitor’s closet uses a heat pump.
Outside, the small garden in the facade is highly drought tolerant, full of native and pollinator-friendly plants, as well.

Buildings play a big role in carbon emissions, Emerson told the group of climate and technology enthusiasts who showed up for the tour. According to the environmental nonprofit Architecture 2030, about 40% of carbon emissions come from built environments, either from its operations, or the pollution brought by construction activity itself, including mining, extraction, transportation and manufacturing materials. 
That’s why, Emerson said, during the construction process, the team meticulously chose materials with smaller carbon footprints — from the carpets to the countertops and tiles. 
Embarking in this project saved emissions by opting to preserve many of the features of the building that sat in the lot prior to the nonprofit’s arrival — and also, the staff repurposed wood pieces from the organization’s previous headquarters for this building.

A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said. Another team also supervised the space’s variable refrigerant flow heat pump, essentially a mechanical system that works like a large air conditioning unit that can provide cooling when it’s warm, and work in reverse to extract warmth out of the air, even on cold winter days.
The organization’s next step is to document all of these features by pursuing third-party certifications for the building, including a zero energy validation, focusing on the emissions it is not producing, and a zero carbon one to certify the materials used in retrofitting the space.
All of those lessons learned while designing and executing the building were included into climateinnovationcenter.org, a website, so others can incorporate non-polluting practices in new constructions or renovations. 
“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added. “And that’s our vision, is that zero emission buildings become a standard practice here in Utah that supports energy affordability.”
Hopefully, he said, more buildings become a big part of solutions for climate and better air quality days in Utah.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)A budget bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives could impose significant financial and social challenges in Alabama.
The measure could cut food assistance and Medicaid program funding that serve hundreds of thousands of people with low incomes in Alabama, and potentially cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars annually. It’s still unclear if it will pass the U.S. Senate.
The legislation, which passed the House largely along party lines, proposes funding reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid. Experts and state officials warn the cuts could lead to increased hunger, loss of health care coverage and other economic consequences across the state, particularly in vulnerable rural communities.
“There are three things in the bill, as it came out of the House, that are problematic for SNAP,” said Carol Gundlach, a policy analyst with Alabama Arise, an organization working on poverty issues. “The first — and the biggest and the most important one — is it shifts cost-sharing to the states.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Historically, states have paid 50% of administrative costs for SNAP, but the benefits themselves have been 100% federally funded. The new bill, Gundlach said, would increase Alabama’s share of administrative expenses to 75%, costing the state an estimated additional $35 million. 
More concerning, she said, is the proposal to shift part of the benefit cost to the states. Gundlach said Alabama could be “on the hook for about 15% of the actual benefit cost of SNAP,” amounting to at least $254 million annually.
“That would also presumably have to come out of the General Fund, and that’s every year, every single year,” Gundlach said.
The proposed SNAP changes also include an expansion of work requirements for parents with children over the age of 7. This could force parents to “jump through a bunch of hoops in order to keep your SNAP benefits, or they’re going to cut your family SNAP benefits,” she said.
The bill could prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from recalculating the base amount of SNAP benefits in the future, a measure Gundlach said would increase hunger as benefits fail to keep pace with food costs.
“Any way this works, people are going to lose SNAP benefits,” she said, warning that in a worst-case scenario, Alabama could walk away from the SNAP program completely, leaving nearly 1 million people dependent on SNAP, or about 20% of Alabama’s population, without food assistance.
Medicaid
Debbie Smith, campaign director for Arise’s Cover Alabama, said Alabama’s “bare bones” Medicaid program also faces pressures. According to Smith, the bill could cost Alabama “$324 million, I think, over 10 years” for Medicaid, translating to roughly $30 million annually. This could increase Alabama’s Medicaid spending per resident by about 15%.
“Any cut to Medicaid is concerning when you have the bare bones program that we have. We really can’t afford to cut anywhere,” Smith said. “$30 million for a year … that’s still a big impact on our state budget.”
The bill would also eliminate the federal incentive designed to encourage states like Alabama to expand Medicaid, a significant concern for Smith.
“(The bill) sunsets that incentive, Jan. 1, 2026, so there’s no time for anybody to take advantage of it before it sunsets,” Smith said.
Even without state expansion, the bill is expected to cause coverage losses. Smith said Arise projects 53,000 people could lose their Medicaid coverage. Combined with the potential expiration of enhanced subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace, 170,000 Alabamians could lose health insurance, leading to a $592.89 million increase in uncompensated care costs for the state, according to a Center for American Progress analysis.
The House bill also proposes reducing retroactive Medicaid coverage from three months to one month.
State budget
The combined potential costs from SNAP and Medicaid changes could put Alabama’s General Fund in a challenging position, but Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund committee, said it’s still early in the process and that it’s hard to plan for a bill that could still change.
“We know things are going to get tough, OK, but we don’t know how tough they’re going to be,” Albritton said.
Albritton said lawmakers had trouble finding an increase of about $220 million for Medicaid this past legislative session and he expects another significant increase next year. “Between the changes of SNAP and other changes, that’s going to put more pressure on us,” he said.
Albritton, who has often voiced concerns about federal program funding being pulled, suggested Alabama is somewhat prepared because it hasn’t expanded Medicaid.
“That’s something — at least one of the few things we don’t have to worry about right now,” he said.
Arise described the bill’s measures as “cruel.” Gundlach described the situation as “making parents choose between adequate care for their children and being able to put food on the table. If there is any definition of cruel, I don’t know what else it could possibly be.”
Albritton pushed back against such characterizations, calling the term “alarmist” and blaming partisan politics. He chose a more cautious approach.
“All I can do at this point is sit and watch and wait,” he said. “There’s a lot that we do not know, and we’re running around trying to fix something that we don’t know what the problem is.”

(Anya Kamenetz for The Hechinger Report)HAYTI — “Are we actually in space?” 
The kindergartners of South Dakota’s Hamlin County are, in fact, in space. To be specific, they are on planet Earth, near the geographic center of North America, sitting crisscross applesauce inside an 11-foot-high inflatable planetarium set up in their school gym.
The darkness is velvety. Childish whispers skitter around the dome like mice. The kids are returning from a short mission to Jupiter, piloted by Kristine Heinen, a young museum educator with a ponytail who knows how to make her voice BIG AND EXCITED and then inviting and quiet to hold little ones’ attention.  

  During the planetarium’s daylong visit to the small community of Hayti, an educator from the South Dakota Discovery Center wowed 500 elementary school students with a presentation about the planets and stars. (Anya Kamenetz for The Hechinger Report)

“Now we’re over China!” Heinen says. 
“My friend went to China!” a girl calls out.
“The other side is nighttime and this side’s bright,” expounds a boy with a crew cut. “The sun shines here so it can’t shine over there.“ 
The school is in eastern South Dakota, 34 miles northeast of the settlement where Laura Ingalls Wilder grew up and attended a one-room schoolhouse. The sprawling Hamlin Education Center is a modern-day analogue, serving an entire district in one building, with just under 900 students, pre-K through 12. Notable graduates include U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the former governor of South Dakota.
The center is roughly equidistant from four tiny towns, surrounded by open fields where cornstalks shine in the sun; 95% of students arrive by bus, from up to 20 miles away. Over a third of them qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, said Dustin Blaha, the elementary school’s principal. 
Blaha said that most of these children have never been to the South Dakota Discovery Center, a hands-on science museum three hours west in the state capital. But thanks to a federal agency called the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a part of the museum can come to them.
The IMLS was established in 1996, combining previously separate programs. The small agency became the largest source of federal funding for museums and libraries, last year awarding $266.7 million in program grants, research and policy development across all 50 states. IMLS awarded the South Dakota Discovery Center about $45,000 in 2023 to upgrade this traveling planetarium. 
But students around the state may be waiting a long time for the next upgrade.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in mid-March calling for the agency to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.” Mass firings followed.
On May 1, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order to block the agency’s dismantling, followed on May 6 by a second federal judge finding the dismantling of this and two other agencies unconstitutional. On May 20, the American Library Association reported that employees are returning to work and some grants have been restored. 

But the administration is continuing its legal battle to all but shutter the IMLS. The latest post on the agency’s Instagram account is captioned, “The era of using your taxpayer dollars to fund DEI grants is OVER,” holding up for criticism grants that were aimed at addressing systemic racism in museums, equitable library practices, and diverse staff development. The IMLS and the Department of Government Efficiency did not respond to requests for comment. 
A veteran of the agency who asked to remain anonymous because of fear of reprisal said they first saw DOGE staffers meeting with leadership on March 28. “On the 31st, we were put on administrative leave. We had about two hours to turn in your key cards, your ID, get everything off your laptop you’re ever going to need. We were locked out of our computer systems by 3:30 and told to get out of the building.” A skeleton crew was hastily rehired the next day. 
The ex-staffer points out that the Institute of Museum and Library Services spends, or spent, just 7% of its budget on its 70 staff, passing the rest along as grants. “We are not a bloated agency.” They have two kids at home, one with special needs and are married to another federal employee whose job is also at risk; but they are almost as worried about their grantees as themselves.
“After 20 years, I didn’t even get to put an out-of-office response up. Is someone emailing me right now and getting nothing, because all of a sudden their grant just ended? I hate that,” the former IMLS employee said.  
Almost all grants awarded required a one-to-one cost share out of the local institution’s budget, the staffer said. Plus, typically the grantees pay for activities first and then apply to get reimbursed. “We’re leaving these often small rural museums and libraries on the hook.”

Anne Lewis, executive director of the South Dakota Discovery Center, said that organizations like hers would be “wobbly” without federal funding and would have to scale back on ambitious programs like the planetarium upgrade.
“The new system has much better interaction and control,” said Heinen, the museum educator. An earlier version had a static point of view, but upgraded visual effects mean that “now we have spaceship mode,” she said. “We can travel to destinations including planets, and go in a full 360-degree mode around galaxies.”

With a flick of the touchscreen menu, she can also display the constellations of a dozen different cultures including Lakota, a significant benefit especially when she visits tribal schools. 
It’s a lean operation: Heinen drove solo nearly 200 miles from Pierre to Watertown the evening before and spent the night at an Econo Lodge. From there, it was another 20-some miles to Hayti, where she arrived at 7:30 in the morning, set up the dome herself, and ran 30-minute programs all day. 
The whole elementary school, about 500 kids in total, saw the planetarium, with each show customized to the children’s interest and grade level; and she also conducted a parent engagement program in the afternoon. Heinen said she never tires of being a “Santa Claus” for science. ”As soon as they see me, they know something fun is going to happen.” 
During this visit, the fan favorites were Jupiter, Mars and the sun. “It was cool when we went to Mars,” said Nash Christensen, 6. “And the volcano on that one moon, and the big hurricane on Jupiter. I think Jupiter is a dangerous place to live.” 
Grant recipients of the Institute of Museum and Library Services say the support from the federal government has been critical to running their programs. For example, the Boston Children’s Museum, the second-oldest children’s museum in the country, has used federal grant money to improve school readiness. One of the outcomes was a new exhibit in the museum, “Countdown to Kindergarten,” that mimics a kindergarten classroom, complete with a school bus you can sit in out front.
“It’s helpful not only for the kids, but some of our caregivers who came from other countries and may not have gone to a school like this,” said Melissa Higgins, the museum’s vice president of programs and exhibits.

At the Madison Children’s Museum in Wisconsin, federal funds paid for a multistate partnership that provides climate education for young children and their families. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a grant covered five “STEMobiles,” which offer hands-on science activities for children ages 3-5 in low-income parts of Broward County. The Philadelphia School District won a two-year planning grant to try to improve its pipeline of school librarians; they were down to only a handful for a district of 200,000 students. 
But the greatest impact may come in rural, often deep-red areas.
Trump’s firings reach into a Rapid City museum and derail an expert’s career

“Rural communities have particularly unique challenges,” said Lewis at the South Dakota Discovery Center. “There’s 800,000 people in the state, and they’re dispersed. We don’t have a concentration of funders and donors who can help support these enrichment activities.” 
She said the teachers she serves are “passionate, committed and, like every other place in the world, underfunded.” If not for institutions like hers, students would probably go without this kind of hands-on science experience, she said. 
Blaha, the elementary school principal, concurred. “The planetarium brings excitement and expertise that we don’t typically have in a community like this,” he said.
For now, the excitement is coming to an end. The class has “landed” on a green lawn, under a deep blue sky. Heinen announces “It’s time to leave.” She’s met with a chorus of, “Noo!” 
“You guys, we were in here for a full 30 minutes.”

“It felt like 10!”

“It felt like a second!” 
Tonight, many of them will be able to look up at the dark sky over the prairie and show their parents Jupiter, Ursa Major and Mars.

So far, the first-term Republican governor has vetoed just one bill and signed 169.
For comparison, Lombardo vetoed 75 bills in 2023, setting a single-session veto record. He signed 535 bills.
Nevada governors usually have five days, excluding Sundays, to veto a bill after it gets to their desk. Legislative rules extend that timeframe to 10 days in the waning days of the session. That means vetoes could be announced into next week.
So what might Lombardo veto this year? Below are the bills the Nevada Current has covered that are now on veto watch. We’ve organized them by how bipartisan their journey through the Legislature was. That said, Lombardo last session did veto bills that passed unanimously, and he signed bills that the Republican caucuses voted against.
Passed on party lines

Assembly Bill 44 (Attorney General Aaron Ford, D) seeks to crack down on “knowingly deceptive” price fixing. All Republicans opposed the bill, as did a few Democrats.
Assembly Bill 201 (Assemblymember Erica Roth, D) would expand efforts to automatically seal eviction records.

Assembly Bill 223 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) would give tenants more power to hold landlords accountable for failing to provide livable conditions.
Assembly Bill 280 (Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, D) proposes rent stabilization for seniors.
Assembly Bill 283 (Assemblymember Max Carter, D) would restructure the eviction process.
Assembly Bill 411 (Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, D) would allow prescriptions for drugs used for medical abortions and miscarriage management to list the name of the prescribing health care practice, rather than the name of the specific individual providing the prescription.
Assembly Bill 441 (Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, D) would change how Opportunity Scholarships are administered.
Senate Bill 350 (State Sen. James Ohrenschall, D) would extend the time period the state has for carrying out an execution of someone on death row.

Bills with bipartisan support

Assembly Bill 398 (Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, D) would provide additional pay for public school district teachers in hard-to-fill positions and establish a fund for broader charter school raises. Yeager amended the charter school provision into the bill after Lombardo threatened to veto the K-12 education budget over the issue. AB 398 passed the Legislature with broad bipartisan support, with only Democratic Assemblymember Natha Anderson opposing. After its final vote, Lombardo signed the K-12 budget bill, a strong sign he will likely sign AB398.
Assembly Bill 555 (Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, D) would prohibit private insurance companies from charging people more than $35 for a 30-day supply of insulin. The bill received broad bipartisan support, with only Senate Republicans John Ellison and Robin Titus opposing.
Assembly Bill 452 would ensure customers receive full refunds with interest for overcharges and extend regulatory timelines for rate case reviews. The bill received bipartisan support, with eight of 15 Assembly Republicans supporting the bill. All eight Senate Republicans voted for the bill after an amendment.
Assembly Bill 96 would mandate that cities and counties with populations exceeding 100,000 people include “heat mitigation” as part of their master plans. The bill passed with some bipartisan support. Three of 23 Republicans supported the bill.
Assembly Bill 457 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) originally sought to close a potential loophole that can be used by corporate landlords to avoid paying the state’s commerce tax. It has now been amended into a study on the issue. Only one Republican, Assemblymember John Steinbeck, supported the bill.

It would also require landlords to offer a way for tenants to pay rent without added processing fees. Three Republicans voted for the bill.
Assembly Bill 211 (Assemblymember Venicia Considine, D) would allow a third party to take over the property until repairs are made and living conditions improved. The bill passed with broad bipartisan support, with only Republican state Sen. Robin Titus opposing.
Senate Bill 88 would discharge medical debt from those incarcerated once they leave prison. The bill received broad bipartisan support.

 Bills unanimously supported


Senate Bill 54 would require the state’s Department of Health and Human Services to apply for a federal waiver and amend the state Medicaid plan to cover medical respite care for people experiencing homelessness.
Assembly Bill 321 (Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, D) seeks to establish a pathway for formerly incarcerated people to work as firefighters with the Nevada Division of Forestry.
Assembly Bill 104 would establish the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program, which would allow willing landowners to sell their water rights back to the state through the year 2035.
Assembly Bill 277 (Assemblymember Rich DeLong, R) would make the Net Proceeds of Minerals Bulletin public again.
Assembly Bill 176 (Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, D), known as the Right to Contraception Act, would strengthen protections against a state or local government burdening access to contraceptive measures.

Harriet Tubman, along with Black soldiers, took part in a daring Union raid of Combahee Ferry near Beaufort, South Carolina. 
She became the first American woman to lead a major military operation when she and at least 150 Black soldiers helped to rescue more than 700 Black Americans who had been enslaved on nearby plantations. Many of the men became soldiers for the Union Army. 
The Wisconsin State Journal described her as “She-Moses,” whose raid struck “terror to the heart of the rebeldom … without losing a man or receiving a scratch.” She worked on similar missions with the famed Massachusetts 54th Infantry, portrayed in the award-winning movie, “Glory.” 
In all, she made 19 trips back to the South to ensure that hundreds of others that were enslaved made their way to freedom and was quoted as telling them, “If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If there’s shouting after you, keep going. Don’t ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.” 
She was never caught, despite a $40,000 reward ($1.5 million in today’s dollars) for her capture. The movie, “Harriet,” depicts the Combahee Ferry raid. Statues of Tubman can now be seen across the nation, honoring this heroic woman.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06104619/Harrriet-Tubman-June2.jpg,,,2025-06-02 09:07:41.389687

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh is a political pioneer of sorts.
In her campaigns for the Alabama Power Rubber Stamp Squad — excuse me, the Public Service Commission — Cavanaugh had one message: Being a conservative Republican is the only qualification for office.
She trumpeted her opposition to abortion rights, even snagging Mike Huckabee to back her up on that. Later on, she campaigned for re-election in part on her opposition to “socialism and liberal ‘woke’ ideas.”
What did any of this have to do with the Public Service Commission? Zero. The PSC, at least on paper, regulates utilities. It does not restrict abortion. Or college courses. Cavanaugh could have just as easily campaigned on disappointment in Auburn’s 2012 football season. The PSC has as much power over Gene Chizik as women’s health.
Once she became a regulator — first as a member and then as president — Cavanaugh proved a doormat for the utilities. She supported the rate stabilization and equalization process. That guarantees Alabama Power a profit and shields it from questions about its decisions. Rates went up with hardly a peep from the commission.
Terry Dunn, a fellow Republican on the PSC, wanted Alabama Power to explain how it charged customers. Cavanaugh signed onto a cosmetic change to the process that did little to shake the status quo.
Or lower your power bill. Alabamians pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the South. Both in our homes and our businesses.
There could be non-mercenary reasons for that. But we can’t say for certain. Cavanaugh and her colleagues, ostensibly tasked with protecting the public from high prices, showed no interest in learning why our rates are high, much less confronting power suppliers about them.
The PSC in 2015 trumpeted an Alabama Power rate adjustment that would have saved customers – by the utility’s own calculations – one penny a day over a year. Cavanaugh used that opportunity not to call for further reductions, but to bash the federal government.
That was always the real target of her ire. In turning aside a challenge from Dunn in the GOP primary for PSC president in 2016, she lambasted Obama-era regulations aimed at reducing coal emissions and improving public health.
She also prevailed in a general election contest against Democrat Laura Casey in 2020, whose platform included calls to make the rate process more transparent.
In each election, Cavanaugh showed far more interest in attacking national Democratic figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez than in making electricity in Alabama affordable.
The PSC’s low profile helped her. So did straight-ticket voting. It allows a parakeet with an R next to its name to win an Alabama state office.
But Cavanaugh showed that embracing an extreme form of political peacocking meant one didn’t even have to bother with the pretense of using public office to advance the public good.
She loved Trump, jobs and burning coal. She hated abortion, the “woke agenda” and Democrats. When conservative media turned to new targets, so did she. Her political agenda always seemed to be whatever Fox News happened to be discussing in the moment.
And as it turned out, hating the right things could land you a job that had nothing to do with those things. An electricity regulator could ignore the power bills in mailboxes in Linden, Alabaster or Dothan so long as she shook her finger at a young woman seeking reproductive health care.
These politics of conservative hallucination used to stand out. Now it’s common practice.
Sen. Tommy Tuberville, our putative governor-in-waiting, plans to campaign against Joe Biden, who is not on the 2026 ballot. He says he will stand with veterans, which should be news to officers who were up for promotion back in 2023. (Or to 80,000 VA workers who could lose their jobs in August.) He claims that tariffs Trump has imposed will help Alabama farmers, even as China’s retaliatory tariffs threaten a major market for them.
And of course, he attacks DEI and “woke” ideas of inclusiveness and human decency, attacks that are sure to be repeated ad nauseam in the coming year in ads showing Tuberville holding guns, walking into a church, or walking into a church with a gun. GOP primary voters ask for nothing more.
After all, they don’t care that Trump has 34 felony convictions. Or that he bungled the COVID response. Or that his tariffs are threatening the economy. He wears his hatred of their perceived enemies like a maroon stovepipe hat. As long as that’s visible, they will tolerate all his incompetence and corruption.
Cavanaugh is now going to work for Trump, serving as Alabama’s “director of rural development” in the state. Considering the administration’s antipathy toward public investment and infrastructure, I would expect her to do little in the way of developing rural areas.
But she can still talk about how much she dislikes abortion. Because in Alabama politics, performative hatred matters more than accomplishment.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)After Donald Trump tapped him as his running mate, J.D. Vance crisscrossed the country and gave speech after speech in which he, like Trump, demonized immigrants and promised to mount a mass deportation effort if elected.
The Boeing 737 that he used to travel around the nation is now being used to deport immigrants. Records show that it has made at least 16 flights to Central and South American countries to deport immigrants this year.
An Arizona Mirror analysis of publicly available data and records obtained by the University of Washington through Freedom of Information Act requests confirms that the 22-year-old jet is part of the fleet of planes known as “ICE Air” that swiftly shuttles immigrants out of the United States. ICE Air consists of multiple charter airlines and other private aviation companies around the country who are contracted to move immigrant detainees inside and out of the country.
Even before the plane was emblazoned with the Trump campaign logo in July 2024, it had been used at least four times to transport immigrant detainees during an earlier stint on the ICE Air fleet.
Data analyzed by the Mirror and confirmed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights researcher Phil Neff show that the aircraft flew four ICE Air missions in April and May of 2018.
Those four missions consisted of three removal flights to El Salvador and Guatemala, in which deportees were shipped off to those countries. The fourth was a transfer flight, in which detainees were moved from one ICE facility to another.
During those four missions in 2018, the aircraft carried between 456 to 504 passengers, according to ICE passenger data.
And records from 2020 detail 35 flights from known ICE hubs to Central and South American countries.
For example, on March 6, 2020, the aircraft took off from the Alexandria Airport in Louisiana, where ICE has a staging facility operated by private contractor GEO Group. It then landed at the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, before returning to Alexandria.
Earlier this year, that same airport was where military planes deported migrants.
Data on flights after 2018 is more difficult to confirm. ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security began redacting identifying information of the aircraft used in the deportation process, making it more difficult to see the movements of individual planes, though it is still possible in some cases.
In its response to questions from the Arizona Mirror, which DHS provided after this story was published, an unnamed “senior DHS official” said that the department would not confirm whether the plane had been used for deportation flights.
“ICE uses sub-contractors to help carry out its mission to deport illegal aliens,” the unnamed official said in an email. “These sub-contractors are not exclusive to ICE. For operational security, we will not confirm tail numbers of planes used for removing illegal aliens who are often violent criminals and foreign terrorists.”
Claims that most of the Trump administration’s deportees are violent criminals have been repeatedly proven false.
Civil rights groups have been fighting for records about the program, while the agency regularly slow-walks records releases.
“Our experience in general with FOIAs — not just with the Department of Homeland Security, but especially with the Department of Homeland Security — is you should expect to have to sue to get information and for us that process involves getting approval from the highest level of the university,” Neff told the Mirror. “So, we have had to be very selective in the case in which we have had to do that.”
Just five months after Trump and Vance won the election, the aircraft flew between multiple airports known for ICE Air activity before heading to an airport in Honduras known for deportation flights, then coming to rest at Mesa Gateway Airport.
It is not clear if Trump or Vance were aware of the aircraft’s history prior to it becoming part of their campaign. A spokesperson for the White House directed the Mirror to the Department of Homeland Security and Vance’s office. Vance and DHS did not respond.
From ferrying travelers to deportees
The aircraft, N917XA, has a long and interesting history.
It started its life in the fleet of the now defunct Air Berlin before transferring to Orenair, another ill-fated airline based in Russia, until it was acquired by Swift Air.
Swift Air was a subcontractor for ICE and has previously conducted flights out of Mesa Gateway Airport, one of ICE’s major airport hubs. Flight history shows the plane has made multiple flights to and from Mesa Gateway to other ICE airport hubs, as well as to Central and South American countries.
A previous inspector general report listed the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway airport as the operational headquarters for ICE Air.
Swift Air rebranded as iAero Airways in 2019, but went bankrupt in 2024. Eastern Air Express acquired much of iAero’s assets, including N917XA, in April 2024. Three months later, it was unveiled as Vance’s campaign jet. Eastern Air Express has also taken over the ICE Air contracts that iAero held.
The company also has connections to the Trump world.
From 1989 to 1992, Trump owned an airline company called “Trump Shuttle,” which he purchased after meeting the Eastern Air Express CEO at a party. But the endeavor, like so many of Trump’s businesses, was financially doomed and failed.
ICE Air activities heat up in Arizona
ICE Air operations in Arizona are beginning to ramp up as well, with Avelo Airlines starting to make deportation flights out of Mesa Gateway this month, amid financial woes and market competition.
Contracts to conduct deportation flights are lucrative for the companies involved. The Project on Government Oversight has reported that CSI Aviation, whose corporate director was a “fake elector” in New Mexico for Trump, was awarded a no-bid contract to the tune of $128 million.
Neff said he wasn’t surprised to learn that the aircraft which had been used for deportations had been utilized by the Trump campaign, although he did say there was an “irony to it.”
During their research, Neff said they found that some of the contractors would often boast about how they could turn aircraft around from passenger style to luxury style on short notice, even finding aircraft that had previously been used for deportations later being used to shuttle professional sports teams or musicians around the country.
Immigrant advocates have been critical of the flights and say they raise a number of human rights and civil rights issues. Neff said those concerns are only being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s push to speed up deportations.
“I think it is really impossible to overstate or understand the true scope of human impacts of a deportation program on this scale,” Neff said.
During their initial research, which covered flights between 2010 and 2020, Neff said they found a “significant portion” of the passengers being deported still had ongoing cases that had not worked their way through the courts. The Trump administration has recently been defending its use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans, to do rapid deportations.
Once on the planes, immigrants are shackled at their feet and hands for the duration of the flight. In testimony in a class action lawsuit against the United States, where passengers were shackled for 23 hours sitting on the tarmac, some soiled themselves as they were denied access to the bathroom.
Abuse on ICE Air flights have been reported going back to 2016, when some passengers were left bloodied after being beaten and placed in body-bag style restraints. In some cases, deaths and miscarriages have been reported on ICE Air flights.
And transparency about the flights is getting worse, Neff noted.
While the first round of data obtained by researchers contained information such as flight destinations, flight costs and the tail numbers of aircraft, the government redacted that information from future releases.
While public flight history data is available to researchers, those researchers are working overtime to help track these flights.
“It is 8 or 10 hours, 7 days a week. It is a significant amount of time,” immigration activist Tom Cartwright, who has been voluntarily tracking ICE flights since Trump’s first term, told the Mirror.
During that time, Cartwright has noticed that tracking the aircraft has gotten considerably more difficult, as federal agencies have sought to stymie watchdogs from monitoring the program by removing their aircraft from flight-tracking services.
But Cartwright and others have still found other ways to keep a watchful eye on the program.
“The transparency has gotten worse over time and worse under the (second) Trump administration,” Cartwright said, adding that taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent. “To send some of these flights with relatively few people on them at a million dollars a flight seems pretty ridiculous, to be honest.”
The coming weeks and months are likely to keep Cartwright busy, as deportation flights have been ramping up. In the last couple of weeks, Cartwright said he has noticed flights have “accelerated quite a bit,” and he said is anticipating May to be a record-breaking month for total flights.
Cartwright said his work is important because it sends a message to those on the flights — and those their deportation left behind in America.
“The people on the planes deserve the dignity of someone giving a damn,” he said. “All these people on these planes, they have mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles. They deserve the dignity of someone understanding that they are being sent away to somewhere that, in some cases, they haven’t seen in years or somewhere that is dangerous or where they won’t be able to support their family.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Multiple people were injured Sunday in downtown Boulder when a man reportedly lit them on fire, according to local police.
Six victims ranging in age from 67 to 88 years old were transported to hospitals in the region, police said. One was described as being in critical condition, with other victims’ injuries ranging from serious to minor.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Saliman, was taken into custody by police and was being treated for minor injuries at a hospital, Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Denver field office, said during a Sunday evening press conference.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Michalek said.
The attack took place near the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall, an area in the heart of the city that typically attracts hundreds of people on the weekend. The first calls about the attack came at 1:26 p.m., Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier Sunday.
“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”
Participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, were in the area at the time of the attack.
Michalek said the suspect was “heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.” He called it a “targeted act of violence” and said the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.
Kash Patel, director of the FBI, earlier on Sunday called the incident a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said it was a “heinous act of terror.”
The Anti-Defamation League said on social media it was “monitoring the situation in Colorado.”
Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the U.S. House, characterized the attack as targeting Jewish people.
“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, indicated the group was targeted.
“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser said in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado.”

Santiago/Getty Images)Alejandro thought that driving full-time for Uber offered freedom — flexible hours, quick cash, and time to care for his young son. But that promise faded fast.
“There are hours when I make $20,” he told me. “And there are hours when I make $2.” As his pay dropped, he pawned his computer and camera, began rationing his insulin, and started driving seven days a week just to break even.
Alejandro, whose real name is withheld for his privacy, is one of millions of workers powering a billion-dollar labor model built on legal loopholes.
Companies like Uber insist they are “tech platforms,” not employers, and that their workers are “independent contractors,” not employees. This sleight of hand allows them to sidestep minimum wage laws, paid sick leave, and other workplace protections while shifting risks onto workers. It also lets them avoid employer taxes, draining funds from public coffers.
A new Human Rights Watch report looks at seven major platform companies — Amazon Flex, DoorDash, Favor, Instacart, Lyft, Shipt, and Uber — and finds that their labor model violates international human rights standards.
These companies promise flexibility and opportunity, but the reality for many workers is far more precarious. In a survey of 127 platform workers in Texas, we found that after subtracting expenses and benefits, the median hourly pay was just $5.12, including tips — well below the already paltry federal minimum wage.
Seventy-five percent of workers we surveyed said they struggled to pay for housing. Thirty-five percent said they couldn’t cover a $400 emergency expense. Over a third had been in a work-related car accident. Many said they sold possessions, relied on food stamps, or borrowed from family and friends to get by.
Their labor keeps the system running — but the system isn’t built to work for them.
By classifying workers as contractors, platform companies avoid paying core employment obligations while retaining tight control over how the work is done. The platforms often use algorithms and automated systems to assign jobs, set pay rates, monitor performance, and deactivate workers without warning.
One Uber driver in Houston said, “They are like puppet masters. They psychologically manipulate you.”
One Shipt worker in Michigan said her pay plummeted immediately after she received two four-star reviews, down from her usual five. Ratings are hard to challenge, and recovering from a low score can take weeks. Workers feel forced to accept every job and appease every customer, reinforcing a system that rewards compliance over fairness.
These aren’t the conditions of self-employment. They’re the conditions of control.
This labor model also drains public resources. In Texas alone, Human Rights Watch estimates that misclassification of platform workers cost the state over $111 million in unemployment insurance contributions between 2020 and 2022 — a quiet transfer of public wealth into private hands.
In 2024, Uber reported $43.9 billion in revenue and nearly $10 billion in net income, calling the fourth quarter its “strongest ever.” DoorDash pulled in $10.72 billion, up 24 percent from the previous year. Combined, their market valuation exceeds $250 billion.
But workers are pushing back, and policymakers are starting to listen. At this June’s UN-backed International Labour Conference, for example, a binding treaty on platform work is under discussion.
The message is clear: workers are demanding rules that protect their rights.
The U.S. can start by updating employment classification standards and adopting clear criteria to determine whether a platform worker is truly independent. We also need greater transparency. If gig workers were properly classified, public companies would have to disclose pay data, showing just how far below the median these workers earn — and how high executive compensation soars above them.
This isn’t about rejecting technology. It’s about making sure companies don’t hide exploitation behind an app. Alejandro has a right to a wage he can live on, protections he can count on, and a system that doesn’t punish him for getting sick, injured, or speaking up.
He and millions like him built the platform economy. It’s time they shared more than the burden.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-02 11:31:00+00:00,CT Mirror,There is no difference between Black feminism and DEI,Dione Dwyer | Opinion Contributor,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/02/there-is-no-difference-between-black-feminism-and-dei/,People think DEI is about race and feminism is about gender. But intersectionality can be found embedded into both.,"“Citizens of this nation, cannot know the positive contributions feminist movement has made to all our lives if we do not highlight these gains.”  — bell hooks

DEI (Diversity Equity Inclusion): A framework approach used to create a more inclusive and fair environment for individuals and groups in various settings, such as workplaces, schools, and communities. 
Black Feminism: Focused on building political and social power for Black women, girls, and gender-expansive people. It centers leadership development, community care and joy.  
People think that feminism is about gender. It is not. Feminism is a realization of what’s fair. Feminism is for everybody – just like DEI includes everyone. Everyone that needs the support of it, such as the elderly who might have retired but still have to work to supplement their pension because it’s not enough. It also supports the young adults diagnosed with any spectrum of autism, ADD or ADHD. 

Dione Dwyer
I am a member of a grassroots organization, a resident-owned and lead collective, in the low-income public housing of my city. The organization was founded and established by residents in the community. Years later, It then furthered its establishment by aligning itself with the Black Feminist organizing movement. Getting training to better familiarize ourselves with how involved the organization would be is what kept it going to the current time. 
We then came to the realization that Black feminism is similar to what we are also working towards when it comes to inclusivity: housing justice, education, environmental Justice, and good government. We are constantly working to drive change in the system that is supposed to help lift us up, but only continuously harms us. 
When I think of Black feminism and what’s going on in the world today, it seems to me that feminism is showing up more in the DEI conundrum… How isn’t anyone making this connection? To me they are both interconnected; in similar ways, they both give reasons to be inclusive of everyone. 
They are both the reason that someone who is special needs can still be in the work environment to earn their own pay; it’s the same reason why women are able to do the same work as men. 
Because of Black feminism and DEI in today’s society, women are now included.
Race is what people think DEI is all about; and gender is what people think Black Feminism is all about. But intersectionality can be found embedded into both; and that  is where today’s DEI can actually make a difference to how everyone gets to be included.
DEI and Black feminism can also work in tandem together. However, if DEI – which is threatened – goes away, it may also essentially take away the work of any organization that includes Black feminist work as well. 
The work I do follows the motto of The Combahee River Collective:  “If Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression.”  
As a matter of fact, DEI would probably not be needed if that statement was to be followed through. But I suppose that not many, especially the ones in charge, can ever imagine a world such as that.  
I suppose hierarchy is always going to be something that we all have to contend with and fight against. Either way, DEI and feminism are both essential to today’s society in order for it to move forward in a direction that it needs to go, for a better functioning world.
bell hooks tells us, “Feminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action.” 
This also goes for DEI, it doesn’t exist just for the Black race to be incorporated into the existing world. It exists because everyone else that will be excluded, and is not able to be a part of the existing normal world, that may have a little bit of a difference when it comes to physical ability, mental learning, emotional processing, and more, will now certainly be included and live a “normal life.”
Inclusivity is what DEI and Black feminism have always been about, to make sure the one-sided thinking of the past is no longer something to go by. To make sure that as life progresses we are including all of the people that may come with a different way of being, and be able to progress in this world we live in. 
So why is the current administration trying to pull that apart? Why is it that so many corporations are willing to undo the DEI progress that actually has been working towards bringing all of us together? Isn’t this the way we’ve made progress in the first place? To what end? Will undoing all these things help us all progress further in the world in this lifetime? Why are we working so hard to dismantle that progress? What will happen to us all after we do these things? 
True inclusion disrupts how we’ve been going along to get along. That all humans who can be included with all of our uniqueness to bring progress along even more so. The people want some answers.

The last day of early voting is Monday, with Election Day on Tuesday to elect a new county executive and a county council member.","A drop box in a parking lot next to Prince George’s County Board of Elections on May 30. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Prince George’s County’s year of cascading special elections is almost over.
More than 62,000 Prince George’s County voters had dropped off mail-in ballots as of Friday, ahead of Tuesday’s special election to choose a new county executive and a new District 5 council member, a county election official said.
In-person turnout was light — just 307 voters on Wednesday, the first day of early voting and 396 on Thursday — but county Election Administrator Wendy Honesty-Bey attributed that to the week’s rainy weather. “It’s been expected,” she said Friday.
There is one more day of early voting Monday before Election Day on Tuesday. The voting caps a year of upheaval in the county, where the election of a new U.S. senator and the criminal conviction of a sitting council member created openings that had a domino effect, as county officials moved in to new positions.
The parade of elections began with the conviction last year of former At-large Council Member Jamel “Mel” Frankin, who was convicted in a campaign theft scheme, setting up an August primary and a November election. When District 5 Council Member Jolene Ivey won Franklin’s seat and County Executive Angela Alsobrooks won a U.S. Senate seat in November, it set up a March primary and Tuesday’s general election for those seats.
In the executive’s race, voters are choosing between State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy, the Democrat, and Republican nominee Jonathan White to fill out the remaining two years of Alsobrooks’ term, who stepped down in December to take her Senate seat.
The county’s chief administrative officer, Tara H. Jackson, who has been acting county executive since Alsobrooks stepped down, chose not to seek the seat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Braveboy, who was endorsed by Gov. Wes Moore (D), easily won a March primary over a field of nine Democrats, including former County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, who had the endorsement of  state treasurer and county resident Dereck Davis (D), and At-Large Council Member Calvin Hawkins, who was endorsed by Alsobrooks.
Ivey was briefly a candidate in the executive’s race but withdrew before the primary — and still managed to finish fourth. By withdrawing, Ivey spared county residents the prospect of another special election for her at-large council seat. Should Braveboy win the executive’s race, the county’s circuit court judges will select a replacement to serve out the remaining two years of her term.
In heavily Democratic Prince George’s County, Braveboy is the favorite to win. In a victory party after her March 4 primary win, Braveboy acknowledged as much when she told the crowd, “I can’t wait to serve as your next county executive.”
Voters in council District 5,which includes Bladensburg, Cheverly and Glenarden, are also choosing between former school board member Shayla Adams-Stafford, a Democrat, and Republican Fred Price Jr. to replace Ivey.
Adams-Stafford, a former school board member, won the Democratic nomination by slightly more than 2,000 votes against four other candidates. A fifth Democratic challenger, former Cheverly Mayor Kayce Munyeneh who lost reelection in last month’s city election, dropped out the County Council race.
As with Braveboy, Adams-Stafford is the likely favorite in the heavily Democratic county.
The council make up could become more progressive with Adams-Stafford on the council, who also received support from Council Chair Edward Burroughs III and Vice Chair Krystal Oriadha. About three weeks after Braveboy won the special primary, Burroughs became the youngest chair in the county’s history at age 32.
Honesty-Bey said counting ballots for Tuesday’s special general election should be completed by June 13.

Here's what to know.,"Republicans in Congress are inching closer to passing a significant piece of legislation that could affect everything from taxes to immigration to Medicaid.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is the vehicle to enact much of President Donald J. Trump’s second-term agenda. Republicans want to extend the tax breaks in the 2017 tax law that passed during his first term and will expire at the end of the year.
The legislation has implications on taxes for individuals and families at most income levels as well as for businesses and universities. To offset some of those costs, the bill includes steep spending cuts, which would have a direct impact on some safety net programs.
Because they control both chambers of Congress, Republicans can pass a budget bill on their own. But they have been dealing with internal conflicts, and the bill could end up looking considerably different in the final stages.

Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, are opposed and have no role in crafting the bill. They argue it will disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans and big corporations, balloon the national debt and cut critical services.
Here’s where the bill currently stands and what it could mean for your finances.
How will it affect my taxes going forward?
Individuals and households in Connecticut could see quick relief on some of their taxes. But some of it will only be temporary and last through the rest of Trump’s term.
It makes many of the tax breaks permanent from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act since they will expire at the end of the year, including lower income tax rates.
One of the most-watched parts of the bill has been whether to raise the cap on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT. If the cap increases, it will be especially beneficial for higher cost-of-living states like Connecticut.
The bill would raise the $10,000 threshold on SALT deductions to $40,000, which would get phased out for those who make over $500,000. Both caps would increase by 1% through 2033. But it’s likely the Senate will make changes to this provision.
Workers would be able to deduct overtime pay or tips from their federal income tax. And people could deduct up to $10,000 of interest on their auto loans as long as the vehicle was assembled in the U.S. All three tax breaks would last through 2028.
Families would get to claim a slightly higher child tax credit. The rebate would increase to $2,500 through 2028 and then go back down to $2,000 and indexed for inflation. It also requires parents who file taxes jointly to have Social Security numbers.
Seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $4,000 deduction. And the bill would automatically create new savings accounts for newborns born between Jan. 1, 2025, to Jan. 1, 2029. The federal government would give a one-time deposit of $1,000 and invest it in the stock market. Others would be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year through the age of 18.
There would also be changes to student loans and financial assistance.
For Pell Grant recipients who want to get the maximum amount, they need to be full-time students. Under the bill, students would need to increase the number of credits they take each semester from 12 to 15 to reach that status. They need to be half-time students to get at least some assistance. But it would also expand these grants in other cases by making short-term vocational training eligible for Pell.
And the bill would reduce the number of existing income-driven repayment plans to pay back student loans and get rid of federal subsidized loans for undergraduates.
Consumers would no longer see the tax breaks for electric vehicles and energy-efficient home appliances that were part of Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act.  
Will I lose access to Medicaid or SNAP benefits?
Not necessarily. But cuts are expected if stricter work requirements and other changes are enacted. If the bill passes in its current form, those could go into effect as early as late 2026.
The Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes and scores federal bills, estimates up to 10 million people could lose Medicaid coverage and about 3 million people could lose food assistance in the U.S. over the next decade.
To qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, you would need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. Exemptions are made for certain groups including those who are pregnant or postpartum, Medicare recipients, veterans, caregivers and people with disabilities.
For those who fall under the requirement, the bill would require you to report that work and the state would conduct frequent checks to ensure eligibility. Those same adults would also need to pay a $35 co-pay for most services.
The bill also seeks to penalize states like Connecticut that provide Medicaid regardless of immigration status. “HUSKY for immigrants” provides state-sponsored health care for children under 15 and people who are postpartum with qualifying incomes. Connecticut uses its own money to provide that coverage, but could stand to see reductions to their federal Medicaid reimbursement for doing so.
Under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program proposal, more older Americans would need to work or train at least 80 hours a month. The bill raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64.
Dependents are currently considered under the age of 18. But when it comes to SNAP, the bill would significantly lower the age of a dependent to under 7. That means work requirements would also apply to able-bodied adults with children ages 7 or older in order to receive benefits.
States like Connecticut would need to pay a portion of SNAP benefits for the first time in the program’s history. That has raised concerns about potential benefit cuts.
Where does Trump’s bill stand in Congress?
Republicans are using a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation. This allows them to bypass filibusters in the Senate and pass certain kinds of bills without relying on support from Democrats. But the process can still take months to complete.
In late May, Republicans in the House narrowly passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” after weeks of negotiations and divides within the party about what to include.
With Congress returning from recess the first week of June, the Senate will now take it up. They will go through their own tedious negotiations, an all-night vote series on amendments and then a final vote on passage.
Because the Senate is likely to make changes, Republicans in both chambers would then need to reconcile the differences and vote on a compromise bill. Republicans are aiming to wrap up the process and send it to Trump for his signature by July 4. But it could take more time if the party remains split on the final version.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25126554098870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 08:04:37.701562

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Who says being a lawmaker is a thankless job? The Arc Maryland said thanks to four lawmakers Thursday, recognizing them at the Arc Maryland’s 65th Convention and Awards banquet for their part in clawing back nearly $300 million in proposed cuts to the Developmental Disabilities Administration.
Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D- Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), Sen. Cory McCray (D-Baltimore City) and Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery) were each given a Legislator of the Year award Thursday at the Arc Maryland’s 65th Convention and Awards banquet.
As chairs of committees that create the state budget, Guzzone and Barnes were influential in restoring millions in funding back to the DDA, which oversees the services for people with developmental disabilities, after Gov. Wes Moore (D) initially proposed $457 million in cuts for the 2026 budget citing unsustainable growth and costs.
Much of the work to restore almost $300 million to the agency occurred in budget subcommittees in the respective chambers, with McCray leading the effort in the Health and Human Services subcommittee and Shetty leading the Health and Social Services subcommittee.
“This was a heck of a year – one that we would not like to be repeated,” Guzzone said in accepting his award.
It was a grueling session for advocates in the developmental disabilities community. Hundreds of people with disabilities, their families and support staff rallied in Annapolis against the hefty cuts, and significant lobbying efforts continued throughout session.
Guzzone recognized the persistent lobbying from the developmental disability community this session as “inspiring” and an example of democracy at work.
“I am just touched by the fact that all of you keep telling your stories, bringing them to the legislature,” he said “And there are others in the legislature who really stepped up.”
“This was a session when we needed all hands on deck,” he said. “The team of people who came together who said, ‘No way, we’re not going to let this happen. We’re going to work with the administration to make this thing — this enormous amount of money — we’re going to figure out a way to deal with it.'”

Speaking of the Maryland State Retirement Agency…


Maryland State Retirement Agency Chief Investment Officer Andrew Palmer has been named to Blueprint Capital Advisors’ 2025 “Power100” list as a leading allocator among institutional investors.
The Power 100 is a nonprofit enterprise designed “to shine a spotlight on alternative investment organizations, professionals and investors that are high performing, impacting the industry and narrowing societal gaps related to wealth, health, education, and other areas important to us all.”
“This recognition speaks to the work of our investment team and the broader mission of the Maryland State Retirement Agency,” Palmer said in a release from the retirement agency. “It’s gratifying to see how our investment strategy not only secures the long-term retirement benefits of our members but also contributes meaningfully to the future of the investment industry.”
It is the second consecutive year Palmer has been named to the Power 100. Under his guidance, the agency said, the investment division has consistently pursued innovative strategies while staying grounded in the fiduciary responsibilities owed to Maryland’s public employees and retirees.
“Andy’s recognition is a reflection of the values we prioritize at SRA: integrity, long-term thinking, and a commitment to the public good,” said SRA Executive Director Martin Noven. “We’re proud that our investment program is not only producing strong results for members, but also serving as a model for principled, inclusive leadership in the broader investment community.”
The list also features other prominent state pension systems, including CalSTRS, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, and the Employees’ Retirement System of Hawaii.

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor's Office)Attorneys for the state of New Jersey want an appellate court to deny a request by nonprofit groups and several public school families who want the court to hear their case that New Jersey schools are unconstitutionally segregated along racial and socioeconomic lines.
In a 46-page brief filed last week, the state’s attorneys argue that it is premature for the appellate division to hear the case because a trial judge overseeing the dispute has not issued a final order. The record before the trial judge is too limited, and an appellate court weighing in now would result in “piecemeal review,” the state argues.
“There is no grave damage or injustice necessitating immediate appellate review,” the state said.
The case, filed in 2018 by Latino Action Network and the statewide NAACP, among others, alleges that school district boundaries tied to municipalities exacerbate de facto segregation across schools. They cited a UCLA study that found New Jersey had the seventh most segregated school system, with nearly half of all Black and Latino students in New Jersey attending schools that are more than 90% non-white, schools that are often mere blocks from predominately white districts. The plaintiffs note that the state has a constitutional duty to provide students with a “thorough and efficient” education. 
In October 2023, a state superior court judge ruled that the plaintiffs demonstrated a “marked and persistent racial imbalance” in public schools, but said the lack of data did not prove their sweeping claim that the system is “unconstitutionally segregated because of race or ethnicity.” He declined the plaintiffs’ request for an immediate ruling. The plaintiffs appealed.
In Wednesday’s filing, the state criticizes the plaintiffs for failing to show what desegregation would look like or offering any “practical solution.”
The state’s recent filing came one day after the New Jersey Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank that supports school choice, filed a 20-page motion in the case arguing in favor of expanding a state program that allows students to attend schools outside of their hometowns. 
Enrollment in the program has been virtually frozen since 2015. Lifting that freeze would be a cost-effective way to increase racial diversity and would not require any significant additional administration, they said, adding that districts could be incentivized to participate.
The program offers a “ready-made solution that can be implemented almost immediately,” according to the institute, which says more than 2,000 students are currently on waitlists. And school choice expansion could help integrate schools more quickly than redistricting, according to the brief. 
“The state has already built the infrastructure. All that’s left is to unfreeze it,” the brief states.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ellen Oxfeld: Our health care system needs systemic reform.","To the Editor,In the latest outrageous Vermont health care news, we learn that Vermont hospitals are marking up outpatient drugs to an average of more than 500% of the manufacturer’s price (and in one case nearly 70 times the manufacturer’s price) — the highest markup in the nation.This is one of several reasons for escalating health insurance costs in Vermont. So, it is good news that lawmakers are taking emergency steps and adding an amendment to a drug price bill that would cap outpatient drug prices.READ MORE
But is it effective to keep responding on a one-on-one basis to each health care crisis? Ironically, the lobbyist for the hospitals has admitted that price gouging is wrong. But she argues we have a “very flawed way of paying for health care.”That’s correct. Most countries pay for hospital care as a universal public good. They pool publicly raised funds and finance their hospitals with global operating budgets that take account of local needs and levels of care required in each facility. Such systems have better control over hospital costs and more effective public oversight than we do. Yet this legislative session, a bill (H.267) that would have created a publicly financed hospital system languished in House Health. No testimony was taken. The same is true of bills that would have created universal primary care (H.433 and H.185). Can our relevant House committees take testimony on these bills next session?We can keep trying to put out forest fires, or we can start the work of systemic reform.

Why I withdrew my amendment, and why that matters.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Troy Headrick: Equity requires more than rhetoric.","This commentary is by Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington.Recently, during floor debate on S.123, I offered an amendment that would have created an eight-year renewal option for Vermont-issued identification cards. It was designed to provide longer-term stability and protection for Vermonters, especially those who are trans and nonbinary.The structure was simple and sound, the amendment was revenue neutral, included safeguards to stabilize DMV revenue over time, and aligned with Vermont’s proud policy of allowing self-attestation of gender identity.I also withdrew the amendment.To some, that may have seemed abrupt or puzzling. But the choice was deliberate. While I remain convinced that the amendment represents strong policy, I knew that insisting on a vote could delay passage of the underlying bill that also includes a critical early renewal provision that trans and nonbinary Vermonters need immediately. Preserving that core protection became the priority.Still, we need to talk about what this moment revealed.Vermont leads in recognizing gender identity, but we do so within a larger federal system. The Trump administration’s recent executive order directs federal agencies to define sex based on immutable biology at conception. This quietly but powerfully undermines existing ID frameworks.A Vermont-issued ID that reflects a person’s affirmed gender could now be questioned or rejected by the Transportation Security Administration, passport agencies or other federal entities. That’s not hypothetical. It’s the creeping return of exclusion via administrative means.My amendment would have given Vermonters a shield with an eight-year window of bureaucratic peace. Time to travel, apply for jobs, enroll in benefits or simply move through the world without being asked to re-prove who they are.And yet, too few in the chamber seemed ready to engage with that reality. The concerns raised weren’t rooted in hostility, but they were rooted in and exposed a blind spot. Some viewed the eight-year renewal as a bonus convenience, not a policy with protective power. Others were uncomfortable with the idea of setting up a reserve fund, despite the clear fiscal logic behind it.What concerns me most isn’t that the amendment was withdrawn, but that too few of my colleagues recognized what it actually offered. For those of us who’ve never had our identity questioned at airport security or challenged by a federal agency, an eight-year ID renewal might sound like a simple convenience. But for trans and nonbinary Vermonters, many of whom aren’t in the room when we draft these policies, it would mean eight years of peace of mind, safety and stability.When we dismiss policy changes as nonessential because they seem nonessential to us, we risk missing real opportunities to protect those who are most at risk. That’s a policy failure. Specifically it’s a failure to act on our stated commitment to keeping equity at the center of our legislative processes.This is not the end of the conversation. The issue will return, as it must. In the meantime, I hope this moment serves as a reminder that equity requires more than good intentions. It requires an ability to see the implications of our policy through the eyes of those who are most affected by it.Because dignity shouldn’t expire every four years.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep.

In 2024, fatal overdoses in the state dropped nearly 11% from the previous year, from 3,512 to 3,137, according to preliminary data released by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“There’s been not a lot of good news in this space, and this is good news,” said Dr. Herbert Duber, regional medical officer at the state Department of Health. “I think that we need to get more time, though, to see how it sticks.”
Last year’s total is still nearly 14% higher than the deaths recorded in 2022.
Washington saw the downward overdose trend reversed in the last few months of 2024, noted Duber. The past month has also seen a significant increase. 
Washington’s decrease last year was far below the national average of more than 25%. Only two states saw upticks in overdose deaths: Nevada and South Dakota. 
Nationally, overdose remains the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 44, health officials say.
Fatal overdoses had been rising quickly in Washington. In 2019, fewer than 1,300 residents died, according to state data. 
Highly potent fentanyl drove that rise, along with increased drug use during the pandemic. In 2019, just over 300 people in Washington died from synthetic opioids like fentanyl. By 2023, that had skyrocketed to more than 2,600, according to the state Department of Health.
Federal health officials cite the Overdose Data to Action program as a way to continue reducing deaths through statistic-guided prevention efforts. The state Department of Health, as well as the King and Snohomish County health departments, have received federal money under Overdose Data to Action.
In Washington, Duber sees increasing access to treatment as a catalyst for the improvement seen last year, especially to the medication buprenorphine meant to treat opioid addiction. Duber, an emergency department physician, will prescribe Suboxone, a medication containing both buprenorphine and naloxone that reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms.
“There’s just been an increasing level of comfort and education and engagement on opioids, trying to figure out a way where the healthcare community can really impact this epidemic,” Duber said.
The state is looking to keep the progress going. The two-year state budget Gov. Bob Ferguson signed last week included money for a new hotline to facilitate access to services and medication like buprenorphine. The earliest that could be launched is in September, a Department of Health spokesperson said.
The goal is to lower barriers as much as possible to give people the chance to get treatment.
But the so-called “big, beautiful bill” the U.S. House passed last month could threaten the progress. The Medicaid program for low-income Americans is the largest payer for opioid use disorder treatment in Washington, according to the state Health Care Authority.
The Republican-backed legislation proposes cutting Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, a move that could cost Washington about $2 billion over the next four years and force around 194,000 to lose coverage, local leaders have warned.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/drug-syringe-1.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The sprawling sports complex on the edge of southern Lebanon, bordered by open fields and new townhomes, is a welcome and familiar site to Jessica Hill. She regularly brings her 8-year-old son, Larry, to The Farmers Bank Fieldhouse for his basketball league games and practices. The duo also come to watch the Lebanon Leprechauns, a professional basketball team that plays in the Midwest Division of The Basketball League.
The 200,000-square-foot Fieldhouse is one of hundreds across the country and more than a dozen in Indiana promising economic growth, a tourism boost, community engagement and a foothold in the fast-growing world of youth athletics.
“It fuels our community, which is great,” said the mom, who pointed to opportunities for youth sports fans. The venue also hosts birthday parties, golf simulators, batting cages and even personal trainers — though all have an associated cost. 

Arnolt Center for Investigative Journalism staff Max Reich, Marissa Meador, Mia Hilkowitz, Alaska Jones, Zoe Benson and Libby Erlenbaugh co-wrote this special report.

The building is part of a changing Lebanon, which is also set to host a mammoth technology park that’s spurring new housing and associated development — growth that Hill said could sometimes be overwhelming. 
“In the long run, this place will be good for our community,” she concluded. 
The Hills were among roughly 300 hometown fans at the sports complex who watched the Leprechauns narrowly lose a May 23 game that featured a local dance squad, opening game prayer and people shooting hoops on open courts. 
Mike Edwards, an associate professor at North Carolina State University, who researches sport and community development, said that type of investment can benefit communities, but only if the needs of local residents remain the priority.
“I’m a big believer that your first priority for how you’re spending your tax money for recreation, for sport partnership should be a direct benefit to your local residents,” Edwards said. “If it’s not balanced with direct use, accessibility and benefits to that local community, then you’re probably missing out on, really, what the focus of these facilities should be.” 
Sports tourism projects have popped up all over the state — from Columbus and Noblesville to Hammond and Newton County. But the recent push to make Indiana a go-to destination for youth sport competitions started, arguably, in Westfield.
Economic impact and strategic investment 
On the outskirts of Indianapolis, the $49-million Grand Park Sports Complex, has 15 clover-shaped outdoor baseball fields visible from above, sprawling across acres of open land. Inside its main building, which opened in 2016, synthetic turf bears the brunt of hundreds of cleats as youth athletes cycle through tournaments, practices and games across a range of sports. 
Weekends are the busiest times for the complex, as it is usually hosting youth sports tournaments and larger events. Grand Park’s largest events are the Crossroads of America College soccer showcase, the NXT Lacrosse MidAmerica Invitational and the Amateur Baseball Championships. Grand Park also hosts the Indianapolis Colts Training Camp. Occasionally, the complex will host non-sporting related events — including farming and equipment expos, corporate events and even a political rally for President Donald Trump during his inaugural campaign. Youth sports teams train at the soccer fields and baseball diamonds for the rest of the week.
Matt Trnian has served as director of Grand Park Sports Complex since January 2022. He said the complex attracts around 5.5 million visitors each year, from all over the country, but mainly from the Midwest.

Trnian said Grand Park is designed to attract tourists who otherwise never would have visited Westfield and its businesses. 
“So the vision with these events is to have them spend their tourism dollars within the community and to eat at our local restaurants, shop at our local retail stores and spend their tourism dollars within our community,” Trnian said. “So there’s certainly a direct impact to the visitation that Grand Park has to the local businesses throughout Westfield.” 
Revenue for Westfield’s Grand Park reached an all-time high last year, as reported earlier this year by Inside INdiana Business. Recently, an adjoining sports, entertainment and business district started generating enough tax increment financing to cover debt payments roughly a decade after opening.
The city still owes $62 million, according to the story, with payoff scheduled for 2041. But, unlike other public parks, the complex isn’t free for residents to use — similar to how other publicly funded sports complexes operate. 
A cultural shift for youth sports
Access to these facilities and their programs often depends on a family’s ability to travel and keep up with the rising expenses associated with youth sports.
While local leaders see the economic benefits from sports complexes, the multi-million-dollar complexes often shut out children who can’t afford to participate. 
“If you’re going to use public funds to build a facility like Grand Park [sports complex], how do you assure that the local youth in that area can still access it?” said Cassandra Coble, an associate professor at Indiana University who researches youth sports.
For example, open courts at the Lebanon sports complex cost $12 per session, unless you purchase a membership for at least $50 per month. A junior hoops summer camp starts at $250 per child while a volleyball camp is $200.
Beyond infrastructure, these complexes reflect a cultural shift in how some Americans view youth sports — not just as recreation, but as tools for community advertising and development.
Many of these complexes pop up in rural areas where land is more readily available, which can create other participation hurdles for families such as a shortage of volunteers to coach or maintain playing spaces.
“Rural communities face a unique set of challenges when it comes to access to sports and physical activity,” Edwards said. “Transportation is often a major barrier in areas where parents commute into urban centers and kids take the bus home from school, it’s hard for them to access space.”
Limited parks staffing and tight municipal budgets can make it difficult to maintain scattered parks and fields. In response, Edwards said, many towns have moved toward consolidation.

“There’s been a real emphasis on centralizing complexes and parks,” he said. “But in doing so, you sometimes make the park less accessible to the population.”
Coble said she worries about the rise of these complexes, many of which are private, and their long-term effect on youth participation as costs for travel, equipment and private coaching increase
The average U.S. family spent $1,016 on their child’s primary sport in 2024, a 46% increase since 2019, according to a recent survey by the Aspen Institute. This figure doesn’t include expenses related to secondary or even tertiary sports teams. When added up, parents said they spent around $1,500 dollars in 2024.
In total, families in the U.S. currently spend an estimated $40 billion annually on youth sports — double the revenue generated by the NFL, according to the Aspen Institute study. That figure leaves out additional public spending by schools and municipalities, and investments from private facility operators.
Experts, including Coble, say the growing commercialization of youth sports is limiting access to equitable opportunities and, in some cases, is pricing children out of participation altogether.
“There has for a long time been a gap between who has legitimate access to participating in youth sports,” Coble said. “But that gap is growing and growing with the introduction of private training and private facilities.”
An ecosystem for youth sports
Less than 20 miles away from Grand Park, The Farmers Bank Fieldhouse is pitched as one part of the overall “youth sports ecosystem” in central Indiana, according to Lebanon Mayor Matt Gentry.
“It’s actually a multiplier; it’s not a competition-type situation,” Gentry said. “Even before we built our facility, we were getting overflow hotel rooms and stays in Lebanon because of Grand Park and because of the Pacer Athletic Center.
“They’re already kind of feeding and supporting each other,” Gentry continued. “Us having a facility isn’t a negative for (them).”

Gentry said the attraction brings an estimated 60,000 visitors monthly from across the country. Conversations with business owners have made it clear the Fieldhouse has had a positive ripple effect, he added.
“They’ve told me directly they’ve seen increases in business, and our downtown has seen an influx of visitors with different events,” he said.
The city is planning additional economic development around the facility using the Fieldhouse as the main attraction. But, more than a year after its opening, the land in front of the facility is overgrown and features mounds of dirt from the original construction.
“Having the Fieldhouse there is the anchor tenant that makes everything possible,” Gentry said. “We would not be getting an interest in these amenities if we didn’t have the tourism base, and frankly, just the foot traffic, generated by the fieldhouse.”
The $25-million public bond for Lebanon’s complex is set up to be paid for over 25 years by property taxes, innkeeper’s taxes, and food and beverage taxes, though Gentry acknowledged that local income taxes are a last-resort option if all else fails.
“Essentially, all of the development is going to pay for the Fieldhouse, back onto itself,” said Gentry.
Hoosier cities add to the momentum
Across the state, Fort Wayne’s city leaders introduced plans for a $1.5 billion redevelopment project in February. 
The first phase of the proposed North River development includes the North River Fieldhouse, a 160,000 square foot, $60 million facility to advance Fort Wayne’s standing in the sports tourism industry, according to a news release from the city.

It’s expected to host events 27 weekends of the 52-week year, create about 900 new jobs and generate an anticipated $36 million in new economic activity, according to consulting firm Victus Advisors. The city recently approved a contract with Victus to secure a developer for the site.
The city hasn’t yet determined how it will finance such a project, though it is exploring whether it can tap into federal money slated to help with river cleanup, according to WANE, a local television station.
The facility will also be available for public use outside of the tournament season. 
Alec Johnson, Fort Wayne’s deputy director for redevelopment, said that the facility is expected to serve as a catalyst for the success of the rest of the mixed-use district, which will include a boutique hotel, riverwalk, shopping and dining alongside the proposed soccer stadium, natatorium, E-sports venue, athletic fields and basketball courts.
Johnson said the question of public benefit has been central to planning, which includes a “very active” neighborhood association within the district.
“The way that they sort of look at it is, everybody is falling in love with the riverfront development,” Johnson said about the district’s neighborhood association. “So, how do we sort of leverage that and allow that momentum and positivity to jump the river to the northside and spill out into the neighborhood so they see the benefit?”

I wrote a lot about wolves, apparently. (Getty Images)Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: the bottom line.
Well Reformers, this is it: the final Topline. Call it the Bottom Line? 
As this is my last day here, I thought I’d do something a little more self-indulgent than usual and look back at my time at the Reformer, by the numbers.
Number of days I was employed by the Reformer: 1,050
I started at the Reformer on July 18, 2022, making my tenure just a hair under three years. My first story was about wolf attacks, and how they benefit far-right politicians. I published 309 stories in total, including this one, which works out to about one byline every 3.4 calendar days.
The most widely-read story I worked on was this one from March about then-Sen. Justin Eichorn’s arrest in an underage prostitution sting, although if I recall correctly Michelle Griffith actually did most of the work on it. 
My most-read solo piece was a November 2023 story about how wolves weren’t responsible for that year’s disappointing deer hunt. Judging by the state of my inbox at the time, many of those pageviews were hate-clicks from angry guys looking for any excuse to go shoot a wolf.
Pieces of legislation inspired: 3
Journalism’s not just about the hate-clicks, of course: You’re also trying to change things for the better. To that end, my stories inspired three pieces of legislation in St. Paul this year.
The first was a bill providing grant money to help solve non-fatal shootings in the state. This came about after I wrote last year about data showing more than half of violent crimes in Minnesota go unsolved.
The second would have reformed how so-called “drug free zones” can be policed after I reported on the aggressive and frankly bizarre drug charging practices used by a prosecutor in Polk County (and basically nowhere else).
The third, and the only signed into law this term, was the bill that finally decriminalized bong water in the state. It was inspired by my reporting on Jessica Beske of Fargo, who was staring down the barrel of a 30-year prison term after cops alleged they’d  found a bong used to smoke methamphetamine in her car.
That case, incidentally, also came out of Polk County. Some very strange things happening up there! 
It’s also worth noting that these stories didn’t just arise out of a vacuum. The Reformer had done extensive work on violent crime clearance rates long before I showed up. And Jessica Beske reached out to us only because she had read Deena Winter’s prior reporting on drug paraphernalia reform at the legislature.
Legislator ties to extremist groups exposed: 1
One of the things that drew me to the Reformer in the first place was editor Patrick Coolican’s characterization of it as a newsroom that would tell the stories other news organizations can’t or won’t  tell. I got a first-hand taste of this shortly after I started, with a piece about former Republican Rep. Donald Raleigh of Blaine, whose name had turned up on a leaked membership roster of the Oath Keepers, a far-right extremist group.
Raleigh’s defense was that he never actually agreed with the Oath Keepers’ ideology, and had only signed up for their email list as part of “market research” he was doing for a veteran’s organization he founded. He also told us that other news outlets, like the Star Tribune and Buzzfeed, had looked into his ties to the group and decided they weren’t worth doing a story on. The implication was that we shouldn’t be reporting on it either.
I strongly disagreed, and Patrick backed me up on this. Raleigh’s story was plausible enough, and that’s how we framed our piece. But by the time Raleigh had signed up for their newsletter, the Oath Keepers had a well-established reputation as a fringe group with violent tendencies, and they had been the subject of countless media stories.
As a voter, I’d want to know if one of my elected officials was signing up to receive communications from extremist groups, for “market research” or any other purposes. Especially in the post-January 6 era.
We ran the story, and Raleigh lost his seat two months later (although that was due more to the effects of the state’s recent redistricting than anything else).
Senate ethics inquiries launched: 1
I’m delighted with my reporting on Senate President Bobby Joe Champion’s ethically questionable ties to the Rev. Jerry McAfee for two reasons. The first, and most journalistically obvious reason, is that it shined a light on Minnesota’s extremely lax conflict-of-interest laws, and it got a number of lawmakers to acknowledge that they should maybe try to avoid funneling boatloads of grant money to individuals they have professional relationships with outside of the Legislature.
It also sparked a Senate ethics inquiry into Champion’s actions, which went nowhere given the even balance of power in that body.
But the other reason I love this story is how I stumbled across it in the first place: by wasting time on social media. I was hanging out one morning on Twitter (I will never call it “X”), avoiding whatever story I was supposed to be working on, when I saw some Minneapolis folks making offhand comments about Champion being McAfee’s lawyer. It was a jarring moment, as these people were casually discussing the fact as if it were common knowledge, despite it not having been reported anywhere.
A quick visit to Minnesota’s court records system confirmed what they were saying, and we were off to the races from there.
There are two reporting lessons here, I think. The first is that what passes for common knowledge in some communities will come as a shocking revelation to others. 
The second: Never log off.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1071732044-1024x699.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

It was a day of productive conversations about transportation, curriculum, funding, taxes, extracurriculars, school lunches, and so much more. 
That was until I knocked on what was probably the twentieth door of the day. The man who opened it immediately saw I was holding a pamphlet, and simply asked, “Which party?” I was frozen for a split second, before gathering my wits and explaining. “Actually, this is for a school board race! The candidates are nonpartisan.” I saw a look of disappointment flash across his face. But the conversation that continued from there was just as rich as the ones I’d had before. By the end of our chat, I think we both learned something about the role of schools in our community. 
Sadly, conversations like these are rare in Indiana, because we are one of only seven states that still allows straight ticket voting. Straight ticket voting was once widespread nationwide, but most states have abolished it since the 1960s. While Indiana limited its use in 2016, it persists for most major votes. It’s a practice that rewards partisan ignorance — you don’t even have to look at candidate names. Check a box, R or D, and almost all votes are marked. 
I say almost because some candidates, such as judges and school board members, are left out of a straight ticket vote. As a teacher, I’m grateful. And I’m relieved that this exclusion was maintained in the final version of Senate Enrolled Act 287, which put Indiana in a club of just nine other states requiring school board candidates to declare a political party. 
But I found it telling to hear how the bill’s author, Sen. Gary Byrne, justified adding parties into school board elections: “People don’t know who they’re voting for…Knowing which political party a candidate identifies with will help Hoosiers know what kind of principles that person would apply to their position.”

Of course, this assumes that there are only two ways to govern – Republican or Democrat. In education, as in any other sector, nothing could be further from the truth. The partisan binary in a straight ticket simplifies a much more complicated discourse, enabling people to be uninformed when they vote. 
If everything comes down to party, we may as well allow artificial intelligence to determine election results based on population characteristics and party affiliation. But that’s not how democracy is supposed to work. Democracy requires an open debate that transcends parties. It requires voters to weigh heavily the responsibility of their choice.
Advocates of straight ticket voting claim it’s popular, but if that were true, Indiana wouldn’t have one of the most abysmal voter turnout rates in the nation. In fact, the partisan heuristic is just as likely to turn off voters. Both of our major political parties are deeply unpopular, with solid majorities viewing both unfavorably. About half of Americans don’t even identify with a political party, and those rates continue to decline. The data is clear: straight ticket voting is about tribal self-preservation, not voter education.
That’s how we often find ourselves stuck with problematic, mean, and ethically questionable candidates sliding into positions of power, especially down the ballot. There’s too few options on the table. By emphasizing partisan affiliation over all else, proponents of straight-ticket voting assume that voters are too busy or uninformed to understand real issues. That’s a dismissive way to understand the electorate. 
So as voters, how do we push back? It’s simple: just refrain from voting a straight ticket. We should feel uneasy if we put someone into power without knowing what they are capable of. Get to know the full ballot ahead of time — your coroner, your auditor, your treasurer. Ensure that you walk into the voting room and recognize every name. Google them. Email them. Call them. Ask questions early. When election day comes, you can confidently cast each vote, with no abstentions, knowing exactly how they’ll use the power you’re giving them
It takes time. But when we stop using the straight ticket, maybe Indiana will send it to the dustbin where it belongs.

(Photo: Greg Childress)North Carolina housing advocates are sounding the alarm over proposed cuts to the Workforce Housing Loan Program (WHLP) administered by the N.C. Housing Finance Agency (NCHFA) in combination with federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits.
The state Senate’s version of the FY 25-27 budget does not include funding for WHLP. The House version allocates $5 million for one year of the two-year biennium. Gov. Josh Stein’s spending plan calls for $30 million in non-recurring funding for the WHLP.  The previous budget included $35 million in non-recurring program funding.

The WHLP was created to help “construct or substantially rehabilitate” multi-family affordable housing units. The money is used in combination with federal low-income housing tax credits to provide gap funding to make affordable housing development financially feasible in difficult-to-serve markets. The WHLP has financed thousands of apartments for seniors, families and members of the state’s workforce across 59 counties since it was created 10 years ago.
The proposed program cuts come as the need for affordable housing grows across the state, members of the N.C. Housing Coalition said last week.
“Without the WHLP, many developments would not be possible, especially in rural areas,” a coalition spokesperson said during its weekly housing call. “As construction and development costs continue to rise, cuts to this program could shutter much needed investments into the construction and preservation of affordable homes across the state.”
The coalition is urging housing advocates and others across the state to contact members of the House Appropriations Committee and urge them to protect and restore the WHLP to $35 million.
“This is an existing program that works, and we already know it works, and it does a really wonderful job of leveraging public funds with private dollars,” said Stephanie Watkins-Cruz, the coalition’s director of housing policy. “If there’s ever a time to not cut housing investments, this is the time.”
Watkins-Cruz noted that the program is structured so that Tier 1 counties are eligible for up to $3 million in funding. Tier 1 counties are the most economically distressed among the state’s three tiers.
Several counties in the 2025 Qualified Allocation Plan are in eastern North Carolina. Several are also on the list of disaster-impacted counties from Hurricane Helene in Western North Carolina. They include Alexander, Graham, McDowell, Mitchell, Rutherford, and Wilkes counties.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – After a long Memorial Day weekend, politicians, business professionals, lobbyists and public service workers traveled to Mackinac Island for the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce’s annual Mackinac Policy Conference, with political division intersecting at almost all points with policy goals throughout the three day event.
The conference typically features a host of panel discussions centered on economic development, education, housing, and politics at a state, national and international scale, and this year was no different as panelists pointed to concerns with Michigan’s lagging approach to education, outlined the impact  of uncertainty on tariff policies and federal funding and pointed to opportunities to build up the state’s efforts in the manufacturing and technology sector. 
While some lawmakers came together for civil discussions in line with the conference’s motif of civility and bipartisanship, political divides served as a backdrop throughout the conference, as the split Michigan Legislature remained concerned about the state budget and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan took pot shots at politicians over partisan bickering.
Although members of Michigan’s Congressional Delegation touted their ability to work together on issues affecting Michigan – like getting a new mission for Selfridge Air Force Base or protecting the Great Lakes from invasive species – the relationship among state legislative leaders was a bit more frosty.
During an annual reception ostensibly highlighting civility, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, House Speaker Matt Hall, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt and House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri spent a tense hour that served as the four leaders’ first meeting as a group debating the merits of each party’s strategy to negotiating legislation.

The back-and-forth between legislative leaders was just one example of what Duggan, who is running for governor as an independent, criticized as a broken system.
Another example: The Democratic Governors Association began running a digital ad attacking Duggan, who was a member of their party until last year, claiming he has a “long, corruption-riddled history,” just one day after Duggan spoke about the Democratic and Republican parties relying on attack ads to win their elections.
Duggan told the Michigan Advance that Democrats “are nothing if not predictable” after the ad campaign was announced.
“They hate Republicans in general, and they hate Donald Trump in particular,” Duggan said. “But today, I’ve gotten them to broaden their platform; now they hate me, too.”
“Once again, after facing the tiniest bit of scrutiny, Mike Duggan resorted to another temper tantrum by immediately lying and comparing himself to Donald Trump,” DGA Spokesperson Sam Newton said in a statement after the Michigan Advance published Duggan’s response to the ad. “Well, he’s right about one thing: both Duggan and Trump are corrupt and wrong for Michigan.”
Although some panels confronted Trump’s blunt-edged approach to diplomacy, federal funding and tariffs head on, U.S. Ambassador to Canada and former Michigan Republican Party Chair Pete Hoekstra offered an optimistic vision for the two countries’ relationship, saying they could become a global powerhouse on energy and manufacturing if they’re able to mend fences that have been stressed since Trump took office in January, proposing to implement punishing tariffs and speculating about making the sovereign nation a 51st state.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel criticized the business-as-usual approach she felt attendees were taking in their usual networking and lobbying efforts as the President works to expand his power and reshape the federal government. 
“I look around the Grand Hotel and, you know, the Mackinac policy conference, and there’s this sense that everything is normal and that everything is the same as it’s ever been, and people are negotiating with each other for different sorts of policies they want to see implemented. And yet, I don’t think they understand that anything can be undercut by the federal administration at any time,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel told the Michigan Advance on Wednesday. 
Nessel has helped file 17 different cases against the Trump Administration, challenging several policy changes including Trump’s executive order excluding certain newborns from birthright citizenship.

While several candidates for governor and U.S. Senate were present at the conference — with Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the early favorite for Democrats, making it a stop on her book tour — none got quite as much attention as Duggan, who was shown to be pulling equal amounts of support from Democrats and Republicans in a poll released last Tuesday. 
Duggan delivered a keynote address Wednesday and participated in a conversation with Rocket Mortgage founder and philanthropist Dan Gilbert on Thursday.
Speaking on another panel Thursday afternoon, April Ryan, White House Correspondent for The Grio, underscored Duggan’s arguments about partisan politics, telling Fox 2 Detroit Anchor Roop Raj Duggan’s polling shows “the system is broken.”
“Certain groups felt, that are now in power — now I’m going to say it — They felt like they weren’t heard. And the problem is we have to find a way to get everyone under the umbrella. If you get this person, I’m not going to be heard. If you get that person, I’m not — it’s such a polar opposite, and the system is broken,” Ryan said. “We’ve got to find a way to fix it. That’s why independents are on the rise, and people are listening, because people don’t feel heard. People want to feel seen.”

However, Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who launched a Democratic bid for governor in March, took the helm for several announcements, including more than $107 million to support infrastructure workforce development, $769,000 in grants to support programs aimed at reversing population decline in the state, and a $3.5 billion commitment from the state’s largest energy companies — DTE Energy and Consumers Energy — to purchase technology, equipment and services from Michigan-based businesses in support of the state’s energy manufacturing sector. 
Notably absent from the conference: U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.), who declared his candidacy for governor in April. Polling points to James as the early favorite among Republicans, compared to former Attorney General Mike Cox and Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, who are also pursuing the Republican nomination.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)While the Florida Legislature exhibits nowhere near the level of bile-spitting, brainless dysfunction you get in Washington, they haven’t exactly been a model of a sleek, responsive government machine.
For weeks, there was no budget. No hint of a budget.
Instead of getting done the one thing the Constitution says they have to get done, they’ve been indulging in that sure-fire negotiating tactic: insulting each other.
Then Friday: a trickle of white smoke emanating from the Capitol.
Habemus budget!
A budget framework, anyway.
It’s a bit short on details, other than “permanent sales tax exemptions targeted toward Florida families,” elimination of sales tax on commercial leases, and a boost to the state’s rainy-day fund.
Money for education, health care, environmental restoration, culture, roads — little stuff like that — has yet to be spelled out. Seems House and Senate leaders will be meeting this week to thrash out details and plan, they claim, to hold a vote by June 16.
Things remain contentious, and that’s not counting the wild card in the process: our congenitally angry governor.
He can veto appropriations he doesn’t like or, knowing him, appropriations he thinks his legislative enemies particularly care about.
The state budget is not yet a done deal. If it’s not passed by June 30, we could even have a government shutdown.
Thought experiment: Would you notice?
Bears might: Shuttered FWC offices could slow down final approval for bear hunting, passed by this year after passionate lobbying from the Davy Crockett Caucus.
State workers might: Their paychecks would be suspended.
Holders of state contracts might: They’ll be in limbo.
Anyone wanting to visit a state park might: The gates will be locked.
Hated Canadians
Still, most Floridians probably wouldn’t realize their government isn’t working.
It often doesn’t. Work, that is.
Instead of addressing our numerous problems, from unaffordable housing to unaffordable insurance to inflation to flooding, elected officials prefer to spend much of their time worrying about pronouns, boasting about helping Trump’s storm troopers arrest brown folks, or trying to rename the Gulf of Mexico.










Floridians don’t expect much. And not much is what we’ll get.


Floridians don’t expect much.
And not much is what we’ll get.
The Senate wanted sales tax “holidays” for clothes, tools, hurricane preparedness, and “Second Amendment Summer items,” i.e. cross bows, firearms, ammo.
The House wanted to slash state sales taxes from six percent to 5.25%.
Who knows which, and in what form, these proposals will survive the process.
The governor hates all of it. He’s been stomping around the state throwing tantrums about how lower sales taxes only help tourists and “foreigners,” railing, “I don’t want to give Canadians a tax cut.”
He might not have to worry about tax relief for those sinister Canadians much longer: They’re selling their Florida condos and taking vacations in Mexico and Portugal instead.
DeSantis’ plan? Give every homeowner a $1,000 rebate.
Then work up to abolishing property taxes altogether.
Awesome! Lower taxes! Maybe no taxes! We hate taxes, right?
Problem is, most of us love schools, sidewalks, roads, garbage pick-up, parks, police departments, fire departments, municipal pools, good drinking water, bike paths, animal shelters, electricity, and emergency medical services.
Florida cities and counties depend on taxes to fund these. The House and Senate plan will reduce the state budget by $2.25 billion.
That’s likely to hurt everybody.
‘Streamline’ destruction
No surprise. A number of measures passed this session are not exactly citizen-friendly.
One example: Given our increasingly strong hurricanes and the floods they bring, the state should encourage people to rebuild more resilient structures.
But no: A bill approved this session will block attempts to strengthen construction after storms.
The idea is to “streamline” the process (translation: Help developers who can sue if a local government institutes “burdensome or restrictive” rules) so you can build your house or your business or your school back under the same outdated codes that failed to protect it last time.
The bill also raises the price of flood insurance.
Nice, huh?
Another example: In a fit of good taste, the Senate refused to confirm some of DeSantis’ more appalling University of West Florida board nominees, including yahoos who think the GI Bill was a bad idea or that women don’t belong in higher education.
Good for them. But legislators had a chance to do even more for higher education by putting college president searches back in the sunshine where they belong.
Bills stopping the governor installing his hand-picked faith followers sailed through various committees, but in the end they were withdrawn.
Fear of a gubernatorial melt-down? Line-item vetoes of pet projects?
Presidents will still be chosen in secret subject to the whims of the governor and his tame boards of trustees.
To be fair, the Legislature did decide to forbid oil and gas drilling within 10 miles of the Apalachicola Estuarine Reserve, and passed a bill to shield state parks from the kind of boneheaded nonsense the governor wanted in 2024: You know, “improving” the parks with golf courses, pickleball courts, and luxury hotels.
Why can’t we have nice things?
DeSantis actually realized (for once) he’d screwed up big time last year and signed the bill.
This year, he demonstrated he hadn’t quite learned his lesson.
A secretive outfit calling itself Upland LLC wanted the state to give it 600 acres of preservation lands on the Guana River in St. Johns County in exchange for 3,000 acres of non-contiguous, less environmentally significant property scattered around four counties.
Apparently, that swap sounded good to DeSantis. The state Acquisition and Restoration Council served up a report claiming there was nothing special about the Guana River land, no historic sites, no amazing habitat, nothing like that — never mind the ancient Native American shell middens, wood storks, roseate spoonbills, and old oak hammocks — and rushed the required public comment meeting.
Genuine Floridians (the ones their government ignores) rose up on their hind legs and said hell, no. Loudly.
Upland, its feelings hurt, pulled out of the deal — no thanks to DeSantis and his Department of Environmental Prostitution.
Why, you ask, is this state so self-defeating?
Or, to put it another way, why can’t we have nice things?
Florida has one of the most regressive taxation systems in the country, what the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy calls an “upside down” model. The rich pay a far smaller percentage of their income than the middle classes and the poor.
If the state decides to deprive itself — us — of tax dollars, we will all suffer.
Florida’s social safety net is already tattered.
Twenty percent of children live in poverty. The state ranks 40th in child health and 45th in economic well-being.
Children don’t vote
You’d think lawmakers would figure out helping to feed, educate, and take care of children is worth the money: Healthy, educated people contribute to the economy.
But children don’t vote. Or write big fat campaign checks.
It’s bad enough our so-called representatives can’t do their jobs in a timely manner and must keep coming back for special sessions to decide which taxes to cut and by how much while simultaneously costing the taxpayer around $50,000 every day they hang around in Tallahassee.
The governor, the most mobility impaired of waterfowl, his political career in the dumpster, his wife’s charity under investigation for possible money laundering, still wants to abolish property taxes.
Maybe he thinks that will give him a nice slogan to run for president on if we have an election in 2028.
The Legislature wants to curry favor with their voters by giving them a break on stuff they buy.
Everybody loves a bargain, right?
But it’s not much of a bargain if your quality of life goes to hell.
Cities and counties are staring into the abyss, wondering how they’ll fund everything citizens expect.
School roofs won’t be repaired, parks won’t be maintained, bad water pipes won’t be fixed, new cops won’t be hired, EMS will be cut, potholes will proliferate.
But hey, it’s a small price to pay for a sales tax break on batteries and backpacks, right?",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FLCapitolIMG_0045-1536x1152-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

They should also hear from […]","GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs, and Kauffman Stadium, home of the Kansas City Royals, are pictured on Feb. 8 (Anna Spoerre/The Missouri Independent).As the Missouri legislature begins its special session to consider, among other things, taxpayer subsidies for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals, lawmakers are hearing from a parade of stakeholders — Gov. Mike Kehoe, policy analysts, lobbyists, activists and the many special interests who stand to gain from the deal.
They should also hear from the two individuals who stand to benefit most: Royals owner John Sherman and Chiefs owner Clark Hunt. These men should appear before the Missouri House and Senate to explain why taxpayer subsidies of this scale are justified. Anything less short-circuits public accountability.
During a March 2024 debate ahead of the Jackson County vote on funding a new downtown stadium, I was asked if I’d ever met Sherman. I hadn’t, though KCPBS invited Sherman to participate. His office declined every offered date.
On April 2, Jackson County voters rejected the stadium-tax extension by a decisive 58% to 42%. Their position was clear: no blank checks, no vague promises. If legislators now move forward with a $300 million bond package without in-person testimony from the owners, they risk replicating the same lack of transparency voters already rejected.
The current proposal would authorize hundreds of millions in public bonds, yet these franchises are far from lacking resources. Forbes values the Chiefs at $4.85 billion and the Royals at $1.3 billion. When billion-dollar teams request public subsidies, their owners should answer for the proposal, in person.
Key facts remain unknown: where the Royals would build, what share of costs the teams would cover, and how much the Royals would spend on the stadium itself versus adjacent commercial ventures. As in Jackson County, taxpayers are being asked to commit before the teams do. That sequence—public commitment before private investment — betrays the principles of responsible budgeting.
Until these facts are disclosed on the record, the proposal’s benefits remain impossible to assess.
Kehoe has cited the teams’ economic impact to justify the session. his justification is a familiar one — and often misleading. A 2017 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis brief warned that many stadium impact studies “fail to include opportunity costs,” noting that spending inside an arena often displaces spending elsewhere in the local economy.
Bipartisan resistance building against Missouri governor’s stadium funding plan

That displaced spending often supports a wider variety of small businesses and contributes more reliably to public revenue through sales, property, and income taxes. By contrast, revenue from stadium-centric development tends to concentrate in the hands of franchise owners.
Kehoe also cited claims from the Royals projecting 8,400 jobs, $400 million in annual labor income, and $1.2 billion in economic output. These numbers were distributed to lawmakers just before the regular session ended. They lack independent review and should be treated accordingly.
These Missouri figures also echo broader trends. Independent research shows stadium subsidies rarely yield significant economic gains. In Nevada, legislators approved $750 million in public funds for the Raiders in 2016. Clark County now estimates total public costs ballooned to $1.35 billion—nearly double the original allocation. In New York, the new Bills stadium is projected to cost taxpayers more than $1.1 billion. Missouri lawmakers should hear why this case will be different.
A 2023 study published by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management explains why so many of these projections fall short. The authors—John Bradbury, Dennis Coates and Brad Humphreys—found that reports sponsored by teams or developers often use inflated multipliers, unrealistic assumptions, and conflate gross and net impacts.
Missouri senators should examine how the Royals’ numbers were generated—and how they remain so precise without a confirmed stadium site.
There is clear precedent for having owners testify. In 1997, Twins owner Carl Pohlad testified before a joint Minnesota House–Senate panel to press for a cigarette-tax-backed ballpark package. Vikings owner Zygi Wilf followed suit in 2006, fielding committee questions on the state-county deal that became U.S. Bank Stadium. And in 2016, Raiders owner Mark Davis appeared in Carson City to urge Nevada lawmakers to approve a $750 million hotel-tax subsidy for Allegiant Stadium—a commitment that will cost Clark County about $1.1 billion with interest over 30 years. Missouri can—and should—demand the same level of transparency and accountability.
Bradbury and colleagues put it plainly: “Professional sports venues generate limited economic and social benefits, which fall far short of the large public subsidies they typically receive.” These deals often amount to transfers of public wealth to private entities.
Redirecting even a portion of this investment to infrastructure, education, or health would likely yield more durable benefits for Missouri families.
Let’s not forget that merely considering these subsidies is a financial burden. The costs of convening a special session are real. The Jackson County election, demanded by the teams, cost local taxpayers roughly $1 million.
Before approving any subsidy, senators should secure clear, on-the-record answers:

What is the private-capital commitment, in dollars?
Who is responsible for covering overruns?
What is the expected net new revenue, after substitution effects?
What milestones—site control, zoning, environmental review—must precede bond issuance?
Are there claw-back or profit-sharing provisions if forecasts fall short?
What is the long-term plan for demolition or reuse once the stadium reaches end-of-life?

It is not unreasonable to expect Sherman and Hunt to explain their request for public funds in person. If the governor can meet with them behind closed doors, the House and Senate—and the public—deserve that same access, in open session.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020925Arrowhead2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

Exactly how much is uncertain. The review by Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, estimates it will be at least $170 million and could be as much as $429 million if state lawmakers pass tax cuts that mirror provisions in the legislation approved in the U.S. House.
Dylan Grundman O’Neill, senior state tax policy analyst at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said Walczak’s estimate is sound. O’Neill said he is working to estimate how much Missouri’s revenues would be reduced further from the bill’s increase in the limit on the itemized deduction for state and local taxes.
Cuts to food aid endorsed by Congressional GOP could cost Missouri $400 million

The potential reduction in state revenue caused by federal changes, coupled with the new exemption for capital gains income and expanded property tax credit for some retirees and people with disabilities passed by the Missouri legislature earlier this year, could cause the coming fiscal year to be the fourth in a row where revenue growth does not keep up with inflation.
And the prospect that those federal tax changes and state tax cuts will put the squeeze on Missouri’s budget hangs like a shadow over the legislature as it reconvenes this week to consider whether to set aside almost $1.4 billion in state taxes over the next 30 years to finance professional sports stadiums in Kansas City
“We know the state budget years ahead are going to be challenging, and the amount of general revenue that we have is something that I’m taking very seriously as a businessman, and what it’s going to take in future years,” said Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe.
The state budget for the coming fiscal year, awaiting action by Kehoe, would spend $15.8 billion in general revenue while collections are estimated at $13.6 billion. The budget’s draw on the state’s surplus and uncertainty about future collections is why a spending bill also on the special session agenda has only $50 million more in general revenue, Kehoe said last week.
 Federal impacts

Missouri’s state income tax is linked to the federal tax system. The state tax form starts with the adjusted gross income calculated on the federal return and grants filers the same standard deduction.
The approximately 10% of taxpayers who itemize deductions are allowed to keep most of what they report to the IRS and add some deductions for Social Security and other payroll taxes.
The bill approved by the U.S. House includes a temporary $1,000 increase for the federal standard deduction, $15,000 for single filers this year. That would reduce Missouri revenue by about $124 million, Walczak said.
The new deduction for interest on motor vehicle loans would be added to the federal form in a way that reduces the adjusted gross income amount. That change is estimated to reduce state revenue by $46 million, he said.
“They’re putting that above the line there,” he said. “I don’t understand why. I don’t think anyone knows why they choose to do it this way.”
It would require action by state lawmakers to reverse the effect, Walczak said.
“A state could choose to have a modification where they add back the subtracted amount for auto loans, but they would have to choose to do that,” he said.
For most taxpayers, income derived from tips and overtime would be exempt from the income tax entirely. Like reversing the auto loan deduction, making Missouri law mirror that benefit would have to be done by the legislature, Walczak said.
The two exemptions would reduce Missouri state revenues by about $259 million.
“We put those numbers there because there are states that are saying that they want to follow the federal government and exempt tips and overtime,” he said. “So we wanted to show what it would cost if they did that.” 
The change in the $10,000 cap on the deduction for state and local taxes to $40,000 is one of the hardest pieces of the federal bill to estimate, O’Neill said. 
Federal Medicaid cuts could leave Missouri with huge budget shortfall

Before the cap was put in place by Congress in 2017, more than 30% of taxpayers itemized their deductions. When the standard deduction was doubled — and when mortgage loan rates were low — the rate of itemizers plummeted.
The deduction covers state and local income and property taxes. Missouri’s current tax forms subtract state income tax payments from the amount claimed, for those under the cap, allowing the rest.
Itemizers who claim the maximum calculate the share of the tax payments that come from income tax, and subtraction a pro-rated amount from the $10,000 limit.
For example, the owner of a home in Columbia that the assessor appraises at $1.5 million pays just under $20,000 in property taxes. If income taxes are 90% of the total state and local taxes included on that person’s federal form, the owner would retain a $1,000 deduction for their state return under current law.
With the cap increased to $40,000, the taxpayer would retain a $4,000 deduction. The net effect on state taxes would be a $141 cut for that taxpayer.
“The more the congressional bill raises that cap, the more relevant that provision becomes for states,” O’Neill said. “Missouri is one of the states that has relatively high exposure to that change because of its rolling conformity to the federal tax code.”
The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that Missouri taxpayers would see their federal tax bills drop by $9.1 billion, with more than one-fifth of that total going to the 1% of Missouri taxpayers who have an income greater than $689,300.
Filers in that group would receive an average tax cut of $58,490. 
Taxpayers in the lowest 40% of filers would receive one-twentieth of the tax cuts under the bill.
The new costs imposed by the bill include a possible $400 million annually to maintain the food benefits program known as SNAP. Missouri would have to pick up an estimated 25% of the cost of providing the aid because Missouri’s error rate on payments was 10% in 2023, which would mean the highest cost share.
 State financial picture

Missouri will end the current fiscal year with an unobligated general revenue balance of $2.6 billion, the state budget office estimated when Kehoe’s spending proposal was released in January.
Even after spending $1 billion of the accumulated balance, it is historically large and almost $900 million more than was predicted a year earlier. Two factors played into that increase — revenues in fiscal 2024 that were almost $300 million more than anticipated and a gap between budgeted amounts and actual costs, mainly due to understaffing.
Kehoe’s January budget anticipates the surplus would fall to $1.4 billion by the end of the coming fiscal year in June 2026. 
In the coming special session, Kehoe will be under pressure to allow more money to be spent in the appropriations bill. 
“I don’t believe that it’s the government or the state’s job to accumulate a billion dollars to look at in the bank,” said state Sen. Lincoln Hough, the Springfield Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. “I agree with a healthy reserve. I’m fine with that. But this billion and a half dollars that we have sitting in the bank while we’ve got hospitals that are closing down and child care facilities that need support… it’s the whole list of projects.”
There should be some allowance for lawmakers to add items to the bill, he said.
“I’m not naive enough to think we’re going to put together a $513 million capital improvements package and drop that,” Hough said.
The budget revenue estimate made in December anticipates a slight decline in revenue in the current year and a slight increase in the coming year. 
That estimate was made before lawmakers passed the tax cut worth about $285 million in the coming year by official estimates but forecast to be much more by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, supports the legislation to keep the Chiefs and Royals in the state. She also said there should be more for the appropriations bill.
“We need to be concerned about where we’re spending our dollars, but I also think that we have to be doing it responsibly,” Aune said.
But she is also concerned about the revenue impact of the federal budget bill and the tax cut awaiting action from Kehoe.
“We are in a position right now where we are seeing revenues dwindling,” Aune said. “With everything that has been passed recently, it has the potential to put Missouri in a much more difficult position.”

Community members and staff advocate against losing the midwife-led center they say is a pillar of the region.

Photo by Kristen Fountain/VTDiggerWhen rumors about closing the Copley Hospital Birthing Center started to circulate last year, Sarah Chouinard, the president of the hospital’s nurses union, and many of her colleagues thought they were just that: rumors.“There have always been cycles of this threat of closure,” she said. “But we’ve been protected because of community public relations and the service we provide for the community.” Then, one of the hospital’s four midwives scaled back her hours to work on an as-needed basis. The hospital initially made no plan to hire a replacement, then posted the job, found a good candidate but never made the hire. The other three midwives grew suspicious. Chouinard also began emailing Copley President Joe Woodin, similarly seeking clarity: Were these just more rumors swirling around the birthing center? Would her nurses need to worry about being reassigned? She said she got no response.“The more that was not said, the more we knew what was happening,” Chouinard said. In March 2025, the Morristown hospital announced it was launching a comprehensive review of the birthing center to explore closing or expanding its operations. Those were the options suggested by a landmark report published by a state-hired consulting firm last year that outlined radical changes needed to make the health care system in Vermont more accessible and affordable. Hospital leadership said it does not plan to make a decision until a consultant hired to do the review submits its recommendations, which are expected in mid-June. The hospital’s associated Women’s Center, which hosts gynecological and obstetric care, is slated to remain open, regardless of the hospital’s decision on the birthing center, according to hospital spokesperson Barbara Walls.Still, the threat of losing such a beloved center has left the community incensed.Supporters of the birthing center quickly created an online petition, which has garnered more than 2,500 signatures. Advocates hosted a Mother’s Day rally in support of the center, peppered their yards with lawn signs, and wrote countless letters to the hospital and public in hopes of underscoring just how great a loss the closure of the Copley Hospital Birthing Center would be for Lamoille County. The public outcry reached such a boiling point that Copley decided to postpone its annual Stowe Art Wine & Food Fundraiser over concerns about a planned protest at the event.READ MORE
The midwife modelAdvocates argue the closure of the birthing center would not only leave the community without a local place for delivery, but it would also jeopardize what patients and providers consider to be a model for midwife-driven care.When a pregnant patient comes to the center, a midwife leads their prenatal visits and development of the birthing plan. The clinic’s two OB-GYNs are part of that broader care team but only become hands-on with a patient’s care if there is a need — like gestational diabetes or hemorrhaging in birth, Kopas said. “It’s a different approach that puts the pregnant person at the center of decision making,” said Mary Lou Kopas, one of Copley’s three full-time nurse midwives. “(The model) looks at pregnancy and birth and breastfeeding as normal physiologic processes and not medical emergencies waiting to happen.”She said the approach also centers “shared decision making,” where the provider takes time to listen to the patient’s specific needs, lifestyle and circumstances in forming a birthing plan. “It’s not a one size fits all,” she said.Patients believe that this approach is what’s made their experiences so positive.“It’s such a special place. It’s the only time that I’ve had an interaction with the medical system where I left that interaction feeling like I was treated with dignity and respect,” said Eva Zaret, a public health specialist who had both her children — a 3-year-old and a 9-month-old — at Copley.Zaret said she had a history of managing an eating disorder and had intense anxiety about gaining weight during pregnancy.When Zaret began explaining her worries, the midwife walked her through the possible alternatives, and “then the midwife just put down everything,” Zaret said. “And she just looked at me, and said, ‘What do you need?’” Zaret told her she didn’t want to be weighed at her appointments, to which the midwife simply said “OK.” That was it. The birthing center also scores highly on one important marker of high-quality birthing care: Copley often cites that it has one of the lowest rates of C-section births in the state. At Copley 1 in about every 10 births is a C-section delivery, Kopas said, while nationally, that rate is closer to 1 in every 3. Part of that low rate, however, may be due to the fact that Copley is only able to accept low-risk pregnancies. Midwifery care has been associated with fewer preterm births, reduced labor interventions, and lower maternal and infant death and illness, as various control trials and observational studies have shown. “I think that Copley should be held up as a model — beyond just ‘you should have (this) many midwives on for this many hours.’ People should go shadow and see ‘how do I talk to a patient? What does it really mean to be trauma informed? Or, what does it really mean to be patient centered?’” Zaret said.Paying for pregnancy When the consulting firm Oliver Wyman issued its report in September 2024, outlining ways to improve Vermont’s health care system, it recommended developing more regional “centers of excellence” for specialized care. For Copley, the report suggested scaling up to become a regional center of excellence for orthopedics. The report did not identify Copley as one of the four hospitals where major restructuring would be needed to stay afloat. The report, and thus Copley’s review, is part of a bigger push to scale back ballooning healthcare costs in the state.“Our health system is experiencing an intense cost crisis, and also an access crisis,” said Brendan Krause, the director of health care reform at the state’s Agency of Human Services. “We’re seeing the cost crisis not just in hospitals, but also with our state regulated insurance market — which doesn’t just mean more, higher premiums for individuals and businesses. It also means it is more expensive to create jobs; property taxes go up.” “I would say this (review) is very much aligned with what a state has asked them to do. And, I would trust the hospital and the board to review the data and listen to their community and make the decision, according to the best information they have,” Krause added. Delivery nurses and midwives expressed frustration that there was little communication with their department about how to make the center more profitable. In late May, the board met with some of the midwives and providers to collect their input on how to close or expand, something providers had long been asking for. They and other stakeholder groups have been given an hour of time to share these ideas, observations and questions with the consultant.Copley says the birthing center operates at a loss of $3 million to $5 million annually. Because commercial insurance rate increases are approved annually by the Green Mountain Care Board, a statewide health care regulator, Copley has been limited in what it can charge and how quickly it can increase those charges. As a result, currently, the hospital bills private insurers around $7,000 for a low-intervention, vaginal birth, while other large hospitals charge more than twice that number.“Our costs are fixed. We do not have the ability to change those costs,” said Barbara Walls, the hospital’s spokesperson. When the Green Mountain Care Board set commercial insurance price increase rates in September, Copley pushed for an 11.8% increase in costs, Walls said. The board trimmed that request significantly to 3.4%, a rate increase that all hospitals were required to stay at or below. The board allowed Copley a total of 15% increase in commercial rates the previous fiscal year — 8% in September 2023 and an emergency additional 7% in April 2024.Kopas and her colleagues see room for the program to draw in more money without raising costs: “I do think there is capacity to grow this program — could easily do 10% more births without increasing staffing,” Kopas added. One way of doing that, she and others suggested, would be to put a satellite prenatal clinic in Waterbury, where the hospital has recently expanded its orthopedic services. It would allow them to catch a larger array of patients right off Route 89, Kopas said.Still, Walls said that an expansion and upgrade to the birthing facilities may not directly correlate with an increase in patients and revenue. Walls said 42% of the births in Lamoille County occur at the hospital.“That’s 58% (of births) that are not happening at Copley,” she said. Part of that may be due to the fact that Copley can only accept low-risk pregnancies. Anyone who might need a Newborn Intensive Care Unit gets referred elsewhere, usually, to University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington.The hospital often cites low birth rates, which the Wyman report highlighted, as a reason to close the facility. The report identified a low volume of deliveries as a reason for the hospital either to “grow or shift birthing to other organizations.”The report set a threshold of 240 births a year, as sufficient to offset the costs of running birthing operations. Copley has been well under that number since 2010, with birthing center deliveries landing between 160 to 200 a year. Since 2018, those levels have plateaued around 160 births a year. North Country Hospital in Newport and Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital in St. Johnsbury, both of which draw from regions that overlap with Copley’s service area, also had birth volumes beneath the Wyman report threshold. Kopas interpreted the data differently, saying birth rates have remained steady and that this year’s due-dates are on track to keep the hospital in the same ballpark. Plus, Lamoille County is growing, she said.Walls questioned whether that growth would make a difference.“Yes, Lamoille County is growing, but is it growing with people who are planning on having additional children?” she said. “And would they be planning on having those children here?”When Kim Horne and her husband were looking to buy a house in Morrisville in early 2020, their real estate agent highlighted the house’s proximity to Copley and its birthing center. “Like a lot of our friends who have also recently moved to the area, we were looking to start a family,” she said. In January 2024, she had her first child at Copley and is planning on giving birth to her second child there next month. Community care Many stress the importance of the fact that Copley is a community hospital as one of its great selling points — both because of the proximity it gives patients and the staff’s connection to the county. “It’s a community, and there’s even a family feel to it,” Chouinard said. “You realize you start taking care of generations of people – of babies’ babies.” Chouinard grew up in North Wolcott, went to Stowe High School and then the University of Vermont. She started her career at Copley before becoming a travel nurse, and in 2011 she returned to Copley and has stayed there ever since. “I was so excited to really take my skills and experience and do something here at home,” she said.To patients, that community investment shows. “I think you could take any OB unit at a hospital, and you could staff it up with a 24/7 midwifery model, and you wouldn’t get what Copley has,” Zaret said. “They have worked very intentionally for a long time to create a culture there that really values their patients.” Moreover, many worry about what the absence of a local place to give birth will mean for patients. “That’s going to be a mess,” Chouinard said. “Ambulances don’t want to deliver babies, ERs don’t want to deliver babies. There are a lot of ‘what-ifs’ (to risks associated with birth) but we’re supposed to be here for the ‘what ifs.’”Others worry that closing the birthing center would decrease prenatal visits — though Walls stressed that its Women’s Center will remain unaffected. Patients will still be able to access their pre and post natal care at Copley. Horne, who is eight months pregnant with her second child, worries about what any additional travel might mean for patients before they give birth. Her first baby was head down, but flipped, before she went into labor. “It was excruciating,” she said. “I couldn’t put any pressure on my pelvis or my lower back whatsoever. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t sit, and when a contraction would happen, and I was seated in the car, even just for the tiniest commute, I was like lifting myself up in my seat,” she said, adding that having to make a longer drive “would have been dire.”But to her, a community hospital represents more than just drivetimes. It’s about the investment a hospital has in its patients’ care, beyond profits.“I’m not trying to be harsh or anything, but (if you close your birthing center), you can’t really call yourself a community hospital anymore because that’s such a vital pillar of a community,” she said. Walls said that the hospital knows that and is taking this to heart. “We understand that this is very emotional. It’s a deeply human process of birthing and creating new families, and we understand and respect that,” she said. “That being said, the temperature has gone up higher and higher, the more we have been forthcoming and transparent and acting from a place of integrity, the more we have received suspicion.”For now, the hospital and its community members are in a holding pattern until the consultant’s report returns with recommended paths of action. Still, Kopas sees the low monetary value placed on midwifery care and birthing in general as part of a deeper systemic issue. “Why is care that is essential to people with a womb an expendable portion of care?” she asked. “I mean, this is primary care for women and other childbearing people. This is essential care. So why is it expendable? That just angers me. I see it in a bigger picture of misogyny in our culture. Why is this care not reimbursed at the value?” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Copley Hospital weighs closing its birthing center amid statewide effort to curb health care costs.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Copley-Birthing-Center-Morrisville-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 07:11:18.948199

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) thanked Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for being willing to meet and negotiate with President Donald Trump.
“The governor is trying to do what’s right for Michigan,” Dingell said. “She went in there and got a mission for Selfridge Air Force Base, which we, quite frankly, fought for for four years.”
“And thank you, Donald Trump, for delivering a mission to Macomb County, we need that,” Dingell added.

U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) joked that “we’re going to cut and snip that one.”
Huizenga similarly praised Whitmer as leading the fight for the Brandon Road Lock and Dam to protect the Great Lakes from invasive species.
He said the Great Lakes are an example of an issue where almost everyone in the Midwest can agree and work together, noting that Dingell is a Democratic co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, along with Ohio U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, also a Democrat.
“My joke is with Marcy Kaptur, she and I would struggle to agree that today is Thursday in most instances, but we are lockstep when it comes to Great Lakes funding,” Huizenga said.

Huizenga said he and Dingell have co-signed several letters related to the Great Lakes, including one to the Office of Management and Budget requesting full funding for related projects.
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) disagreed with an assertion that the Democratic base is frustrated with elected Democrats working with Republicans.
“Even in this climate, in Congress, there are many bills that we see Democratic and Republican votes on, and I don’t feel ostracized by my party in doing that,” McDonald Rivet said. “I work for the people of the Eighth District, and I actually think working in a bipartisan way is what helped me overperform in almost every single precinct of the district.”

But Huizenga said he does get criticized by other Republicans for working with Democrats.
“I’ve had people say, ‘Hey, you shouldn’t even be talking to those people,’” Huizenga said. “And my reply to them is, well, if we’re not talking, how are we supposed to figure out whether we agree on 5%, 15% or 50%?”
“You might not be able to picture yourself interfacing with these folks, but guess what? That’s my job. I have to,” Huizenga added.

The proposed contract between UF and Ono includes a $1.5 million base salary for serving as president, $500,000 for serving as UF Health chair, more than $400,000 in annual performance bonuses, and another half-a-million in retirement contributions and retention payments.
Despite unanimous approval by UF trustees, Ono’s presidency is being protested by some Republicans, while Gov. Ron DeSantis says he is leaving it up to the board he appointed to make the right decision.
Tuesday, the 17-member Board of Governors will vote on Ono, who received unanimous approval from UF trustees last week. He is the sole finalist for the position.
“I appointed all those folks, so they’ll make the judgement,” DeSantis said of the Board of Governors’ final vote.
Former Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, and U.S. Rep. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds have publicly questioned Ono’s candidacy, as has Donald Trump Jr., who took to X to express his feelings on the candidate.
“WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!??? This woke psycho might be a perfect fit for a Communist school in California, but how is he even being considered for this role in Florida?” Trump Jr. posted Wednesday. “Every single member of the Florida Board of Governors should vote against him!!!”
Ono supported diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in his previous job as president of the University of Michigan, guiding its “DEI 2.0” initiative and touting benefits of such programs but ultimately closed DEI offices earlier this year. Some Republicans question the legitimacy of Ono’s new-found anti-DEI convictions.
“Now people have pointed out a lot of statements that he has made that are not exactly what we’re looking for in a state where woke goes to die and I cringe at some of these statements,” DeSantis said Thursday, during a news conference in Fort Myers about medical negligence.
“But basically, I think the folks that were involved in the search, after having interviewed him, spent time with him, it’s their judgement that he’s really kind of reached the limit on the campus leftism and he would want to leave Michigan where that’s prevalent to Florida where it’s frowned upon,” DeSantis said.
Ono told trustees that he developed his new stance on DEI in the last year and a half after talking with students and other members of the university community. Before, he wasn’t an expert on the topic, which had been universal in higher education, he said.
Florida Republicans and President Donald Trump’s administration have focused heavily on removing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives from higher education, including banning state expenditures on such initiatives.
“He will lose his job” if he promotes “a fountain of activism or leftist indoctrination,” DeSantis said.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho health officials say it’ll take years to switch all Idaho Medicaid benefits to being managed by private companies.
Through a sweeping bill meant to cut Medicaid costs, the Idaho Legislature this year directed the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to change a range of Medicaid policies — including to pursue switching Medicaid benefits to being run by private companies.
That model, called managed care, is used widely across the country. 
Right now, Idaho Medicaid already uses managed care  — somewhat. But it’s more of a patchwork approach, where some services are managed by the state health department, some by managed care organizations, and some by doctors’ offices. 
Shifting Idaho Medicaid to managed care will take time to do well, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron told a panel of state lawmakers late last month.
  Idaho Medicaid administrator Juliet Charron testified before the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on House Bill 345 on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare expects the new comprehensive Idaho Medicaid managed care contract to start in 2029, following years of prep work, she told the Idaho Legislature’s Medicaid Review Panel on May 22.
“We have been evaluating all of the different scenarios and timelines under which we could implement this — looking at it as early as 2027 or 2028 — and have determined” that going much earlier is risky, Charron said. “Because you’re going to start to have pieces overlapping throughout this. And that will be particularly challenging for our provider communities.”
Medicaid is a largely federally funded health care assistance program that covers about 260,000 Idahoans, including low-income earners, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and some older people. Roughly 92,000 Idahoans are enrolled in Medicaid expansion, a voter-approved policy that raised the income eligibility cap.

 Medicaid work requirements could come under new law

Idaho governor signs bill to privatize management, add work requirements to Medicaid program

The new Idaho Medicaid cost cutting bill also called for Idaho to seek federal approval for Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied adults. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare plans to apply for that by July 2026.
The federal spending and tax cut bill being considered by Congress might ease the process for Idaho to seek Medicaid work requirements. 
Instead of applying for a Medicaid waiver that could temporarily allow for work requirements, Idaho could seek a longer-lasting state plan amendment for Medicaid work requirements — if the federal bill becomes law, Charron said. (The bill would require nationwide Medicaid work requirements years later. After passing the U.S. House, it heads to the Senate, where changes are expected.)
Other states’ experiences and a federal watchdog report suggest costs for Medicaid work requirements are high, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Since almost half of Idahoans on Medicaid are already working, some advocates say work requirements are effectively just expensive administrative barriers to access the program. 
 Idaho Medicaid’s management is split up. A new contract would replace existing ones. 

Overall, only 6% of Idaho Medicaid enrollees are in comprehensive managed care — the roughly 27,000 Idahoans dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, Idaho Idaho Medicaid Deputy Administrator Sasha O’Connell told the legislative panel.

Idaho’s existing Medicaid managed care contracts mostly carve out private management for certain benefits, like mental health, medical transportation and dental.
That split makes it complicated for the state to oversee, O’Connell said. 
“What this has led to is we have particularly high turnover, I would say, in state agencies. And I think that that happens in Medicaid as well,” she said. 
The various contracts have put Idaho Medicaid’s limited staff in a cycle of “amending these contracts constantly,” she said, instead of putting the contracts up for a new competitive bid, a process called procurement.
“Because procurement is such a huge lift,” O’Connell said.
Idaho is also on track to end doctors’ offices managing Medicaid benefits next year, Charron told lawmakers. The new Idaho Medicaid cost cutting bill called for the end of that model, called value-based care, which is unique to Idaho and has existed for a few years.

The new Idaho Medicaid managed care contract is likely to become the biggest contract given out by the state of Idaho.
Idaho’s contract for the company Magellan to run mental health Medicaid benefits is already the state’s largest contract, initially pegged at $1.4 billion over four years.

Like under Idaho Medicaid’s first managed care mental health organization, Idaho Medicaid providers have reported payment delays from Magellan, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.
Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, raised that issue to Idaho health officials.
“You’re saying, I’m getting reports back from the (managed care organization), and they’re saying, ‘Everything is great. All of our providers are happy. They’re loving it,’” Cook said. “‘That’s like asking the fox, … ‘How’s the hen house?’”
 Idaho’s new managed care contract slated to go to three companies

Idaho’s existing managed care contracts will be phased out for the broader contract to come.
Idaho Medicaid mental health contractor hires three state government employees

“Idaho is a very large state. But our health care infrastructure is somewhat limited. And people access health care all over the state. Frequently, we are sending Medicaid participants to different parts of the state, based on the service that they need,” Charron said.
The new contract will task three different managed care organizations to run Idaho Medicaid benefits, for a few reasons, she explained, like: 

Federal requirements for Medicaid enrollees to have choice under managed care;
Creating competition between companies to drive efficiencies; and
Redundancy, in case a plan terminates.

Before Idaho launches the new managed care contract, Idaho has a lot of preparation to do, state health officials say. Like engaging stakeholders, seeking out more information and contracting out for actuarial services, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), a new enrollment broker for Medicaid enrollees to pick managed care plans, and Idaho Medicaid’s information system.

Income tax cuts. Creation of business courts. Four new appointees to the State Board of Education. Stopping the education department’s effort to collect information on students’ citizenship. Extending the school year by a day. Banning cellphones in schools. Largely ending virtual school days. Flat agency budgets.
Check. Check. And more checks.
These victories represent an amazing turn of events for the governor, who year after year, has seen some of his major policy priorities — like calls to cut taxes — stymied by fellow Republicans. In prior years he employed one of the few tools a governor has in the Legislature: forcing lawmakers to return to the Capitol to reconsider his top agenda items during special sessions. But his efforts were futile, and those useless special sessions wasted taxpayer dollars with little to show.
In fact, Stitt was so pleased with this session’s outcomes, he said last week he doesn’t see a reason to call a special session.
Lawmakers, meanwhile, sat mutely for days as Stitt vetoed their bills or insulted their priorities. 
As of Thursday morning – the second-to-last day of session – the governor had vetoed nearly 70 bills, the majority of which were authored by Republicans. He also let an astounding number of bills — over 300 at last count — passively take effect without his signature. When asked about his decision to not sign bills, Stitt said those are the measures that he doesn’t “think are going to move the needle.” He also said the people think it’s “super weird” that there are over 500 new laws proposed each year.
This is the same governor who vetoed measures that increase women’s access to breast cancer screening or that aim to improve Oklahomans’ access to the public records. 
But later Thursday, lawmakers suddenly emerged from their self-imposed supporting role and spent the final full day of session criticizing the governor’s decisions. 
Against Stitt’s wishes, they took the rare step of firing his commissioner of mental health after the agency’s finances fell into disarray. Allie Friesen’s removal marked one of their final actions and sent a clear sign that the honeymoon is apparently over and it might be a rocky interim.
They also overrode nearly four dozen of Stitt’s vetoes, including the breast cancer and public transparency measures.
But it was too little too late. Stitt astutely took advantage of the legislative power vacuum that existed for most of the session to flex his muscles.
Republican lawmakers seemingly wandered into session with no large-scale priorities of their own, and even the House speaker acknowledged early Friday that Stitt had emerged from session with what he wanted.
Stitt’s clear goals must have been a much needed beacon for a rudderless Republican legislative caucus led by new leadership trying to gain their footing and rein in state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
Walters, by the way, was the session’s biggest loser amid a meteoric fall from grace and the end of his storied bromance with Stitt. The two men found themselves exchanging escalating verbal jabs over the path forward for public schools. 
Stitt fired the three education board members that backed Walters, and after closed door budget negotiations, lawmakers revealed that they’d rejected most of Walters’ budget requests, including spending $3 million on Bibles. Lawmakers also dealt Walters’ citizenship collection rule the coup de grace.
But whether the 2025 “Stitt Show” will go down in infamy or herald a renaissance remains to be seen. One thing is for sure, this session will certainly be the one that defines Stitt’s legacy in years to come.
Only time will tell if he’s remembered as the ultimate champ or biggest chump.

(Photo by Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything.
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson rode out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property.
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.
Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: The Trump administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities, which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.
 Cave City pushes forward

Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.
Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City.
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”
 FEMA politics

Over the past two years, the Biden administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020.
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance.
In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.
John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: The federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo-ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold.
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.
Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.
Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said.
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing … they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

Water protection group drops challenge to dome tents’ sewerage permit while state lands controversy still swirls around Casper gravel pit.
The post Last legal challenge to Teton glamping hotel ends appeared first on WyoFile .","A water protection group in Jackson Hole removed the last challenge to a temporary glamping operation on state land near Teton Village on Thursday.
Protect Our Water Jackson Hole filed papers with the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council withdrawing its appeal of a controversial sewage system permit. The group had challenged the Department of Environmental Quality’s permit allowing the canvas-dome hotel, owned by Basecamp Hospitality and known as Tammah, to operate a septic tank and leach field at the headwaters of troubled Fish Creek.
The withdrawal came after the Supreme Court ruled in April that the group could not sue to rescind the permit. “It didn’t make sense to continue down a path that had already been litigated as one in which we didn’t have adequate standing,” said Phil Powers, executive director for the group.
Protect our Water’s action followed another Wyoming Supreme Court decision on April 24 that Teton County could not impose its development regulations on Tammah. Conclusion of the two protests ends the immediate legal conflicts over the hotel that offers 11 posh fabric-covered geodesic domes with online rates topping $800 a night.
“Basecamp is proud to continue its partnership with the State in offering a one-of-a-kind, sustainable resort experience in Wyoming.” Chris Hawks
“All legal challenges and regulatory claims — brought by environmental organizations and raised by Teton County — have now been fully resolved in Basecamp’s favor, including POWJH’s recent voluntary dismissal of its appeal regarding the DEQ permit,” Basecamp attorney Chris Hawks said in an emailed statement. “With these matters behind them, Basecamp is proud to continue its partnership with the State in offering a one-of-a-kind, sustainable resort experience in Wyoming.”
Before Protect our Water withdrew its appeal, the Wyoming Supreme Court rejected Teton County’s challenge to the five-year temporary use permit, citing state laws.
The Wyoming Legislature “did not grant the County Board authority to enforce those [local] regulations when the State Board issues [temporary use permits],” Supreme Court Justice Kari Jo Gray wrote.
The advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Use of State Lands, which sided with Teton County in the legal fight, said in an email to supporters that the court’s decision “is not what we wanted.”
Nevertheless, “it is not all bad news,” the group said.
Prospects for change
There are several reasons for Teton County residents to take heart in the face of the legal loss, the group’s attorney Bill Schwartz said Thursday. First, the Supreme Court recognized that leases on state lands — commitments longer than five-year temporary use permits — subject the leasing party to county regulations.
“They noted expressly,” Schwartz said of the court, “that in connection with leases, the land board is required to make the lessee comply with county regulations.”
That’s important because Tammah should not have been approved as a temporary use, he said. A judge made that point as the case advanced to the Supreme Court, he said. In addition to the judge, legislators and residents statewide are recognizing the land board’s use of what the citizens’ group calls a loophole, Schwartz said.
“I think it’s clear [the land board] authorized this use through temporary use permits instead of leases to avoid the statutory requirements that they would have to comply with county regulations,” Schwartz said.
That awareness could bring changes to the underpinning state laws. Momentum is building, Schwartz said, to close the temporary-use loophole and also to scrutinize long-term leases that may also skirt state responsibilities to the detriment of neighbors.
Exhibit one is a lease for gravel mining on state land at the base of Casper Mountain. There, the land board on June 5 will consider renewing Prism Logistics’ lease which, Schwartz said “is literally in the middle of residential areas.”
Neighborhood worries are central to the Tammah and Casper conflicts, even though the circumstances differ. In Casper, Schwartz said local regulations should apply because the gravel mining is a lease.
The state, on the other hand, lumps gravel mining with the mining of minerals, he said. Mineral mining on state land leases is exempt from local regulations, Schwartz said. But Wyoming courts have said, for 100 years, that gravel is not a mineral, he said.
“This is not a mining operation in a sense that is meant in that exemption,” Schwartz said. “I think the gravel operations on Casper Mountain are not considered mining operations like a gold mine or coal mine because gravel is not a mineral.”
Other problems dog the state land board, Schwartz said, including what he and others perceive as inadequate public notice regarding applications for commercial operations on state lands.
“This is a great opportunity for a reset,” he said. “I think the Casper people are going to let that be known.”
The domes abide
Tammah is located on about 5 acres of a state school trust section that’s the site of seven other temporary uses. Most of the 640-acre section is leased for grazing.
Basecamp attorney Hawks said Tammah will abide. “Since entering into its lease with the State of Wyoming, Basecamp Hospitality has remained committed to environmental stewardship, compliance with all applicable laws and building standards, and delivering a distinctive guest experience at the Tammah Resort.”
Among other things, Teton County residents worry about the Tammah septic system and leach field that’s located adjacent to a wetland and at the headwaters of already polluted Fish Creek, a Class 1 waterway that’s impaired by E.coli. After the State Board of Land Commissioners approved temporary use permits on portions of the 640-acre state school trust section near Teton Village in 2022, Teton County began abatement procedures against Basecamp/Tammah for not complying with local land use regulations.
The county sought to conduct fire and electrical inspections. The state land board sued the county to stop local enforcement, prevailing in April in the supreme court.

With Colorado River negotiations facing a 2026 deadline, the state wants to keep water management in its own hands, but lags its neighbors in planning to cut usage.
The post Wyoming begins exploring voluntary water conservation programs appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
In Cheyenne, one of the northernmost cities receiving Colorado River water, the state engineer and attorney general’s offices met with legislators on the select water committee last month to discuss ongoing Colorado River negotiations. Their message was clear: Wyoming must adapt to a future in which the river has an inadequate supply of water for all of its users.
Brandon Gebhart, Wyoming’s state engineer responsible for managing and regulating the water within the state, and Chris Brown, with the Wyoming attorney general’s water and natural resources division, gave committee members background on the Colorado River negotiations, and outlined why it is in Wyoming’s interest to come up with its own water conservation statutes. 
With many Colorado River basin mountain ranges holding less than 50% of their average spring snowpack, it’s clear that the river and its reservoirs will again be stressed this year by deepening drought.
“We don’t have anything set up right now,” Gebhart said. “But I think it’s very important that if we’re to do that, we need to do it in a way that doesn’t impact our water users, and it’s something that Wyoming can live with.”
Southwest Wyoming relies on water from the Green River, the Colorado River’s largest tributary, to feed agricultural operations, serve its towns and power its industries. But as climate change intensifies the decades-long drought in the West, and river users continue to demand more water than the system can provide, the Colorado River is running dangerously low, threatening the water supplies and livelihoods of 40 million people in seven U.S. states, 30 tribes and Mexico.
In an attempt to address river shortages and forecasted drought, the states and tribes have come up with new plans for how to manage the river ahead of an October 2026 deadline. Both the Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — and the Lower Basin states — Arizona, California and Nevada — have proposed cutting basin-wide use by as much as 3.9 million acre feet.
But, so far, the basins have been unable to agree on how to share those cuts. 
The Upper Basin states have proposed levying the full 3.9 million acre feet of required cuts on the Lower Basin in proportion to elevation declines at Lake Mead, which serves only Lower Basin water users, while voluntarily cutting their own use. Under the Upper Basin plan, the Lower Basin would incrementally cut its water use once Lake Mead drops to 90% of its storage capacity; when the lake reaches 70% capacity, the cuts plateau at 1.5 million acre feet — enough water to cover 1.5 million acres with a foot of water. The cuts would remain at that level until Lake Mead dips below 20% capacity, at which point Lower Basin states cut water use by an additional 2.4 million acre feet.
The Lower Basin states have offered to cut their own consumption by 1.5 million acre feet, but only once the Lake Mead water level drops to 69% of its capacity. The remaining 2.4 million acre feet of cuts would be triggered once the system hit 23% capacity and be shared equally between the basins.
Gebhert, who is also Wyoming’s representative in Colorado River negotiations, told the committee a voluntary program of cuts is important in part because it underlines the viability of the Upper Basin states’ plan and shows the Lower Basin “the certainty that we can do something to contribute to the solution.”
It is unclear what a voluntary water conservation program in Wyoming would look like — except that it would have to accommodate several interests. Ranchers, in addition to having some of the most senior water rights in the Green River basin, draw the most water, and any voluntary conservation program would likely have to balance their needs alongside demand from the communities of Rock Springs and Green River, which together hold almost 6% of the Equality State’s population, and take into consideration industries like mining for trona, a mineral used in soda ash for glass, paper and detergent manufacturing. Mining companies make up a substantial portion of the region’s tax base.
There may not be consensus within each of those groups as to what shape a voluntary water conservation program ultimately takes.

“I hear everything from, ‘Well, we haven’t used our allocation of Colorado River water yet, why should we do anything?’ — which is a good position to have, but one I’m not sure withstands scrutiny in the overall federal picture [of the river] — to those who say, ‘Well, this may provide some opportunity for me to get some revenue from use of some of my water,’” said Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, a ranching trade group.
Magagna hopes that as the state engineer’s office drafts its pilot program, it will account for the impacts of voluntary cutbacks of water use on landscapes and ecosystems that have historically been irrigated at a certain time, in a certain way with certain quantities. The state engineer’s office’s pilot program would likely affect urban and industrial water users in the Green River basin, not just agricultural users.
“I really appreciate the fact that they understand the need to involve everyone,” Magagna said.
Wyoming is, in the estimation of Chris Brown, a senior assistant attorney general, behind its peers in the Upper Basin — particularly New Mexico and Utah — in developing a voluntary water conservation program, he told state legislators.
In 2023, the Utah legislature passed a bill requiring water conservancy districts and water utilities over a certain size to submit conservation plans and update them every five years. They have access to state loans or funding to improve water uses. New Mexico makes water conservation resources available to homeowners, industrial users, landscapers and public utilities, among others.
The meeting concluded with members of the select water committee authorizing the state engineer’s office to come up with draft legislation for a pilot conservation program. Lawmakers plan to review that draft during their next meeting in August, at a yet-to-be-determined location.

The lawsuit named Randall Hepp and Yana Pusich as defendants, the then-warden and then-security director of the prison. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
According to the lawsuit, Botwinski suffered from a severe drug addiction and from mental illness at all times while serving his prison sentence at WCI. It says he died of a fentanyl overdose.
The lawsuit alleges prison staff known to be smuggling drugs were assigned in proximity to Botwinski. It also alleges a failure to order Botwinski into close observation until drug smuggling could be controlled. 
The DOC’s online offender locator dates Botwinski’s death on January 19, 2023. Botwinski is at least the eighth incarcerated person to die at the prison since 2023. The death of Damien Evans, 23, was at least the seventh death at the Waupun prison since 2023, according to reporting from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earlier this year. 
Another man incarcerated at Waupun, Tyshun Lemons, died on Oct. 2, 2023 when he overdosed on a substance containing fentanyl, the Examiner reported. 
The estate of Joshua Botwinski is the plaintiff for the lawsuit, by special administrator Linda Botwinski. The lawsuit alleges Hepp and Pusich were deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need, knowingly created a danger for Botwinski and knowingly failed to protect him from danger. It argues that their alleged deliberate indifference caused Botwinski’s death. 
In January, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that nearly a dozen prison employees had resigned or been fired since the U.S. Department of Justice’s launch of a probe into a suspected smuggling ring within the prison.  
In September, William Homan, a former facilities repair worker at WCI, pleaded guilty to smuggling contraband in exchange for bribes. A sentencing memorandum by prosecutors said the presence of contraband in WCI contributed to a “lack of institutional control.” 
In late April, Hepp was convicted of a misdemeanor and fined $500 in the death of Donald Maier, who was incarcerated at WCI. 
A sentencing memorandum by a lawyer for Hepp said that in March 2023, “conditions and actions of the inmate population created an environment that posed an immediate threat to the safety of the staff and inmates while also threatening the security of the institution.” 
The memo said Hepp put the prison in modified movement, “at times referred to as a ‘lockdown.’” 
“This led to an investigation of the conditions and a search of the institution,” the memo said. “Information and physical evidence that was developed revealed a level of corrupt behavior taking place that was historical in scope involving trafficking of illegal drugs, cellular telephones, finances, and other contraband.”
The sentencing memo from Homan’s case said the lockdown involved incarcerated people “being confined to their cells twenty-four hours a day except for medical or other emergencies.”
“As part of its efforts to reestablish control, a facilitywide search was conducted, resulting in the recovery of numerous cellular phones, controlled substances, and other contraband,” the memo said. “WCI provided information obtained from its investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which included information that WCI staff were receiving bribes in exchange for smuggling in contraband.”
The lawsuit alleges that before Jan. 19, 2023 — and therefore before the lockdown and investigation — “via the reports they received from staff, both Pusich and Hepp knew that illegal drug use was rampant at WCI, and they knew that prison staff was smuggling drugs into WCI.”

The lawsuit alleges that on August 15, 2022, WCI officials found out that Botwinski was under the influence of drugs. Botwinski tested positive for opiates and stimulants. 
Incidents of prisoners being under the influence of drugs “is automatically reported to Pusich as security director,” and Pusich would report incidents of prisoners using illegal drugs to Hepp, the lawsuit alleges. 
Before Jan. 19, the day of Botwinski’s death, Pusich and Hepp knew illegal drug use was “rampant” at the prison, the lawsuit alleges. 
“From the reports of drug use and overdoses, they knew that inmates had an almost unfettered access to drugs in prison,” the lawsuit alleges. “Botwinski’s access to drugs in WCI was greater than his access to drugs outside of WCI.”
The lawsuit alleges that Hepp and/or Pusich assigned prison staff known to be smuggling drugs into the prison in proximity to Botwinski. It alleges that they knew placing staff who smuggled drugs into the prison in Botwinski’s proximity would lead to overdose. 
According to the lawsuit, staff observed Botlinski in his cell at about 5:10 p.m. 
“At about 6:45 p.m., Botwinski was discovered in his cell: he had been the victim of a drug (fentanyl) overdose, from which he died,” the lawsuit says. 
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Examiner.

The University of Wyoming should exemplify its ""world needs more cowboys"" campaign and protect diversity, equity and inclusion programming, write a group of UW social work students.
The post Cowboy ethics aren’t what they once were in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The University of Wyoming launched its “The world needs more cowboys” campaign in 2018 with a video celebrating the diversity of students who embody the cowboy legacy — tenacious individuals who courageously pursued adventure and freedom through “fearless independence” in the American West.

Opinion

As students, UW asks us to embody “cowboy ethics,” but our institution isn’t “cowboy” anymore. 
If UW applauds cowboys for their “unyielding courage” and “relentless curiosity” — as banners adorning campus lamp posts suggest — then the administration should be standing up to the fear and narrow-mindedness exemplified by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus’ attack on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
After hours of testimony over the last year from professors, students and staff who spoke out against the Freedom Caucus’ push to defund DEI programs, the UW administration demonstrated they were more than willing to over-comply and over-censor essential university offices out of fear of legislative reprimand. This is not cowboy “unwavering integrity,” it’s bowing down to authority at the first point of resistance.   
Even private funding for DEI initiatives is under threat. Senate File 103, “Terminating and defunding diversity, equity and inclusion,” a bill vetoed by Gov. Mark Gordon earlier this year, would have prohibited public institutions from accepting private donations designated for DEI efforts. That means when our community wants to support inclusion with our own funds, there are lawmakers who want to tell us we can’t.  
What will happen once the University of Wyoming loses accreditation for programs that require DEI, putting students’ degrees in jeopardy?
In fact, enrollment at the state’s only four-year public university has already been declining.  
Taking effect on July 1, House Bill 147, “Prohibition of institutional discrimination,” defines DEI programs and activities as inherently discriminatory. The rhetoric of a merit-based society is attractive, but what is not being conveyed is that we can’t have a merit-based society without DEI when there is systemic institutionalized discrimination. What gets lost in this definition is the truth: DEI is cowboy. Not the sanitized version we see on recruitment posters, but the real, historical legacy of the American West. One in four cowboys was Black. The vaquero traditions of Mexican cowboys defined cattle herding and ranch life. Native Americans, Asian immigrants and women all shaped the frontier. Cowboy culture has always been diverse; we’re just finally telling the whole story. 
By rejecting DEI, we aren’t preserving tradition. We’re whitewashing it.
When did “relentless curiosity” mean allowing fear to dissuade us from inviting hard workers, creative thinkers and adventurous pioneers to have a seat at the table? 
Cowboy ethics aren’t meant to be printed on a banner, attached to a light pole and forgotten when things get hard. If we only stand by them when it’s easy, they aren’t ethics, they are decoration. 
Cowboy values are grit, speaking up when it counts, standing up to bullies and looking out for the people around you.
So, we urge the university to find its Wyoming cowboy backbone — reflect, course correct and remember what it truly means to draw a line and hold to it.

Pocan was in Eau Claire, the 3rd Congressional District represented by Derrick Van Orden, a Republican, on Saturday, May 31, at a town hall organized by Opportunity Wisconsin, a coalition of grassroots groups, at the Pablo Center at the Confluence, Eau Claire’s performing arts center.
Van Orden was invited to attend the event but declined.
Pocan is one of several congressional Democrats who have begun holding town hall meetings in Republican districts where Republican representatives have been reluctant to meet their constituents who are upset about  budget cuts that threaten access to Social Security, Medicaid and federal food assistance. 
Pocan focused on what President Dondald Trump (R) has called “the Big Beautiful Bill” that was recently passed by the House of Representatives, and which  Pocan called “the worst bill I’ve ever seen introduced by anyone, by any political party.”
He chided Republican supporters for cutting  Medicaid benefits  for nearly 14 million Americans,  raising the premiums for the Affordable  Care Act (ACA), and cutting food assistance to 11 million mostly low-income children through Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
The Republican budget reconciliation package  also extends  tax cuts passed in 2017 for America’s top earners, resulting in a nearly $5 trillion national deficit over 10 years.
A May 20 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of the GOP budget bill projects it would increase the national deficit by $3.8 trillion and decrease Medicaid spending by $698 billion and SNAP spending by $267 billion.
A May 22 CBO projection notes the bill would reduce SNAP participation by “roughly 3.2 million people in an average month over the 2025–2034 period.”
There are different projections on how many people would experience a Medicaid cut, with estimates ranging from 7.5 to 10 million.
Van Orden sent out a release after Pocan’s appearance in Eau Claire:
“What Mr. Pocan is doing is absolutely despicable – continuing to fearmonger our vulnerable populations, including seniors, veterans, hungry children, individuals with disabilities and pregnant women. This bill protects Medicaid and SNAP for those most in need and prevents a 25% tax hike on Wisconsin families. Anyone telling you anything different, including Mr. Pocan, is lying to you.”
Van Orden also disputes  the CBO’s analysis, stating that the CBO has been wrong in the past and tends to be overly critical of Republican-sponsored legislation.
“There are not cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, veteran benefits, SNAP and WIC (Women, Infants and Children program) are not being cut,” Van Orden told a local TV station after the House passed the bill.
But Pocan said Van Orden has been corrected even by other Republicans who admit the bill would reduce spending on Medicaid.
“83% of the benefit goes to the top 1% of the people,” Pocan said of the tax cuts, “so they are taking from the pockets of pretty much everyone in this room and putting it into the pockets of Elon Musk and Donald Trumps and others.”
Pocan added that  only 5% of the tax cuts in the bill will go to working people, including those who won’t have to pay taxes on tips,  seniors and to offset interest payments on car loans. And, he noted, those cuts will  sunset, while the much larger tax cuts for top-earners, which account for  83% of the cost of the bill, are permanent.
“The single largest cut to health care in American history is in this bill, 13.7 million people are estimated would lose access to health care because of the cuts to Medicaid,” Pocan said. “But what doesn’t get as much coverage is they also cut some of the premium assistance for the Affordable Care Act. So it’s a $700 billion cut to Medicaid, but also a $300 billion cut to the Affordable Care Act. We don’t even have the estimates of the numbers yet, but millions more will pay increased premiums.”
Pocan said Republicans have said the Medicaid cuts are really about setting work requirements in exchange for benefits and not a straight cut.
“Two-thirds of the people who get Medicaid are working poor,” Pocan said. While they shouldn’t be affected by the new work requirements, the red tape involved in proving their work history will help push people off Medicaid.
 “It’s not about trying to have any accountability,” he said. “It’s to just make it harder for people to get health care.” Pocan pointed to a state work requirement for Medicaid recipients in  Arkansas, where people who lost coverage were actually eligible for care. The work requirements did not boost employment, researchers found and many of those who lost coverage had trouble accessing the online reporting system. 
Pocan also noted that the projected increase in the deficit under the House proposal would trigger a sequestration requirement, resulting in automatic cuts to Medicare of nearly $500 billion.
SNAP cuts would mean a loss of $314 million for Wisconsin.
 Pocan also criticized Trump’s “on again, off again” practice of announcing tariffs, which had created a climate of uncertainty for businesses.
“Not only did Donald Trump not reduce costs like he promised in November, but the tariffs are actually a tax on all of us,” he said.
Pocan criticized Van Orden for not coming to town hall meetings to defend his vote for the Republican budget bill.
Van Orden has said he prefers telephone town halls where the meeting isn’t dominated by people he describes as leftwing critics, and he also has said that his family has received death threats and is vulnerable in an in-person setting.
Pocan acknowledged death threats should be taken seriously, but also stated he and many others in Congress have received death threats, and he criticized Van Orden’s telephone town halls for only allowing his supporters to talk.
Pocan also criticized Van Orden for going back on his promise never to cut Medicaid or reduce SNAP.  Van Orden has claimed  the bill doesn’t reduce Medicaid and that Medicaid and  SNAP payments will continue as usual for recipients if they meet the new work requirements.
A registered nurse who attended the town hall in Eau Claire said many of her clients are on Medicaid and Medicare, with several living in nursing homes, and she asked what would happen to them if the House budget bill became law.
State Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) who came to the town hall with Pocan,   said approximately 55% of people in long-term care in Wisconsin are on Medicaid and if Medicaid funding is cut it will also impact the other 45-50% who have private insurance  because facilities will close due to lack of funding.
Pocan also responded to questions about cuts to Social Security Administration staff, saying, “When you cut thousands of people who work for Social Security, you make it harder for people to get access to their money.”
Speaking more generally of federal cuts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, he added, “They fired the people who worked on avian flu, bird flu, which was affecting us greatly recently, and they had to rehire them at the Department of Health and Human Services.” 
Pocan said he believed Trump won in November because the cost of living was high and noted that in other countries incumbents  also lost because of a backlash caused by global  inflation.
“So that was the No. 1 thing going for Donald Trump in November, but today it’s the No. 1 thing that’s taking him down the polls, because he said he would address it. He’s done nothing,” said Pocan.
Asked how Democrats could encourage younger people to vote, Pocan said, “The good news is younger people absolutely agree with more progressive public policy and not conservative policy.” But people “want to fight back, you want something to happen,” he added.
He encouraged Democratic leaders to hold more town hall meetings in Republican districts.
 “We should be going into many more Republican districts,” he said.
Pocan also encouraged attendees to meet Van Orden whenever he is in Eau Claire and ask to talk to him directly, and invite the press to be there for the interaction.
He encouraged the crowd of 100-plus to become active.
“You happen to be in this very unique position of having a member that is in a purple district,” Pocan  said of Van Orden, who  won in 2024 by one of the smallest majorities for a Republican in Congress. He “could lose his seat if he doesn’t listen to you.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers greenlit a long-term commission Friday to review how the state funds its K-12 schools, a step that could lead to future property tax relief after the latest efforts fell short this year.
Legislative Bill 303, from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward and introduced at Gov. Jim Pillen’s request, passed 48-0. It would create an 18-member School Financing Review Commission to regularly review and suggest possible improvements to the state’s main state aid formula to divert sales and income tax dollars to public K-12 schools: the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act.
“I hope to be a fly on the wall of those meetings anyway,” said Hughes, who plans to reintroduce legislation in 2026 for additional property tax relief. “When you hear ideas, then it might spark something else that gives you better ideas.”

LB 303 received widespread support, including from the Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Farmers Union, Nebraska State Educational Association, Nebraska Rural Community Schools Association, Nebraska Council of School Administrators, Nebraska Association of School Boards, Greater Nebraska Schools Association, Educational Service Unit Coordinating Council and the OpenSky Policy Institute.
TEEOSA basics
The “TEEOSA” formula, created in 1990 and perpetually adjusted since, in most basic terms, diverts “equalization aid” to public school districts if it calculates that a local district has more “needs” than “resources.”
“Needs” is calculated among 18 buckets, including a district’s poverty concentration, students with limited English proficiency, transportation needs and student growth. 
“Resources” includes six buckets of funds, such as estimates of property taxes that could be raised with a $1 tax levy and net option enrollment funds.
  These are the various components that make up the “needs” and “resources” that amount of “equalization aid” as part of Nebraska’s Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act (TEEOSA). (Courtesy of the Nebraska Department of Education)
The formula diverts about $1.2 billion between 245 school districts each year. An increasing number of districts do not receive any TEEOSA aid under the formula, which is why Pillen and other senators in 2023 created “foundation aid,” distributing $1,500 to school districts roughly for each student. About 60% of foundation aid is considered a “resource.”
Pillen, in a Friday statement, said the state’s history with TEEOSA has indicated some “glaring flaws.” He thanked Hughes for championing a commission that Pillen said could find the “right solutions” to funding schools and “ultimately be a part of solving our property tax crisis.”
‘A long time coming’
Hughes said the “significant milestone” has been “a long time coming” with multiple senators, including State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and former State Sen. Al Davis of Hyannis, who each proposed similar commissions.
DeBoer, now in her seventh year, routinely fought for the commission, including with LB 500 this year, because she believes it is the best way for a “deep dive look” at TEEOSA and property taxes generally. She said it can help understand if the state is on the right path,” or if corrections are needed, “not just today but in the long run.”
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
DeBoer and Hughes are among a rare crop of senators who understood TEEOSA before coming to the Legislature, Hughes because of school board service in Seward and DeBoer because of preparations during her 2018 campaign and as a self-described “nerd.”
The two senators said the implementation of term limits in 2006 also complicated major changes to TEEOSA.
‘Desperation’ for change
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, said the commission shows the need to reform property taxes and how the state funds its public schools.
“I agree with the desperation of farmers and homeowners that nothing else has worked, so it’s worth a try with the commission,” Murman said.
A former senator had questioned whether a commission was needed, arguing that lawmakers didn’t need an outside advisory group and could act right away for any TEEOSA changes.

Murman said the commission could be beneficial, but he’s been hesitant to support one in the past because he feared school officials might push conversations in ways that support their local schools or a set group of schools. He said their representation is needed, but he also wanted more taxpayer representation. Hughes embraced those suggestions.
With those reservations, Murman said senators should take any recommendations with “a grain of salt” as they have the final say in legislation. Murman plans to appoint himself as the Education Committee representative on the commission.
Property tax relief
Hughes, vice chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, has made it one of her personal legislative missions to reform the state’s model for funding K-12 schools. Over her years in the Legislature, she hopes to lower school property tax levies and push them closer together. Right now, school districts can tax up to $1.05 per $100 of taxable property valuation.
TEEOSA considers a “local effort rate” of $1 per $100 of taxable property valuation for every school district, a mathematical model to determine what a district could theoretically contribute.

LB 303 would have originally lowered both the maximum tax rate and the “local effort rate” by 3 cents, thereby distributing more dollars to schools to ease the burden of local property taxes. That would have cost more than $120 million, proving too big a hill to climb with the state’s budget woes.
Pillen originally included LB 303 in his budget proposal in January, but the Appropriations Committee made key diversions from Pillen’s proposal, and downward economic projections in April derailed hopes to find additional funds without expanding sales taxes.
Instead, the bill moved forward only with the review commission, the members of which will need to be appointed within one month of the governor signing the bill. A first report is due Dec. 1, with subsequent reports each Nov. 1 after.
Commission duties
The commission’s main duties are to:

Evaluate TEEOSA and make recommendations for adjustments or changes “that may be necessary to help prevent the increase of property taxes.”
Regularly review both the “needs” and “resources” sides of the TEEOSA formula.
Analyze how to minimize the negative impact on schools during times when the state might not be able to fully fund the TEEOSA formula.
Examine the impact of funding for education on student achievement and outcomes, including access to early childhood education, student attendance, literacy, graduation rates, college-going rates and postsecondary workforce participation.
Consider the impact of funding on issues and resources impacting students with relatively high needs, including students who live in areas of high concentrations of poverty, students with an individualized education program and students with limited English proficiency.

Path to the governor’s desk
Hughes’ bill languished in the Education Committee until mid-May, largely because of a lack of funds. But it also stayed behind as a backup for property tax reform.
“We had to get a better feeling of what mechanisms might work to fund schools and property tax relief,” Murman said. “We wanted to keep all options open.”

Murman tried to keep LB 303 in committee longer than when the committee met May 9 to advance the bill 7-0, which could have hurt the chances of the bill reaching its finish line. The bill reached the full Legislature on May 15, the 80th legislative day, and passed on the 88th legislative day. Lawmakers will adjourn for the year Monday.
At the committee meeting to advance LB 303, a committee staffer urged Murman to oppose LB 303, or at least not vote to advance it. But Murman voted it out of committee and approved it along the way. He said his concerns weren’t personal.
Hughes challenged Murman for committee chair in January. He won reelection 29-20.
LB 303 sought three state senators as nonvoting members of the commission. However, Murman said the Education Committee chair should be a member, which some committee members pushed back on.
‘A big deal’
Hughes changed her bill so the senators are the chairs of the Education and Revenue Committees, or their designees, and one at-large senator. No more than two senators can be of the same party, and both chairs are Republicans.
If the Revenue Committee chair appoints himself, Hughes would not be able to serve on the commission because she, too, is a Republican.
Hughes said she doesn’t see a big recommendation coming from the commission this year but will continue work ahead of the 2026 session on how to drop school property tax levies and increase property tax relief. She plans to work with at least six other senators, two each from the Appropriations, Education and Revenue Committees, with even political party splits.
“People may or may not have noticed what a big bill it is,” DeBoer said, “but it is a big deal towards the ultimate goal of finding the right way for Nebraska to finance education.”



School Financing Review Commission membership
The School Financing Review Commission shall consist of:

The state commissioner of education (currently Brian Maher), or the commissioner’s designee, who will chair the commission.
The state property tax administrator (currently Sarah Scott), or the administrator’s  designee.
One representative of the governor appointed by the governor.
Three members of the Legislature, including the chairs of the Education Committee (currently State Sen. Dave Murman) and Revenue Committee (currently State Sen. Brad von Gillern) or their designees. Up to two senators can be from the same political party. 
One member who is a representative of postsecondary education with expertise in school finance.
One representative of a Class V school district (Omaha Public Schools).
One representative of a Class IV school district (Lincoln Public Schools).
Four superintendents or school board members representing Class I, II or III school districts (smaller than OPS or LPS). No more than two members can be from the same school district class.
Five members appointed from the state at large, including at least one with experience in business, one with experience in farming and one who is an active certified teacher in a public school.

The commission must meet at least once each calendar quarter. Commissioners would need to be designated by early July.
The Nebraska Department of Education, Nebraska Department of Revenue and the Legislature’s legislative fiscal analyst can provide data and assistance as needed.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) In an escalation by Trump Administration officials and Republican lawmakers, two U.S. House committees have launched an inquiry into the response by Nashville’s mayor and local officials to federal immigration enforcement activities. 
A letter sent Thursday by the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees demands a series of documents from the office of Mayor Freddie O’Connell by June 12.
They include documents related to the mayor’s executive order requiring city emergency personnel to report interactions with federal immigration officials within 24 hours. The committees are also demanding all communications between city officials and other organizations and individuals regarding federal immigration activities during the month of May.
The letter accuses the mayor of actions that “threaten to chill immigration enforcement in the City of Nashville and Davidson County.”
O’Connell, during a regularly scheduled news conference on Friday, said he intends to “appropriately respond.”

“I am not particularly concerned,” the mayor said in response to a reporter’s question about the inquiry. 
“We’re going to respond appropriately to all inquiries, and we have been guided by a full understanding of state and federal law and we will continue to be,” he said.
The letter was sent to O’Connell the same day the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a list of hundreds of U.S. cities, counties and several states that Trump Administration officials accused of “deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities.”
Nashville, along with Shelby County in west Tennessee, was on the list. 
But in a reversal over the weekend, the list was removed from the agency’s website. Reuters reported Sunday that the list was taken down after DHS received pushback from the National Sheriff’s Association, which issued a statement noting that local law enforcement had not been consulted before the sanctuary city list was made public and that it “violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement.”
On Friday, O’Connell held in his hand a copy of Tennessee law barring sanctuary status, a designation that typically limits cooperation between cities and federal immigration officials, noting that Nashville has not engaged in any of the actions barred by the legislation.
“By definition Nashville is not a sanctuary city,” the mayor said. “We do not, nor have we ever had a policy that violates state law.”
“As we’ve stated several times in recent weeks, Metro (Nashville) does not have any legal authority as it relates to immigration enforcement and we do not impede federal law enforcement actions,” O’Connell said. “In fact we regularly partner with state and federal agencies to take violent criminals off our streets. This is the reality.”
U.S. border czar: Nashville mayor, a critic of immigration sweeps, now faces investigation

O’Connell also noted that both violent and property crimes in Nashville are significantly down from prior years.
The mayor’s remarks came at the end of a week marked by escalating attacks against him by top federal immigration officials as well as Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles. 
During a Memorial Day press conference, Ogles accused O’Connell, a Democrat, of “aiding and abetting illegal immigration.” 
Subsequently, White House “border czar” Tom Homan warned that immigration agents would “flood the zone” in Nashville seemingly in retaliation for the mayor’s perceived political stance against mass immigration detainments.
And on Thursday a Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs accused O’Connell of “harboring” immigrants without legal status and “doxxing” immigration enforcement agents.
O’Connell has drawn the ire of Republicans for two actions: during mass immigration stops in Nashville earlier this month, O’Connell issued a revised executive order requiring the city’s emergency personnel – and some non-emergency employees – to report any interaction with federal immigration officials within 24 hours. 
The city then posted a list of those interactions on its web site. Initially the names or partial names of four federal immigration staffers appeared on that list in error, city officials said. The names have since been removed. 
O’Connell also publicized a fund established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee to assist family members of those detained by immigration authorities. While Trump Administration officials accused O’Connell of using public funds to support immigrants without legal status, the fund operates only with private donations, a foundation spokesperson said.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Ever since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II, America has been admired around the world as a beacon of equality, freedom and opportunity. That admiration helped the United States become the world’s preeminent economic and military power over the last 80 years. While we have faced serious problems, like racial inequality, poverty and questionable wars, our elected representatives have usually been able to work together in an effort to address them. I fear that the era of America’s economic and moral dominance is now faltering and headed into a period of decline.
U.S. House-passed tax bill weakens accountability at for-profit colleges, advocates say

The so-called big, beautiful bill, which the U.S. House of Representatives passed on May 22, is a symptom of the decline. It will greatly benefit the wealthy, while denying medical care, food assistance and other social safety-net programs to those on the lower income scale. The bill would substantially increase income inequality in the country and likely necessitate a $500 billion cut in Medicare spending. It is unfathomable that U.S. Reps. Russ Fulcher and Mike Simpson voted for the bill and that Gov. Brad Little strongly supported its passage. Unless the U.S. Senate stops the bill in its tracks, the states will have to increase their budgetary outlays or let their voters go without vital services.  
The national debt consequences of the bill are also of great concern. It should be remembered that Trump added $8.4 trillion to the national debt during his first term, more than any other U.S. president. His big, beautiful bill would add an additional $3.8 trillion to the debt, which would raise the debt from its current $36.2 trillion to a whopping $40 trillion. That is a very serious problem in itself, but made substantially worse by other destructive actions he has taken that will seriously hinder the nation’s ability to deal with that massive debt.
The U.S. lives wildly beyond its means by borrowing against the future. Instead of requiring wealthy corporations and individuals to pay their fair share of taxes, we simply finance the deficits by issuing government bonds.
 Since the mid-1990s the GOP has forgotten that budget deficits can be prevented by raising adequate revenue. Thus, the national debt has ballooned from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to $36.2 trillion at the end of 2024.  About $8.5 trillion of the debt is held by foreign governments and investors. 
Foreigners have helped finance our debt because the U.S. has been regarded as a steady, reliable trustworthy nation. Our dollar is the coin of the international realm, and our government bonds have always been seen as a safe, reliable investment, particularly in times of international economic turmoil.
Donald Trump has shaken the world order by dumping on our friends and allies, including those closest to us – Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and Korea.
He has disregarded trading relationships that have made America the leader of the free world. Trump’s latest threat to impose 50% tariffs on European nations seems designed to drive away our steadiest, most-reliable trading partners and military allies. His erratic and self-defeating tariff actions have shown America to be an unreliable partner. Our friends and allies have started forging stronger trading relationships among themselves and with China, our chief international adversary. This will reverberate against U.S. economic and security interests well into the future.
The bond market has become increasingly edgy about Trump’s erratic behavior. Investors are concerned about the safety of U.S. bonds, as evidenced by an increasing interest rate on our nation’s bonded indebtedness. The big, beautiful bill promises to trigger a crisis in the bond market. A well-regarded economist has observed: “The U.S. government bond markets are already shaky, long-term interest rates are rising, and it seems that foreign investors are fleeing the United States.” It is inconceivable that such chaos in the economic foundation of our country could have occurred since January.
America has long been regarded as the moral beacon of the world. As President Ronald Reagan put it in his Farewell Address — “The shining city upon a hill.” That perception is no longer the case. A recent survey discloses that America’s worldwide popularity has suffered a collapse since January. China is now regarded more favorably than the United States. Trump is viewed more negatively (58%) than Vladimir Putin (49%) and Xi Jinping (31%). Those dismal numbers foretell a decline in America’s ability to sustain its position as the premier moral, economic and military power in the world.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The twice-dismissed felony criminal case against the former director of History Nebraska might soon reach the state’s highest court.
The Nebraska Supreme Court has been asked to accept an appeal of a March ruling by the Nebraska Court of Appeals that dismissed, on procedural grounds, a felony theft by deception charge against Trevor Jones.

The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, which is prosecuting the case, asked for the review earlier this month, maintaining that the Appeals Court had erred in dismissing the case and in not hearing the state’s objections. Due to the “high profile” nature of the charge and the “weighty concerns” raised by its dismissal, the Supreme Court should weigh in, wrote Zachary Viglianco, a principal deputy solicitor general in the Attorney General’s Office.
“There is also a need for greater clarity about the proper procedural path to appeal an order granting a motion to discharge. This Court’s intervention is warranted,” Viglianco wrote.
But in a May 23 response, Jones’ attorney wrote that the AG’s office is raising “the same flawed argument” that led to the earlier dismissals — that a motion for discharge due to a speedy trial violation “is civil in nature as it is purportedly a ‘special proceeding.’”
Jones’ charges were dropped in January after Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong ruled that state prosecutors had failed to bring him to trial soon enough, violating his right to a “speedy trial.”
That led the Attorney General’s Office to appeal to the Court of Appeals, which dismissed the case based on another procedural error.
It was unclear whether the Supreme Court would take up the case on appeal. The court had issued no notice as of Thursday.
Jones had served six years as the $164,800-a-year director of the Nebraska State Historical Society, but resigned suddenly in 2022, shortly before a state audit raised concerns about his handling of $270,000 in donations from a fundraising foundation.

The Attorney General’s Office eventually charged Jones with theft by deception, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors alleged that he wrongly diverted the donations into a private foundation he helped establish, instead of depositing them with the state treasury, as required by law.
The failed prosecution has drawn criticism from at least one state lawmaker, Sen. Danielle Conrad, who has said Attorney General Mike Hilgers seems too focused on “politically charged litigation” to the detriment of a prosecution to protect public funds.
Jones’ reign as director was controversial. He imposed a personnel management system that some workers complained micromanaged their work and rebranded the society as “History Nebraska.” But he also won some praise for seeking to digitize the society’s holdings.
Gov. Jim Pillen, when he took office, restored the agency’s historic name, the “Nebraska State Historical Society,” and has since named a former head of the Nebraska National Guard, Daryl Bohac, as director. The independent nature of the agency was ended, placing the society as a department under the governor’s direction.

He said the party had about $800,000 of debt when he first took over, but said he has raised $500,000 since taking over.
“We’re vanquishing that debt,” Runestad said. “I think by year’s end, we’re going to get most of that down, and into next year, at the end of this term, we certainly will have no debt.”
Runestad said he has vowed to ensure the party has a “big” fund balance by the end of his term – even if means denying requests for a last-minute spending spree in the run-up to the election.
“We’re going to raise the money, we’re going to spend the money, but whether it’s me or someone else, we’re not going to leave that for the next person,” Runestad said.
He said the party has been undergoing a rebuilding process following several years of dramatic internal politics.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The latest round of air-quality tests near Tontitown’s landfill is complete, the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment announced Friday.
Environmental consulting firm CTEH conducted the testing, specifically looking for chemicals found in previous air sampling, including benzene, acrolein, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and naphthalene,” a news release from the department said. 
“Within 90 days of receiving all final, validated analytical sampling results, CTEH will prepare a draft final report for the study, with feedback from the Arkansas Department of Health.”
All of the chemicals mentioned by the department are toxic to humans and can cause a variety of health problems.
Benzene is a liquid, flammable chemical used in a number of consumer products and industrial processes. Long-term exposure can lead to a number of health problems, including cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Inhalation of acrolein leads to eye and throat irritation and can lead to more serious respiratory congestion, according to the CDC.
Carbon tetrachloride is a highly toxic chemical once used in refrigerants and still used in some industrial processes with serious health consequences for people exposed to it, according to the EPA.
Naphthalene, a common ingredient in mothballs, can cause anemia, liver damage and neurological issues if ingested or inhaled in large concentrations, according to an EPA fact sheet.
Chronic exposure to chloroform can affect the liver and central nervous system, the EPA says.
The testing, which occurred from May 2-11, was the fourth round of tests conducted in response to persistent complaints from nearby residents of overwhelming, noxious odors they say emanate from the Eco-Vista landfill, which is owned by Waste Management and is the only landfill in the region. 
The concerns of those living nearby the site, some of whom have said they want the landfill shut down, have bumped up against the waste disposal needs of the region, which has exploded in population since the landfill first opened in 1979.
Complaints and concerns about the landfill started about five years ago, and have grown since then. Tontitown is currently suing in state court over Eco-Vista’s landfill permits.
At a Pollution Control and Ecology Commission meeting last year, Tontitown Mayor Angela Russell said the Division of Environmental Quality had abandoned her town, which is in one of the fastest growing areas of the state, to a landfill that has received nearly 200 complaints in the last five years.
The latest round of testing was necessary, regulators have said, because previous tests did not identify the source of the chemicals in the air, even though the concentrations of acrolein and benzene were above EPA screening levels for residential air. The Arkansas Department of Health concluded after the third round of testing last year that further testing would be required to determine if the landfill was contributing the chemicals to the ambient air.
CTEH conducted the testing, at a cost of $539,966, after bidding on the project. 
The division previously said they would not announce when testing would take place in an effort to record “normal activities.” Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, previously accused two unnamed DEQ employees of tipping the landfill off to inspections during a pre-session budget hearing last year.
The town is in the process of suing the commission and Eco-Vista over multiple permitting matters.
Complaints have come into the division regularly over the last few years, but it was only last year that Eco-Vista was cited with violations of Arkansas air pollution laws as a result of odors.
The alleged violations were referred for DEQ’s formal enforcement process.

				This article is the first in a series on the environmental costs of America’s last remaining alumina refinery.			



GRAMERCY — For several months, a River Parishes refinery unlawfully discharged industrial toxic waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic heavy metals into public areas and waterways, state records show.
The company, Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, has so far racked up 23 violation notices from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality after inspectors first discovered the pollution in August. It involves a slurry of industrial “red mud” byproduct that has eroded through the giant levees surrounding the facility’s waste containment lakes and spilled onto public property. The toxic sludge has killed vegetation and contaminated the land along its path to a local drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas, according to a 606-page LDEQ inspection report finalized in March. 
The incident marks the first known case of red mud levee breaches at an American bauxite refinery. When asked for details, LDEQ spokesman Gregory Langley had little information to share about the prolonged discharge other than to say it is currently under investigation with the agency’s enforcement division. The only enforcement action taken as of May 29 is a warning letter LDEQ sent to Atalco.  
A review of thousands of pages of state and federal documents and interviews with scientists and area residents indicate that Atalco polluted public land and state waterways with the most toxic non-radioactive elements on the planet and allowed that pollution to continue for months — never notifying the outside community.   
Atalco’s refinery occupies roughly 3 square miles of land where St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes meet on the Mississippi River’s east bank. The site specializes in refining bauxite, a rust-colored powder of raw metals and minerals, into aluminum oxide or “alumina” in the form of an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum. Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States and therefore the nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock. 
Atalco produced 669,261 metric tons of aluminum oxide last year, state records show. For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
One of the main problems in refining bauxite is there are not many good options for what to do with all that waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud. 
The waste comes from a part of the process in which bauxite is heated in a pressurized vessel with sodium hydroxide, a highly caustic chemical. The alumina compounds are then filtered out and separated, while the toxic byproduct is stored in the facility’s six red mud lakes. The lakes are open-air ponds, each roughly 150-200 acres in size surrounded by large earthen levees, some as high as 50 feet, meant to contain the thick liquid waste. 
Four of the lakes, including a “surge” or overflow basin, were constructed in the early 1970s without any liners that would help prevent the heavy metals and chemicals from seeping into the soil below.

“It is very dangerous,” said Slawomir Lomnicki, an environmental scientist at LSU. “There can be a lot of toxic metals leaching out of it and getting into the groundwater.” 
Groundwater contamination from leaching is a constant risk that exists when Atalco’s systems are operating normally. The public drinking water system in St. James Parish regularly monitors for that kind of contamination, according to Parish President Peter Dufresne. Officials with the St. John Parish water system did not answer multiple phone calls last week. 
A greater risk to the community from bauxite refineries in general is the rare case of a levee breach at a red mud lake, which can cause toxic waste to directly contaminate public waters and soils, scientists said. 
Until this reporting, the last known breach at a bauxite refinery occurred in Hungary in 2010. The failure of a red mud reservoir sent 35 million cubic feet of waste into nearby villages, killing 10 people and injuring 150 others.
In the wake of that incident, industry officials told the American public that a levee breach at Louisiana’s bauxite refinery would be unlikely because the levees are “periodically checked by state and federal regulators,” according to a news report from that time. 
That unlikely event has happened at Atalco. With a caustic level higher than drain cleaner and elevated concentrations of heavy metals, Atalco’s waste slurry eroded through levees in multiple locations at multiple lakes, forming canyons as deep as 10 feet that allowed the toxic waste to escape, records show.
 
A water sample LDEQ had tested from a public ditch outside the plant detected arsenic at a concentration nearly 1,400% higher than the level considered safe by state groundwater and EPA drinking water limits. The sample also contained cadmium at levels above those same limits. 
A soil sample taken from the same ditch contained mercury, beryllium, cadmium and chromium — all at concentrations above the average background levels found in U.S. soils. The cadmium was nearly 400% higher, and the chromium was 900% higher than LDEQ’s standard limits for soil. Chromium is the most toxic non-radioactive element on earth and is about three times more poisonous than arsenic, according to EPA toxicity factors.  
Historic water quality data for the Blind River, recorded from 1979-99, show heavy metal concentrations nowhere near those levels.

When the levees broke
“With this kind of facility, the worst major accident that can happen is a breach of the lake [levees],” said Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works with the environmental watchdog Louisiana Bucket Brigade. The group has monitored incidents at the alumina refinery for years.
It is unknown when the mud lake levees first began to erode, but state and federal records show the pollution lasted for months and continued even after Atalco became aware of the problem. 
The company has not responded to the Illuminator’s multiple requests for an interview.
Federal inspectors with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) documented several hazards at Atalco’s levees last summer and voiced concerns about the risks they posed to the workers at the plant. 
“There were several mud lakes at the facility that was (sic) not being maintained,” MSHA inspector Brandon Olivier wrote in a citation dated June 25, 2024. 
Trees and shrubs obscured sections of the levees, making thorough inspections impossible, Olivier added.
A few weeks later, on Aug. 14, the MSHA issued Atalco another citation after inspectors discovered caustic waste “seeping through various locations on the east and west side of Mud Lake #4” and flowing downhill “into the roadway and ditches.”
LDEQ later noted the Aug. 14 citation was the first formal written notice Atalco received about the levees having a breach with dangerous toxic waste escaping from its facility.

Other dangers present at the Atalco plant had already drawn regulators’ attention at that time. 
Just days prior, on Aug. 4, the public was reminded just how dangerous the chemicals at Atalco could be when 45-year-old Curtis Diggs, a contract worker from Waste-Pro USA, fell into a pit of sodium hydroxide at the plant because a grate that covered the pit was missing and the entire floor was flooded with several inches of the caustic cloudy liquid. The chemical, the same that is stored in the red mud lakes, left Diggs with severe burns from which he did not recover, according to LDEQ records. He died in a New Orleans hospital on Sept 2.
MSHA investigated the fatality and learned that Atalco personnel had removed the grate on July 30, 2024, to try to pump out the flooded area and failed to put anything in its place or even a warning marker, creating a dangerous pitfall left open for five days and virtually invisible. MSHA charged Atalco with three regulatory violations and charged Waste-Pro USA with two, faulting both companies for “aggravated conduct” that involved an extraordinary pattern of negligence, though it’s unclear if any fines or penalties have been issued as of May 30, according to federal records.    
Atalco uses sodium hydroxide to refine bauxite into alumina. After the refinement process, it stores the used sodium hydroxide in the lakes with the other waste. 
Despite the heightened scrutiny from state and federal regulators at the time, by mid-September Atalco still had not repaired the levee breaches to Red Mud Lake 4 that federal inspectors cited the month before. Nor did the company thoroughly inspect its other lakes to look for similar breaches because, as the records indicate, similar breaches were there — if only the company had looked. 
On Sept. 17, MSHA inspectors found a breach in the levee around another lake, Red Mud Lake 1 East, with a stream of hazardous waste flowing freely across the roadway.
“The caustic was observed seeping through the side of the levee for approximately 50 yards across the roadway and to the ditch,” the citation states. “The mud lake is access[ed] by the plant operators daily and contractors for service, and this condition exposes them to injuries if there is a dam failure due to the seepage.”

Based on further inspections that same day, MSHA cited Atalco for a third levee break — at Red Mud Lake 2. 
On that single day, three of Atalco’s six waste lakes had confirmed breaches with streams of poisonous chemicals flowing freely to areas they weren’t permitted to go, including the Blind River Swamp — a popular recreational fishing spot in the Lake Maurepas backwaters.
LDEQ officials first arrived at the plant Sept. 20 to initiate a routine compliance inspection. Agency records show state officials met with Atalco managers, conducted an interview and toured parts of the facility. However, they were unable to inspect some of the lakes and levees because the plant manager told them the access roads were too wet to travel on. 
LDEQ first documented the levee breaches five days later when they were contacted by the federal inspectors, according to state records. Atalco had still not officially notified LDEQ of the levee breaches — something the company should have done immediately upon learning of them in accordance with Atalco’s permit requirements as well as state and federal laws. 
Local officials have also been kept in the dark. When asked about the events during an impromptu meeting with a reporter Thursday at the State Capitol, St. James Parish President Peter Dufresne said he was unaware of Atalco’s levee breaks that contaminated neighboring land and drainage with toxic waste. Dufresne declined an interview but asked the Illuminator for copies of LDEQ’s inspection reports. 
In October, the records show, state inspectors discovered erosion channels in the levee of a fourth lake, Red Mud Lake 3. They also saw for themselves the levee breaches that federal inspectors documented two months before. The erosion channels were still there, and the caustic waste was still escaping from those lakes.
So much waste had escaped that it also overwhelmed the facility’s secondary containment system, which is a network of interior ditches just outside of the levees used to catch any chemical spills or leaks from the lakes. The backup ditch at one location had overflowed, sending the toxic slurry across the highway just north of the Veterans Memorial Bridge. 
Atalco was also, as a matter of protocol, unlawfully using a stormwater ditch as a backup containment ditch. Three company officials, apparently unaware that they weren’t permitted to use the ditch for toxic waste disposal, told LDEQ inspectors that they routinely used it for containment, according to the inspection files.
In other areas, LDEQ inspectors saw that the waste slurry had accumulated to “nearly the height of the levee” in some of the lakes, the agency’s files note. The waste level in the lakes should never be allowed to rise higher than two feet from the top of the levee.
Ultimately, in site visits over the next three months, LDEQ inspectors viewed and documented levee breaches at four of Atalco’s six lakes, prompting the state agency to cite Atalco multiple times for failing to inspect and failing to repair the levees.

Erosion of the levees was a very real possibility that Atalco had long known about. In its 2010 permit renewal applications with the state, the company had addressed the topic at length, promising to prevent erosion by conducting daily inspections of the levees and keeping written logs of those inspections. The state included those as specific ongoing requirements in the final permit issued to Atalco. At that time, the company was in the process of raising its levees from 30 feet to 50 feet high, according to the permit application.
By the time state and federal officials began prodding the company last August, Atalco had not consistently inspected its lakes and levees in over three years and was missing hundreds of daily inspection records from July 30, 2021, to Dec. 18, 2024, according to LDEQ’s summary of violations.
On Oct. 23, state officials noted the company was constructing a new berm to contain the breach at Red Mud Lake 4, which Atalco had known about since at least Aug. 14. 
The breach at Red Mud Lake 3 continued until Dec. 4, according to the LDEQ file. On that day, Atalco managers accompanied state inspectors into the field when they noticed multiple streams emerging near an access road and traced it back to “one erosion channel with an estimated depth of at least 10 feet.” 










You would definitely get injuries and skin burns from it. The plants and any fish in the area would die from that. You can’t survive that high of a pH.


– Corinne Gibb, chemist, Louisiana Bucket Brigade


The chemistry of Atalco’s toxic waste
During their site visits in October, the state inspectors took pH readings from various pools of standing waste that had escaped from the lakes
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with water having a neutral pH of around 7. Lower values indicate acidity, while higher values indicate alkalinity. Substances at the extreme ends of the scale in either direction can eat through solid materials such as steel and concrete and are very dangerous to most life forms.  
The LDEQ detected high pH at every location, with one puddle logged at a high of 12.49 — the same alkalinity as most caustic drain clog removers and ammonia-based cleaners. The inspectors also photographed dead or dying vegetation, petrochemical sheens, and white and yellow chemical residues in many of the locations where the slurry had traveled. 
“Just the pH by itself is concerning … That is very high,” Gibb, the chemist, said. “You would definitely get injuries and skin burns from it. The plants and any fish in the area would die from that. You can’t survive that high of a pH.” 
State inspectors had testing done on water and soil samples from off-site locations in the public drainage system and on-site locations near the erosion streams. Simultaneously, Atalco personnel collected their own batch of samples and sent them to a separate lab for independent testing. 
LDEQ’s soil samples contained significantly elevated levels of cadmium, chromium and nickel — all toxic carcinogens. Atalco’s samples reaffirmed the LDEQ’s lab results and detected even higher levels at one location. The company’s sample taken from public property outside the facility contained cadmium at roughly 1,000% higher than what the state considers safe for people. Additionally, the levels of chromium and nickel measured 1,700% and 300% above their respective state standards, the lab reports show.

Gibb and Lomnicki, the LSU scientist, said these three heavy metals, along with arsenic, are among the most dangerous non-radioactive substances on the planet. Exposure to excessive levels can cause a range of serious health issues, including cancer and blood poisoning.
Ganga Hettiarachchi, a Kansas State University professor of soil and environmental chemistry, said cadmium could pose the greatest long-term risk because it spreads easily and accumulates in living organisms over time. Enough small doses during a given time period can add up to a fatal dose, she said. 
Cadmium is highly toxic to humans in short- and long-term exposure settings. Small concentrations ingested or inhaled can cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, while higher concentrations can cause cancer, cell death, neurological damage and organ system failure, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Increasing the risk from cadmium is that it can be easily spread across far distances and transfer from soil into crops, Hettiarachchi said, posing risks to humans and animals if they eat those crops.
“It could easily end up in our food,” she said. “That has been historically the main pathway for cadmium.”
If cadmium gets into surface water or groundwater, it can become an even bigger problem, especially if that water is used for irrigation, she added. 
“The area of damage can expand further and further over time,” Hettiarachchi said.
Cadmium was present at elevated levels in two of Atalco’s water samples and four of LDEQ’s. The highest concentration was 400% above the level considered safe in a water sample taken from an erosion channel within the perimeter of the facility. It also had high levels of chromium and lead.
All seven water samples that LDEQ had tested contained elevated levels of arsenic. One of them taken from outside the levee of a red mud lake detected arsenic at a level 9,000% higher than state and federal safe limits, and it contained high levels of cadmium, nickel and thallium. Six out of the seven samples Atalco personnel collected contained arsenic at levels beyond what is considered safe. 
LDEQ has yet to address the risks Atalco’s red mud runoff could pose to the community. Langley, the agency’s spokesman, said it has yet to determine what the public impact might be. 
“Obviously those are things we don’t want going into state waterways,” Langley said. 
Part Two: For some nearby residents, the levee breaches at Atalco are just the latest incident in a familiar pattern. The second story in this series reveals why the incident at Atalco was foreseeable based on the history of the plant and the many accidents and environmental exposures to the nearby communities. 
“They’re turning a blind eye to it,” said Gail LeBouef, who’s lived near the plant since 1999.

They don’t recognize checks and balances nor the institutions tasked with imposing them. 
They do not recognize the rule of law. Laws that do not suit simply do not apply. 
So, a country’s governing documents such as a constitution are malleable. Truth is what they say it is, facts be damned.
Critics who challenge this – journalists and the organizations they work for, law firms, universities, disagreeable judges, artists, etc. – are in for punishment and derision. They are cast as unelected elites, liars and betrayers of the country’s ideals, the better to silence or mute their influence.
But perhaps most importantly, autocrats and authoritarians must identify enemies for the rest of us to hate. Anyone who’s not part of their tribe, ideologically, ethnically, racially, by gender or sexual orientation is a target. If they speak another language, all the better.
President Donald Trump has focused for years on targeting  immigrants.
Trump himself is a  descendant of white immigrants and is married to one, but that’s where he makes an exception. 
He has accepted white South Africans as refugees while dismantling protections for people from countries he once described as sh–holes. Which is to say, refugees who aren’t white. 
He claims white South African refugees are the victims of extreme violence. As descendants of apartheid adherents, they are members of a group that has retained its privilege in South Africa. They are certainly  not victims of genocide, as Trump claims. The data shows that they are less likely to be the victims of violence than Black South Africans.
Trump’s executive order to enshrine English as the country’s official language – America for English-speaking Americans only – is another example of whites-only tribalism. 
Long ago, the languages of European immigrants like Trump’s forebears  were thought to  delay assimilation and demonstrate traitorous loyalty to other countries. But these days, the fear is rooted around Spanish of the Latin American variety and the languages of immigrants from Asia and Africa.
Around the globe, people in  other countries think a populace fluent in many languages is an advantage, not a deficiency. 
But Trump’s American is one of proud provincialism.
In any case, immigrants already recognize English as the indispensable language of commerce and success in this country.
Ask any child of immigrants. My parents desired that I master written and spoken English, though the price was less literacy in their native language – Spanish.
My proficiency in English brought my parents the most pride.
Now, for many people, speaking perfect English is a matter of safety. Trump  is deporting immigrants of color under an assumption they are members of criminal gangs. But in many cases there is plenty of evidence that those charges are misplaced, and people are being deported  without due process. 
Trump is carelessly rounding people up and sending them to a hellhole prison in El Salvador and to other countries he would assuredly describe as sh—holes —  even to a dysfunctional non-country such as Libya, in the midst of a civil war, without giving them time to respond to the charges against them. 
He has long labeled immigrants as terrorists, although there is little discernible link between immigrants and terrorism.
Under his broad definition, importing drugs to satisfy Americans’ appetites for illicit substances is a terrorist threat,  not  a public health issue.
Even when the administration is forced to admit error in deporting people who have a legal right to be here, it is not returning them. See, Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvadoran prison.
Like many citizens of color, I’ve become hardened to Trump’s racist  animus. We’ve been cast as job stealers, criminals and a threat to American culture. This is the same animus that made the  civil rights movement necessary. 
Not so long ago, we thought  the pendulum had swung to a more equitable, inclusive country.
But then more than 77 million Americans voted for Trump for the purpose of making America great again.
A country led by an authoritarian leader who thumbs his nose at the rule of law is not the America I know. And it certainly isn’t great.

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Brandon Bell | Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

(Photo: Kansas Reflector) A Trousdale Turner Correction Center inmate serving time at a privately-run prison in Tennessee is suing the warden and staff for allowing gang members to assault him and extort money from his mother.
Filed in May in U.S. District Court in Nashville, the lawsuit claims gang members at the CoreCivic prison in Trousdale County threatened to assault inmate Charles Anderson if his mother and two family friends didn’t send them money, then beat and sexually assaulted him anyway after he complained to prison staff. 
Trousdale Turner already faces a federal civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for gang violence and murders.
The lawsuit names prison warden Vince Vantell, assistant warden Keith Huggins, investigator Robert Fohrd and a sergeant at the facility, which is run by the Brentwood-based prison operator under contract with the state of Tennessee.
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

The filing says almost as soon as Anderson was transferred to Trousdale Turner in October 2023, he became the repeated victim of violence, with gang members stealing his property and threatening and inflicting violence on him. Gang members ordered him to buy back the stolen items in a well-known prison extortion scheme, according to the filing.
Anderson then instructed his elderly mother to pay gang members’ affiliates outside the prison through mobile methods or a “green dot” card or else he would be severely harmed or killed.
Gang members armed with shanks forced him to call his mother and ordered him to tell her to make payments between $40 and $150.
“These calls were placed from (Trousdale Turner Correctional Center) lines and presumably monitored by staff at TTCC,” the filing says.
When the inmate’s mother couldn’t afford to make the payments, he asked two family friends for “protection” payments to “preserve his life.”
The family friends told Fohrd about the extortion and threats, yet the staff member did “nothing” meaningful to intervene or put Anderson in protective custody, the filing says.
In May 2024, the family friend sent multiple emails to the warden’s office about the “incessant” extortion, and at one point a prison official told the friend they were “committed” to placing him in protective custody.
Yet in June 2024, Anderson was assaulted again, and in October 2024, he was sexually assaulted by at least four gang members with a broom handle. They claimed he owed them $1,000 for “debt.” No staff members intervened, the filing says.
The victim received treatment at Nashville General Hospital in October, but when he returned to the prison, gang members attacked him again and poured “scalding hot water” on his face as he slept.
Despite receiving medical treatment, he wasn’t placed in protective custody and was attacked again and threatened if he didn’t perform sexual favors for the gang members, which he refused to do, according to the filing.
A corrections officer recommended he be put in protective custody, and staff reviewed the request. After repeated complaints and a request to file a Prison Rape Elimination Act complaint, Anderson met with prison officials when Vantell told him it was “okay if he was gay.” Anderson replied that he wasn’t.
“This interaction was an attempt to cover-up the rape as a consensual act and escape liability for the defendants’ acts and omissions,” the filing says.
The defendants denied his requests for protective custody, alleging he “was not honest about why he needed protective custody” and “became argumentative with the board” of prison officials.
In December 2024, Fohrd spoke with the inmate’s mother and told her to pay the gang members “one more time” to buy back his property and he would be put into protective custody. The filing says the phone call was made in the presence of Anderson and gang members.
“Because the defendants failed to stop gang violence and extortion directed towards Mr. Anderson and his family, the violence and extortion continues, without reprieve, even to present,” the filing says.
Since last October, the victim has received multiple disciplinary write-ups for refusing his cell assignment, because he believes “segregation” is the only way to be protected from “constant gang violence,” according to the filing. Yet he remains in the general population.
Vantell resigned as warden in April after being placed on involuntary administrative leave amid the Department of Justice investigation into inmate physical and sexual violence, as well as understaffing at Trousdale Turner.
The plaintiffs are represented by Moseley & Moseley Attorneys in Murfreesboro and Leanne Thorne in Lexington, Tennessee.
A CoreCivic spokesman said the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation but added that “the safety and well-being of every person in our care is a top priority for our leadership and the staff at our Trousdale Turner Correctional Center.”

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is asking the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a federal judge’s decision to dismiss its latest lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Standing Rock filed the lawsuit in October, asking the court to find the pipeline must be shut down because it still lacks an easement authorizing it to pass under the Missouri River’s Lake Oahe reservoir, which is regulated by the Army Corps.
“The Corps of Engineers has not earned the trust of our Tribe,” Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire said in a statement last week announcing the appeal. “We cannot rely on the Corps to properly evaluate DAPL, so we are continuing our legal efforts to protect our water and our people from this dangerous pipeline.”
Greenpeace seeks reversal of verdict, arguing jury wanted to ‘punish’ someone for pipeline protests

The Army Corps originally granted the easement to the pipeline’s developer in 2017, but Boasberg revoked it in 2020 after finding the agency had issued the permit without completing the full environmental review required by federal law. The matter was brought to him through a lawsuit the tribe filed against the Army Corps in 2016.
Boasberg at the time directed the Corps to withhold making a decision on the easement until it completes a full environmental impact study. He also ordered the pipeline to be shut down, though that demand was later reversed by an appellate court.
Five years later, the Army Corps still has not finished the environmental review. It published a draft in late 2023. 
Standing Rock in its latest suit argues that keeping the pipeline open without an easement is a violation of federal law. The tribe also alleges the Army Corps is at fault for a number of other regulatory violations related to the pipeline.
In court filings, Standing Rock has said it intends to present new evidence related to the pipeline’s safety. The pipeline company has indicated previously it does not consider that information credible.
U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg tossed the suit in March, finding that the courts cannot intervene in the matter until the Army Corps wraps up its environmental study.
“No matter its frustration with Defendants’ sluggish pace, it is not yet entitled to a second bite at the apple,” he wrote in his March order.
Boasberg previously indicated that while the agency works on the study, it has the option of enforcing its property rights since the pipeline is operating on federal land without authorization.
“The Corps has conspicuously declined to adopt a conclusive position regarding the pipeline’s continued operation, despite repeated prodding from this Court and the Court of Appeals to do so,” he wrote in a 2021 order.
Standing Rock leaders say they hope the D.C. Circuit will overturn Boasberg’s decision to dismiss the case.
In her statement, Alkire said the tribe fears the Army Corps’ study will “whitewash” the pipeline’s risk to the surrounding environment.
The pipeline crosses Lake Oahe just north of the Standing Rock Reservation. The tribe opposes the Dakota Access Pipeline as a threat to its sovereignty, water supply and cultural heritage sites.
Federal judge dismisses Standing Rock’s latest lawsuit over Dakota Access Pipeline

Alkire also underscored the tribe’s dismay over a March jury verdict that found the environmental group Greenpeace at fault for damaging the pipeline developers property and business as part of its protests against Dakota Access Pipeline. The jury ordered Greenpeace to pay the company, Energy Transfer, roughly $667 million.
Standing Rock has criticized the verdict as based on a false narrative that Greenpeace, and not Standing Rock and other tribes, led the protests.
“We saw Energy Transfer’s efforts to re-write history as we know it and lived it in their lawsuit against Greenpeace,” she said.
In April, another federal judge ordered the Army Corps to pay North Dakota $28 million in connection to the anti-pipeline protests, finding the agency’s actions had wrongfully forced the state to pay millions policing the protests and cleaning up the aftermath.
The Dakota Access Pipeline passes through unceded land previously recognized as belonging to the Sioux Nation in 19th century treaties with the U.S. government.

(Aristide Economopoulos for NJ Monitor)West Virginia’s school voucher program, the Hope Scholarship, is clarifying how students can use the money for education expenses after parents asked to purchase ammunition, gaming consoles, live animals, witchcraft herbs and more through the program. 
“We had the request for witchcraft herbs and a cauldron,” said Amy Willard, assistant treasurer for the Hope Scholarship Program, at a May 16 scholarship board meeting. The request was denied.
The Hope Scholarship, which launched four years ago, provides roughly $4,900 per student in tax-payer funds to be used for private schooling tuition, homeschooling, microschools and more. Around 11,000 students used the program during the 2024-25 school year.
Parents who utilize the Hope Scholarship for homeschooling use a portal to purchase a wide range of educational materials, like curriculums, iPads, water tables, bee keeping materials under $200 and more from vendors. Parents are permitted to use the money for horseback riding lessons and dance studio fees. Hope Scholarship funds are not sent to the parents.
Carrie Hodousek, communications director for the State Treasure’s Office, said some items are pre-approved and don’t require a manual review by the board. Other items are reviewed by an individual or multiple individuals either in the Treasurer’s Office and/or the Office’s contracted program manager, she explained.
“These items are brought to the board for approval or disapproval,” she said.
On May 16, the Hope Scholarship Board issued an updated list of unallowable expenses based on parents’ requests. Along with witchcraft herbs, live animals and ammunition, the board said the funds may not be used on these additional items and more: travel sports fees; household furniture, including desks and couches; virtual reality equipment; athletic equipment in excess of $500; medications and supplements; chicken brooders; heat lamps and chicken coops in excess of $400.
 “In none of these instances were these items successfully purchased without authorization from the board,” Hodousek said. 
“If items are placed on the non-qualifying expense list, it means that the Treasurer’s Office did not allow those purchases to go through and then requested guidance from the Hope board as to whether they should be permissible expenses,” she added.
The Hope Scholarship program is expected to grow to 50,000 students by 2026, and the price tag has already raised concerns among the GOP-led Legislature, who largely back the program as part of their school choice push. 
Lawmakers recently approved $97 million for the Hope Scholarship for the upcoming school year — up from this year’s $58 million in funding for the program. It was the largest funding increase requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in his first budget proposal.
In 2027, its price tag is expected to skyrocket to around $300 million, when the program will open up to all students in the state. 
“We are leaving other vitally necessary programs underfunded because of an increase in this line item,” Del. Elliott Pritt, R-Fayette, said in April as the House debated bills that funded the program. Pritt, a public school teacher, noted the state’s public employee’s insurance program, which insures teachers, continues to struggle. 
Democratic lawmakers in the House proposed a bill banning the use of Hope Scholarship funds at out-of-state schools, but the measure wasn’t taken up for consideration during the legislative session. More than $122,000 in Hope funds were used at out of state schools last school year.
Public school leaders have said the growing number of students using the program has continued to financial issues as the state is facing a wave of school closures. Under the current school funding formula, counties receive state funding based on the number of students. West Virginia is also experiencing an overall population decline.

The county got more than $1 million for residential improvements like plumbing and weatherization through the Whole Home Repair Program, which has since run out of its American Rescue Plan funding. State lawmakers are proposing a similar successor funded at $50 million per year. (Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)A home repair program that Pennsylvanians really seem to need, based on the response, could continue if state officials can agree on how to run it.
A bipartisan group of state legislators announced – just before budget talks officially start in Harrisburg – they’ll co-sponsor forthcoming legislation creating the PA Home Preservation Program.

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/31epHPP-web-audio.mp3
 
Gov. Josh Shapiro’s proposed budget allocates $50 million for the program.
It took mere months to spend four times that amount through the similarly-focused Whole Home Repair Program.
The WHRP diverted $125 million to financing weatherization, plumbing and other essential improvements to thousands of residential units across the state starting last September, according to the state Department of Community and Economic Development.
And more 18,000 applicants, combined, were left on waitlists kept by pass-through agencies, according to the planned bill’s co-sponsorship memo.
Lawmakers used a one-time federal infusion from the American Rescue Plan to create the WHRP. 
Program requirements limited homeowners to those making no more than 80 percent of median area household income. Landlords couldn’t own more than five properties and 15 affordable units across all properties. And it capped project costs at $50,000 per unit.
State officials view the WHRP as a pilot for the proposed PA Home Preservation program that’s intended to be more permanent.
“It is not easy to sort of do all this coordination, build out relationships with contractors, … [and] sub-grantees,” said DCED Secretary Rick Siger during the agency’s budget hearing earlier this year. “But we have a path now…informed by, frankly, just learning a bunch of stuff as we ran Whole Home Repair.”
The new initiative likely would have income limits for homeowner recipients and prioritize senior citizens, according to prime sponsor Rep. Lindsay Powell, D-Pittsburgh.
Other than that, few details have been hashed out, Powell said Friday.
But one would be an effort to keep program guidelines as consistent as possible, she said. She cited constantly changing expectations and reporting requirements as a major challenge during her time on Pittsburgh’s Urban Redevelopment Authority Board.

Siger, Powell and others have pointed to the age of Pennsylvania’s housing stock as another reason to invest in renovation and rehabilitation, with nearly 60 percent of homes statewide dating back to before 1970.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shamokin3-1024x742.jpeg,,,2025-06-02 06:00:17.622397

(Photos by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Few Rhode Islanders think they are better off financially so far in 2025 compared to last year — and not many think Gov. Dan McKee is doing a good job, according to new polling from the University of New Hampshire (UNH).
The latest Ocean State poll found only 15% of 653 Rhode Island residents surveyed between May 22 and 26 believed they were doing better than in 2024. Another 40% said their finances were the same, while only 45% believed they were doing worse.
UNH’s poll has a 3.8% margin of error. 
The top reason for financial concern was an expectation of higher prices and inflation, which was cited by 87% of those who believe they will be worse off by 2026. Rhode Islanders polled also remained pessimistic about making future investments, with only a quarter of respondents saying now is a good time to play the stock market.
Only 19% said they felt that now is a good time to look for a new job.
UNH’s economic survey comes just a day after releasing a poll showing 19% of respondents approved of McKee’s job performance — a drop of 10 points from a year ago. It’s an even sharper drop from a Morning Consult poll released in mid-April, which gave McKee a 43% approval rating and the fourth-highest disapproval rating among the nation’s 50 governors. 
About 74% of the Rhode Islanders polled by UNH  said the governor should not run for reelection in 2026. That includes 60% of Democrats surveyed.
McKee made his re-election bid official in March and remains the only candidate to officially throw his hat in the ring. But a significant chunk of those polled may be interested in seeing former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes run again. She lost to McKee by 3 percentage points in a five-way Democratic gubernatorial primary in September 2022.
UNH’s poll found that 32% of respondents want Foulkes to enter the 2026 race.
Foulkes’ campaign manager, Jon Romano, celebrated the survey.
“What this poll reveals is what Helena is hearing in every corner of our state: Rhode Islanders know the current system has failed them, they’re dissatisfied with state leadership and the direction of our state, and they’re demanding the kind of meaningful change that will finally put their needs first,” Romano said in an emailed statement.
McKee campaign spokesperson Mike Trainor declined to comment on UNH’s poll. But the governor has proudly proclaimed the state has improved under his tenure, citing Rhode Island’s 24th overall spot in the latest U.S. News & World Report “Best States” ranking — a 10-spot jump since the governor ascended to the job in 2021.
The ranking specifically had Rhode Island’s economy climbing 12 places from 28 to 16 between 2021 and 2025. Rhode Island is currently ranked #8 in the “Business Environment” subcategory, up one from 2024. In the past year alone, the state jumped 18 places to reach #14 in the “Growth” subcategory.
Another 23% of those polled by UNH are open to former Republican candidate Ashley Kalus running again, while 19% are open to former Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo returning to the State House.
President Trump’s job approval in Rhode Island fell slightly. The latest poll had 37% approving and 61% disapproving of his job as president with 2% unsure. That’s down from 40% approving and 59% disapproving with 1% unsure a year ago.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)A federal award funding a collaboration between Kentucky’s largest utility, the University of Kentucky and other partners to implement a new system capturing greenhouse gas emissions is among two dozen energy-related awards the Trump administration terminated last week.
The $72 million award terminated by the U.S. Department of Energy funded the testing of a carbon capture system on a natural gas-fired turbine operated by electric utility Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities at its Cane Run Generating Station in Jefferson County. 
Carbon capture refers to technologies that seek to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels by capturing and storing carbon dioxide before it’s released into the atmosphere. The utility described the project last year as an “important step in assessing the future viability” of carbon capture technology for natural gas-fired power plants. LG&E and KU, which serves more than 1 million customers in the state, would have captured a portion of carbon dioxide emissions to be potentially reused by a nearby manufacturer, according to a press release. 
Liz Pratt, a LG&E and KU spokesperson, in a statement said the utility was “disappointed” the award was terminated but remained “focused on driving innovation and important research and development in this space.” 
“​​Together with our project partners, we will review our options for advancing this important research project,” Pratt said. 
Among the other awards terminated Friday by the DOE included a number of other carbon capture and storage projects and a project by multinational alcoholic beverage company Diageo that sought to add batteries to decarbonize production facilities including in Shelbyville, Kentucky. 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in a Friday statement said canceling the approximately $3.7 billion in total awards was “in the best interest” of Americans. 
“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in a statement. 
Investment into carbon capture systems played a large role in the energy policy of the former Biden administration, which sought to require utilities with coal-fired power plants operating past 2039 to capture 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from the plants or have those plants retire by 2032. That carbon capture requirement also applied to new natural gas-fired power plants. The Trump administration has swiftly reversed course, reportedly planning to eliminate any caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. 
Supporters of carbon capture technologies generally say it’s necessary in transitioning to clean energy and addressing industries that are hard to decarbonize, while skeptics, including environmentalists, question whether the technologies will allow for the further burning of fossil fuels. 
Byron Gary, an attorney with the environmental legal organization Kentucky Resources Council, told the Lantern the award termination fits into the Trump administration’s “broader strategy” of “trying to undermine climate regulation.” 
E&E News reported Friday that the Trump administration is expected to argue the U.S. power sector, a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change. 
Gary said while his organization would rather see investment into zero-emission renewable energy paired with utility-scale batteries, the award terminations appear to ensure carbon capture technology isn’t a “viable option” for the future.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1095-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 06:00:17.622397

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver




Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.

“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 mini-grants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
‘Wasteful grants’
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
Impact on communities nationwide
In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

A 19-member legislative commission met last month, its first convening since a mandatory hiatus during the 2025 legislative session was lifted. Enacted last year, the commission received an additional $200,000 in the state budget signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in May, a major bump from the $28,760 it was initially allocated. As it prepares to enter its second year, the group is poised to deliver Virginia’s only known comprehensive statewide examination to date of how public universities displaced Black communities — and what forms of redress may be appropriate. 
In Newport News, a separate task force has also been working since last year to address the displacement of a once-thriving Black neighborhood that was usurped to make way for Christopher Newport University. The neighborhood, enclosed by Shoe Lane and three other streets, was home to several generations of families who were forced to move when an all-white city council voted to seize a large portion of the area through eminent domain in the 1960s, paving the way for the school’s construction. The university’s expansion over time led to the acquisition of remaining homes. Today, only five remain. 
The local response to probe this history, running parallel to the state-level work, is led by the city and university and has laid bare ongoing tensions among some impacted residents of the neighborhood and their descendants. The community members have raised integrity questions about the task force’s work, and frustrations remain high for some who say they are still waiting for the impact of their displacement to be fully acknowledged and addressed. 
“We’ve done this before, time and time again,” said Angela Mickel, one of several attendees of a March documentary screening and discussion on Black community displacement, who expressed frustration towards public officials over long-term inaction on the issue. Like others in attendance, Mickel said she felt formal recognition of the community’s complete loss was long overdue.
“We have many stories that we need to tell, and Newport News needs to reconcile with its own history.”

 Mapping ‘a pathway toward healing and repair’

While Virginia’s state commission and the Newport News task force have indicated that engagement with impacted residents will be critical to their work, both are still navigating how best to do so.
At the state level, the legislative commission has created a subcommittee focused on African American displacement in Virginia. When they reconvened in May, members adopted a formal work plan outlining how the commission will gather input from those directly affected by university expansion. That could include in-person public hearings, virtual comment periods, or an online platform for submitting written testimony.
“This particular work is pivotal to the work of the committee,” said Del. Karen Keys-Gamarra, D-Fairfax, who suggested that outside experts — not legislators themselves — take the lead on organizing and facilitating community engagement. “I would not assume that the legislators would be responsible for that … that would speak to the level of integrity of the work that comes out of that committee.”
All four subcommittees — tasked with conducting research, liaising with universities, documenting community displacement, and exploring forms of relief — have meetings scheduled through the summer and fall, with the goal of presenting recommendations for the full commission to consider ahead of the 2026 legislative session.
Commission Chair Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, expressed optimism about the direction of the work, particularly with the additional funding recently approved by the General Assembly.
“We are moving in the direction of and the process of acknowledging history, and listening to those who have been impacted, and seeking a pathway toward healing and repair,” she said.

A date for a public forum is still being determined in Newport News, where the city-university task force formed in April 2024 has faced criticism over limited transparency and slow outreach — largely due to lack of public access to its meetings and sporadic updates on its progress.
The task force has said outreach to families is ongoing, though members have also acknowledged that coordinating those meetings has taken longer than expected.
In a February city council work session, as members raised questions about the task force’s outreach efforts, the group’s co-chair, Vice Mayor Curtis Bethany, said the group wanted to prepare before beginning “full-blown” outreach, calling the issue “extremely sensitive” and noting task force members didn’t want to approach the community with a “half-baked pie.”
Public remarks from at least one task force member have indicated that the impending public meeting would involve gathering community feedback. 
“We want to get the input from the citizens, from the families that lived on Shoe Lane, and from other families that grew up in Newport News,” said task force member Councilman Cleon Long at the March event.

 Virginia mirrors a nationwide pattern of Black displacement 

As Newport News formally examines the impact of university expansion on Black families, stories of similar displacement are reemerging from other parts of the state.
Adrienne Jackson-Franklin said her father, Otis, was young when her grandparents were among those forced to relocate when Longwood University in Farmville expanded into a bordering Black community in the mid-20th century. Former residents and locals in the area recall that the university cleared community blocks in phases to build dorms and academic buildings, displacing many families by threatening or using eminent domain.
“You lose friends, you lose connections, you now have to rebuild, and it’s almost like starting over,” Jackson said. She told the Virginia Mercury that she’d be willing to speak with the commission and believes it’s important that the state group address generational “deep-seated trauma” that may exist among families impacted by the displacement.

Lamberts Point, a once-thriving middle-class Black community in Hampton Roads, was partially razed in the 1960s and ’70s to make way for a branch campus of the college of William & Mary — now the main campus of Old Dominion University (ODU) in Norfolk. Thomas Harris, a longtime resident who moved to the area in the 1970s, said he has worked with remaining neighbors to address the continuing impacts of the expansion.
“I think they should have a whole lot to say about it,” Harris said of displaced families. “It tore up their homes. It tore up their families—they had to leave and go somewhere else to start all over again.” 
Longwood and Old Dominion have both said they have worked to improve relationships with communities impacted by their expansion.
Longwood pledged to end its use of eminent domain for campus expansion in 2004, according to a spokesperson. ODU offers financial support for Lamberts Point residents admitted to the university, including scholarships either specifically for neighborhood residents or those that prioritize them.
Across the country, efforts to reckon with university-led displacement of communities of color vary. Davarian Baldwin, a historian and urban studies scholar, said Virginia’s statewide investigation stands out nationally as few other states have sanctioned similar examining bodies.
“In my research I haven’t heard of another one,” Baldwin said. “There could be commissions in almost every state in the union (but) a reparations commission around urban renewal is singular.” Baldwin co-founded the Renewal Project, a national network launched in 2022 to support local responses to campus-related displacement, including efforts in states like Kentucky and Colorado.

In both states, impacted residents are directly involved to some degree in reconciliation efforts. Descendants of the displaced Jonesville community in south Kentucky sit on a reconciliation workgroup led by Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, which was established in 2022 to identify ways to address the lasting impacts of the neighborhood’s destruction in the 1960s.
In Denver, descendants of a Latino community displaced from the former Auraria neighborhood in the 1970s hold the majority of seats on a nine-member council formed last year comprising representatives from several universities involved in the original displacement, including the University of Colorado Denver. The council oversees the future use of homes and a church that were saved from demolition, now part of a historic park.
 What’s next

The months ahead may bring key developments in both the state and local investigation.
In addition to the impending public forum, members of the Newport News task force have publicly said a website could launch this spring or summer to make their research findings publicly accessible.
At the May meeting, the commission was still working to acquire responses to a survey it distributed this winter to most of the state’s 45 public institutions of higher education listed by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV). The survey included several questions about campus expansion, including queries on schools’ knowledge of displacement in Black communities. The Virginia Mercury polled the 15 four-year public institutions and 23 community colleges on that list. A majority said they had responded or planned to respond to the commission’s survey, including Christopher Newport, Longwood and Old Dominion University.  
McQuinn said she expects the additional funding received from the amended budget will allow the commission to bring in more resources which could support the subcommittees work including hiring consultants or, if needed, project managers.
“One of the reasons that we were not able to make as much progress as I think we needed to make was because there was limited funds,” McQuinn said.
“The additional dollars are going to be essential in us feeling that the outcome (is) something that is worthy of the community.”



Davarian Baldwin, a historian and urban studies scholar, outlined figurative and tangible acts of repair universities, the state and localities could enact as they address the long-term impact of Black community displacement statewide. 

Repair for property-impacted residents could take structural forms such as: direct payments to affected families; scholarships for descendants of those displaced; community development initiatives like affordable housing and community centers; and Community Benefit Agreements ensuring job training and procuring contracts from small businesses.
Given that universities are often property tax-exempt, an alternative approach could involve redirecting Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) directly to affected communities rather than the city.
Commemorative efforts could include integrating the community’s history into university curricula; placing historical markers; renaming buildings; and other forms of public recognition that acknowledge the past while fostering ongoing community engagement.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryAmid federal and state funding cuts, freezes and delayed payments, the outlook is grim for free clinics in Virginia that have had to trim or halt some services, but there is hope, Health Brigade executive director Karen Legato said Thursday evening. 
“Care is resistance,” she reiterated during a speech outside of the clinic’s Thompson Street location in Richmond. 
Having first opened in 1970 as the Fan Free Clinic, what is now known as Health Brigade was the first free clinic established in Virginia. It is one of about 70 free clinics currently in the state that provide care to uninsured or underinsured people.
The Thursday gathering brought workers, volunteers, supporters and patients of several Richmond-area free clinics together for a town hall to express concerns and frustrations and to brainstorm ways to keep doors open and patients served. 
Before her calls to action, Legato shared that Health Brigade alone has lost $1.8 million in state and federal funding over the past year. Programs that have taken a hit include ones that offer HIV/AIDS treatment and testing for diseases like Hepatitis C and Tuberculosis, as well as a clean syringe program that also provides naloxone kits — the medication that reverses opioid overdoses. 
“We are witnessing the largest cut in the health care safety net that’s ever been made,” Legato said.
What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

In March, President Donald Trump’s administration announced it was planning to pull back $11.4 billion in COVID-19-related funds for state and local public health departments. Virginia’s Department of Health had to prematurely end three such grants, resulting in a loss of $219 million and about 500 employees, according to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by The Mercury. 
Among the crowd was Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, and a staff member representing Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield. Hashmi serves as the chair of the Senate’s Education and Health committee while Willett had carried a budget amendment hoping to boost funding for Virgnia’s free clinics that did not survive legislators’ negotiations. 
Both lawmakers have noted that they’re monitoring how federal actions are affecting Virginia. Willett said last week the state legislature could reconvene for a special session later this year — particularly if Congress and Trump achieve the steep cuts in federal Medicaid funding GOP lawmakers are pursuing as part of a “big, beautiful bill” designed to shave trillions from the country’s budget. The measure has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives and will be debated in the U.S. Senate this summer. 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


At Thursday’s town hall, some speakers recalled that Gov. Glenn Youngkin held back $900 million of Virginia’s budget surplus pending federal government actions, and posited that some of that funding could bolster Virginia’s free clinics or help support any federal Medicaid losses. Meanwhile about $1 billion is earmarked in the state budget for tax relief to Virginians — resulting in $200 for individuals or $400 for joint filers. While that cash could be beneficial to families in the short term, Legato said that money could be better spent investing in public health. 
“While we’re gutting this safety net, we’re worried about getting some chump change back to people in Virginia. I think it’s disgusting,” Legato said. 
Youngkin carves out $900 million as Virginia prepares for Trump-era uncertainty

Her organization reached out to the Youngkin administration in recent weeks, she said, to nudge the state government about $300,000 in reimbursement payments it owes the clinic. She added that Health Brigade almost couldn’t make payroll earlier in May. 
“Some of the struggle we have had in the past year … is when you’re having grants from the state … the safety net has to finance the state services until you get paid from the state.” 
A Youngkin spokesman didn’t respond to request for comment by press time.
As Health Brigade handles several public health services, it  fronts the cost for testing and treatment and then seeks repayment from the state. 
“When we run out of cash because we’re waiting for the state to pay, we have to go to a line of credit to float us until those payments come in,” she said  “What that means for us is that our line of credit bottoms out. So we’re at $500,000 on our line of credit right now. We can’t get any more.”
Other speakers included representatives from neighboring clinics, like CrossOver, which has lost $935,000, and Daily Planet, which is facing $1.3 million in cuts from federal grants and state-administered payments. 
In recent days, Daily Planet learned that federal funding for its “Every Woman’s Life” cancer screening program has been frozen, Dr. Patricia Cook, a chief medical officer, said. The program is meant to help uninsured and underinsured people catch breast or reproductive organ cancers early on. 
Detecting and treating illnesses early is something that Dr. Jeffry Reihl, an emergency medicine doctor, said is paramount to avoiding costly ER overflows and poorer health outcomes. 
“I feel that this is going to flood our emergency departments with more and more patients who are sicker because they haven’t gotten care as an outpatient they should have gotten,” he said. “It’s just going to make an overburdened system even more overburdened.”
McClellan, Virginia Democrats warn of dire impact to state if proposed Medicaid cuts materialize

His argument echoes that of U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, who has recently cautioned her congressional colleagues against cutting Medicaid. Without preventative care within reach, people will likely flood emergency rooms when they need care, McClellan said at a press conference last month. As hospitals are federally-required to provide care, uninsured patients who cannot pay can become a shared financial burden on taxpayers.
 “These cuts are impacting multiple nonprofit health clinics, public health departments, hospitals and medical providers across the state,” Legato said Thursday as she connected the dots between how state and federal funding helps local health care providers serve the public. “We are now on the verge of the feds taking a chainsaw to Medicaid, which will exacerbate the crisis of access to primary care for low-income residents and vulnerable community members.”
To counter the current losses, Health Brigade plans to put the building it owns up for sale. It will lease space to operate from the future owner while it secures a new location down the line, she said. 
The organization also plans to host future town halls with other local health partners to discuss intersectional health issues like housing and homelessness, and to make calls to action for fundraising. 
“Now is the time for courage, creativity and turning caring into action,” Legato said.

The Sheriff’s Office asserts that deputies are simply patrolling more vigorously where serious crimes, historically, have occurred in the county.
“We are not stopping vehicles nor doing searches on the basis of ethnicity,” Tom Julia, spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, said flatly, rejecting allegations of racial profiling. “We completely disagree that it’s targeting of any group.”
Julia made convincing arguments.
It’s understandable that concerns have arisen, however, because of longtime Sheriff Mike Chapman’s well-known, boisterous attacks against illegal immigration and its impacts nationwide. The elected Republican has frequently testified before congressional committees on the subject, often invited because of his leadership role in the National Sheriffs’ Association.
That means you can’t consider his law-enforcement initiatives in Loudoun in a vacuum.
“Over the past four years, the United States has seen an unmitigated flow of undocumented and criminal aliens enter this country with many localities throughout the United States encouraging their sanctuary despite minimal, if not a total lack of proper vetting,” he testified in December.
That was just a month after Donald Trump, who has demagogued the issue repeatedly – often in racial or xenophobic terms – was elected a second time to the presidency.
A new report from the Center for Migration Studies found that there were 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2023, using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available. 
About a year ago, Chapman noted hyperbolically on his LinkedIn  account: “We are all border states now, and the failure of this (Biden) Administration to slow the influx of undocumented immigrants has put all of us at risk.” He’d just testified at a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee hearing.
This is the backdrop in which the traffic stops in Loudoun are playing out. With 443,000 people, it’s one of Virginia’s largest localities. The stops have gained attention following the release of department statistics to the Board of Supervisors there. Loudoun Now recently reported on the issue.
From Jan. 1-March 31, deputies stopped white motorists 3,343 times and Latino motorists 1,194 times. White residents comprise 51% of the population, and Latinos about 14%, according to census figures.
The numbers of stops by deputies were up noticeably for both races from the same period in 2024 – especially for whites. (Of course, not all motorists stopped by deputies were county residents.)
More striking, though, is the number of searches for these subgroups: Deputies searched whites 31 times in the first three months of 2025, compared to 90 for Latinos. The numbers for the same period last year were 13 and 15, respectively.
Activists and residents have decried the disproportionate number of searches affecting Latinos and questioned whether they’re being singled out – possibly for undue suspicion of being undocumented immigrants.
“Even though white and Hispanic residents are getting ticketed at traffic stops at about the same rate, Hispanic residents are eight times more likely to have their vehicle searched than white residents. This is clear racial profiling,” Sarah Pace said at a recent Board of Supervisors meeting. 
“When 14% of the population accounts for 55% of all traffic stop searches, this isn’t about crime prevention. It’s blatant targeting of an already vulnerable and hard-working community,” Heather Gottlieb, a New Virginia Majority member, said in a recent news release. The organization focuses on working-class communities of color across the state.
I interviewed Sofia Saiyed, campaign director for the group’s Loudoun and western Fairfax chapter. She told me organization members say there’s a significantly heavier presence of deputies in the community, moreso than before.
“We’re also in an environment in which the presidential administration is making anti-immigrant statements and deportation stunts,” Saiyed said. “The concern that we have is that Sheriff Chapman has been very public and vocal about his alignment with Trump’s anti-immigration agenda.”
As several nonprofit officials pointed out, Gov. Glenn Youngkin also signed an executive order in February deputizing the Virginia State Police to help identify and arrest criminal undocumented immigrants “who pose a risk to public safety.”
That brings me back to Julia, the Sheriff’s Office spokesman.
He said deputies are stopping people for cause and there’s a nexus between proactive traffic enforcement, arrests and reducing the number of crimes. Julia noted the Sterling area in eastern Loudoun County has had the highest percentage of crimes for decades. Major crimes also occur there. The Sheriff’s Office, he said, is using data-driven analytics to fight the offenses.
As the department noted in a recent news release, the Eastern Loudoun Station area has “a significantly higher Latino population than in other parts of the county.”
If you patrol heavily in areas where many crimes have been reported, you’re bound to make more traffic stops and arrests.
The situation is complex. Is it profiling? Or simply smart police work? A combination?
Questions of whether the stepped-up enforcement program is targeting Latinos unfairly – alienating residents in the process – are bound to continue. Given his posture on immigration, the sheriff should’ve expected the heightened scrutiny and should now listen to his community’s concerns.

(Courtesy of lovewellfarms.com)As co-founder of Rhode Island’s only USDA organic hemp farm, and the largest outdoor cannabis farm in the state, I’ve spent the last eight years helping build the hemp industry from the ground up. At Lovewell Farms, we’ve operated under one of the strictest regulatory frameworks in the country, subject to licensing, batch testing, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) limits, secure packaging requirements, and product traceability. Yet two recently proposed bills, H6056 and H6270, would cut licensed hemp farms like ours out of the very market we helped establish.
These bills, introduced by Democratic Reps. Jacquelyn Baginski of Cranston and Scott Slater of Providence, aim to regulate the sale of hemp-derived beverages containing delta-9 THC, the compound most commonly associated with cannabis intoxication. Slater’s bill would specifically eliminate the sale of such beverages and drink mix powders in Rhode Island, unless these products are specifically included in the state’s cannabis laws. The bills misrepresent both the science behind these products and the legal infrastructure already in place.
During a recent House hearing, Rep. Baginski stated, “I was surprised to learn that hemp-based THC products are also available in the marketplace and largely sold unregulated… at any establishment with a retail sales permit. That could be a convenience store, a hair salon, a gas station, anywhere.” Respectfully, this is inaccurate. In Rhode Island, consumable hemp products must be produced by licensed handlers and tested by certified labs. They are subject to strict limits on THC content, comprehensive labeling standards, and age restrictions. If some products are being sold outside these rules, that’s a failure of enforcement, not evidence of an unregulated system.
Rep. Slater’s testimony in support of his bill, which would effectively ban all hemp-derived THC beverages unless sold through a dispensary, also included misleading claims. He asserted that “the hemp-derived THC products are now being sold outside the regulated cannabis system with minimal oversight, including limited testing, weak labeling, no seed-to-sale tracking, as well as avoidance of cannabis taxes.” This characterization erases the work of licensed hemp producers who follow every requirement the state imposes, many of whom, like us, already distribute specific products through dispensaries and operate with full compliance under existing cannabis laws.










Two recently proposed bills, H6056 and H6270, would cut licensed hemp farms like ours out of the very market we helped establish.


Slater went on to say that allowing hemp beverages undermines Rhode Island’s cannabis cultivators, whom he described as his constituents. “I really find it unfair that as soon as this market has started that we’re trying to undermine them… and allowing folks that found kind of a loophole with this synthetically altered hemp in drinks… without going through the same framework that everyone else has.” But our farm has always followed the framework. There is no loophole for us, just increasing restrictions on products we’ve made legally, safely, and transparently for years.
Both bills ignore a crucial scientific fact: Not all hemp products are intoxicating. Our full-spectrum gummies and vape cartridges, for example, often contain a CBD-to-THC ratio of 25:1 or higher. Peer-reviewed research shows that products with a 15:1 ratio or greater are effectively non-intoxicating, as the CBD counteracts the effects of THC. These products are designed for stress, sleep, and inflammation support, not intoxication. Lumping them together with high-potency THC beverages from out of state is scientifically inaccurate and economically harmful.
What’s also troubling is that these bills would hand control of hemp beverage sales to either liquor stores or cannabis dispensaries, while excluding the very farms that have driven the state’s hemp market since 2018. Rep. Baginski says she wants to “create a new safe marketplace for hemp THC beverages,” but the safest and most transparent path is the one we already have: Products that meet intoxicating thresholds should be sold in dispensaries, and products that do not should be available through licensed CBD consumable retailers. That distinction already exists under current state law.
Rhode Island can and should regulate cannabinoids based on potency, ratios, and public health risk. But it must do so with accuracy and fairness. Hemp farmers have invested many years and many dollars into building compliant, small-scale businesses rooted in sustainable agriculture and community health. We are not the problem, we are part of the solution.
My hope is that lawmakers will revisit these proposals and work with, not around, the people who have spent years getting it right. Hemp regulation should be based on science and equity, not stigma or disinformation.

It’s a universal rule of local government that nobody likes their property tax bill or the way their property is assessed. By any measure, the assessors have a tough and thankless job.
That said, it’s also true that there are unjust assessments and sometimes they’re the byproduct of historical bias and discrimination that affect large numbers of property owners. And right now, that appears to be the case in some North Carolina communities.
As NC Newsline reported last week, advocates in Orange County recently provided compelling evidence that residents of some historically Black neighborhoods are experiencing this injustice.
The advocates say newer larger homes in those neighborhoods – typically owned by white investors — are undervalued while older homes owned by longtime Black residents are systematically overvalued.
And that results in genuinely unjust tax bills.
The bottom line: To their credit, Orange County officials say they will review the data. Let’s hope they do so quickly and carefully and that the work inspires other counties across the state to follow suit.

Stock photo from Getty Images.The executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks is trying to get the word out: If the budget passed by the U.S. House of Representatives becomes reality, it could trash the state budget and make many, many Ohioans go hungry.
The matter goes next to the U.S. Senate. But the members of the Ohio delegation aren’t talking.
The House-passed Republican reconciliation budget — President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — would hand out $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. In an analysis, Trump’s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the “top 10% of the income distribution.” 
Meanwhile, the “Department of Government Efficiency” — led by the world’s richest man — has been looking to cut services for average Americans. One place the Republican House budget seeks to achieve some of those cuts is to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Also known as food stamps, the program provides debit cards for food. To qualify, Ohio recipients generally have to have net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four.
Benefits awarded under the program are pretty modest, $6.28 per person, per day on average last year. And, as a reflection of the high level of poverty in the state, one in nine Ohioans — or 1.4 million — received them last year. 
Whether Ohio’s poorest will get those food benefits in future years is an open question in light of the One Big Beautiful Bill.
“The House-passed Republican reconciliation plan would cut nearly $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through 2034, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates — by far the largest cut to SNAP in history,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote last week. “As a result of these cuts and other policies in the legislation — which are being used to pay partly for trillions in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy — millions of people would lose some or all of the food assistance they need to afford groceries, when many low-income households are struggling to afford the high cost of food and other basic needs.” 
The bill would force states to take up the slack by forcing them to pay based on error rates. In other words, they’d have to pay at least 5% more and then go up a sliding scale based on how often they were found to pay recipients too little or too much in benefits. It also would greatly increase error rates by eliminating the current tolerance for small errors — those up to $57. 
This all might sound technical, but the consequences for Ohio would be huge.
If it had an error rate of 6% or less (which it doesn’t, even under the current, more-tolerant system), the state would have to pay $158 million more a year into the program, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. At the top end, with an error rate of 25% or more, Ohio would have to pay $790 million more a year.
Under the Republican bill, error rates would surely go sharply up. But even under Ohio’s most recent rate, the state would take a massive hit. At 15% errors, the state would have to come up with $473 million a year.
“That’s almost $500 million in new state revenue that they would have to come up with just to maintain current levels of benefits,” said Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks. “That’s roughly equivalent to the entire state investment in the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services” which administers SNAP in addition to many other programs.
Novotny is worried that Ohio’s food banks would be stretched even worse under such cuts than they were after expanded SNAP benefits during the covid pandemic expired.
“We know that we can’t ever make up for the value that SNAP benefits provide to low-income working families, seniors and people with disabilities,” she said. “We’re not designed to be a first-line grocery store. SNAP invests directly in local economies. Benefits are spent at local grocers. The removal of this investment in that supply chain… I’m not only concerned about access to affordable food for people with lower resources, but also sustainability and resilience in the food-supply sector as a whole.”
Novotny said two bad-but-likely results would be bigger food deserts and less access to healthy nutrition. Those outcomes would be particularly devastating to low-income families who have seen food prices grow 27% between mid-2020 and the beginning of this year.
Asked whether Gov. Mike DeWine opposed the SNAP cuts in the Republican bill, his press secretary, Dan Tierney, was noncommittal.
“As we have seen, these proposals can change dramatically as the process proceeds,” Tierney said in an email. “We have generally reserved comments until after final proposals have been adopted.”
The offices of Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno were asked if they would support the cuts when the House bill came before them. Neither replied.
For her part, Novotny said she has an even deeper concern than overwhelmed food banks and growing food deserts. 
Asked what would happen if states can’t or won’t find the money the House budget is demanding for SNAP, she said, “We can’t get a good answer to that.”
“Fundamentally, will SNAP remain an entitlement? Will states have to administer the program at all?” she asked. “Fundamentally, it’s hard to understand how it would be required of a state to participate in the program if there’s such a significant cost burden.”
The question, at bottom, is whether the already huge number of poor Ohioans will swell and whether they’ll be pushed even deeper into poverty and food insecurity.
“I’m most concerned about what it would mean for the structure of the federal nutrition safety net,” Novotny said. “SNAP is and always has been an entitlement program. If you’re a worker who, through no fault of your own, loses your job and while you’re seeking work you need help affording groceries so that you can stay in your house… SNAP is there. Or if you’re a person who receives a really serious cancer diagnosis and you have to use some (Family and Medical Leave Act benefits) to come and get treatment, SNAP is there. If you’re a low-wage working family, or if you’re a senior on a fixed income, SNAP is there and the benefit has always been fully federally funded.”

Most of the clients Keene serves at the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in southeast Missouri are working but still rely on federal food assistance to keep up with ever-increasing costs.
The center provides a domestic violence shelter, parenting education and summer camps to struggling families stretched thin by living expenses. Keene, the center’s CEO, worries about how her clients can absorb significant cuts to food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“I don’t see communities just being able to absorb that need,” she said. “I don’t know what the impact is going to be yet, but I cannot imagine that it’s going to be good.”
Billions in cuts to federal food assistance are looming as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a major tax and spending package that would slash federal spending on domestic programs to extend tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. U.S. House Republicans passed the package in a 215-214 vote, and it’s now before the Senate.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

Cuts to SNAP would affect residents of every state in all types of communities, but advocates fear the fallout could especially hit rural people, who are more dependent on food stamps, the largest anti-hunger program in the nation.
The legislation that passed the House would cut food assistance by an estimated $300 billion, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. One key provision of the bill would expand work requirements to include people between 55 and 64 years old and those with children aged 7 or older. It would also tighten rules for counties with high unemployment rates.
Together, the changes would remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, reducing spending by more than $92 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The legislation will likely face changes in Senate negotiations. The measure was endorsed in a letter signed by 20 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors.
A greater share of rural residents currently rely on SNAP than those in metropolitan areas, according to the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit focusing on hunger and health among the impoverished. Rural hunger is already on the rise and grocery stores face an uphill battle to keep going in the most isolated parts of the country.










The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.


– — Marsha Keene, CEO of the Susanna Wesley Family Learning Center in Missouri


In her corner of Missouri, Keene said, limited job opportunities leave many workers struggling to cover housing and grocery bills. Nearly a quarter of residents live below the poverty line in Mississippi County — almost double the state and national averages.
She recalled her own recent trip to the grocery store, where high prices caused her to forgo items on her list such as orange juice and meat. “And I have a pretty good job,” she said.
“The SNAP cuts are definitely going to make an impact because we already have hungry kids.”
‘I’d probably close the doors’
The National Grocers Association has opposed the potential cuts, saying SNAP provides not only critical food, but also meaningful boosts to local employment and economies. The organization, which represents retail and wholesale grocers, said cuts will particularly hurt independent and rural stores.
“Cutting SNAP would harm the most vulnerable Americans and threaten the viability of community grocery stores that are depended upon by their local economies and neighborhoods,” the association said in a May statement.
Facing competitive pressures from online retailers and big-box stores with lower prices, rural grocery stores are already struggling to remain viable.

But deep cuts to SNAP would have an uneven impact on rural stores.
For Kay Voss, the cuts would be catastrophic at her Stratton Country Market in southwest Nebraska. She estimates 40% of sales are paid for with SNAP.
“I’d probably close the doors,” she said.
That’s a possibility with or without federal changes: Struggling to turn a profit in the town of about 340 people, Voss said the market likely won’t last much longer.
“There’s nothing to be made on the grocery side,” she said.
Several grocery store operators interviewed by Stateline were more optimistic. Some said they believed locals were using their federal benefits at chains in nearby cities for cheaper prices or anonymity.
‘The lifeblood of the community’: States invest to save rural grocery stores

Tasha Malay, one of the owners of Malay’s Market in western Kansas, said SNAP made up less than 2% of the store’s sales last year.
While she believes cuts to the federal program are “a terrible idea” broadly, she said it won’t make a huge difference for her store.
“I think the people that qualify are utilizing it, but I think that they’re spending the dollars elsewhere,” she said.
Profit margins are famously slight in the grocery industry, especially for rural stores facing an onslaught of competition from dollar stores whose bulk purchasing allows them to offer much lower prices.
“When they’re operating on such thin margins anyways, that could have a huge impact on whether or not the store can remain open,” said Carlie Jonas, a policy associate at the nonprofit Center for Rural Affairs.
The center has worked with lawmakers to preserve rural grocery stores, which provide locals with social connections in addition to fresh meat and produce. Proposed legislation to fund $2 million in rural grocery assistance did not win approval from the Nebraska legislature because of the state’s challenging budget cycle, Jonas said.
That figure, though, pales in comparison to new costs Nebraska could face if the proposed SNAP changes are enacted.
One component of the federal legislation would shift billions of costs from the federal government to states to administer SNAP.
A Nebraska-based think tank estimates the state would have to spend at least $39 million a year to make up for the lost federal funds.
“Every single state is going to have to make some really difficult decisions,” Jonas said.
Federal cuts affect regional food access; more uncertainty to come

In Wisconsin, state officials estimate the changes would cost the state $314 million per year.
“This is over a quarter billion dollars each year that Wisconsin couldn’t use for our health care, our roads, our schools, or our economy,” Wisconsin Medicaid Director Bill Hanna said in a May statement.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, downplayed the impacts of the changes.
“We are not cutting SNAP,” he said May 25 on CBS News’ political show “Face the Nation.” “We’re working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were erroneous.”
A PolitiFact breakdown published May 29 disputed Johnson’s remarks, concluding that three independent analyses show millions of people could lose SNAP benefits.
‘It’s time to sound the alarm’
Food insecurity is already on the rise in rural America.
Even in heartland areas where farming is central to the local economy, many have trouble accessing fresh and affordable food.
“We’re seeing food insecurity across the entire state rise, but really disproportionately in our more rural areas,” said Tim Williams, government affairs and advocacy officer at Food Bank for the Heartland, an Omaha, Neb.-based nonprofit serving 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa.

Williams said cuts to the SNAP program will drive up demand on food banks, especially in rural areas that have long struggled with access and transportation to secure fresh foods. In sparsely populated areas such as western Nebraska, it’s difficult to get to grocery stores — if they exist at all.
“There are counties in the state where there are more cows than people, and so things are very spread out,” he said. “They can be very difficult to get to. Sometimes there’s only one pantry or one grocery store in a county.”
The federal food program works in tandem with food banks to keep people from going hungry, Williams said. And cuts to federal aid will unquestionably affect nonprofits.
“It will put a disproportionate burden on the charitable food system that they can’t sustain because they’re already seeing too many people,” he said.
Susie Boelter, executive director of the North Country Food Bank, said it’s time to expand food assistance — not cut it. She told the North Dakota Monitor her nonprofit has experienced “staggering increases” in need over the past three years.
For every meal the food bank provides across its 21-county service area in North Dakota, SNAP provides nine, she said.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” Boelter said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Multiple people were injured Sunday in downtown Boulder when a man reportedly lit them on fire, according to local police.
Eight victims ranging in age from 52 to 88 years old were transported to hospitals in the region, police said. One was described as being in critical condition, with other victims’ injuries ranging from serious to minor.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Saliman, was taken into custody by police and was treated for minor injuries at a hospital, Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Denver field office, said during a Sunday evening press conference.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Michalek said.
The attack took place near the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall, an area in the heart of the city that typically attracts hundreds of people on the weekend. The first calls about the attack came at 1:26 p.m., Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier Sunday.
“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”
Participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, were the apparent target of the attack.
Michalek said the suspect was “heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.” He called it a “targeted act of violence” and said the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.
Kash Patel, director of the FBI, earlier on Sunday called the incident a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said it was a “heinous act of terror.”
The Anti-Defamation League said on social media it was “monitoring the situation in Colorado.”
Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the U.S. House, characterized the attack as targeting Jewish people.
“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, also indicated the group was targeted.
“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser said in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado.”

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s Office of the Child Advocate has been on the chopping block this session as state lawmakers look to trim the budget during a difficult fiscal year. However, some senators, slightly more bullish on the state’s economic outlook, have proposed a way to keep the office, albeit in a slimmed-down form.
When the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed its version of the budget, it eliminated the Office of the Child Advocate. Established in 2018, the office serves as a watchdog for New Hampshire’s youth, overseeing the state’s child welfare, juvenile justice, and youth care systems, and advocating for the best interests of children in the state. Eliminating it would save the state — which has been experiencing lagging business tax revenues — around $2.2 million over two years. However, state senators — who projected a slightly less dire financial outlook and appear more interested in keeping the child advocate — have since come up with a proposal to restore it.
“I’m trying to find a middle ground that the House will accept,” Sen. Sharon Carson, who is spearheading the proposal, said. “Keeping it but compressing it down for now and still allowing them the funds that they need to do the job I think is important.”
Carson, a Londonderry Republican and the Senate president, said she plans to propose an amendment to the budget that would restore the Office of the Child Advocate but lay off four of its employees. The amendment also gives the office the option to request more money from the Fiscal Committee in the future should the state’s finances improve over the course of the next two-year budget term.
The committee is expected to finalize the budget plan on Tuesday. After that, the entire Senate will vote to create the Senate’s final version of the budget. From there, the Senate and House will hash out the differences between their budgets before Gov. Kelly Ayotte gets the opportunity to review and either approve or veto it.
Carson believes there’s enough Republican support for her proposal on the child advocate. She hopes it’s “a path that the House can accept.” Carson serves on the Children’s Oversight Committee and has been pleased with the office’s work.
“After working with the office for a number of years, I know how valuable it is,” Carson said. “And I know the value of the work they do, so we had to try to figure out a way to save it.”
Cassandra Sanchez, who heads the Office of the Child Advocate, said she has “really mixed feelings” about the proposal.
“It’s a really difficult time to look at reducing the office in the way in which that amendment would,” Sanchez said. “But, of course, seeing an amendment come forth that continues funding to our office and does not eliminate the office altogether is a big win for us.”
Sanchez said the four positions to be eliminated are an office coordinator (which is currently vacant), a public relations and training officer, the associate child advocate (her second-in-command), and a case aide. As the budget cut threats have loomed, she’s conceded to lawmakers that if they have to cut positions, losing the public relations and training officer won’t impact their caseload management and she asked that it be removed first. 
She’s most fearful of the case aide being laid off because that position reviews all restraints and seclusions of children, and the state has been seeing rising numbers of these tactics being used, she said. 
In April, the state saw approximately 450 instances of children being restrained or secluded by a state worker, according to her office’s most recent numbers. Sanchez’s office is the only agency that reviews such instances to ensure they’re necessary and in the best interest of the child. She said the office would “be able to function quite well” with the other three positions removed “but (the case aide) is the one critical position being cut that is truly going to have an impact on the children of New Hampshire.”
The amendment also includes a provision that prohibits the office from partisan advocacy. Sanchez has been vocal in support of trans youth in the state. In April 2024, she participated in a press conference speaking out against bills targeting LGBTQ children, which ruffled feathers among Republicans. State Sen. Victoria Sullivan told New Hampshire Public Radio the advocacy is “distracting from the actual good work that’s happening with the children, with the systems.” Other lawmakers have echoed the sentiment.
Sanchez said she’s “not extremely clear on what that means,” but “could assume” it’s a reference to that press conference and other LGBTQ advocacy. She wants more clarification from lawmakers, or even an interpretation from the attorney general. Regardless, she has not backed down on the issue.
“I have had conversations where I’m willing to talk about the way in which we engage with the Legislature around those issues,” she continued. “But it would not change our viewpoint, which again, backed by psychological research, is that supporting a child and their gender identity, however they choose to explore that gender identity, supporting them in that exploration is healthy for their development. And so that is where I stand and where the office stands on those issues. And we will continue to advocate for protections of those vulnerable children and sharing factual information about the statistics and the outcomes for children when there is harmful legislation that attacks their ability to freely express themselves.”
She said leading a team where employees are aware that their jobs are on the chopping block, through no control of their own, has been “extremely difficult.”
“It’s nothing I ever thought or had planned for having to manage,” Sanchez said. “And now that it’s here, I’m really taking it day-by-day. … But it is hard because the work we do already is so heavy and so difficult, and then to add that burden of the unknown on top of it, for their own lives, their own jobs, it’s a lot for folks to deal with.”
Still, she said, the team is “not gonna let pessimism sink in.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SenCarsonMay29-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-02 05:02:38.391316

In the evenings, tourists make their way across the avenue from the French Quarter, drinks in hand, ready to take in some jazz at the clubs on Frenchman Street.
These visitors — or the current residents, for that matter — have little reason to give any thought to what once happened here in centuries past. The streetscape then could have included a cortege of enslaved Black people being forced-marched in chains from far away or from ships at the nearby docks or unloaded from wagons, all to be delivered to what amounted to urban prison camps.
Before the Civil War, the blocks on and surrounding Esplanade Avenue were home to dozens of slave pens, stockyard-like enclosures of dirt lots surrounded by high brick walls to deter escape and shield public view. Inside were men, women, and children warehoused until they could be sold, either directly from the pens or on the auction blocks somewhere in the prosperous city of New Orleans.
The pens were “foul places, attractive to flies and lice and vermin, hazy with acrid smoke from cheap pork cooked over open flames, and reeking of sweat and urine and feces and garbage,” historian Joshua D. Rothman said in his book “The Ledger and the Chain: How Domestic Slave Traders Shaped America.”
It was the stench and health concerns — not the inhumanity of the slave trade itself — that had prompted Quarter residents to push for the pens to be moved away from their fine homes into the neighborhoods along Esplanade.
The prisoners, many torn from family and friends and forced to walk or endure ship passage for hundreds of miles from the Upper South to serve new masters, were crowded inside by overseers concerned only with keeping them healthy and fit enough to bring top dollar on the market.
Passersby “might hear the cries of small children” or “the muted anguish of adults who are there, who are suffering what we call today PTSD or some sort of traumatic injury, who are trying to wrap their heads around what’s happening,” Calvin Schermerhorn, history professor at Arizona State University said in an interview.
  Slave traders often dressed up enslaved people and provided other cosmetic care when bringing them to auction. This magazine illustration titled, “Slaves For Sale: A Scene In New Orleans,” shows a group of Black men, women and children standing alongside a building beneath a sign reading “T. Hart Slaves.” The engraving is from the early 1860s. (Credit: From the Historic New Orleans Collection; gift of Mr. George Denègre)
An alert visitor can find a historical marker on the neutral ground near Esplanade Avenue and Chartres Street, marking the city’s connection to the brutal slave trade. Another marker across the intersection toward the river marks the location of the infamous slave pens where Solomon Northup, known for  “Twelve Years a Slave,” was sold into slavery.
“There’s a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever,” Northup said in his 1853 memoir of his life as a free man sold into slavery. “There will be reckoning yet … It may be sooner or it may be later, but it’s a coming as sure as the Lord is just.”
That accounting has yet to fully come to a city more associated with letting the good times roll than dealing with past sins.
Outside of historians, academics and the generational memories of Black New Orleanians, relatively few people understand the enormity of New Orleans’ involvement in the slave trade, which helped build generational wealth for white residents and made the city the most financially powerful and influential in the South.
Gregg Kimball, Senior Consulting Historian for the Shockoe Institute in Richmond, Va., maintains that the slave trade was part of the 19th century U.S. economic boom “that really made the United States a world power. It basically created American capitalism. That’s a big deal. Right?’”
For New Orleans, sugar and slaves were the driving forces for an economy that also thrived from the global cotton trade and its position at the mouth of the Mississippi River.
“It’s those three intertwined. It’s New Orleans’s status as not only a port city, but as a place where banking is based and where trading happens in sugar and cotton and slaves,” New Orleans historian Erin Greenwald said.
Slavery is in the very bones of New Orleans, where the essential protective levees, streets and core buildings were constructed by enslaved workers. Captive Black laborers helped grow and harvest the lucrative sugar and cotton crops, loaded the yield onto the ships for export and even served as collateral for plantation owners’ bank loans to expand their land holdings and buy more enslaved workers.
From the early 1800s until Union Troops occupied the city about a year after the beginning of the Civil War, New Orleans was known as the “slave market of the South.” An estimated 135,000 people were bought and sold in the city and its immediate environs at more than 50 documented places.
These are the same places where residents and tourists today celebrate Mardi Gras, sleep in luxury hotels, drink in dive bars, and eat at fine restaurants. In 2025, there is little public acknowledgement of the atrocities of slavery beyond a few mostly low-key historical markers and some local tours designed to go beyond the usual sightseeing fare.
The history of how slavery made New Orleans the city it is today rarely intrudes on the daily awareness of most people.
Greenwald said she values what she gets from reading academic histories.
“It’s great. But that’s not what’s going to penetrate the consciousness,” she said. “It’s just not. It’s expensive, it’s jargony. … Historians are speaking generally to each other. You have to have a lot of prior knowledge to access a lot of the narrative in academic history.”
  New Orleans history tour guide David Higgins traces his ancestry to a great-great-great-grandmother who he said was a slave in the French Quarter and mistress to a Dutch slave trader. When he gives an African American history tour, Higgins said, “most people are interested in hearing about progressive things that happened after slavery,” like New Orleans native Homer Plessy and his unsuccessful fight against Louisiana’s racial segregation laws in the late 1800s.

There is also the city’s reluctance to confront its painful past, focusing instead on tourism-friendly narratives and laissez les bons temps rouler marketing.
“There’s a powerful impulse to keep slavery in the rearview mirror, to present a story about the United States that is one of progress and improvement,” Rothman, chair of the history department at the University of Alabama, said in an interview. “People like to think slavery was terrible, but we fixed it. In fact, we’ve forgotten about it.”
To those who know, the city’s slave history is everywhere: former slave quarters operating as apartments and short-term rentals, historic structures built with slave labor and a culture of music and art that wouldn’t exist without the influence and contributions of enslaved residents. But it isn’t easy to track down the markers, read the academic research and all the other things that provide a thorough understanding of what happened.
In an upcoming series of articles, Verite News hopes to make the city’s connection to slavery better known and understood by residents who are not familiar with stories and connections held dear by descendants of the enslaved and to the millions who come to visit “the city that care forgot.”
The historical marker for the St. Louis Hotel, the most famous slave auction site in New Orleans, is placed at the back of the luxurious Omni Royal Orleans hotel, next to a loading dock. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people walk past it each day without pausing to read about what took place there.
The marker itself seems to downplay the connection to the slave market and its inhumanity. “The luxurious St. Louis Hotel included a bank, ballroom, shopping arcade, and trading exchange,” the marker boasts. “Six days a week, under the hotel’s domed rotunda, auctioneers sold land and goods,” before what almost seems like an aside of  “as well as thousands of enslaved people.”
Slavery-related markers on The Moonwalk by the Mississippi River, The Merieult House on Royal Street, The Cabildo in Jackson Square, slave pen locations at Esplanade and Chartres, the New Orleans Slave Depot at Common and Baronne streets, and Congo Square are also easy to overlook.

The marker notes that “The luxurious St. Louis Hotel included a bank, ballroom, shopping arcade, and trading exchange. “Six days a week, under the hotel’s domed rotunda, auctioneers sold land and goods.” Only at the end, almost as an aside, does the marker include that the auction included “thousands of enslaved people.” (Tim Givens/Verite News)
And even for those who do stop and read, the official city guidance and literature provides little context for what it means and what the reader should think or do about it. While other cities around the world have benefited from building museums, permanent exhibits, and other educational structures on painful events, including the Holocaust, race massacres, and the atrocities and injustices of the Jim Crow era, New Orleans has mostly remained on the sidelines.
The removal of Confederate monuments from prominent positions in the city sparked a great outcry in 2017 from those who said they saw it as “erasing history,” but the recognition of enslaved people’s contributions to building and molding New Orleans has not received similar support.
“There had been this resistance, I think, in New Orleans generally to recognizing darker sides of history that complicate the fun-time celebration, exotic nature tourism of the city,” said Greenwald, who put together “Purchased Lives,” an extensive exhibit on slavery that was on display at The Historic New Orleans Collection in 2015. “New Orleans is not alone in that, but they might be one of the worst examples of covering up things that aren’t part of their tourism narrative, and that has changed.”
Many of the slave markers were placed by a city commission appointed to mark the New Orleans Tricentennial in 2018. Freddi Evans, a New Orleans author and educator who was on the commission, said in an interview that the markers have had a positive effect.
“Well, I don’t know if it has an impact on the people who are coming here as tourists, but it has an impact on the people who are here, the citizens,” she said, including the descendants of enslaved people who have taken it upon themselves to keep their history from being erased. The New Orleans Tricentennial Commission does offer a slave marker tour app that provides “an immersive and dramatic self-guided tour of sites that played an important role in the domestic slave trade of New Orleans.”
  Each year, over the July 4 weekend, the New Orleans MAAFA Commemoration provides a community remembrance event “to reckon with the horrors of the Transatlantic and Domestic Slave Trades, and a release from the chains of its legacy.” The event includes a visit to the Tomb of the Unknown Slave – pictured here, next to St. Augustine Catholic Church on Governor Nicholls Street – and other locations. (Ben Estes/Verite News)
Each year, over the July 4th weekend, the New Orleans MAAFA Commemoration takes place. Sponsored by the Ashé Cultural Arts Center, participants wearing white begin at Congo Square with stops at the Esplanade site, the Tomb of the Unknown Slave (next to St.Augustine Catholic Church on Governor Nicholls Street), and other locations. Maafa is a Kiswahili word that means “great disaster” or “great tragedy.”
“Hundreds of people come,” Evans said. It’s one way the city can memorialize those who suffered under slavery.
Harvard historian Walter Johnson has written that the whole city should be considered a memorial to slavery.
“The levee is a slave-built levee. The entire economic development of the city was premised upon slavery. All the buildings were built by enslaved people or free people of color,” Johnson told The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2017.
“You could memorialize the city of New Orleans with a million markers of which enslaved people lived there, which enslaved people worked there, which enslaved people built this.”

(Getty Images)As Ohio food assistance recipients await decisions on the federal and state level about whether they will see large cuts to their benefits, some state legislators are trying to iron out other details related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Congressional budget reconciliation is ongoing in the U.S. Senate, after what anti-hunger advocates say would be a nearly 30% reduction in SNAP benefits was approved by the U.S. House in their draft of budget documents, encouraged by the Trump administration as part of efforts to slash federal spending.
Advocates say the cuts will be devastating for low-income families across the country, with rural communities disproportionately impacted, according to the national Food Research & Action Center. The Ohio Association of Foodbanks said the loss of SNAP funding would restrict services “vital for everyday Ohioans in every Congressional district.”
The potential cuts come as legislators work on the state’s SNAP program, with bills ranging from supplements to the benefits for older Ohioans to a push to prevent the defrauding of Ohioans who need the funds.
Most recently, supporters of House Bill 163 – which would make the electronic benefit cards (EBTs) that hold SNAP benefits chip-enabled, like most mainstream credit and debit cards – spoke on the impacts chip technology would offer to households. The modernization of the EBT cards would help stem fraud through “skimming,” a method of stealing information from the swipe of a card and capture of PIN numbers at checkouts.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe Ohio Poverty Law Center said fraud occurs for many individuals “in the first few days after benefits were loaded, leaving them without benefits until the next month.”
Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks said there was a congressional “pathway” for state agencies to reimburse victims of benefit theft, which took nearly $17 million in SNAP benefits from more than 34,000 Ohio households between June 2023 and Dec. 2024. But the pathway ended in December of last year, when Congress decided against extending authorization for replacement of those benefits, Novotny told the Ohio House Agriculture Committee during a recent hearing on H.B. 163.
Since then, it’s unclear how much has been stolen from Ohioans and other SNAP beneficiaries, because Novotny said “theft reports are no longer being collected.” Still, she said emergency food distribution representatives say the “issue remains pervasive.”
One of the sponsors of H.B. 163, state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, is working with fellow Democratic Rep. Desiree Tims to create a state program to replace stolen SNAP benefits in a bill that would appropriate $17 million from the state’s General Revenue Fund for the task.
State budgets and sweet drinks
State-level budget discussions have included maintaining work requirements for SNAP participants, along with other regulations related to waivers for SNAP participants.
The state budget approved by the House also included a requirement that the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services seek a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to exclude “sugar-sweetened beverages” from items that can be purchased using SNAP benefits.
While the provision of the budget doesn’t specify types of sugar-sweetened beverages, a bill introduced recently by Republican co-sponsors singles out soft drinks as an item they want to see removed from the SNAP-eligible list of products, along with candy, chips, ice cream and “prepared desserts such as cakes, pies, cookies or similar products.”
If the bill passes, those products would join alcoholic beverages, tobacco, hot foods or “hot food products prepared for immediate consumption” as SNAP-exempted items.
Last week, the sponsors of the bill said exempting “junk food” from SNAP eligibility is one way of ensuring to taxpayers that their money is being spent for the betterment of Ohioans.
“What this bill’s all about is helping focus folks who are using taxpayer money – which we’re glad to provide for folks that are having a rough time, don’t have resources at home, whatever the case may be – but just helping them realize there are better choices here than the stuff that adds calories … and no nutritional benefits,” Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, told the Senate Health Committee.
Bill co-sponsor, Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, pointed to a change “demographically in our country” toward obesity and health problems, “and it’s primarily the nutritional things that we consume.”
“We’re doing America a great disservice by ignoring the fact that what people actually need is clean air, clean water, clean food, good exercise and a little bit of sunshine,” Johnson said.
Committee member Sen. Beth Liston, D-Dublin, wondered whether discouraging sweets and soda consumption should start with a different population for which taxpayers subsidize food assistance, like the military or public universities.
“If you’re looking at how to make the best impacts, I think looking at only poor individuals that are struggling to get by may not be, certainly not the largest population,” Liston said to the bill sponsors. “There are many other tax-funded foods that we purchase, and if you’re going to be looking at it holistically, just the SNAP program is a pretty small population.”

Similar legislation is working through the Ohio House, too. But dramatically expanding the scope and availability of gaming has drawn a wide array of critics.
Between charging operators at least $50 million in licensing fees and imposing a tax rate of at least 36% on gambling receipts, the Senate proposal would generate a substantial sum of money. Legislative researchers peg the annual tax collections at almost $175 million. The bill’s sponsor and the gambling industry suggest the eventual figure could be double or triple that much.
But some critics, already in the gaming industry, worry about sharing the market with new entrants. Others, oppose the idea for religious or mental health reasons. Last week they made their case to state lawmakers.

What the bill does and who wants it
State Sen. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville, describes his bill as a way to “modernize” gambling in the state and bring Ohio in line with several of its neighbors. At hearing earlier this month he argued that online gambling is already happening, but it’s unregulated.
“Just like sports betting,” he explained, “there was a lot of illegal sports betting happening. When we legalized it, most of that went to the legal form, and we have additional protections in place there, and we also then get additional revenue to the state, so it is a win-win.”
The proposal would take a tiered approach to gambling taxes. Online sports betting would hold steady at its current rate of 20%, but sports betting at brick-and-mortar casinos would drop to 10%. Online casino-style games would be taxed at a higher rate — 36% for operators with a physical presence in Ohio and 40% for those who don’t.
Ohio lawmakers introduce separate bills to regulate online gambling

 
In addition to expanding online gaming opportunities, the bill expands the role of the Ohio Casino Control Commission. Oversight duties handled by the state racing commission, attorney general and lottery commission would fall under the casino control commission’s purview.
Not surprisingly, the bill’s supporters include casino operators. Trevor Hayes from Caesars Entertainment said they’ve been providing online gaming in New Jersey since 2014, and it’s been “additive” to their physical operations.
“We’ve found that our brick-and-mortar customers that have then tried online gaming now visit our properties 55% more,” he said.
Still, others raised complaints about how expensive a proposition it would be to establish online gaming. Ryan Soultz from Boyd Gaming offered a blunt assessment.
“I’ll just point out that fee structure that’s in the bill today would be the highest in the country,” he said.
The $50 million price tag would far outstrip the highest existing fee which is the $10 million charged in Pennsylvania.
Gambling’s critics
The Center for Christian Virtue held a press conference ahead of the latest hearing to announce more than 100 pastors around the state have signed onto an open letter opposing the legislation. Pastor and state Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, described the bill in predatory terms.
“We know that gambling appeals to those who have the lowest education, the lowest income, and the greatest debt,” Click said. “As we increase gambling especially online gambling we are hurting, we are harming, the most vulnerable people in the state of Ohio.”

As iGaming is being debated, the gambling industry is preparing to unleash hell on Ohioans.

In the committee hearing, CCV’s David Mahan pushed back on claims that the bill wouldn’t lead to more problem gaming.
“Does anyone actually believe that increased access, convenience and anonymity will not lead to increased addiction?” he asked.
He pointed to a presentation developed by an AI-gaming company called DegenX that bragged they “weaponize data to make games addictive” and build games to achieve “higher customer lifetime value.”
“Addicts,” Mahan said simply.
Brianne Doura-Schawohl from the Campaign for Fairer Gambling pointed to studies suggesting online gambling is particularly addictive.
“When we take one of the most addictive products and put it on the most addictive devices, researchers have found that this is a product that is ten times more addictive than that of other gambling products.”
She added that the lion’s share of the industry’s revenue comes from a tiny sliver of bettors — many of whom are problem gamblers or at risk of becoming one. All the benefits promised by casino operators, she argued, are outweighed by the social costs Ohioans will ultimately bear.
“Research is very clear, if you expand gambling you will increase the number of problems. And please remember this is not an individual problem, it’s a family problem, it’s a community problem, it’s a state problem.”
Tony Coder who heads up the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation said 2023 was the first year since COVID where the number of suicides in Ohio declined.
“One percent — that’s 20 folks, though — one percent,” he said. “I want to see those numbers continue to go down, and this legislation, just by everything that we’ve seen, it’s not going to help that.”

Rachel Henderson of Rumford (middle) discusses her data privacy proposal with Judiciary Committee analyst Janet Stocco (left). (Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Members of the Judiciary Committee late Friday advanced one of three proposals to better protect data privacy in Maine with the hope that the effort to rein in the reach of Big Tech would not founder as it did last year.
Before voting against her own bill, Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) told the Judiciary Committee Friday afternoon that she thinks the best chance the Legislature has to get a comprehensive data privacy law passed this year is for there to be just one plan for the Maine Senate and House of Representatives to consider. 
“To me, it’s not about having a bill in my name,” Henderson said. “It’s about the policy. Transparently, it took me a while to get there. I’ve got an ego too.”
However, that decision does not mean lawmakers agree on what the right policy is. That will still be worked out in the chambers. 
For the sake of procedure, the committee opted to advance just one of the bills, but the competing components of the plans will still have the opportunity to be considered as majority and minority reports. 
As Henderson put it, “I would hate to see happen this year what happened last year.” 
Legislature rejects paths to a comprehensive data privacy law in Maine

Last session, after a dozen public meetings, countless hours of behind-the-scenes work and sizable lobbying influence from Big Tech, the Legislature rejected two competing data privacy bills on the last day, during which floor speeches demonstrated confusion over the various differences in the bills.
The fundamental differences between last year’s legislation — namely how companies approach the collection of user data — could not be reconciled. The plans being considered this year, which lean heavily on last year’s proposals, still have those key differences, so whether a resolution can be reached this year will remain to be seen. 
The main disagreement is how to approach a standard called data minimization, which broadly means limiting the collection of personal information to only what is necessary to fulfill the consumer service. 
The legislation the majority of the committee advanced, LD 1822 sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), uses this approach. It specifically would limit the collection of personal data to only what is reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide a specific product or service requested by the consumer.
The key reason business interests at the public hearing opposed this bill was because they were concerned it would prevent them from doing targeted advertising. While Kuhn built her bill off of one of the versions last year that was favored by privacy advocates and opposed by businesses, she altered it to ensure small businesses that have to stretch their advertising dollars can access ad exchanges, which are marketplaces where companies can buy and sell advertising. 
On Friday, Maine Assistant Attorney General Brendan O’Neil said, “I don’t see a restriction on targeted advertising in the bill.”
Henderson’s bill, LD 1088, which the majority of committee rejected, would use a notice and consent model, allowing companies to collect data as long as consumers agree to it in privacy notices. Earlier in May, the committee rejected a similar bill, LD 1224, to narrow down the number of competing proposals. 
These two bills are similar to the version last session that was favored by businesses, who argued for Maine to adopt a law that is consistent with those adopted by other states.
​​There is currently a patchwork of state laws and parts of federal legislation governing the current landscape, as there remains no one federal law regulating internet privacy, despite several proposals. But more than a dozen states have modeled their laws off one first passed in Connecticut, which is the basis for LD 1088 and LD 1224. 
However, Connecticut’s attorney general has since recommended that its state Legislature amend the law to strengthen data minimization provisions rather than rely on its current “exploitable” notice-and-consent model.
Reading from the Connecticut report released in April, O’Neil said, “They start out by saying that, in many cases, serious privacy and data security concerns could have been offset, if not fully alleviated, if companies had properly minimized the data they collected and maintained. That’s really what LD 1822’s data minimization standard aims to do.” 
Maryland passed a law last year that is similar to Kuhn’s proposal, marking a departure from the years-long trend of states following what privacy advocates see as Connecticut’s watered down model.
Maine’s full Legislature will now decide between these two versions of a data privacy law.
The committee voted 7-1 against LD 1088, with Rep. Adam Lee opposed, but his minority report was to strike and replace the bill with Kuhn’s bill. Six members were absent for the vote.
The committee also voted 7-1 in favor of LD 1822, with Henderson opposed. Her minority report is to strike and replace the bill for her bill language. Six members were again absent for the vote.
Essentially, these minority reports afford lawmakers avenues to take up the versions as they see fit but, the committee hopes, without the confusion of competing bills like last year. 
With the possibility of changes coming to Connecticut’s law and waiting to see how Maryland’s law works in practice, lawmakers also prepared to have a vehicle to use should Maine pass a law and then want to amend it based on lessons learned from other states. 
A concept draft, LD 595 sponsored by Judiciary Committee co-chair Anne Carney (D-Cumberland), will be carried over into next year, which currently reads that it could “further update certain consumer privacy laws in response to recent developments in federal and state consumer privacy laws.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)In their apparent eagerness to save money and do right by taxpayers, perhaps Kansas Republican leaders could try passing laws that don’t trample on the rights of their constituents.
That’s my only response to lawsuits filed throughout May that highlight the downright sloppy lawmaking that has become a hallmark of our state’s rushed, secretive legislative session. Bills are introduced and rubber-stamped in committee, testimony from experts is ignored, and the House and Senate send them through with nary a speed bump.
Afterward, the taxpayers of Kansas have to foot the bill for any carelessness.
Let’s take a quick look at the lawsuits and their subjects. Up first, Kansas Reflector editor in chief Sherman Smith, who reported the following May 28.

Two transgender teenagers and their parents are challenging a new Kansas law that bans gender-affirming care for minors.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and the national ACLU filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Douglas County District Court on behalf of a 16-year-old trans boy and a 13-year-old trans girl. The lawsuit argues the new law violates state constitutional rights for equal protection, personal autonomy and parenting.
Senate Bill 63 prohibits health care providers from using surgery, hormones or puberty blockers to treat anyone younger than 18 who identifies with a gender that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. Health care providers who break the law may be subject to civil penalties and stripped of their license.

Next, Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski wrote about another lawsuit on May 19.

A Kansas reproductive rights advocacy group, backed by a Washington, D.C., law firm, sued state officials over a new law banning financial contributions from “foreign nationals” to support or oppose constitutional amendments.
The group, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, argued in a complaint filed in federal court Friday that House Bill 2106, which passed the Legislature in April and is set to go into effect July 1, is broad, vague and unconstitutional. The group said the bill inhibits its ability to advocate for or against future constitutional amendments. Kansans for Constitutional Freedom and its donors have received contributions from foreign nationals, the lawsuit said.
The complaint drew a connection between HB 2106 and opposition to the 2022 ballot measure that sought to limit reproductive rights. Voters rejected the proposed constitutional amendment by a 59-41 margin.

You can read the law here. You can read the lawsuit here.
But wait, there’s still more! Here’s senior reporter Morgan Chilson on May 6.

Three advocacy organizations filed a lawsuit Monday in Douglas County District Court challenging the Kansas Legislature’s attempt to “arbitrarily” reject advance ballots of voters if the mail system fails to deliver them by Election Day.
Kansas Appleseed, Loud Light and Disability Rights Center of Kansas are asking the court to find Senate Bill 4 unconstitutional. Defendants are Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Douglas County Clerk Jamie Shew.
SB 4, which the Legislature passed this year, disqualifies any mail-in ballots not received by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Previously, mail-in ballots were counted if they were postmarked by Election Day and arrived within three days later.

You can read the law here. You can read the lawsuit here.
We covered all of these proposals at various stages, from twinkles in legislators’ eyes to enshrinement in the statute books. Leaders sent the anti-trans bill to Gov. Laura Kelly as their first act of business in the 2025 session. She allowed the foreign nationals ban to become law without her signature and a warning that it “went too far.” The advance-voting bill was called “pure partisan politics” by former Rep. Ann Mah.
Sure, the deluge of wastewater emanating from the Statehouse in 2025 may have overwhelmed at times. But none of this should have come as a surprise.
If people or groups believe the government has infringed on their rights — to medical care, to advocacy, to voting — no one can be surprised if they bring legal action. When senators and representatives cast votes on such issues, they decide whether the state should place a barrier in front of the people they represent. No amount of victim blaming or sanctimonious claptrap obscures the truth.
Defending the laws falls to Attorney General Kris Kobach and his office. Who pays their salaries? You and me and all the people of Kansas. We’re all on the hook for legislative foolishness.
The state may win some or all of these suits. So may those who filed them. Regardless, their mere presence suggests that our elected officials tread far too easily into the swamps of ideological overreaction. Rather than representing all, they have bowed and scraped in service to a hateful few.
We will see the consequences play out before judges in the months ahead.

They’ll account for an estimated 9% of U.S. energy usage by that time. For our state, this could mean higher energy costs and an electric grid pushed past its limit.
But, for Ohio’s rural communities, this isn’t just a challenge. It’s also an opportunity.
As data centers pull a massive amount of energy from the grid, Ohio is pioneering an innovative solution: building “microgrids” at data center sites. Microgrids are small, self-sufficient energy systems that can run independently from the main electrical grid. They generate and store energy onsite using sources including natural gas and renewables. This approach prevents data centers from overwhelming the broader grid during periods of high demand, making the whole grid more resilient.
Ohio is uniquely positioned to scale up microgrid technology. Our state sits atop abundant natural gas reserves, including the Utica and Marcellus shale formations, providing a stable, low-cost fuel source. Ohio’s growing renewable energy sector offers further flexibility for powering microgrids in a sustainable way. Combining these resources can create a reliable energy supply tailored to the unique demands of data centers. Developing these microgrids also offers an economic opportunity, including good-paying jobs in construction, engineering, energy management, and data infrastructure.

But there’s another critical — and unexpected — benefit to integrating microgrids with data centers: growing healthy, fresh food year-round.
Data centers produce substantial heat and carbon dioxide — byproducts typically viewed as waste. Yet, these resources can be repurposed effectively through controlled-environment agriculture, turning them into powerful growth accelerators for local crops. The idea is simple: excess heat from data center operations can warm greenhouses, while carbon dioxide emissions can boost plant growth, creating ideal conditions for high-quality produce.
Imagine Ohio-grown strawberries, lettuce, and tomatoes harvested freshly in January and February, when there’s still deep snow on the ground, powered sustainably by waste heat from AI-driven computing facilities. This approach drastically reduces transportation emissions, minimizes food spoilage, and lessens dependence on distant agricultural markets.
As a sixth-generation Ohio farmer who has also spent years in energy and technology, I see exciting synergies emerging in how we grow our food and power our economy. New innovations now allow us to transform what was previously considered waste and pollution into productive resources. For Ohio farmers, creatively utilizing waste isn’t a novel concept. We’ve always turned animal waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer and crop residues into sustainable soil amendments.
Our state needs a plan to proactively seize opportunities with the growth of data infrastructure and AI — including the use of local energy, the maximization of local job creation, and other less obvious prospects like the expansion of year-round produce options. This should be a team effort: local and state governments, business leaders, foundations, the tech sector, farmers, and others all have a role to play.
If we fail to strategically plan the growth of data centers in Ohio, we risk higher energy costs and compromised grid reliability without generating meaningful job creation or community benefits. Likewise, if we fail to invest in local, sustainable, healthy food, we risk worsening a crisis of poor nutrition and chronic disease.
Ohio should show the world how to address both challenges at the same time.

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

Feb. 5, 2025. (Courtesy of Nebraska Governor's Office)Welcome to another “What If?” press conference, questions for Nebraska’s congressional delegation in Washington. Since our last session, the White House has tried to shutter the U.S. Department of Education, our tariff “policy” resembles a yo-yo, the inaptly-named “big, beautiful bill” has uglied up the nation’s balance sheet, and curious Americans have taken to looking up both “emoluments” and “original sin.”
Let’s start with the aforementioned BBB. The House kept vampire hours to pass it by a single vote, after which the yays, apparently in a fit of sleep-deprived hubris, congratulated themselves before the bill went to the Senate. We have a couple questions: 

Your own accounting firm, the Congressional Budget Office, determined the BBB gives 60% of its tax breaks to the top fifth of the income bracket, yet cuts food assistance and health care to millions of poorer Americans. How does this benefit the country and what problem does it solve?


The five of you belong to a political party that has historically railed against deficits. The CBO projects the BBB will add $3.8 trillion to the nation’s deficit over the next decade. Please explain what the economic advantage is here, given the dismal history of such cuts: See Reagan 1981, G.W. Bush 2001 and 2003 and Trump 2017 for details.

We’ll move on. During a recent congressional hearing the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security couldn’t come up with the meaning of habeas corpus when she was asked to define it. This comes on the heels of recent interviews in which high-ranking administration officials, including the president, couldn’t guarantee that federal detainees would be given due process. Hmm?

Assuming you still support habeas corpus and due process, when and how should Congress intervene when the administration ignores these most basic of principles in a country in which the rule of law is paramount?

This next question is actually a matter of math. According to the Partnership for Public Service, using numbers from the federal Office of Personnel Management, “in absolute numbers, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even as the U.S. population has increased by nearly two-thirds during that time period.” 

Even though the courts have tied up or reversed much of the Department of Government Efficiency’s work, how do you square those numbers with DOGE’s scorched-earth policy, especially since the American public has been provided scant evidence of findings of waste, fraud, and abuse, the triplex premise on which DOGE hangs its hat?

Time to talk tariffs. To date, even a casual observer would conclude that the president’s on again, off again tariff proclamations have roiled markets and created uncertainty with little resulting economic benefit. As you know, Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution gives only Congress the power to levy tariffs. 

Even though previously enacted laws allow Congress to let the president set tariffs in certain situations, could you explain and defend the “qualifying” situation in which we find ourselves and detail how Congress sitting on the sidelines at this juncture in the levying of tariffs benefits Americans?

The president has pulled $2.5 billion from Harvard University, threatened its tax-exempt status, tried to block enrollment of foreign students and pretty much wants a say in whom it should hire and what it should teach. All this to curb what he says is Harvard’s anti-semitism, a charge which, while acknowledged in part by the school, remains without specifics. (Nevermind that the president hosted a cryptocurrency dinner during which a number of coins carried virulently anti-semitic names.) Some have argued that Harvard is simply the poster child for the administration’s “war on higher education,” in the guise of eliminating DEI, CRT, essentially any voice contrary to its liking. 

First, should the government be telling colleges and universities what to teach, who should teach it and who is allowed to learn?


Please respond to the following quote as it relates to social studies and history curricula. “History is not there for you to like or dislike. It is there for you to learn from. And if it offends you, even better, because you are less likely to repeat it. History is not yours to change or destroy. It belongs to all of us.”


Could you explain what problem is solved by closing the Department of Education, which, as you know, sets no curriculum? 


Finally, does it ever occur to you that some in Washington have no idea what they are doing or worse, know what they are doing, know it’s bad for America and do it anyway? Asking for some friends.

We’ve been your eyes and ears at the state Capitol. And we’ve explained what policy decisions made in Atlanta mean for communities across Georgia. 
Administrations, politicians and agency heads have come and gone during that time, but our mission has stayed the same: To provide meaningful coverage of state policy and politics – without a paywall – to readers living below the gnat line, in the mountains of north Georgia and anywhere in between. 
As a nonprofit news outlet, our stories and photos are also available for local newsrooms to complement the vital work they are doing – and available to republish for free.
The generous support of our readers and donors to our parent organization, States Newsroom, makes all this possible. That’s especially true during these uncertain economic times when many Georgians are having to make hard choices to get by.

And today, the Georgia Recorder is moving into a new chapter. Our founding editor John McCosh is retiring and handing the reins over to me, and as the Recorder’s new editor, I wanted to take a moment to reintroduce us. 
I’ve been with the Recorder since we launched in 2019, serving you as the deputy editor. And before that, I covered state politics and policy for a chain of newspapers around the state (shoutout to CNHI). All told, I have been covering the state Capitol here for a decade now, doing my part to help tell the story of Georgia’s evolution into the swingy, purpley state it has become and all that comes with it  – and what that means for you. 
The Recorder staff includes veterans, like our new deputy editor, Ross Williams, who focuses on education and economic inequality. Senior reporter Stanley Dunlap covers energy and environmental issues, including what the Trump administration’s policies mean for Georgians and the resources they rely on. And reporter Maya Homan has joined us to cover state politics with an emphasis on voting rights and immigration. And I’m still chasing down stories about health care and the state’s safety net systems. 
We’ll all pitch in on the campaign trail. Two Public Service Commission seats are on the ballot this year, and the 2026 midterms are already ramping up, as Georgians prepare to pick a new governor and as U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff works to defend his seat in a state President Donald Trump won last year.

And you can also have our work sent directly to you every morning by signing up for our daily newsletter. We’re also on Facebook, Bluesky and Instagram. 
We may be undergoing some changes, but our commitment to you is the same: To deliver the same scrappy, independent reporting and analysis of the day’s news that you’ve come to appreciate. That kind of unflinching coverage of our state Capitol is more crucial today than it’s ever been, and we are renewing our pledge to be a resource amid the chaos for all Georgians, regardless of where they live or their ability to pay. 
We promise to always do our best to get the facts right, to be fair in our reporting and to be transparent. Because we recognize that your trust in the media’s credibility is the foundation for all that we do – not to mention foundational to democracy.

Frank Chopp, a citizen activist who became the state of Washington’s longest-serving House speaker, spent a half-century relentlessly agitating for social change.
It seemed fitting then that Chopp, who died in March, would deliver a final call for action to hundreds attending his memorial service in Bellevue on Sunday.
“We have made so much progress, but let us also remember how lucky we are,” he says in a taped excerpt of a speech on the opening day of a legislative session. “None of us go without a paycheck, none of us go hungry, none of us go homeless, none of us lack health care, none of us lack the opportunity to get an education.”
“The people we represent just want what we have,” he said. “So we have a lot to do. Let’s get to work.”
Applause and cheers erupted through the crowd of lawmakers past and present, community leaders, current and former governors, and family friends gathered in the Meydenbauer Center to celebrate Chopp, whose death March 22 at the age of 71 stunned them, coming less than three months after his political retirement.
For two hours, they told stories and paid tribute to the mustachioed maestro of politics, a streetwise and strategic solon who sought no higher office than the Seattle legislative seat he occupied for three decades. A Democrat, he managed to be both high-profile and behind the scenes, fomenting change without leaving visible fingerprints. 
“With Speaker Chopp, we witnessed a rare fusion: the heart of an organizer, the strategy of a legislator and the savvy of a political mastermind,” said Teresa Mosqueda, a King County Council member. “Frank blended these elements into a force that reshaped our social contract.”

Former Gov. Jay Inslee said Chopp’s blend of personal passion and strategic ability was the “rocket fuel” that drove significant housing, health care and social justice policies across the finish line.
Though only one person with one vote, his role in pushing the state to strengthen the social safety net, build affordable housing and improve public schools is unmatched, they said.
“Frank Chopp was the greatest legislator in the last century. Period,” proclaimed Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, a close friend and fellow Democrat.
‘Relentless’
Chopp had two North Stars. 
There was his family: Nancy Long, his wife of 41 years, and Ellie and Narayan, their children. Chopp would tear up when he’d mention them on the House floor, for they were his touchstone.
He was “an equal partner at home,” doing the laundry and shopping and “showing up for the small stuff,” Long recounted. Amid the steady seriousness of the job, she said he was funny and “sometimes downright goofy.” 
His other North Star was adapting government to serve the state’s most vulnerable.
“His daily focus from the time he was in college to the very day he died was improving the lives of others,” Long said. “Frank started with no connections, no positional power, no money, no real standing. What he had were these very adaptive personal traits, a very solid understanding of history, a curious and amazingly agile mind and a total disregard for the status quo.”
Chopp was first elected to represent Seattle’s 43rd Legislative District in 1994, an election that proved catastrophic for many other Democrats. His party lost more than two dozen seats, going from a near supermajority in the House to a 62-36 minority.

He ascended to leader of the House Democratic Caucus and, in 1999, became co-speaker with Republican Clyde Ballard of East Wenatchee when there were equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans in the House.
Democrats won a special election in Snohomish County in 2001 to gain control of the chamber and installed Chopp as speaker in 2002, a job he kept until stepping aside in 2019. He won two more elections before retiring last year.
Chopp understood persistence and patience could achieve lasting progress while impatience could trigger a political recoil. 
“He believed it only mattered to be right if you were getting results,” Long said. 
As speaker, Chopp’s sometimes cautious approach, or pragmatism, depending on one’s perspective, incited the pique of the caucus’ more caffeinated progressives.
“He was not an incrementalist,” declared Mosqueda, who emceed the portion of the memorial devoted to building on Chopp’s legislative and political legacy. “He knew that bold, progressive victories require smart, strategic steps. He was relentless in his drive to dismantle inequity, and his strategies were thus layered and often multi-year.”
Inslee said Chopp recognized the potential that a temporary victory could derail policies and cause Democrats to lose seats.
“He made sure that we didn’t get too far out ahead of the people,” he said.
Chopp was the grandson of Croatian immigrants. His father began working in the Roslyn coal mines at age 12 and later became a union electrician at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. His mother served as a school cafeteria employee. She left school at 14 to work but earned her high school diploma from Green River Community College at age 65, according to his obituary.
He grew up in Bremerton and graduated from the University of Washington. He served several years as executive director of the Fremont Public Association, now known as Solid Ground, which offers resources such as food banks, housing and employment programs.
  Frank Chopp, the former speaker of the Washington state House of Representatives, was known for carrying note cards on which he wrote ideas he had or heard from others. At his memorial Sunday, attendees were encourated to write memories of Chopp on note cards and put them on a wall for others to read. (Photo by Jerry Cornfield / Washington State Standard)
In his 30 years as a lawmaker, he focused heavily on housing and homelessness, working to increase the amount of affordable housing across the state, improve access to homeownership and house people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
He helped start the Seattle Tenants Union and the Cascade Shelter Project, living in a geodesic dome in a rented parking stall to bring attention to the need for affordable housing in the area.
He helped lead efforts to set up the state’s Housing Trust Fund and its Apple Health and Homes program, which uses Medicaid dollars to fund housing. Creation of the state’s covenant homeownership program was one of the crowning achievements of his tenure. 
Chopp also pushed policies to expand behavioral health care facilities, child care access and student financial aid for more Washingtonians. 
Yona Makowski, a longtime budget analyst with the House Democratic Caucus, said Chopp was “willing to break tradition and adapt government procedures” to achieve broader objectives. 
“I’ll lose my composure if I talk about what Frank meant to me,” she said, instead offering what her family members thought of him. “They knew him from me talking about him at the dinner table.”
“My son thought he was a great strategist in getting meaningful things done to help disadvantaged people. My daughter compared him to the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, but if the wizard was actually the hero,” Makowski said. “And lastly, my late husband perhaps said it best, Frank was a very good man.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20160111_122228ab-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-02 03:01:06.043030

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A package of legislation that would have included tax cuts and an overhaul of state budget laws has stalled in the Louisiana Senate and is unlikely to regain momentum before lawmakers end their 2025 legislative session next week.
The package includes a proposed constitutional amendment that would have let lawmakers take $3 billion from an emergency savings account and use some of it to pay for income and sales tax cuts, among other things.
That proposal, sponsored by Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, received overwhelming bipartisan support from House lawmakers last month but has been sidelined until next year, according to Sen. Franklin Foil, R-Baton Rouge.
Foil, who chairs the Senate Committee on Revenue and Fiscal Affairs, said in an interview Sunday he and other senior lawmakers met with Emerson and Gov. Jeff Landry last week to discuss several fiscal bills being proposed this session.
“[After] our last meeting that we had with the governor, I don’t believe that we’ll be bringing that amendment through this session,” Foil said, adding that Emerson’s package of fiscal bills had him worried that it was all “too much, too fast.”  
Senate leaders are reluctant to green light more of a fiscal policy overhaul before they even see the results of the one they completed in a special session last fall. In November, lawmakers lowered and flattened both individual and corporate income taxes and increased the sales tax.  
Emerson, who chairs the House Ways & Means Committee, and other House Republicans have been on an aggressive path to lower the state income tax until they can eliminate it entirely. In a previous interview, Emerson said her goal is to “get to zero,” referring to a 0% tax rate. 
Emerson’s constitutional amendment would have allowed lawmakers to shift about $2 billion from the state Revenue Stabilization Fund into a separate savings account. The remaining $1 billion would be used to pay down debt, freeing up some money currently being spent on interest payments. 
But the current version of the amendment also formed the backbone of a plan that included using that extra cash to fund two separate tax cuts and make a pay stipend for teachers part of their permanent salary. Lawmakers have found a new way to pay for teacher stipends for another year and are continuing to work on it through a proposed amendment, but the tax cuts have stalled.
House Bill 667 would have cut Louisiana’s new 3% flat income tax to 2.75% and authorized a higher deduction for taxpayers age 65 and older. The bill was contingent on the amendment’s approval, and senators were concerned with an analysis from the Legislative Fiscal Office that estimated the measure could deprive the state of more than a billion dollars in revenue over a five-year period beginning in 2027. The Fiscal Office also stressed the difficulty in coming up with any estimate due to the lack of data reflecting the tax changes that took place in November.
“We didn’t even hear the income tax bill because that’s primarily what it did,” Foil said. “It was going to reduce income taxes even more than what we did during the special session in the fall. Many of us up here would like to see income taxes reduced, but we need to do it in a responsible way, and…we didn’t want to accelerate deficits for us either until we see how the finances level out.”
Another cut was in House Bill 578, which would have lowered the state sales tax from 5% to 4.75%. The rest of the bill restores some minor sales tax exemptions removed from state law during the special tax session last fall. The Senate Revenue & Fiscal Affairs Committee advanced an amended version of the bill Sunday that no longer contains the sales tax rate cut. It is now pending a vote on the Senate floor. 
Outside of the committee room Sunday, Emerson, who is typically responsive to reporters, offered only short answers as to how she felt about the setback to her legislation.
“I mean, it is what it is. They took it out,” she said.
The legislative session ends June 12.

It is moral. The Democratic governor of our state should address and combat extreme concentration of wealth, not embody and enable it.","Sixty-six days into Donald Trump’s second term, Gov. Ned Lamont convened a press conference at the University of Connecticut Health Center to announce the rescission of roughly $155 million in federal public health funding to Connecticut. The cuts would gut infectious disease surveillance, newborn genetic screening, and childhood immunization programs. 
“We have been modeling out potential outcomes and monitoring funding for critical programs,” said Lamont, Senate President Martin Looney, and Speaker Matt Ritter in a joint statement the following day, committing: “we will review these on a case-by-case basis  to understand the impact and protect our most essential   programs.”

Justin Etheridge
The additional $880 billion in federal cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, food assistance, special education, and more currently under debate in Washington is already projected to cost Connecticut at least $1 billion. And so it begins. Across the country, Democratic oﬃcials at every level will organize —publicly and politically— to fend oﬀ crippling federal cuts to essential public services.
Unfortunately, the state of Connecticut could not be in a worse position to endure the coming troubles of a second Trump administration. Not because of a lack of resources —but because of a lack of will. A lack of moral character. For six years, the state has been governed by a brand of fiscal caution that has been marketed successfully as “responsible” leadership. But it couldn’t be further from the  truth.
When he was sworn in in 2019, Governor Lamont faced a projected $1.5 billion deficit—a hole he and state lawmakers closed with a variety of creative solutions. One was diverting $170 million in vehicle sales tax revenue from the Special Transportation Fund (STF) to the General Fund. Notably, full dedication of this revenue stream to the STF was later achieved by FY2023 —a promise kept. Kudos to Lamont and company: actually, a deft budget move.
There were more risky maneuvers as well—saving $183 million in one year and $189 million in another by restructuring the state’s pension obligations to teachers and public employees. The changes extended the state’s pension debt schedule from 2032 to 2050, while wisely lowering the assumed return on investment from 8% to 6.9% (though 6% would have been more realistic). But two more decades of sustained economic growth to make ballooning payments is a risky bet—especially now, in an era of federal upheaval, inflation shocks, tariﬀ-driven price hikes (and the profit-padding they conceal), sticky interest rates, and ballooning federal debt,  all in service of extreme wealth concentration. When future lawmakers complain about “leaders of both parties” who “passed the buck” or “kicked the can down the road,” they’ll be talking about Governor Lamont, that budget, and those  votes.
There were additional savings—$460 million over two years—from sacrifices made by our state workers—furlough days, delayed bonuses, three years of wage freezes, and higher employee contributions to healthcare and pensions. These weren’t theoretical cuts. They meant smaller paychecks, delayed promotions, steeper out-of-pocket costs, and more worry in the lives of   the people who plow and repair our roads, process benefit applications, ensure our public safety.
And while workers gave more, the administration drew it’s only red line: no new taxes on the wealthy. There were gestures of progressivity—$6.3 million in revenue from a modest tax increase on real estate transactions for homeowners moving out of state and selling their houses for more than $2.5 million. A pretty penny of $50 million was taken in from trimming a 93% tax credit giveaway to owners of “pass through entities”—law firms, real estate   groups, private equity funds—down to 87.5%, which still remains a pretty generous giveaway to help wealthy business owners avoid state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps while the rest of us pay extra taxes for the same reason.
But by and away, the bulk of new revenue in Lamont’s first budget came from a broad-based scheme of regressive taxes and fees. A total of $218.4 million was raised through sales tax increases on services like parking, laundry, dry cleaning, interior design, online sales, and digital downloads (which, as a member of a digitally native generation—I hate paying). And perhaps most egregiously of all, the budget taxed prepared grocery items—literally taking food out of people’s shopping carts. Could you imagine proposing an increase to grocery prices today?
In the years that followed, Connecticut’s budget outlook didn’t just stabilize—it soared. The state became flush with cash not because of Lamont’s tax policy, but because of a rare confluence of economic conditions: soaring stock market gains among the wealthy, record corporate profits, inflated consumer spending driven by stimulus, a pandemic housing boom, and $2.8 billion in one-time federal COVID relief. In short, the windfall came from the very top of the economy—and from circumstances unlikely to  repeat.
Connecticut went from a $1.5 billion deficit in 2019 to record-shattering surpluses: $569 million  in 2020, $1.7 billion in 2021, $4.3 billion in 2022, and $1.9 billion in 2023. By 2024, the Rainy Day Fund hit its statutory cap of 18% of the General Fund, totaling $4.1 billion. The excess was used to pay down pension debt—more than $8.5 billion in supplemental payments between 2020 and 2024.
But while the balance sheets were glowing, Connecticut’s public services were quietly hollowing out. After more than a decade of flat funding, state-contracted nonprofits— responsible for mental health care, housing support, substance use treatment, re-entry programs, and services for people with disabilities—now operate with 30% less buying power than they had in 2007. Nearly 2,000 people sit on waitlists at the Department of Social Services, unable to access basic care. At Connecticut’s community colleges, over 400 permanent positions will be cut. Entire staﬀs eliminated from oﬃces like Career  Services.
Cafeteria workers laid oﬀ, shutting down food operations. Oﬃce administrators, tutors, ESL instructors, and librarians sent home, slashing library hours and student support across multiple campuses. Funny, from a governor who once featured his public school students in his campaign ads.
At a May Day Rally on May 1, on the New Haven Green, I witnessed a licensed practical nurse who worked at a state-aﬃliated nursing home take the stage. He was a Black man of large stature, caring for people’s parents, grandparents —and caring for us, seniors. He said that the facility had only been supplied with medium gloves. He held out his hand, opened his palm to the crowd, and declared: “These hands don’t fit medium gloves.” He went on to describe coworkers buying hand soap from the dollar store with their own paychecks because the state did not provide any. Then he described having to tape two diapers together to fit a patient because they didn’t have diapers in the right size. I  cried.
SEIU 1199NE—the union representing nearly 5,700 nursing home workers across 51 facilities in Connecticut—is demanding a long-overdue investment in the caregiving workforce. The union is seeking to raise starting wages to $25 per hour, with increases over time to $30— wages that would oﬀer basic stability to caregivers like the one I saw speak on the  Green. These are not the workers we want stressed, sleep-deprived, and struggling in a constant state of scarcity. To meet the union’s demands, the state would need to invest an additional $275 million per year in Medicaid funding, roughly half of which would be reimbursed by the federal government.
Connecticut’s community nonprofits are requesting a $264 million increase for FY26. This funding would support a 6% cost-of-living adjustment for providers, a Medicaid rate increase, and the annualization of one-time coronavirus funding. Staﬃng shortages are impacting service delivery, with more than 80% of health and human services nonprofits struggling to recruit and retain staﬀ due to uncompetitive wages. Two-thirds report having waiting lists stretching from weeks to months, and almost half have been forced to cut programs, reduce capacity, or turn away clients. More than 60% say they are operating at a deficit or with dangerously thin margins.
Senate President Martin Looney has introduced measures such as a “mansion tax,” which would impose a 1-mill tax on homes assessed over $1.5 million and a 2-mill tax on those  over $2 million, potentially generating up to $660 million annually. Alongside Majority Leader Bob Duﬀ, he also proposed raising the top two income tax brackets, which could generate another $420 million annually. 
This year, the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee advanced a 1.75% capital gains surcharge on Connecticut’s wealthiest residents—projected to raise $284 million annually. Despite repeated introduction, none of these proposals have ever been included in the final budget package negotiated with Governor Lamont. This year is the  year.
This is not about what lies in the state’s coﬀers. It’s about what lies in the heart of our   governor —and the intentions of those around him who enable and celebrate his leadership. In a state so often described as being in permanent fiscal crisis, one would think the need for new revenue would be self-evident. And yet, time and again, revenue solutions are avoided —not because they don’t exist, but because they’re considered politically toxic.
A budget is a moral document. Show me your budget—and I’ll show you your values. Where are the morally courageous leaders who will say: I will generate revenue for this state from the right places —not by cutting funds for soap and sanitary products in nursing homes, but by asking for a few more cents on the dollar from those buying mansions, docking yachts, or taking helicopter rides from their back yards? 
Connecticut’s crisis is no longer fiscal. It is moral. The Democratic governor of our state should address and combat extreme concentration of wealth, not embody and enable it, as he stewards our public services.

Imagine our towns beginning to mirror San Francisco’s streets, where rampant homelessness has crushed public safety, chased businesses, and gutted community pride. 
This grim future awaits Connecticut, including Greenwich, if House Bill 7033 becomes law. This legislation, if passed in Hartford, will erode both communal compassion and civic order. There will be nothing legally Greenwich or any town can do to stop this law from being implemented.
A brief background: In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court’s City of Grants Pass v. Johnson decision backed a principle that towns can enforce ordinances to keep public spaces safe. The 6-3 ruling confirmed that fining or jailing people camping on public property does not violate the Eighth Amendment (“cruel and unusual punishment”), even with scarce shelter. This empowers municipalities to protect parks, sidewalks, and greens for residents, free from legal roadblocks.
H.B. 7033, being crafted in Connecticut’s Housing Committee would gut this power. Titled “An Act Prohibiting A Municipality From Imposing Any Penalty On Homeless Persons For Performing Life-Sustaining Activities On Public Land,” it bans penalizing sleeping or stashing belongings on public property. Democrats, never content to leave a proven bad policy alone, have doubled down on failure with this bill, testing liberals’ vaunted tolerance for homeless encampments except perhaps in their own back yards. If passed, it would squash Grants Pass vs. Johnson aligned ordinances,    forcing towns to endure encampments indefinitely. Connecticut could soon resemble San Francisco, where over 8,000 homeless, open drug use, and public health disasters swamp public spaces.
San Francisco’s collapse is a frightful warning. Its soft policies on homelessness fuelled crime surges and business exodus, desecrating a vibrant and beautiful city. Connecticut, with 3,410 unhoused in 2024, isn’t immune from this result. New Haven’s Democratic Mayor Justin Elicker slams the bill, saying it cripples towns’ ability to blend compassion and order. He’s the lone prominent Democrat voice thus far speaking out against this bill. 
Greenwich Democrat Reps. Stephen Meskers and Hector Arzeno have been characteristically silent regarding the bill. Their silence suggests either consent or insufficient worry to stand up against this bill in defense of Greenwich before it gains frightening legislative traction. Perhaps they even agree with it but are too timid to say so to their constituents? Greenwich’s first term Republican Rep. Tina Courpas, the ranking member on the Housing Committee, voted “No” for the bill to proceed.
Republicans propose a more common-sense approach: let towns forge solutions while funding fixes like shelters and job training. A strong economy and lower taxes would foster opportunity and do much to prevent widespread homelessness. H.B. 7033 provides zero dollars for housing, dumping encampment and safety costs on municipalities and towns. With Connecticut’s budget strained, Greenwich taxpayers will get stuck with all the costs.
Connecticut’s strength is its safe, thriving towns. H.B. 7033 risks turning parks into squatter camps, diminishing property values, safety, and civic pride. Grants Pass v. Johnson equips municipalities to act decisively; H.B. 7033 rips those tools  away.
Lawmakers must kill this bill, champion local control, discipline, and solutions lifting the unhoused while safeguarding towns. Keep Connecticut’s streets clean and secure—not a mirror of San Francisco’s failed policies.

Electricity rates have risen by over 30% over the last decade, and heating bill hikes are headed in the same direction. 
Just last fall, Yankee Gas requested bill hikes of 43%, an increase of more than $45 per month.
Local leaders, state officials, and residents alike have sounded the alarm on rising energy costs. The state legislature has responded, introducing a handful of bills this session aimed at tackling the problem with a broad range of remedies. So far, the majority have focused on only one half of the equation – electricity bills.
We also desperately need to bring down costs for those who heat with natural gas. One idea in the spotlight uses an old and misunderstood playbook: expand Connecticut’s access to natural gas supply.
This concept has elicited a range of reactions, but let’s consider it in earnest for a moment. Natural gas heats over a third of Connecticut homes. Couldn’t additional gas bring relief on winter bills?
Let’s start by looking at the gas supply.
In recent years, we’ve seen several gas price spikes from extreme weather events like Winter Storm Uri, geopolitical events, and other supply constraints. Gas prices are also historically volatile, making it difficult for households to plan for utility costs. Now, the Energy Information Administration is projecting that the cost of gas this upcoming fall will be almost double the cost from 2024.
Expanding reliance on gas supply only locks Connecticut into an unpredictable and expensive energy future. There’s no way out of this problem – New England doesn’t have any gas reserves or production – Connecticut relies on interstate pipelines to import fuel from other regions. It turns out we can’t simply open the spigot.
Beyond the gas itself, we need pipelines to transport it safely.
This means repairing and likely replacing aging gas infrastructure and expanding gas pipeline networks. That’s an expensive undertaking, and a slow one, especially given that Connecticut ranks No. 4 in the country for miles of old pipe needing attention.
According to 2023 filings, the Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation (CNG) and the Southern Connecticut Gas Company (SCG) cost-per-mile to replace gas mains were $1.4 million to $2.9 million and $1.5 million to $1.9 million, respectively.
Replacement costs are soaring across the country, especially in urban areas. New York gas utilities paid over $3 million per mile and Massachusetts utilities paid up to $6M for pipe replacements in some residential Boston neighborhoods.
Because these costs are up everywhere, and because the headwinds facing the industry are larger than simply construction cost inflation, gas utility planning and cost-containment is formally being reviewed in various states.
New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Jersey, Maryland, Minnesota, Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon and Illinois are all asking for insights into these costs increases, and assessing how to meaningfully combat them, rather than pre-supposing that the solution is to spend billions of additional ratepayer dollars in the same way that we always have.
A necessary first step to getting a solution for Connecticut is to open a proceeding at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) to examine the long-term costs of the gas system, its interdependencies with the electric system, potential lower-cost solutions to bring down bills, and what other states are doing to combat this same problem. An uncontested docket at PURA comes at no cost to ratepayers.
This proceeding will gather critical information on today’s gas infrastructure and supply costs and bring transparency into the assumptions the utilities are making about the future. With this information in hand, legislators and utility regulators will be able to make better decisions to combat this growing heating affordability crisis.
To plan for an affordable energy future, we need to look forward, not backward. Legislators should issue a practical directive to PURA to open a gas system study as a first step to ensure that Connecticut homes get the most cost-effective and reliable energy solutions.

This is not short-term care, and these are not short-term patients. We’re one of only two hospitals in the country providing this level of long-term, specialty care to both children and adults. And we do it as a nonprofit:  more than 85% of our patients rely on Medicaid coverage.

Crista Durand
That makes state budget decisions —particularly around Medicaid reimbursement rates —critical to our ability to continue providing this care.
After years of flat funding, we are hopeful that a modest Medicaid rate increase for chronic disease hospitals will be preserved in the final state budget. It’s an important step, and we are deeply grateful to the legislators and state officials who understand what’s at stake and have prioritized investments in the Hospital for Special Care and the patients we serve. We remain steadfast in our mission to provide highly specialized care to individuals and families who need it most.
But make no mistake: this must be the beginning, not the end, of our shared effort to protect access to complex care in Connecticut.
The population we serve is growing. Children with autism spectrum disorder are being diagnosed earlier and in greater numbers. Our comprehensive autism center, which includes inpatient and outpatient services, is one of the most advanced in the nation and provides the only in-patient services in the state. At the same time, more adults are surviving catastrophic illness or injury, requiring weeks, months, or even years of post-acute care. Our long-standing programs in spinal cord injury, acquired brain injury, heart failure, and ventilator weaning are expanding too.


This level of care requires staff, space, technology, and time. In healthcare, all these things are expensive.
Our services are designed to be intensive and resource-rich because that’s what these patients require to recover and thrive. We run ventilator units, invest in adaptive technology, and provide therapies that rebuild lives. This kind of care isn’t billable the way a routine hospital visit might be —but for our patients, it’s life-changing and often life-saving.
If reimbursement doesn’t keep pace, the long-term cost isn’t just financial. It shows up in emergency rooms overwhelmed by patients who can’t be transferred to the appropriate level of care. It shows up in working parents forced to leave jobs to care for medically fragile children at home. It shows up in missed rehabilitation windows, lost function, and preventable complications. Connecticut cannot afford to let that happen. We need to create a healthier state, where we can live and thrive together.
To some, Medicaid rate adjustments may look like lines on a budget spreadsheet. But to us —and to the families we serve— they determine what kind of care is possible, and where that care happens. Without sufficient support, specialized hospitals like ours will be forced to make difficult decisions: scaling back services, reducing capacity, or in some cases, closing programs altogether. And when that happens, patients don’t just lose access; they lose precious time that cannot be recovered.
The hardworking staff at Hospital for Special Care will keep doing what we’ve always done: taking on the hardest cases, treating the whole person, and redefining what recovery can mean. We’re proud to serve as a cornerstone of Connecticut’s healthcare system, but we can’t do it alone.
If we want this system to remain strong and equitable —for everyone— then support for specialized care must be a priority. We’ve upheld our commitment to the patients of Connecticut. We hope the state will continue to stand with us, so we can stand with them.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Multiple people were injured Sunday in downtown Boulder when a man reportedly lit them on fire, according to local police.
Six victims ranging in age from 67 to 88 years old were transported to hospitals in the region, police said. One was described as being in critical condition, with other victims’ injuries ranging from serious to minor.
The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Saliman, was taken into custody by police and was being treated for minor injuries at a hospital, Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Denver field office, said during a Sunday evening press conference.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Michalek said.
The attack took place near the Boulder County Courthouse on the Pearl Street Mall, an area in the heart of the city that typically attracts hundreds of people on the weekend. The first calls about the attack came at 1:26 p.m., Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier Sunday.
“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”
Participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, were in the area at the time of the attack.
Michalek said the suspect was “heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.” He called it a “targeted act of violence” and said the FBI was investigating it as an act of terrorism.
Kash Patel, director of the FBI, earlier on Sunday called the incident a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said it was a “heinous act of terror.”
The Anti-Defamation League said on social media it was “monitoring the situation in Colorado.”
Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the U.S. House, characterized the attack as targeting Jewish people.
“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon,” he said in a statement. “Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, indicated the group was targeted.
“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser said in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado.”

Jeff Landry.,"Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, helped lead an effort to reduce funding in the state budget for a new private education voucher program that Gov. Jeff Landry has pushed. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The Republican-led Louisiana Senate Finance Committee has removed public money meant to expand the use of private education vouchers in spite of the initiative being a priority for fellow Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. 

The committee agreed Sunday to cut $50 million from LA GATOR, Landry’s initiative launching in the 2025-26 school year. The reduction will leave $44 million for the program, enough to continue covering private school tuition for 6,000 students who already receive state-funded vouchers. 
Landry and the Louisiana House wanted to put an additional $50 million into LA GATOR so the state could give out 5,300 new vouchers next school year, for approximately 11,300 overall. 
The cut was one of the biggest shakeups in the Senate leadership’s initial version of the $43 billion state budget unveiled Sunday. The Senate and House must come together to reach a compromise on the spending plan by June 12. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, has been resolute in his opposition to giving out more vouchers in the coming year. For weeks, he has expressed concern that LA GATOR’s cost could grow faster than the state can afford it, and that the state’s existing voucher program hasn’t resulted in better education outcomes for students enrolled in it.
Still, Landry and conservative groups who back LA GATOR have been putting pressure on senators to keep the $50 million in the program. They are running advertisements and recently held a rally next to the Capitol pushing for additional vouchers for the program.
Some senators were also reluctant to explain why the money had been removed Sunday. 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Glen Womack, R-Harrisonburg, and Sen. Rick Edmonds, who sponsored the bill to set up LA GATOR last year, allowed the state budget bill with the cut to move forward, but they declined to comment after the committee meeting. 
Louisiana Education Superintendent Cade Brumley, one of LA GATOR’s biggest proponents, also refused to comment on the budget change after the committee hearing. Brumley said he had not had a chance to review the adjustment to the program yet. 
Yet based on the assumption that the number of vouchers offered would grow, Brumley had opened applications for the program across the state earlier this spring. Nearly 40,000 families have applied for the limited slots. 
At least some of the $50 million taken from LA GATOR is going to be used to restore $30 million to a targeted tutoring program for public elementary school students. Brumley attributed some of Louisiana’s success on national math and reading tests to the tutoring program and said he was grateful it had been added back into the budget. 
Landry, Senate hope for hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding 
The Republican Senate leadership’s version of the budget also adds hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to the state Medicaid budget. The money would be used to pay physicians and hospitals a higher reimbursement rate for treating Medicaid patients. 

Landry asked the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services earlier this year to allow Louisiana’s medical providers to receive a rate for treating Medicaid patients closer to what private insurers provide. 

The federal government has not agreed pay the new rate yet. But if it does, it will increase Louisiana’s federal Medicaid funding by $500 million in the state budget cycle that starts June 1. Hundreds of millions of federal  dollars could also be given to Louisiana to retroactively cover payments in the current budget year that ends June 30. 
Louisiana’s request for more Medicaid funding comes at a time when President Donald Trump and U.S. House Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, are pushing for ways to reduce the nation’s overall spending on Medicaid. But the reimbursement rates are not expected to be affected by changes Congress is considering. 
UNO transfer to LSU System comes with debt relief

The Senate has added $20 million in its budget proposal for the University of Louisiana System to pay off debt associated with the University of New Orleans, which is likely to move over to the LSU System this summer. 
The Senate has also included nearly $2 million for the UL System to continue a youth recreation partnership at UNO for another year and $450,000 for LSU to conduct an “academic and finance” audit of UNO in the next fiscal cycle. 

Sheriffs will get paid more to hold state inmates
The Senate added $11.6 million to the budget in order to give local sheriffs $3 more per day per inmate to house state adult inmates in their local jails. 

Currently, sheriffs are paid $26.39 per day per inmate to house state prisoners.
Louisiana keeps approximately 15,800 inmates in local parish jails instead of state prisons. This includes almost 2,000 state prisoners who are in transitional work programs, where they hold jobs at private businesses in the community while living at the jail. 
Louisiana DOGE gets money, staff to find efficiencies

(Photos via Florida Senate and Florida House of Representatives)Florida legislators are finally heading back to Tallahassee to wrap up their work for the year.
Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez announced late Friday that closed-door negotiations had yielded a breakthrough on the state budget as legislative leaders agreed to a “framework” they will use to draw up a final budget bill.
The plan as outlined in memos to House and Senate members is for legislators to begin formal budget conference meetings on Tuesday with the goal of voting out a new budget for 2025-26 by June 16. Florida’s fiscal year starts on July 1.
The main job each year of the Florida Legislature is to pass an annual budget which authorizes billions in spending on education, healthcare, the environment, transportation, public safety, and more. The lingering standoff on the budget had led to the possibility of a state government shutdown 
While many details remain unclear, the deal announced on Friday would yield a substantial tax cut break for businesses versus a much smaller set of tax cuts for Florida families. The agreement does not include any consideration of a cut in the sales tax rate that had been championed by Perez and House Republicans.
Legislators left town in early May after failing to pass a budget during their 60-day session. On its final day, the House and Senate agreed to extend until June 6. At the time, Albritton and Perez announced an agreement to cut taxes by $2.8 billion, including a cut in the state’s sales tax.
But that deal fell apart after Gov. Ron DeSantis warned he’d veto it, lest it undercut his push to reduce property taxes. Albritton backed away from the earlier deal. That decision prompted sharp criticism from Perez, who said that Albritton had broken his word.
The new agreement calls for $2.25 billion in “revenue reductions” that include the elimination of the sales tax charged on commercial leases and business rent that is estimated to cost $900 million. 
The two sides also agreed to $350 million in “permanent sales tax exemptions targeted toward Florida families.” The memo did not explain exactly what exemptions, although the Senate previously had suggested eliminating some taxes charged on shoes and clothes.
The rest of the revenue reductions, however, would include $200 million for paying down existing state debt and $750 million that would eventually be placed in the Budget Stabilization Fund. The size of that “rainy day fund”  is now capped, so legislative leaders would ask voters in 2026 to approve raising that limit. In the meanwhile, they want to set aside money in reserves that will eventually go to the fund.

COUNSELOR, N.M. – On a Tuesday in March, Billton Werito drove his son Amari toward his house in Counselor, New Mexico, navigating the bumpy dirt road that winds through a maze of natural gas pipelines, wellheads and water tanks. Amari should have been in school, but a bout of nausea and a dull headache kept him from class.

“To me the surprise was certainly the magnitude of the effects” of air pollution on students, said Mike Gilraine, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University. “It’s hard to find a similar factor that would have such an impact on schools nationwide.”

“It happens a lot,” Amari explained from the backseat, glancing up from his Nintendo Switch. The symptoms usually show up when the sixth-grader smells an odor of “rotten egg with propane” that rises from nearby natural gas wells and wafts over Lybrook Elementary School, where he and some 70 other Navajo students attend class. His little brother often misses school for the same reason.
“They just keep getting sick,” Amari’s father, Billton, said. “I have to take them out of class because of the headaches. Especially the younger one, he’s been throwing up and won’t eat.” The symptoms are putting the kids at risk of falling further behind in school.

Lybrook sits in the heart of New Mexico’s San Juan Basin, a major oil and gas deposit that, along with the Permian Basin in the state’s southeast, is supplying natural gas that meets much of the nation’s electricity demand.
The gas pulled from tens of thousands of wells in New Mexico has reaped huge benefits for the entire country. Natural gas has become a go-to fuel for power plants from coast to coast, sometimes replacing dirtier coal-fired plants and, by extension, improving air quality. Locally, oil and gas companies employ thousands of workers, often in areas with few other opportunities, all while boosting the state’s budget with billions in royalty payments.
But those benefits may come at a cost for thousands of students in New Mexico whose schools sit near oil and gas pipelines, wellheads and flare stacks. An Associated Press analysis of state and federal data found 694 oil and gas wells with new or active permits within a mile of a school in the state. This means that around 29,500 students in 74 schools and pre-schools potentially face exposure to noxious emissions, as extraction from the ground can release unhealthy fumes.
A measurable effect on students
At Lybrook, where Amari just finished sixth grade, fewer than 6 percent of students are proficient at math, and only a fifth meet state standards for science and reading proficiency.
Other factors could help explain students’ poor achievement. Poverty rates are higher in some areas with high levels of gas development, and students at rural schools overall tend to face challenges that can adversely affect academic performance. AP’s analysis found that two-thirds of the schools within a mile of an oil or gas well were low-income, and the population is around 24 percent Native American and 45 percent Hispanic.
But research has found that student learning is directly harmed by air pollution from fossil fuels — even when socioeconomic factors are taken into account.
And it’s not just New Mexico where this is a risk. An AP analysis of data from the Global Oil and Gas Extraction Tracker found over 1,000 public schools across 13 states that are within five miles of a major oil or gas field. Major fields are collections of wells that produce the highest amount of energy in a state.
“This kind of air pollution has a real, measurable effect on students,” said Mike Gilraine, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, who studies connections between air quality and student performance.
In 2024, Gilraine cowrote a study showing that student test scores were closely associated with air contamination. Each measured increase in PM2.5, a type of pollution created from the burning of fossil fuels, was associated with a significant decline in student test scores, Gilraine found. Conversely, researchers have documented that reductions in air pollution have led to higher test scores and fewer absences.
“To me the surprise was certainly the magnitude of the effects” of air pollution on students, Gilraine said. “It’s hard to find a similar factor that would have such an impact on schools nationwide.”
America’s shift to natural gas has resulted in substantial increases in student achievement nationwide, Gilraine’s research shows, as it has displaced dirtier coal and led to cleaner air on the whole. But there has been little data on air quality across New Mexico, even as it has become one of the most productive states in the nation for natural gas. State regulators have installed only 20 permanent air monitors, most in areas without oil or gas production.

Independent researchers have extensively studied the air quality near schools in at least two locations in the state, however. One is Lybrook, which sits within a mile of 17 active oil and gas wells.
In 2024, scientists affiliated with Princeton and Northern Arizona universities conducted an air-monitoring study at the school, finding that levels of pollutants — including benzene, a cancer-causing byproduct of natural gas production that is particularly harmful to children — were spiking during school hours, to nearly double the levels known to cause chronic or acute health effects.
That research followed a 2021 health impact assessment that was done with support from several local nonprofits and foundations, which analyzed the effects of the area’s oil and gas development on residents.
The findings were startling: More than 90 percent of people surveyed suffered from sinus problems. Nosebleeds, shortness of breath and nausea were widespread. The report attributed the symptoms to the high levels of pollutants that researchers found — including, near Lybrook, hydrogen sulfide, a compound that gives off the sulfur smell that Amari Werito associated with his headaches.
Those studies helped confirm what many community members already knew, said Daniel Tso, a community leader who served on the committee that oversaw the 2021 health impact assessment.
“The children and the grandchildren need a safe homeland,” Tso said during an interview in March, standing outside a cluster of gas wells within a mile of Lybrook Elementary.

“You smell that?” he said, nodding towards a nearby wellhead, which smelled like propane. “That’s what the kids at the school are breathing in. I’ve had people visiting this area from New York. They spend five minutes here and say, ‘Hey, I got a headache.’ And the kids are what, six hours a day at the school breathing this?”
Lybrook school officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite risks, oil and gas can pump money into schools
Researchers have identified similar air quality problems in New Mexico’s southeast.
In 2023, a team of scientists from a coalition of universities conducted a detailed, yearlong study of the air in Loving, a small town in the Permian Basin. Local air quality, researchers found, was worse than in downtown Los Angeles, and the tested air contained the fifth-highest level of measured ozone contamination in the U.S.
The source of the ozone — a pollutant that’s especially hazardous to children — was the area’s network of gas wells and related infrastructure. Some of that infrastructure sits within a half-mile of a campus that houses Loving’s elementary, middle and high schools.
A small group of residents has spoken out about the area’s air quality, saying it has caused respiratory problems and other health issues. But for most locals, any concerns about pollution are outweighed by the industry’s economic benefits.
Representatives of the oil and gas industry have claimed the air quality studies themselves are not trustworthy.
“There needs to be a robust study to actually answer these questions,” said Andrea Felix, vice president of regulatory affairs for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA). Felix said other sources of emissions, such as cars and trucks, are likely a larger source of air quality problems near wells.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var a in e.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[“datawrapper-height”][a]+”px”}}}))}();
“Companies follow the best available science” for well placement and emissions controls, Felix said, and also contribute huge amounts of money to the state’s education budget through streams like royalties and direct expenditures. In the most recent fiscal year, oil and gas revenue supported $1.7 billion in K-12 spending in New Mexico, according to a NMOGA report.
Officials with Loving Municipal Schools are also skeptical of the alarm over the wells. Loving Superintendent Lee White said the school district used funds from the oil and gas industry to pay for a new wing at the elementary school, a science lab for students, turf on the sports field and training and professional development for teachers. He said the industry’s contributions to state coffers can’t be ignored.
“Are we willing to give that up because people say our air is not clean?” he said during an interview. “It’s just as clean as anywhere else.”
As White spoke, a drill rig worked a couple of miles east of Loving’s elementary school while parents poured into the gymnasium to watch kindergartners collect their diplomas. White touted the district’s success, saying the elementary school scores above state averages for reading, math and science proficiency, while Loving’s high school students far outpace the state average for college and career readiness.
But environmental groups, attorneys and residents continue to push for limits on drilling near schools.
Those efforts saw a boost in 2023, when New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard issued an executive order prohibiting new oil and gas leases on state-owned land within a mile of schools.
Industry representatives decried the move, saying it added potentially insurmountable costs and barriers to drilling operators. However, AP’s analysis found that relatively few wells would be impacted even if the rule applied to all of New Mexico; only around 1 percent of oil and gas wells in the state are within a mile of a school.
In the years since, residents of areas where exploration is heavy have lobbied for legislation prohibiting gas operations within a mile of schools, regardless of land status. That bill died in committee during the most recent session of the New Mexico legislature.
Advocates have also sued the state over an alleged lack of pollution controls. That suit is currently pending in state court.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Nurses at Meriter hospital in Madison returned to work Sunday with a new contract at the end of a five-day strike, the first in the hospital’s history.
The agreement, reached Saturday and ratified by union members late Saturday night, for the first time gives nurses direct input on staffing concerns at the hospital, said Pat Raes, president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin and also a nurse at the hospital. Raes spoke at a short return-to-work rally Sunday morning outside the hospital.
While it falls short of establishing guaranteed ratios of patients to nurses, Raes said the new two-year contract  establishes a precedent by including  language about staffing concerns.
Wages will go up by 10% over two years, Raes said. She said the wage gain offered “meaningful raises” including 8% across the board and the other 2% for “step increases recognizing our experience and attracting new talent.” 
Raes said the contract also contains  “enforceable language” addressing the safety of health care staff and patients, including a commitment to install a metal detector by the end of the summer.
Staffing concerns and a push for the hospital to guarantee specific ratios of patients to nurses on duty were among the issues that the union stressed in contract negotiations and during the five-day walkout.
In public statements during the contract talks and strike, UnityPoint Health-Meriter officials said they shared the union’s concerns for safe staffing levels but opposed dictating ratios, claiming it would hinder  flexibility to respond to changing conditions.
Raes said the agreement builds on an existing system of committees in which nurses are in charge. “We really felt that was the format for having the staffing discussions and noting where those issues were,” she said Sunday.
The contract also commits the hospital to an annual discussion with the union on staffing concerns and issues, Raes said.

“This was a long and difficult negotiation,” Raes said. “We acknowledge Meriter’s management for ultimately coming to the table and reaching an agreement that prioritizes the needs of our patients and our dedicated professionals. Today, we turn the page.”
The final negotiating sessions were conducted with the aid of a mediator from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC).
“We did not want to walk,” said bargaining committee member Carol Lemke, “but we felt it was the only thing we could do” to get staffing-related language in the contract.
In a statement distributed by UnityPoint Health-Meriter Saturday night after the agreement was announced, Sherry Casali, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, said, “We are grateful for the dedication and hard work of everyone involved in the negotiations. This tentative agreement represents meaningful progress toward a contract that recognizes the important contributions of our nurses.”
Raes said the union is now turning its attention to state legislation lawmakers have reported they are drafting that would establish a state mandate for the ratios of health care workers to patients in health care institutions. 
After five days of large throngs of picketing nurses, the crowd outside the hospital Sunday morning was smaller. The scene was cheerful and celebratory, accompanied by a sense of relief.
Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway turned out for the 6:30 a.m. return-to-work rally.
“I want to thank you for your courage because I know this wasn’t easy,” she told the nurses.
While she said she was grateful “mostly to the nurses,” Rhodes-Conway also said she was “grateful to management for coming to the table and finally understanding that we are stronger when we collaborate.”
The contract was ratified Saturday night by “a supermajority” of nurses, Raes said. Although the union didn’t release the official vote count, Raes said, “We had more people vote for this contract than we have ever had vote in the past.”
The union pushed to ensure the votes were cast and counted before midnight because the pay increases take effect with the start of the next pay period, Sunday morning.
The timing was also important for another reason. Meriter management told the union and employees that nurses on strike would be removed from the list of active employees effective Sunday, which would end their health insurance coverage.
The union wanted to complete the ratification process Saturday night “so there would not be any issues — there would not be any threat,” Raes said.
“We have nurses that are being treated for long-term health issues that cannot afford to lose their insurance who were out striking, and we have had other ones that felt they had to cross the picket line to not risk their health insurance,” Raes said.
She said she doesn’t expect divisions among members because of those choices, however. “Everybody, all the nurses, will continue to work together and have each other’s back on the floors,” Raes said, “because that is how we have to work.”
  Striking nurses left the message “We would rather be working!” in chalk on the sidewalk in front of Meriter hospital in Madison. The graffiti was still visible Sunday morning as the nurses returned to work. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)

The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown, D-Ohio. “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
 The high cost of foodborne illnesses

Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas.
“This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak in peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
 ‘Life or death for our Sson’

E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”

Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.

But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

SPRINGFIELD – With public transit agencies in Chicagoland facing a fiscal cliff and the potential for thousands of layoffs, the state did not pass a bill that would have provided the agencies with potentially over $1 billion in new funding.

A version of the bill passed in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago. But the House adjourned early Sunday morning without concurring as some of its tax hikes became too controversial. Now, the future of Chicagoland transit is in limbo as the bill awaits further action.

The Regional Transportation Authority — which oversees the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail and Pace Suburban Bus — projects a $771 million annual operating budget shortfall.

At a hearing in the days leading up to adjournment, Amalgamated Transit Union political director Clem Balanoff told lawmakers that thousands of union bus drivers and train operators would be laid off if action wasn’t taken to fill the budget gap. RTA officials have estimated 40% service cuts are necessary to address the fiscal crisis.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Sunday said there is “significant work” left to address Chicagoland transit funding over the summer and into the fall.

“The fact is that we need to address transit funding as fast as possible,” Pritzker said.

The Senate’s proposal to do so included statewide taxes on deliveries and electric vehicle charging, as well as expanding taxes on rideshares and expanded certain Chicago taxes to the rest of Cook County and surrounding counties.

RTA and its subsidiary transit agencies will create their budgets for the upcoming fiscal year in the coming weeks. According to RTA spokesperson Tina Fassett Smith in a statement, those budgets “by law must only include funding we are confident the system will receive in 2026.”

“We think there’s probably a billion dollars for mass transit in there,” RTA Board Chairman Kirk Dillard said shortly after the Senate passed its transit bill late Saturday night.

Now, Dillard and other transit officials are going to work to minimize or avoid cuts.

“It’s clear that many in both the House and Senate support transit and our intention is to build on that shared support to identify the funding needed to avoid devastating cuts and disruption for everyone in Northeast Illinois,” Smith said in a statement.

The senate’s solution
House Bill 3438, the proposal approved by the Senate, would bail out transit authorities and send some funding outside northern Illinois. The reform package includes multiple tax increases. It’s unclear if any of these increases could come up again in future attempts to reform transit, although the House could pass it at a special legislative session or at a a future regular session.

The most controversial tax increase was a $1.50 fee added to any home delivery order placed online, with exceptions for some small businesses as well as orders containing only groceries and medication. Of the funds raised from this statewide tax, 80% would go to northern Illinois transit systems under a renamed RTA and 20% would be put into a fund for downstate transit agencies.

The bill would have also instituted a tax on real estate transfers in Cook County and the counties surrounding it. That tax is similar to one already in place in Chicago. It would have also required a charge on taxi and rideshare services in that region and a statewide 3 cents-per-kilowatt hour fee for charging electric vehicles.

""All told, we have achieved with the Senate package, a $1.5 billion investment for the northeast Illinois region,” Villivalam said. “And we have received more than double what downstate transit agencies requested for a historic investment.”

Over the two years that lawmakers have worked with the RTA on this transit funding issue, Democratic lawmakers have consistently repeated their mantra: there would be no funding without reform. To that end, they sought to institute sweeping reforms to the RTA.

The bill would rename the RTA to the Northern Illinois Transit Authority. The agency would have ultimate control over fares as well as a restructured board that places more power in the hands of the state.

While the bill will not become law soon, similar governance reforms were proposed by House lawmakers, who indicated there was agreement between the Senate and House on the reforms likely to be included in any deal.

Even still, those reform proposals drew fierce criticism from some suburban lawmakers

""This has become a bailout for Chicago CTA,” Sen. Seth Lewis, R- Bartlett, said. “We’re giving the mayor more control. We’re giving him more than a billion dollars in revenue.”

The board, under the Senate bill passed Saturday, would have five members appointed by the governor, five appointed by the president of the Cook County Board, five from the mayor of Chicago and one each from the collar counties.

The ink is hardly dry on Washington’s new budget and already legislative leaders are anticipating more fiscal uncertainty. 
Democrats are focused on threats to health care access if Congress slashes Medicaid funding, while Republicans are warning of renewed legal jeopardy in education funding.
In post-session interviews on TVW’s Inside Olympia, House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, warned that a U.S. House-passed budget legislation — if enacted — could force Washington into a special session to make emergency Medicaid adjustments.
“I’m very concerned about the prospects that Republicans in Congress are going to cut Medicaid at a level that’s going to lead to a whole lot of people losing health care around the country,” Fitzgibbon said. “We’re not able to insulate ourselves from that entirely.”
He said proposed reductions to federal reimbursement rates, particularly for hospitals and nursing homes, would force tough decisions. “We would have to come back in special session and we’d have to kick a lot of people off health care and close a lot of hospitals and nursing homes.”
Senate Republican Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, disputed that framing. “I think there’s a lot of fearmongering out there,” he said, adding that the U.S. House plan is “much more favorable for Washington than what many people thought.”
Braun pointed to proposed eligibility checks, work requirements, and reforms to prevent dual-state enrollment. “These are things that will not only save the federal government money,” he said. “They’ll save the state government money and allow us to deliver services more equitably to the people that really need it.”
 McCleary 2.0 concerns

The two party leaders also offered starkly contrasting assessments of whether the new state budget could reignite a constitutional challenge like the 2012 McCleary decision, which mandated that Washington fully fund basic education.
Fitzgibbon defended the budget’s approach, saying the state continues to increase total and per-student K–12 funding. “I don’t think that we are relying on local levies to make up the difference in what basic education costs,” he said. “Those are enrichment levies to cover additional programs.”
He argued that voters had already approved the levy increases and said the budget includes additional money for levy equalization, more formally known as Local Effort Assistance, or LEA, which provides extra state support to property-poor districts. “That should very much keep the scales balanced between the property-rich districts and the property-poor districts,” he said.
Braun disagreed sharply, warning that the Legislature’s move to increase local levy caps could trigger another legal challenge. “I don’t think there’s any question. I think you’ll have that lawsuit—if you don’t have it already—you’ll have it before the end of the year,” he said.
  Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, during an interview on TVW’s Inside Olympia. (Photo courtesy of TVW)
“You can’t go to a school district across our state and say, ‘Can you show me any definitive way that you’re not using levies for basic education?’ They’ll say, ‘No way, I can’t. We’re using it for basic education.’”
 Studies cite widening gaps

Outside groups are warning of persistent discrepancies among districts. According to a March 2024 report by the Washington State School Directors’ Association, wealthier school districts consistently raise significantly more revenue through local property tax levies, allowing them to offer expanded programs and staff. Lower-income districts often struggle to generate comparable funds, creating disparities in educational access and quality.
Though Washington law imposes a “levy lid” to limit how much local districts can raise, the system still allows for wide funding gaps. The League of Education Voters, in a summer 2024 analysis, concluded that the state’s LEA funding is “inadequate” to fully offset these disparities.
The report found that districts are increasingly using levies to fund what many parents and educators view as core services—including special education, student mental health, and additional classroom staff—undermining the notion that the state is fully funding a “basic education.” The result is what the League called “a patchwork system where access to a constitutionally guaranteed education can depend on a student’s ZIP code.”
Braun echoed that view, saying, “It’s undeniably inequitable. This will result in less money per student in some districts and more in others—and that’s exactly what McCleary said we could not do.”
Fitzgibbon acknowledged the concern but said it can be addressed legislatively. “The increase in levy equalization, which was not included in that bill, but is included in the budget, is something I have every expectation we’ll be able to put into statute.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Fitzgibbon-1-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-01 12:13:06.524700

The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown, D-Ohio. “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
  The High Cost of Foodborne Illnesses 

Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas.
“This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak in peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
  ‘Life or Death for Our Son’ 

E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, and Karla Lems, R-Canton, speak to the press after they announced their campaign for governor and lieutenant governor at an event in Sioux Falls on April 24, 2025, at the Military Heritage Alliance. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Republicans could be choosing from a crowded field when they make their choice for governor in the 2026 primary. With as many as five candidates in the race, would-be governors will need to find a way to distinguish themselves from the pack. 
The first announced candidate for that race was Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, a Dell Rapids attorney. He declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in April. 
Hansen was the first candidate for governor to come from the new MAGA wing of the South Dakota Republican Party—referred to as “grassroots patriots” in his announcement speech. His campaign platform contains many of the topics his wing of the party has made a priority: cutting government spending, allowing school choice, protecting private property rights, opposing abortion and tightening election laws.
First candidate for governor focuses on property rights, spending and halting ‘corporate welfare’

Another topic that Hansen touched on was ending “corporate welfare.” That’s the name he has given to the practice of using taxpayer dollars to boost private business. His example of corporate welfare gone bad was Tru Shrimp. The company was given a $6.5 million loan of state and local funds six years ago to build a facility in Madison. While the company did manage to change its name to Iterro, it has yet to break ground. 
“I think it’s just unnecessary government mingling, and it’s risky business, and they’re wasting our taxpayer dollars to do it,” Hansen said in a South Dakota Searchlight story. “It’s the sort of stuff that we want to say ‘no more’ to. Let’s get back to the free market, low tax and low regulation.”
South Dakota got serious about using state dollars to entice and build business in 1987 when Gov. George Mickelson helped to create the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund. Mickelson was able to convince the Legislature to implement a 1% sales tax increase that would sunset once it had raised $40 million for the REDI Fund. Since then the Governor’s Office of Economic Development has made loans and grants worth millions of dollars to new and existing businesses and industries in the state. 
Taking state government loans and grants out of the marketplace would certainly be one way Hansen could approach his new role if he were elected governor. That tactic, however, fails to consider the fact that a financial boost from the state is sometimes what it takes to get the free market interested in investing in South Dakota. 
Putting an end to low-interest government loans would certainly put the state at a disadvantage when it comes to competing with other states for business and industry.
A recent news release from the GOED showed just how invested the state has become in helping businesses grow. The news release noted a $3.4 million grant for the Big Stone Energy Storage Project thermal energy facility, a $2.6 million grant for a Bel Brands expansion and a $250,682 grant to Dakota Line Energy for a lagoon digester. 
The news release said the grants would result in $419 million in capital expenditures and create 180 full-time jobs. In essence, the state is betting $6 million in hopes of getting a $419 million payoff. That kind of “government mingling,” as Hansen called it, seems to offer pretty good odds. It is, however, as he noted, “risky business.”
At its heart, investing in economic development will always be a bit of a gamble. That’s why we expect government officials to place safe bets, though there is always the chance for a bust like Tru Shrimp. That’s the nature of any gamble.
Hansen won’t be the only “patriot” in the Republican primary for governor, with Aberdeen businessman and political influencer Toby Doeden also declaring his candidacy. If “corporate welfare” is going to be an issue in the GOP primary, the people who like to use state loans and grants to boost their local economies have got to do a better job of telling about the benefits of government investment. 
One way to do that would be to keep telling their story after the initial news release has been issued. Beyond the cliched photo of local officials with hardhats and shovels for a groundbreaking, taxpayers deserve regular updates on capital expenditures and job creation. This would add a layer of government transparency to the use of tax dollars. It would also soften the criticism from people like Hansen when an outfit like Tru Shrimp is slow to pay off on its state investment. 
Politicians often like to tout the benefits of the “free market.” By curtailing state grants and low-interest loans, that market will be free to invest in states that are more financially welcoming. 
In 1987, the state’s economy was badly in need of a jump-start, and it got one from Gov. Mickelson and the REDI Fund. Since then, that gamble has paid off more often than it’s gone bust. What Hansen calls “corporate welfare” has been a usually sound investment for South Dakota.

The Republican-controlled House passed two bills last week that would bar transgender girls from competing on girls sports teams. But Democrats, who control the Senate, say they will not consider the legislation.
“Our legislative agenda is long and attacking kids is not on it,” Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, a Democrat from Grand Rapids, told Chalkbeat in a statement.
Failure to take up the Republican-sponsored bills could draw unwelcome political attention to Michigan at a time when the Trump administration has targeted for investigation states that don’t comply with its view on Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on sex.
Since taking office for the second time, Trump has issued several executive orders targeting the rights of transgender Americans. One in January said the U.S. government would only recognize two genders, male and female, while another issued that month attempted to ban gender-affirming health care for transgender youth. A February executive order called for schools to block trans girls from competing on girls sports teams.
Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don’t comply with his executive orders.
Executive orders cannot override existing state and federal statutes, though, and there have been legal challenges to the constitutionality of Trump’s executive orders.
But the Trump administration’s threats to states that don’t comply with the order have stoked fears over how he intends to enforce it. Multiple federal agencies opened investigations into Maine this year after a heated exchange between Trump and the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, in which she promised to follow the state’s law protecting transgender rights.
In one of those federal cases, a judge issued an injunction to stop the government from freezing federal funds to the state. But there are two other open cases that have been assigned to the Department of Justice to enforce.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has said other states are at risk of losing federal funding for Title IX violations, specifically singling out California and Minnesota. Officials in those states have said their civil rights laws preclude them from complying with Trump’s executive order. Bondi’s office announced Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into California.
Like some other states, Michigan recently expanded state protections from discrimination on the basis of sexuality and gender identity and expression. The expansion of those protections two years ago has long been a signature issue for Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
She signed the expansion of the state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act in 2023, saying in a statement that “Michigan is a place that will fight for your freedom to be yourself.”
It is possible what has happened in Maine could happen in Michigan, said Nancy Chi Cantalupo, associate professor of law at Wayne State University.
“But what is happening in Maine is in no way a success for the current administration at this point,” she said, noting that the federal government has never withdrawn funds from a state under Title IX or any other civil rights statutes it enforces.
“It’s not like there’s a light switch the federal government can use to just turn off federal funds at its whim,” she said. “There are a lot of steps it has to go through.”
Brinks did not respond to a question about whether she or others in the Democratic Party have concerns Michigan may be targeted by the Trump administration.
Whitmer’s office did not respond to questions about the bills.
In Michigan, a prohibition against trans girls competing on girls sports teams would affect few athletes statewide. The Michigan High School Athletic Association, the private organization that runs the state’s high school sports competitions, said there were no trans girls competing on spring sports teams this year. None played on winter sports teams, while two played on fall teams.
About 25 states have already passed similar laws restricting trans girls from playing on sports teams aligned with their gender identity.
Advocates for transgender rights say sports bills aren’t really about limiting the teams trans girls and women can play on.
“If this bill were just about sports, it wouldn’t be proposed in coordination with all of these other anti-trans bills [nationwide,]” said Kye Campbell-Fox, a research assistant and laboratory manager at Michigan State University, who studies the impact of legislation targeting the rights of trans kids. “This is a coordinated campaign to push trans people out of public life.”
 Advocates say trans youth don’t feel safe as their rights are attacked

Though the Michigan bills have effectively died, advocates say lawmakers’ focus on the issue — and the language they often use to talk about trans athletes — is still harmful to all trans children.
The Michigan bills, for example, referred to trans girls as “biological males,” ignoring their gender identities. And some lawmakers have said that the presence of trans girls in locker rooms could lead to sexual violence against other girls.
Rep. Mike Harris, a Republican from Waterford, said during a hearing for the bills that he was concerned about the potential for sexual assault if trans girls use girls locker rooms.
“I don’t think it’s appropriate to place biological boys and girls in the same room, to strip down naked next to each other,” he said.
There is no evidence to support the idea that trans girls will assault other girls, though there is evidence that trans populations face increased risks when they use bathrooms according to the sex they were assigned at birth.
Republican lawmakers’ rhetoric has emboldened some students and adults to feel freer to make hateful remarks, and LGBTQ+ youth are being affected by it.
“I’m hearing a lot of fear from youth,” said Jude Krajnyák, a regional coordinator for a research policy project at the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health. “Things everyone else gets to take for granted — like playing soccer in middle school — are rights that are being taken away from us.”
Krajnyák said he heard from a trans girl in middle school who gave up on playing soccer because she said “it’s just not worth” the backlash.
Currently, the Michigan High School Athletic Association determines eligibility for trans girls to play on girls teams on a case-by-case basis. The executive director of the association, Mark Uyl, makes the determination based on a number of factors, including what gender is recorded on the students’ school documents and other paperwork. Students are also asked whether they’ve begun hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries.
“The MHSAA asks for documentation on therapy and surgery as our policy allows for a waiver to be both approved and denied — and part of that decision is based on where in the transitioning process a student is at the time,” Geoff Kimmerly, director of communications for the association, told Chalkbeat.
The policy went into effect in 2012, according to the association. It aligned with federal law during the Obama administration, as well as federal requirements from the Office for Civil Rights during Trump’s first term and Biden’s presidency.
“The MHSAA follows and will continue to follow all applicable state and federal laws,” said Kimmerly in a statement. “We are monitoring developments in this regard closely.”

This policy change would replicate how the government resolved the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s -- by negotiating steep discounts from the bank lenders, which allowed countries to repay much lower amounts, restoring their credit ratings. We should borrow from that experience. 
The post Here’s how we can help solve the student loan crisis: sell th[...]","FROM THE ONSET of the pandemic until today, the terms of federal student loan repayment have changed over and over again. It is often forgotten that President Trump was the first to pause payments through the CARES Act, signed in March 2020. But it was President Biden who tried to put a stake in the heart of student debt, forgiving most of it only to see the Supreme Court deny him the right to do so.  In his second term, President Trump has concluded that it’s time to collect on the debt. The administration announced in early May that it is resuming aggressive collections on defaulted federal student loans. The government is threatening to garnish wages, tax refunds, and Social Security benefits from those who fail to pay.  For many borrowers, it will feel like being flogged while already down. Defaults are expected to balloon. This isn’t about individual irresponsibility. It’s about a broken promise — that student debt would pay for itself through higher earnings. For millions, it hasn’t. And it never will. Is there any escape from what is broadly seen as a failed policy? Here’s an idea that would be a win-win for government and student loan holders: Sell the debt before it becomes an even bigger problem.   Student debt operates under a fundamentally different set of rules than most other types of debt—a fact that often goes overlooked. Federal student loans are not traded in financial markets and are not “marked to market” like corporate or sovereign debt. In fact, by law the government can only trade the debt if it involves no loss, a condition which has effectively prohibited any trading. This means the value of student loans remains on the government’s books at face value, even when long-term repayment is unlikely — due to defaults — or delayed through income-driven repayment, deferments, or forgiveness programs. Thus, a first step toward a sale of the debt would be to recognize that the $1.6 trillion in student debt sitting on the federal government’s books is worth much less due to growing defaults. Only by shining the light of the market on it will we learn the real value of the debt.  Sales of debt into the market may involve painful discounts. But this will force transparency. After the sale, students would pay the discounted price, which would represent real debt relief.  In size and method, this policy change would replicate how the government resolved the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s — by negotiating steep discounts from the bank lenders, which allowed countries to repay much lower amounts, restoring their credit ratings. The combination of the government working with the private sector succeeded in lifting the entire region from depression and despondency. We can borrow from this experience. Before a debt sale the government must set terms with prospective buyers that whatever discount is achieved in sales will favor the student borrower. Thus, if a bank buys a lot of debt at a 50 percent discount it will mean that the debt of the student borrower will be cut in half.  The bank will benefit from the ability of the student to keep up with lower payments. Right now, the credit ratings of students are in the cellar. Cutting the debt load on students would raise these ratings, making them better able to participate in the market for houses, cars, and other big-ticket items.   Meanwhile, debt sales would provide substantial cash to the government that could be used to provide student grants, pay down national debt, or meet any number of priorities. To maintain the status quo would keep the government in the collection business forever given the $1.6 trillion of debt, which will only grow over time.  If this effort were running smoothly, it would be one thing. But the government has wrapped itself into a pretzel trying to meet its fiduciary obligations to taxpayers while easing burdens on students. Meanwhile, the servicing companies it contracted to collect the debt infuriate students with false information, incorrect payment demands, and overall poor communication.  Selling the debt would free politicians from the trap of having to compel payments from those they seek votes from. It would also alleviate distortions, including how the easy availability of loans has allowed colleges to raise tuition levels to stratospheric levels. To end the scourge of student debt, the government must not only sell existing debt but also ease up on lending. Even with declining enrollments the government annually issues $70 billion in new loans and $40 billion in new Pell grants. These figures should be reversed, and new loans should be ready for sale.  At present, student loan rates are high at 6.5 percent for undergraduates and 8 percent for graduate loans, sufficiently attractive for banks to purchase. Any attempt by banks to cherry-pick the loans of students with the highest credit scores should be forestalled by offering discounts on the loans of low-income students. States are showing a much better way of financing higher education by offering cheaper options such as community colleges and vocational training. State grants combined with federal Pell grants often allow students to attend these programs for free. They are directing colleges to limit tuition and other costs to what can be covered by grants.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration is imposing stricter conditions on Pell grants, which could greatly narrow their availability. Lack of access to Pell grants will put pressure on student finances, forcing them to borrow more. The government should do just the opposite — increasing grants while decreasing loans. All of these changes should be voted on by Congress. We learned during the Biden administration that trying to use executive action to implement sweeping change will only lead to court action and political rancor.  President Trump has shrunk the federal government in ways that have cut vital services in many areas. Lessening its role in the student loan business would actually be a good way to reduce government’s footprint. Bob Hildreth is a former International Monetary Fund economist whose professional work involved restructuring Latin American debt and marketing sovereign debt loans. He is the founder of Boston-based Hildreth Institute, Inversant, and other nonprofit organizations with complementary missions to help get low-income students to college.  The post Here’s how we can help solve the student loan crisis: sell the debt    appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/massbay-e1707743859561-edited.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-01 09:01:12.626320

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned Alabama’s ban on the NAACP, allowing the NAACP to operate in the state for the first time in eight years. 
NAACP leader Ruby Hurley set up the office in Birmingham in 1951, only to be forced to flee the state five years later after Alabama authorities aggressively investigated the NAACP and tried to seize membership records. 
After the NAACP refused, an Alabama judge levied a fine against the organization and threatened more penalties it refused to comply. The NAACP sued, only to have the Alabama Supreme Court dismiss the litigation. NAACP lawyers argued that the release of such records could invite reprisals and attacks on their members. 
In 1958, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the right of association and assembly under the First Amendment is protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. If the high court had upheld the state’s attempts to seize membership records, it would have dealt a serious blow to the organization, its members and the movement itself.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06104623/Ruby-Hurley-June1-FeatImage.jpg,,,2025-06-01 09:01:12.626320

Every day we delay, more kids are being hurt.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont state legislators: Big Tech doesn’t want you to know what’s happening to your kids online. We do..","This commentary is by 17 Vermont state legislators. Their names are listed below the text of the commentary.There’s a battle happening over your child’s safety — and most Vermonters have no idea it’s underway. That’s because it’s being waged behind closed doors: not in press conferences or public hearings, but in whispered conversations, anonymous letters and legal threats from some of the most powerful corporations in the world.As Vermont state legislators and sponsors of the Vermont Kids Code (S.69) — also known as the Age-Appropriate Design Code — we’ve been on the frontlines of this fight. We want to share what we’ve seen, what’s really at stake, and why we need Vermonters to stand up and speak out before it’s too late.S.69 is a common-sense bill designed to protect children online. It prohibits manipulative features like autoplay and endless scroll for minors. It prevents companies from making programming decisions designed to addict and exploit. It defaults to strong privacy settings. And it says that if a company knows that its product is being used by a kid, they have a duty to protect them — not exploit them.But Big Tech doesn’t want that.Your child’s attention is money. Their data is money. Their mental health? Their safety? That’s just collateral damage.So the moment this bill started moving, the industry mobilized. But they didn’t show up themselves — not Meta, not Snap, not TikTok, not Google.Instead, they deployed front groups — organizations with friendly sounding names like NetChoice and TechNet, funded by Big Tech but designed to appear neutral. These groups flooded lawmakers with memos filled with legal jargon and exaggerated fears of censorship.Big Tech refused to testify in public. And their front groups? They didn’t come out of the gate disclosing who they represent. And not once — not once — did they mention the stories of children whose lives have been destroyed by the very systems we’re trying to regulate.They didn’t talk about the 12-year-old Vermont girl who was allegedly raped by a man Snapchat recommended as a friend she might know.They didn’t talk about the students whose bodies were found after months of algorithm-fueled self-harm and depression.They didn’t talk about the parents who wake up every morning knowing their child will never come home again — because a multibillion-dollar company couldn’t be bothered to turn off a notification.Instead, they told us our bill might be “too hard” to comply with.That’s not a legal argument. That’s a business model problem.The truth is, we built this bill to withstand court scrutiny. We studied rulings in other states. We tailored the language. We removed any provision that regulated speech and focused only on product design and data processing. We listened to civil liberties groups, constitutional scholars and children’s advocates. We did the work. Because that’s our job.The opposition? They’re doing theirs too — but their job is to protect profit.These conflicting goals create a difficult fight. If we walked away from every hard fight, no child would wear a seatbelt. No parent would know if a toy was toxic. This is how progress happens. You write the strongest law you can, and then you defend it — because the cost of doing nothing is simply too high.And here’s what keeps us up at night: every day we delay, more kids are being hurt.More are being addicted. More are being preyed upon. More are falling victim to a system designed to exploit them.The 2025 S.69 Age-Appropriate Design Code passed the Vermont Senate on a vote of 25–5 and the Vermont House on a vote of 133–9 with strong tri-partisan support. The Legislature is expected to continue moving the bill forward and eventually send it to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk.If you are a parent, a grandparent, an educator or a young person tired of being treated like a product — you have a role to play.Contact the governor’s office today. Ask him to stand with Vermont families — not with the powerful out-of-state corporations working behind the scenes to stop this bill.Because this is the industry playbook. Meta, Snap, TikTok and Google profit from addicting and exploiting children — and when lawmakers push back, they send in front groups to confuse, delay and weaken the response.Gov. Scott has an opportunity to rise above their tactics and lead.We may not have their billions. But we have the truth. And the truth is, this bill will save lives.Let’s make sure the governor hears from Vermonters — not just Silicon Valley. Let’s show our kids that when it mattered, we stood up for them.Rep.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bill Jesdale: Buy some time and get education funding right.","Dear Editor,One of the compelling aspects of many sports is the pressure to perform or do something within some sort of prescribed timeframe.Major League Baseball now has very specific rules about pitchers not taking forever to deliver the next pitch. Batters can no longer retreat to constantly adjust batting gloves, read signs from base coaches and so forth. Batters and pitchers failing to meet the deadlines are penalized.Football and basketball have rules that force teams and players to move quickly. Again, penalties are levied if a team fails to act within the timeframe.The Vermont Legislature is under pressure to do something quickly about funding our public schools. The penalty in their case is to be viewed by some as not doing anything, being inept, incurring the displeasure of the governor and so forth. Unfortunately, the bills before them offer poor solutions and would have the effect of damaging many small communities and their very effective schools.The major theme in these bills is consolidation of school governance. Please remember that this was also the major theme of Act 46, which promised new efficiencies, lower costs and improved student outcomes in exchange for the loss of local control. How did that work out?My recommendation is to take the penalty. Throwing a rushed, bad pitch that lands ten rows up in the center field bleachers is a far worse outcome than the penalty for a delay.Vermont education funding is extremely complicated and finding reasonable solutions is tough work at best. The proposals from the administration assume that consolidation by itself will save money and that student performance will increase. Nonsense!

People just kept recognizing Russell Porter’s genius and offering him jobs.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Art, Architecture, Astronomy and the Arctic — A Vermonter’s curious career.","Russell Porter couldn’t get enough of adventures in frigid climes, participating in nine Arctic and sub-Arctic expeditions. Photo via National ArchivesIf Russell Porter ever wrote a resume, recipients could be forgiven if they thought someone was playing a joke on them. At various times, he was an artist, but also an engineer. An architect, but also a cartographer. He was a builder, and a death-defying arctic explorer, while also being a ground-breaking telescope designer.In truth, Porter might never have had to write a resume and make sense of all this nonlinear bouncing between vocations and avocations. Resumes weren’t mandatory in the job market during the first half of the 20th century. More importantly, he didn’t seem to need one, because people just kept recognizing his genius and offering him jobs. Here’s some of what his resume might have covered: Born in Springfield, Vermont, in 1871. Took college preparatory classes at Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, from which he graduated. Skipped freshman year of college, enrolling as a sophomore at Norwich University before transferring to the University of Vermont to study engineering. Left UVM before graduating when his family suffered a financial blow.Moved to Boston, where he took a job appraising buildings for an insurance company. Became so fascinated with the buildings’ designs that he decided he would become an architect. Enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study architecture, while still working part time as an appraiser to pay his bills.That’s when his career took its first surprising zag. In the fall of 1892, Porter attended a lecture by arctic explorer Robert Peary about his recent traverse of northern Greenland, which confirmed that it was indeed an island. Porter was transfixed by one thought — he had to join Peary’s team. As he explained, “Out of a clear sky that evening came to me the undefinable lure known as arctic fever.” Porter managed to secure an interview with Peary that winter in Washington. The conversation went well; Peary agreed to consider Porter for his next expedition.But Peary ultimately decided against taking Porter. Only years later did Porter learn that his mother had written the explorer, imploring him not to take her son.Russell Porter as a young man. Photo via Stellafane
The following year, Dr. Frederick Cook, who had been a member of Peary’s Greenland expedition, offered to take passengers to the Arctic for a fee of $500. Porter, who had studied painting under an accomplished MIT classmate and surveying in a college course, persuaded Cook to reduce the fee to $300. In exchange, Porter would serve as the group’s artist and surveyor. Apparently Porter’s mother didn’t object. Porter took leave from his job — he was working as an architectural draftsman by then — and voyaged north with Cook and 50 other paying passengers aboard a steamship. The Miranda attracted mishaps like a magnet. Departing the pier in New York City, the ship’s crew accidentally rammed the dock instead of backing out into the Hudson. En route to Greenland, the Miranda struck an iceberg. The ship stayed afloat, but needed repairs. Underway again, the Miranda struck an uncharted submerged reef, tearing a gash in its hull. The shriek of shredding metal filled the vessel. “I had for the first time been thoroughly frightened,” Porter wrote, referring to it as “tasting copper,” a sensation akin to what “one feels when placing upon the tongue certain electrodes that will generate a slight current.”The Miranda was beyond repair. Porter was one of a dozen men, including four Inuit guides, who boarded a sailboat to search for help. Sailing 150 miles north, crossing the Arctic Circle, the men located an American fishing schooner, the Rigel, which agreed to help. Once everyone had transferred from the Miranda onto the Rigel, the cable securing the Miranda was cast off and the stricken vessel steamed off into a fog bank, never to be seen again. Despite the dangers he’d faced, Porter was eager to return to the Arctic. He found the “fugitive glimpses of the shimmering ice cap” irresistible. Porter spent the next decade splitting time between Boston and expeditions in the frozen north. MIT gave Porter a scholarship to pursue postgraduate studies, even though he had never graduated college. But his mind was equally occupied with thoughts of the next expedition. When visiting Vermont in wintertime, he made a habit of getting off the train in Bellows Falls and walking the dozen miles to his family’s home to acclimate to the cold. In all, he would make another eight treks into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.Porter persuaded Peary to take him on an expedition hunting a large meteorite that had smashed into Greenland. Porter joined a small scientific team stationed in Umanak, a Danish settlement north of the Arctic Circle, where he oversaw the group’s food and camping equipment. In his free time, Porter helped the scientists monitor the movement of a nearby glacier. Peary didn’t find the meteorite, but Porter returned to Boston with watercolor portraits he had made of members of the local Inuit community. Porter rejoined Peary the next summer as he tried again to find the meteorite; this time, thanks to the help of Inuit guides, Peary was successful.After trying his luck in the Klondike gold rush in British Columbia, Porter joined the Baldwin-Ziegler Polar Expedition of 1901 as a surveyor and artist. The latter job almost got him killed. While sketching the shoreline one day, Porter became so engrossed in his work that he didn’t notice a large white bear approaching until it was about 100 feet away. The polar bear was already well aware of Porter, who was alone and about three miles from camp. Porter carried a rifle for just such an event. Aiming the gun at the bear, he pulled the trigger. The hammer moved as if in slow motion and came to rest gently on the firing pin. The gun’s oil had congealed in the frigid conditions. Porter dropped the gun, pulled out his knife and began shouting and dancing about. The display only made the bear more curious. Porter tasted copper for the second time in his life. In desperation, he whacked the gun over his knee in hopes of bringing it back to life, then raised the rifle again. This time it worked.Although the Baldwin-Ziegler Polar Expedition never lived up to its name — it never reached the North Pole — Porter returned to Boston impatient for his next chance. He signed on almost immediately with the Fiala-Ziegler Expedition, this time as artist, surveyor and assistant scientist. This expedition would be the most trying he endured.The America steams north of the Arctic Circle in this painting by Russell Porter. Photo via National ArchivesDuring the summer of 1903, Porter traveled to Russia, joining the expedition’s vessel, the America, and the rest of the crew in the far northern White Sea. While Porter and most of the men were camped on the northernmost island of the Franz Josef Archipelago, the America disappeared from its mooring one night during a heavy storm. Two days later, the men aboard the America managed to sail back to the bay, explaining that the ship had been blown out to sea. Things didn’t improve from there. In November, the America became trapped in the ice. The men salvaged goods from the ship and stripped every useful part before the America sank during a January storm. Subjected to cold and living off rationed food, the men split into feuding factions. To distract the men during the long, cold days, Porter fashioned a deck of playing cards from sheets of zinc, using his watercolors to paint the faces. The deck was four inches thick and weighed two pounds. His more serious task was taking celestial bearings to determine the location of their camp. While stranded, expedition leader Anthony Fiala made several attempts to reach the North Pole, selecting Porter as part of the team. But each effort failed. A relief ship finally rescued the men in the summer of 1905, after two years marooned above the Arctic Circle. After nine Arctic and sub-Arctic adventures, Porter decided at the age of 34 that it was time for a less perilous existence. His dream was now to start an art colony in Maine. He started by purchasing a house and 50 acres in Port Clyde from a fisherman. He soon married the fisherman’s daughter, Alice Belle Marshall. A few years later, the couple became parents to their daughter, Caroline.Crewmembers salvaged everything they could from the America after it was trapped in the ice. Photo via National ArchivesIf Port Clyde provided a fruitful place to start a family, his idea of forming an art colony there failed to take root. Porter shifted his attention to farming potatoes, like his neighbors, but only briefly. He moved on to something relevant to his actual training; he designed and built cottages to rent out, creating 14 unique designs for the houses, all done in a rustic English style. The next turning point in Porter’s life arrived in the mail. An old friend from Springfield, James Hartness, knowing that Porter was captivated by the cosmos during his years of Arctic navigation, sent him a copy of Popular Astronomy magazine. Porter’s celestial obsession dovetailed perfectly with the part of his brain that loved the challenges of engineering. Soon he was constructing telescopes, meticulously making his own mirrors, and building a small, domed observatory next to his home.Hartness, who had become wealthy as president of the Jones and Lamson Machine Company, mailed his friend $200 to support his telescope-building endeavors. He even gave Porter his decrepit Stevens Duryea automobile. The thing didn’t run, but no matter: its true value was providing parts for building telescopes. In Porter, Hartness had found a kindred spirit: the two corresponded regularly about telescope designs.Porter was on the move again in 1915, relocating to Boston with Alice and Caroline to teach architecture at MIT, a testament to his lived experience since he himself had never graduated. Soon, however, with World War I raging, Hartness, a leader in the machine tool industry, convinced officials with the National Bureau of Standards that Porter would be invaluable in Washington to solve issues producing enough optical instruments for the war effort.When the war ended, Hartness persuaded Porter to return to Springfield to help him develop an optical device to inspect screws for uniformity. It was less inspiring than spending nights gazing out through the Milky Way, but it paid the bills. Porter’s biographer, Berton C. Willard, wrote that Porter wasn’t “a joiner,” or “socially or civically minded.” But he was far from a hermit, and in fact Porter’s time in Springfield seems to contradict that characterization.In August 1920, Porter assembled a group of 16 men and one woman to teach them how to build telescopes, particularly the painstaking work of grinding and polishing mirrors by hand. Out of this first meeting of friends with a shared passion grew the Springfield Telescope Makers. Club members built a gathering place on a nearby hill owned by Porter, who naturally oversaw construction. He suggested they name it Stellar Fane, from the Latin for “shrine to the stars,” soon shortened to Stellafane. The group has held nearly annual gatherings since 1926, making it the longest-running astronomical convention in the United States. The founding members of the Springfield Telescope Makers club gather in 1920. Russell Porter is fourth from left. Photo via StellafaneGiven Porter’s unique combination of talents, it wasn’t hard to surprise his friends. Stellafane member Ralph Flanders, a manager at Jones and Lamson and a future U.S. senator, recalled an incident during a backcountry trip with Porter in Quebec. One night, while camped in a farmer’s field, Flanders asked Porter where exactly they were. “I’ll tell you,” Porter replied, taking out a saucer and pouring in maple syrup from their food supply, then balancing it on their car’s fender. Sighting the North Star with his sextant and bringing its image together with its reflection on the syrup, which acted as an artificial horizon in place of the sea’s horizon, he was able to calculate their latitude. Then, using the sextant, his wristwatch, and tables from his copy of The Nautical Almanac, along with the maple horizon, he determined their longitude. Scrawling the coordinates on a piece of paper, he said, “That’s where we are.” In 1925, Albert Ingalls, an editor at Scientific American magazine, visited Stellafane and came away impressed. His article about the club elicited enthusiastic letters to the editor from readers as far away as Alaska, Argentina, Australia, India, and Switzerland, demonstrating that amateur telescope building was becoming a global pastime. Porter became a leading figure in the hobby, writing regular pieces for Scientific American and other publications.Among his readers was George Ellery Hale, a prominent American astrophysicist who dreamed of building the world’s largest telescope. Ingalls arranged a dinner with Porter and Hale in New York City in early 1928 at which Porter spoke expertly about how Hale could realize his dream. Grabbing any paper that came to hand, he sketched out his ideas. Later that year, a pair of astronomers arrived in Springfield to speak with Porter. Not realizing who they were, Porter talked about a wide range of topics — the Arctic, art, life in Vermont. They might have skipped the topic of astronomy completely. Only when the men had left did Porter learn that Hale had sent them, and that he’d just been interviewed for a job. Apparently, it had gone well. Some weeks later, Hale telegraphed Porter: “Can you come to Pasadena for several months to assist in designing a 200-inch telescope.” Hale hoped Porter could “come at once to push work rapidly.”That telegram set the course for the final two decades of Porter’s life. Porter proved himself an invaluable addition to the team from California Institute of Technology building the massive telescope. With a mirror measuring 200 inches across, Hale’s telescope would be twice the size of the next largest in existence.Porter was initially assigned to design a specialized telescope to test the suitability of various sites around the Southwest. The team ultimately picked Palomar Mountain, southeast of Pasadena, as the location of the future observatory.Next, Porter designed a series of large Art Deco-style office and laboratory buildings. He also designed the mounting for the telescope, monitored manufacturing of the enormous mirror and devised the massive rotatable dome that would cover the telescope. One of his greatest contributions to the project, however, was creating masterful cutaway drawings that showed how parts that hadn’t yet been fabricated would interact. His drawings were credited with resolving heated debates within the team.“(T)o think that any artist had his pictorial imagination in such working order as to construct these pictures with no other material data than blue prints … is simply beyond belief,” declared famed New Hampshire painter Maxfield Parrish. “These drawings should be in a government museum of standards, in a glass case, along with the platinum pound weight, yard stick, etc. to show the world and what comes after just what a mechanical drawing should be. … The pity is that comparatively few will know about them, for their creation should be world news.”When World War II broke out, Porter’s skills were used to show the inner workings of rockets before a prototype had even been made. And when the U.S. military ran short of prisms for use in antiaircraft and artillery pieces, he rallied telescope enthusiasts to boost the supply. The amateurs manufactured more than 28,000 prisms that met the military’s exacting specifications.The war delayed the completion of the Palomar Observatory, but Porter lived just long enough to see it begin operation in 1948. The Hale Telescope allowed humans to see farther into the universe than ever before. It is still in operation today.Late in life, Porter received an honorary doctor of science degree from Norwich University. In January 1949, Middlebury College’s president and fellows voted to do likewise at the school’s spring graduation, but Porter died before he could receive it.As gratifying as those tributes might have been, Porter, that lover of barren landscapes, might have been more thrilled that two celestial craters — one on the moon, one on Mars — were named in his honor.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Then Again: Art, Architecture, Astronomy and the Arctic — A Vermonter’s curious career.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Arctic-expedition-1024x694.jpeg,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez and Jessica Kutz of The 19th. Meet Barbara and Jessica and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this week that the federal government no longer recommends the COVID-19 vaccination for healthy pregnant people and healthy children, a move that immediately raised questions from medical experts.
“Despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement. “The COVID vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants.”
Kennedy did not cite any data along with his decision, though he has long questioned the need for frequent COVID-19 boosters for children.
Removing COVID vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for pregnant people or children could impact the availability of the vaccines or if they are covered by insurance. Dr. Sean T. O’Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that removing the recommendation “could strip families of choice.”
“Those who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage and access remain unclear. … What is clear is that pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,” he said.
An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to The 19th’s request for comment.
Here’s what we know about Kennedy’s announcement and how it could impact pregnant people and access to the vaccines.
 Why were COVID-19 vaccines recommended to pregnant people and children to begin with? 

Scientific studies have shown that pregnant people are at higher risk of developing more severe cases of the virus than people who aren’t pregnant. As a result, pregnant people are more likely to end up hospitalized. They are also over 10 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the general population. Studies have also shown a link between COVID and an increased risk of stillbirth.
Vaccinating pregnant people has not only been shown to lower these risks, but also offers some protection to newborns. Antibodies from a parent who received the vaccine while pregnant can provide some immunity to infants in the weeks and months after birth, according to Charlotte Moser, co-director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “[It] is the safest way to protect those babies,” she said in an email.
Studies have shown that COVID-19 may be less severe in healthy children. But Moser said children who become infected with COVID-19 are at risk of being hospitalized, developing long COVID or dying from the virus. COVID-19 vaccines decrease those risks.
 Will my health insurance still cover a COVID-19 vaccine if I’m pregnant? What about for my children? 

“It is not totally clear yet,” said Joshua Sharfstein, a public health professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He was also a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official under the Obama administration.
Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance providers are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC, but some experts, including Sharfstein, are concerned that this announcement could mean insurance companies are no longer mandated to cover the COVID-19 vaccine for “healthy” pregnant people and children.
It’s still too early to know whether private insurance companies will remove vaccines from their coverage. It may still be more cost effective for companies to pay for the vaccine, versus paying for severe illnesses that might result from being unvaccinated, experts said.
Sharfstein said private insurance is still clearly required to cover a COVID-19 vaccine for a pregnant person or child who has a medical condition that meets the criteria for a higher risk of severe COVID.
But it’s unclear who falls under these categories, said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a longtime expert in infectious diseases. She noted that the health secretary is contradicting an FDA announcement last week that listed pregnant people as a high risk category that makes them eligible for the vaccine.
“They need to get their message straight,” she said in an email.
 How will this affect access to COVID-19 vaccines? 

That’s also unclear. Richard Hughes, an attorney at the law firm Epstein Becker Green, who previously served as vice president of public policy for a major vaccine manufacturer during the COVID pandemic, said manufacturers could eventually reduce their supply as they determine their bottom lines. That could shake up overall product availability at doctors’ offices and pharmacies.
In addition, if private insurance companies stop covering the vaccine, it could be a barrier for those with low incomes.
“We know that any amount of out-of-pocket [cost] for a vaccine is going to discourage a patient from getting vaccinated,” he said. “The more that increases, the less likely they are to get it.”
This announcement does not immediately impact the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, a federally-funded initiative that aims to vaccinate children whose parents or caregivers might not be able to afford them. However, given how the health secretary has sidestepped protocol to remove this recommendation for pregnant people, some experts worry that Kennedy may similarly make decisions for the VFC program.
 Wait, so can Kennedy do this?

Medical experts say Kennedy’s announcement — which came via a one-minute video posted on X — appeared unilateral, since a key vaccine panel that would typically make such recommendations did not appear to vote on the matter. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which is housed under the CDC, isn’t scheduled to meet again until June.
Kennedy, as HHS secretary, does have legal authority to modify recommendations made by an advisory committee, according to Hughes.
But experts say this decision is highly unusual. This is the first time a health secretary has circumvented the typical review process for vaccination recommendations, and experts stressed that making these kinds of decisions — which they described as not using the science-based procedures that are in place — puts lives at risk.
Several also noted Kennedy’s lack of medical expertise and his long history of vaccine skepticism.
“This signals that health advice for all Americans is now subject to the whim of the secretary of HHS who has no relevant expertise and a long track record of misleading people about vaccines. This should be of concern to everyone,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s school of public health, in an email.
 Will this decision face legal challenges? 

“I expect there will be lawsuits and I expect the administration is not in a good position for those lawsuits,” said Dorit Rubenstein Reiss, a professor of law at the University of California College of Law, San Francisco.
Reiss predicted the decision will be challenged in court by patients who could file a lawsuit if they are denied coverage for the vaccine from insurance companies. Cities and states who buy the vaccination could also sue, she said.
Both the lack of evidence presented by the health secretary and what appeared to be procedural irregularities in making this decision could bolster these court challenges, she said. Not only did Kennedy appear to sidestep the committee that makes these decisions, but he appears in the announcement alongside Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Marty Makary, the commissioner of the FDA. Those men have an anti-COVID vaccine bias, and neither role is typically involved in vaccine recommendations.
“It’s ignoring our usual process that involves expert deliberation and examination of the decision and making what looks like a political decision without a lot of consideration of the effects,” she said.
The fact that Kennedy did not provide evidence for the change is also problematic, Reiss said.
“If you look at the recommendation for pregnant women, it’s a lengthy document by ACIP setting up why they think pregnant women should get the vaccine [which includes] data,” she said. That decision can’t be reversed with a one-minute video on social media, she said. “Under administrative law, an agency is expected to explain its actions.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/preg-1.png,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-01 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Sinners’ and the Blues used to tell epic story of the Great Migration,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/01/sinners-and-the-blues-used-to-tell-epic-story-of-the-great-migration/,"Column: The epic story of the Great Migration — and the influence of Blues music on the world — is at the heart of the epic movie ""Sinners.""","Note: Special screenings of “Sinners” were held in Clarksdale this week after residents decried the lack of a movie theater. You can read more about those events here.

Blues music has long been linked to the mystical or supernatural.
After all, the seminal Blues tale is of legend Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads of U.S. Highways 49 and 61 in the Delta to be able to play a guitar like no one else.
In the movie “Sinners,” set in 1932 Clarksdale in the very Delta town where Johnson is rumored to have made that faustian bargain, those mystical connections are taken to a whole new level.
The movie is based on the believable theory that music or especially gifted musicians can conjure up magic through their performances. Surely, that theory is relatable. After all, many people have been moved spiritually by all types of music. But the movie concludes these gifted musicians can conjure up good and, yes, bad spirits from the past and the future.
In “Sinners,” Sammie, played by actor Miles Caton, who recently visited Clarksdale for a special showing of the movie, is such a talented musician that vampires are attracted to his offerings.
Yes, this is a vampire movie. On first blush, the movie may not seem all that realistic. After all, why would twin brothers Smoke and Stack, both played by Michael B. Jordan, escape the Mississippi Delta after World War I, move to Chicago and then return home in the midst of Jim Crow and the hatred and lynchings it entailed? That seems almost more unbelievable than vampires.
But the brothers referred to Chicago as Jim Crow with tall buildings, though there also was the inference that they might have returned home to try to escape from some issues they had with their employer, the Al Capone crime syndicate.
The movie is so rich with symbolism that perhaps the juke joint where Sammie, the brothers and their allies try to find safety represents their Mississippi home. And perhaps the vampires that lurked outside represent those migratory cities: rich with opportunities (as the vampires in the movie offer) but also rife with dangers. But near the end of the movie, the dangers of their Mississippi home are made clear in vivid detail.
At the heart of the multidimensional movie, which could be considered a musical, is the story of that Great Migration — the period, of course, when Africans Americans fled the nastiness of the South, taking with them the rich and unique culture of their home.
Mississippi still has the largest percentage of Black residents — about 38% — of any state. But remember, the state had a majority Black population before the Great Migration. Black Mississippians who left had an enormous influence on the rest of the nation, and Black Mississippians who stayed can be credited with helping lead a reckoning over numerous American civil rights.
That reckoning, coupled with other aspects of the Great Migration, forever changed the South, changed the north and arguably changed all the world.
An important part of that change was the expansion and the impact that the Delta Blues brought to the world. That impact was highlighted in the surprising and inspiring feel-good ending that will remain unwritten here in deference to the people who have not yet seen the movie.
Family members of “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler were part of that Great Migration. But in an interview, Coogler said he did not recognize the full extent of that impact until he started researching and making the movie.
“I found that there’s a legitimate argument to be made that the Delta Blues music is America’s most important contribution to global popular culture,” Coogler told IndieWire. “It might be America’s most important artistic contribution to humanity came out of this place, and that’s when I realized that the film had to be epic.”
And it is epic, just as the Great Migration at the heart of the movie was.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/29124042/AP25094161362490.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:59:03.190884

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerChittenden property owner John Gerlach has been found in contempt in the latest development  of an ongoing legal battle with Mountain Top Resort. The May 22 decision came after Gerlach removed a rope barring access to one of the resort’s cross-country trails.The dispute began last summer when Gerlach and his wife, Debra, relocated two of the resort’s trails that ran through their private land.The Gerlachs purchased the property with an easement that allowed Mountain Top Resort to operate ski trails within their property lines, but also permitted the Gerlach family to move trails as long as cross-country skiers had access to similarly safe and groomed trails. The resort’s general manager and activities director said at the time that the two modified trails were too narrow and steep to groom, limiting their cross-country skiing guests’ access and potentially hurting their business.In October, Rutland Superior Court Judge Alexander Burke agreed with the resort in a preliminary injunction, which granted the resort permission to use the original trails and prohibited the Gerlachs from interfering with existing trails or the resort’s maintenance and safety measures.But in February, the resort claimed in a motion to the court the Gerlach family violated the terms of the order by obstructing safety markers and using snowmobile equipment on resort trails. The resort asserted such activities affect employees’ ability to maintain existing trails, although snowmobiles are used on other resort pathways.READ MORE
During a Christmas visit to Chittenden from his primary residence in Florida, John Gerlach took down a rope the resort placed on the Sunset Trail to bar cross-country skiers entry, and used a snowmobile on trails crossing his property where such activities are not allowed by the resort.In the May 22 decision, Burke held John Gerlach in contempt for removing the rope marking the trail closure, but disagreed that use of snowmobile equipment violated the injunction and impaired the resort’s ability to maintain trails. John Gerlach’s son, Jake, also was found to have snowmobiled and repeatedly removed rope from a closed trail during a visit to the Chittenden property in March, but Burke did not find him in contempt, as he was not the subject of the initial injunction.The Gerlachs were ordered to not remove the resort’s trail closure ropes and to instruct their guests to follow suit. The Gerlachs must also pay the resort’s attorney fees related to the motion requesting enforcement of the injunction and sanctions. This is not the only legal conflict the Gerlach family has faced over trails.The Gerlachs claimed the town of Chittenden failed to legally establish a public trail running through their 600-acre property. The previous land owners entered an agreement in 2006 allowing a former road running through the property to be transformed into a publicly accessible hiking trail.In a May 5 ruling, Burke denied the Gerlachs’ request for the court to rule that no past agreements properly set up the trail for public use after a similar route was discontinued in the 1800s. Burke instead granted summary judgement to the town, asserting the previous owners “unequivocally intended to dedicate the disputed trail to public use.”A lawyer for the Gerlach family and lawyers for the town of Chittenden were not immediately available for comment Friday.Khele Sparks, general manager of the Mountain Top Resort, said the resort could not offer comment at this stage of litigation. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trail tensions escalate: Chittenden landowner held in contempt in legal battle with Mountain Top Resort.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mountaintop-resort-1-20241114-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

It’s one of the state’s top food exports.But cacao doesn’t grow in Vermont, and climate change has been disrupting the global supply chain. Vermont businesses that rely on cocoa are having to make changes.Miller Farm, a dairy farm in Vernon, is one of them. Their chocolate milk is one of their best-selling products. But in February, production almost came to a halt.The farm was down to its last bag of cocoa powder. And Peter Miller, one of the owners of Miller Farm, said his usual supplier had run out.“I couldn’t find it anywhere,” he said. “I was told there was a shortage due to climate change.”Eventually, Miller was able to find and buy cocoa powder from a different supplier. But he said changing the farm’s chocolate milk recipe on the fly was “frightening.”A newborn calf named BunBun at Miller Farm on April 22, 2025. Photo by Keely Ehnstrom/CNS“We didn’t know if we’d have a great falling out of customers,” he said. “It’s like if Heinz had to change their ketchup formula. All of the sudden, it tastes different.”The cacao plant grows along the equator, largely in West Africa and Central and South America. Climate change in those regions is making weather unpredictable. And cacao is getting harder to grow.Which means, for consumers like Miller Farm, it’s getting harder to buy.And Miller Farm is not alone.Amy Huyffer and her husband Earl Ransom have been making chocolate milk at Strafford Organic Creamery for about 20 years. Their cocoa powder supplier also recently ran out.Their solution was to amp up their supply of maple milk. Huyffer said they get their maple from a friend down the road.“Unlike cocoa powder that I was working for weeks and then months to try and keep in stock, the maple syrup — I could call and Willis came up that afternoon with a new barrel,” Huyffer said.Strafford Organic Creamery now has chocolate milk again. But Huyffer says she doesn’t know what their supply will look like in the future.A Miller Farm employee bottles chocolate milk in the milk plant on April 22, 2025. Photo by Keely Ehnstrom/CNS“I mean we can make plans all day, but the agricultural gods tend to laugh at them,” she said.Other local businesses are improvising as well.Lake Champlain Chocolates in Burlington is one of Vermont’s largest chocolatiers. And as cocoa gets harder to source, Lake Champlain Chocolates is trying to get creative.“We make our own marshmallows here and we dip them in chocolate,” communications manager Meghan Fitzpatrick said. “So we’re trying to sell really delicious confections that maybe don’t use as much chocolate. You know, leaning into our caramels and other things we make here that don’t require, like, a solid piece of chocolate.”Meghan Fitzpatrick, communications manager of Lake Champlain Chocolates, at its Burlington store on April 16, 2025. Photo by Keely Ehnstrom/CNSErnesto Méndez is a professor of agroecology at the University of Vermont who studies sustainable food systems. He says while climate change affects both the quality and quantity of cacao, there might be a silver lining for cacao farmers.“Climate change is a crisis, but it also brings an opportunity for the farmers to negotiate better prices,” he said.Méndez says the consumers in the Global North might need to start paying more and offering more support to the producers in the Global South.“Of course, they don’t want to do it, because they’re going to lose some of that profit,” he said. “But they’re realizing now that if they don’t do it, they might not have enough supply.”Meghan Fitzpatrick at Lake Champlain Chocolates agrees. She says people and corporations that buy cocoa have long enjoyed low prices.“We — people who enjoy chocolate — we haven’t really been paying what chocolate is worth for a really long time,” she said.Fitzpatrick said Lake Champlain Chocolates started a new program this year to award micro-grants to cacao farmers to help address issues caused by climate change.“We’re looking to make some systemic changes at that level, you know, ensuring our future, because climate change is a real issue with cocoa,” she said.As the climate changes, everyone who is part of the cocoa supply chain is adapting. Luckily, Amy Huyffer at Strafford Organic Creamery said, that’s what farmers are good at.“Two most important words in farming are ‘oh’ and ‘well,’” she said. “So we’ll figure it out.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sweet survival: Vermont businesses navigate climate cocoa crisis.",https://i0.wp.com/vtcommunitynews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/peter-miller-dairy-farm-vernon-community-news-service-20250422-edited.jpg?resize=4414%2C2942&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Read the story on VTDigger here:  What is: Winning an episode of ‘Jeopardy’?.","Jim Carpenter is the first “Jeopardy” contestant from Charlotte. He was last Friday’s champion. Photo courtesy of Jim CarpenterThis story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on May 29.Some Charlotters might recognize Jim Carpenter as a regular on the pickleball courts, but now all of America knows him as a champion on the beloved television show “Jeopardy,” after winning last Friday’s nail-biter of an episode.The six-year Charlotte resident — born and raised in Burlington — is now one of 53 Vermonters since 1995 who have competed on the show. But according to Alison Shapiro Cooke, the TV show’s executive director of publicity and communications, Carpenter is the only Charlotter to make an appearance in the show’s history.The show itself has garnered a cult following over the years and many people associate watching the show with their growing-up years. For Carpenter, his experience was similar. He said he grew up watching the show with his dad.“Even after I was grown up and gone and would come back and visit, he and I would watch it together and try to beat each other out,” he said.He had been taking the online 50-question “anytime tests” — an entry point for anyone who wants to compete on “Jeopardy” — for a few years but had never actually anticipated being on the big screen. But one day, out of the blue, he got an email asking him to do a monitored test over zoom.“I mean, there are so many people who take those tests, I never really expected much to come of it,” he said.He continued through a few more Zoom tests, making it to the final mock test round before he was placed in a pool of applicants eligible to be on the show, but still the odds of actually getting called aren’t guaranteed.In February, he got the phone call and luckily his wife was around to suggest he answer the random California number that he thought was spam.“My cell phone rings, and I looked at it and it was a California number that I didn’t recognize,” Carpenter recalled. “And my wife, I said, ‘Oh, who’s calling your cell phone?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s California. It’s probably spam.’ She said, ‘Well, no, wait a minute, that might be ‘‘Jeopardy.’’ So, I answered it, and it was.”He flew to Los Angeles in February for two days of filming with nearly 10 other contestants. When it came time for his turn, Carpenter was up against some stiff competition, the prior three-day champion, Brendan Liaw, a recent college graduate from Vancouver.“He was looking pretty hot and pretty confident going into the game,” Carpenter said. “I got off to a little bit of a slow start.”One of the most challenging parts of the game, he said, was learning the timing of the buzzer. Contestants are only allowed to buzz once the entire question has been asked.“You don’t see this on TV, but there are blue lights on either side of the big game board, and those blue lights flash on when the buzzers are actually enabled to answer the question,” he said. “When it comes on, you start clicking away to see if you can actually beat everybody else to the buzzer.”Carpenter, a retired music professor, doesn’t tout himself as some sort of trivia buff. The knowledge that it takes in a multitude of different topics to compete on the show came from being both well-read and well-versed, he said. Teaching music at different colleges and being immersed in the university realm also helped him to engage in a slew of different subjects and conversations.And, of course, he is an avid New York Times crossword buff.“There’s a lot of funny and obscure little bits and pieces that come out of that sort of thing,” he said. “I’ve always just had kind of a sticky memory where I will remember all kinds of odd little bits of information that somehow get stuck in my head.”Carpenter won $25,601 during his first game and ultimately brought home the gold in Final Jeopardy. The question in the category of “Time” was: “Eponymously named and in use for more than 1,600 years, it was based in part on concepts from the Greek mathematician Sosigenes.”Carpenter, the only contestant to answer correctly and wager enough money to give him a leg up, wrote down “What is the Julian calendar?”“Where I knew that from, I have no idea at this point, but it came into my head,” he said, letting out a laugh.While he didn’t secure a win Monday night in his follow-up appearance, competing for that long as a fan — and securing a win as a contestant — was enough for him. Not many people can add ‘winning Jeopardy’ to their list of accolades, after all.“My whole thought was, whether I win or whether I lose, this is an experience that not very many people get to have,” he said. “I was a little nervous going out and certainly hoping that I would not do something to look really dumb in front of a national audience, but my whole mindset was just to go out and enjoy the experience.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  What is: Winning an episode of ‘Jeopardy’?.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jim-carpenter-jeopardy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Morgan Brown has fought to get Vermonters to recognize the humanity of their unhoused neighbors — inspired by his own housing instability. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Montpelier advocate reflects on cancer journey, advocating for unhoused neighbors and how the community has given back to him.","Morgan Brown and his cat Cleo. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownOn Montpelier’s lively Front Porch Forum, Morgan Brown is one of the most frequent posters, providing local news, commentary and occasional humor. “Can’t sleep at night? Restless?” began one recent post. “Not to worry, call the Insomnia Warmline. Our professionally trained, volunteer, experienced peers, people who are sleepless at night as well, will bore you to sleep.”When Brown went silent for several months this winter, his absence was noted by locals. Upon his return in February, he had some not-so-humorous news to share: He had been diagnosed with an aggressive case of colon cancer and been in and out of the hospital for weeks. The response was immediate and kind. “Morgan Brown, So sorry to hear of your health struggles. I’m thinking of you,” Cindy McCloud wrote on Front Porch Forum. Brown told VTDigger he was incredibly grateful for the Montpelierians who had driven him to the hospital, brought him omelettes and scrambled eggs, and looked after his cat, Miss “Cleo” Cleopatra, while he was gone. “I’ve learned not to say no because that sometimes pisses people off because they want to help,” he said. In mid-May, Brown received a positive update. His oncologist told him he could have a year or more to live if he pursued treatment, rather than his initial prognosis of three months to a year. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownBrown fully intends to pursue treatment. However, he said he’s still in a lot of pain. “I’m a fighter, and I intend to beat those odds, so I intend to be around for a while,” he said. “Winston Churchill’s favorite saying every day in the morning was, ‘Keep buggering on.’ And that’s basically a model I’ve adopted — keep buggering on.”Brown’s diagnosis has also forced him to retire from his passion of advocating for unhoused Vermonters, especially those living on the streets of Montpelier. Brown has attended protests, served on the city’s Homelessness Task Force, and written commentaries for outlets like VTDigger in support of policies that would provide more compassion and support to unhoused Vermonters. The issue is personal to him. Brown spent 12 years living unhoused, transitioning between a variety of living situations before he found housing 15 years ago. When it comes to housing policy, Brown is adamant and firm. “There shouldn’t be one person living outside,” he said. Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont and a friend of Brown’s, called him a well-respected member of the community who gives with “all of his heart.”She said she was saddened to hear of his cancer diagnosis. “I don’t really want to know a world where Morgan Brown is not part of the life that I have or the work that I do because we need him here,” she said. READ MORE
‘Every person is worth the effort’Brown grew up in eastern Massachusetts but said he never felt connected to it. “I don’t say I’m from there. I say I was plopped there as a little kid,” he said. Photo courtesy of Morgan BrownHe first came to Vermont more than 30 years ago. He had chipped in to help a friend get their car up to Montpelier. From the first time he saw the small city, he knew he wanted to live there. “I saw the kids hanging out in front of City Center. I said to myself, ‘Well, if they can do that, this place is for me, you know, I’ll be accepted,’” he said. For a while Brown lived at Another Way, a local community center for unhoused Vermonters and psychiatric survivors. The center did not usually allow people to live there, but he had an “unofficial” arrangement, he said. “Otherwise, I would have been out in the woods with a tarp,” he said. Eventually, with the assistance of an employee at Washington County Mental Health Services, Brown was able to get a motel room, then an apartment. When asked about how his experience informs his opinions on the housing crisis, he deflected. “I try not to just use my own perspective. I watch and I listen to whoever’s outside and whatever. And I actually draw more on that than my own (experience),” he said.Lately, he’s had a hard time keeping up with the local unhoused community because his health mostly keeps him at home. Brown lives in a small efficiency apartment in a multi-unit building with Cleo, a 12-year-old cat with a “voracious appetite.”His recent hospitalization was the longest the two had been apart since he adopted her 11 years ago. “Ever since I got back from the hospital, she hasn’t let me out of her sight,” Brown said. He recalled one of the last in-person protests he was able to attend was the sleep-in on the steps of the Vermont Statehouse in 2021, when activists camped out at the Capitol for weeks to protest the removal of unhoused Vermonters from the motel program.Although he stayed with them for only one night — and “didn’t get any sleep at all,” he said — Siegel recalled Brown coming by to give the protesters water and moral support, then getting a hotel room in town for them when the protest was over so they could go straight to bed. “He did not tell us, because we would have refused,” she said. “It was just like, I can’t quite describe it, but he would show up with whatever he had and give all of it.”Since then, the two have kept in touch through text and email. Siegel has read Brown’s poetry out loud at various protests and events. “He writes beautiful poetry, and especially beautiful poetry about the experience of homelessness and the experience of watching other people go through it after now that he’s housed,” she said. His poetry, political writing and observations about daily life are collected on his blog, Green Mountain Meandering Missives. At times he addresses his thoughts on the housing crisis directly to Gov. Phil Scott.“It boggles the mind how your administration can be so deliberately indifferent and uncaring when it comes to those who are being or already have been evicted from the Vermont Hotel/Motel Program without those persons having anywhere else safe and secure to go inside, day or night,” he wrote in an open letter to Scott last month.The Legislature and Scott have clashed in recent years over whether to extend funding to the state’s motel program, which housed thousands of Vermonters during the Covid-19 pandemic but has slowly been rolled back. To everyday Vermonters, Brown asked them to consider doing for others what they would want done for their loved ones if they were facing a difficult situation. “What would you want for your loved ones? You’d pull out all the stops, right?” he said. He said society tends to classify certain people as “not worth it” — but Brown said he believes “every human life, every person is worth the effort.”“The problem is sometimes people have given up on themselves, so we need to double down on them. We need to show them that they matter. That somebody cares for them, even if they don’t care for themselves,” he said. “And that, sometimes it helps. Without wanting something from them. They’re not obliged, there’s no expectation. I’m not a religious person, per se, but it’s God’s true love.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Montpelier advocate reflects on cancer journey, advocating for unhoused neighbors and how the community has given back to him.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Morgan-Brown-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Left to right, Jeff Carmon, Chairman Francis DeLuca, Stacy ""Four"" Eggers, Siohban Millen, and Robert Rucho. Our democracy, with free and fair elections at the cornerstone, can be warped in favor of those who manipulate the election process to their advantage – who gets to vote, when and where, and which votes are included when they’re finally counted. Call that a cornerstone of autocracy.
For the past 15 years in North Carolina, ever since Republicans captured majorities in the state House and Senate amid President Obama’s first-term struggles, the party has sought to solidify its hold on power in just that fashion.
The tactics have been manifold: gerrymandering that puts Republicans in disproportionate numbers of safe seats. Photo ID rules that cut against groups of voters who might tend to favor Democrats. Stricter rules for absentee voting that result in some ballots being tossed because they weren’t received in time, perhaps because of postal delays.
Republican legislators have been the driving force behind such changes – with elected Republican judges helpfully turning aside cries of foul from Democrats and their allies among voting-rights advocates.
All of that brings us to a chain of events triggered by last fall’s elections, in which Democrat Josh Stein claimed the governor’s mansion and, by a single seat in the House, Republicans lost their veto-proof legislative majority. The results apparently left Republicans in the General Assembly to vow, “You ain’t seen nothing yet!”
The counter-strategy they cooked up has panned out with what amounts to a hostile takeover of an agency that worked to advance the principles of honest, orderly elections in which every eligible citizen is encouraged to participate. That is of course the State Board of Elections – under control of the governor’s party by virtue of a law dating back decades.
The takeover was set in motion when it became clear that, with Stein’s victory, the board otherwise would continue with a Democratic majority. Legislators decreed that instead of by the governor, appointments to the board would be made by the state auditor – a post captured in the November balloting by Republican Dave Boliek.
In essence, the auditor would hold the reins when it came to the state’s election oversight. The changeover would – and did – take effect on May 1, after Stein’s court challenge was sidetracked by Republicans on the state Court of Appeals and then the state Supreme Court.
Court contest’s lessons
As it would happen, much water went under the bridge between the passage in December (over Stein’s veto) of Senate Bill 382 and the power shift in which Boliek appointed new Republican members to run the board, and the board’s nationally heralded executive director, Democratic appointee Karen Brinson Bell, was ousted.
North Carolina’s political headlines throughout the end of 2024 and the first months of 2025 were dominated by the contested Supreme Court election between Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs and her challenger, Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin of the Court of Appeals.
Riggs’ 734-vote victory finally was nailed down on May 5 – no thanks to Griffin’s allies on the two appellate courts who agreed with him that thousands of votes shouldn’t have been counted. It took a Republican-appointed federal judge to explain why disallowing those votes would have violated the constitutional rights of citizens who cast them.
Here’s where the Riggs-Griffin clash and the Board of Elections saga became intertwined. The board, for reasons ultimately validated by Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, resisted the attempt to disallow votes that Griffin claimed shouldn’t have been counted, even though the people who cast them, including military and overseas voters, hadn’t knowingly violated any rules and there was no evidence of fraud.
If the board hadn’t pushed back, insisting for example that overseas voters actually didn’t need to submit copies of photo IDs, chances are that enough votes from likely Democrats would have been tossed aside that Griffin would have won the race.
Myers boiled down his thinking in everyday language: The legality of certain conduct should be assessed according to the laws in effect at the time. “That principle will be familiar to anyone who has played a sport or board game,” he wrote. “You establish the rules before the game. You don’t change them after the game is done.”
That was the election board’s point all along. Yes, it aligned with Democratic arguments. But nobody would accuse Judge Myers of carrying the Democrats’ water.
Auditor’s mission creep
While Griffin’s effort to overtake Riggs worked its way through the judicial pipeline, the law transferring election oversight to the state auditor was being challenged by Stein as an infringement on his executive powers. He argued that the state constitution gives him final responsibility for seeing that the laws are faithfully carried out, and thus he needs to be able to appoint a majority on the elections board who share his commitment to elections operated in the public interest.
Other attempts by the General Assembly to horn in the powers of Stein’s predecessor, Democrat Roy Cooper, were turned aside by the courts as violations of the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches. In the case of S.B. 382, top lawmakers argued that since state auditors are themselves executive branch officials, the legislature’s constitutional prerogative to assign duties within that branch allows them to take oversight of the elections board away from Stein and give it to Boliek.
In accord with the state’s procedure for refereeing alleged constitutional violations, Stein’s lawsuit was routed to a three-judge panel in Wake County Superior Court.
After a full-dress review, with briefs and oral arguments, the panel on April 23 reached a 2-1 decision that Stein’s complaints were justified. Even though North Carolina parcels out various executive duties to the elected members of the Council of State, including such figures as the state treasurer and the attorney general as well as the state auditor, the panel held that under the state constitution ultimate responsibility for the appointed Board of Elections lies with the governor. The two-person majority included one Democratic judge and one Republican. A Republican judge dissented.
Republican Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall appealed to the Republican-dominated state Court of Appeals. On April 30 – the day before the election board change was to take effect – a three-person panel of the court’s judges sided with the legislators, meaning that the changeover could go ahead. The unanimous, unsigned ruling contained no explanation and the judges who participated weren’t identified. No prizes for accountability there!
Stein filed a last-ditch appeal with the Supreme Court, where Republicans also rule the roost. With no immediate intervention by the high court, Boliek on May 1 took command of North Carolina’s election machinery. Instead of a 3-2 Democratic majority with a Democratic chairman, with Boliek’s appointees the elections board emerged with a 3-2 Republican majority.
The new chairman is Francis De Luca, a Republican activist who hardly has been a cheerleader for so-called same-day registration during early voting – a convenience encouraging many eligible citizens to cast their ballots. Another new member, former Republican state Sen. Robert Rucho, would belong in the Gerrymanderers Hall of Fame, were there such a dubious institution, for his work to tilt the scales in favor of Republican candidates for the legislature and Congress.
High court’s tilt
When the Supreme Court finally responded to Stein’s appeal, it rejected the governor’s argument that the reassignment of election oversight to the auditor should have been blocked while the appellate courts weighed the constitutional issues.
That leaves the election board’s new governance structure intact while Stein pursues his case. Of course as time elapses, as Boliek proceeds to appoint new members of county election boards and as this fall’s elections approach, unwinding that new structure becomes increasingly impractical.
The high court’s opinion was unsigned, meaning it was supported by the five Republican justices, although Justice Richard Dietz in a concurrence criticized the Court of Appeals’ opaque handling of the matter. Dissents came from the court’s two Democrats – Riggs, freshly sworn back into office after her drawn-out election win, and Anita Earls.
“The voters hired Joshua Stein and David Boliek to do specific jobs, and the General Assembly is restructuring those jobs after the election,” Earls wrote. “The General Assembly may not grab power over enforcement of election laws by shuttling the Board [of Elections] between statewide elected officials until it finds one willing to do its bidding.”
Well, that sort of power grab looks to be just what the legislature’s Republican chiefs had in mind, and acceding to it looks to be just what the appellate courts are inclined to do.
Continue down that path, and they’ll be turning over supervision of the state’s elections to people whose “election integrity” mantra has proven to be code for voter suppression driven by right-wing partisanship. Not only does that degrade our democratic system, but it also puts the best interests of many North Carolinians vulnerable to economic, educational, environmental and health challenges at unacceptable risk.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4499-1-1024x366.jpg,,,2025-06-01 07:01:10.732875

Moreover, the problem of fake news is increasing as we become ever more polarized and as our government tries to undermine and to silence media that exposes intentions and actions it wants to keep hidden from us. Adding to the problem is the proliferation of social media posts that may or may not be accurate.
Increasingly, I have become a supporter of independent journalism and have dropped my subscriptions to local papers — owned by what some call vulture equity firms, interested only in power and profit. I’ve even dropped my long-time subscriptions to two well-known national newspapers. Instead, I support my local library, where I can access, online, my local newspaper, as well as national news publications such as The New York Times and The Washington Post.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I am not necessarily advocating that you drop your newspaper subscription. Instead, I am hoping you are aware of the many independent news sources available to you. In Colorado, among those I support are Colorado Sun, Mountain Ear and this newspaper, Colorado Newsline (part of the States Newsroom organization).
Conveniently, in Colorado alone there are many more independent news sources than the three I have named. The Media and Democracy Project has compiled a list that can be found at the organization’s website.
Personally, I also support a number of independent national news sources, some of which are identified online at trustworthymedia.org.
Most crucially, I support those organizations that support independent journalism in a variety of ways — organizations such as the Colorado News Collaborative, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the Media and Democracy Project.
What do I mean by independent news sources? Independent news sources are those that are free from the influence of governments, corporations or special interest groups, ensuring that what they report is truthful. To determine independence, you could begin by looking at whether the news source is more reliant on facts than on opinions/arguments, by investigating the sources of its funding and whether there are potential conflicts of interest, by evaluating its history and track record (e.g., its record for exposing criminality or abuses of power), and by assessing the extent to which it follows established journalistic standards and ethics.
When I want to ensure that what I am reading is trustworthy, I search for primary sources if available (e.g., a C-Span video or a legal document) and for additional reports on the topic. I search FactCheck.org, Reuters Fact Check, Snopes, and Media Bias/Fact Check, too — all available online.
We are awash in fake news, and it is eating away at our society. We deserve an honest, skeptical, independent press. Too much of corporate-run media is only interested in lining their own pockets at our expense. According to a Sept. 18, 2020, article in TechStartups online:

These media conglomerates are owned by the elite or the ruling class, which extends its reach to encompass not only traditional power structures but also modern behemoths like big tech companies, exerting control over the content we consume — what we read, watch, and listen to …
The term “elite” often slips into our conversations without much thought, yet its roots and significance remain unfamiliar to many. Derived from the French élite, which traces back to the Latin eligere, meaning “to select or to sort out,” elites represent a select group of influential individuals who wield a disproportionate share of wealth, privilege, political power, or expertise within society.

Are you confused and overwhelmed about whom and what to believe?
If so, make a point of becoming a savvy news consumer, and spreader, of truly important and reliable news. Don’t repeat or repost something you’ve read without first checking out whether it’s true. And support independent journalism.

To access, click on the player above.
With final passage Saturday of a major early childhood education bill, legislators will return Monday to begin their three-day push to Wednesday night’s adjournment deadline with a limited to-do list topped by adopting a biennial budget and voting on a bipartisan energy deal.
Gov. Ned Lamont, and his wife, Annie, made a surprise visit to the state Capitol as the House debated Senate Bill 1, legislation creating a groundbreaking new fund for early childhood education that was Lamont’s major initiative in a year dominated by his desire to keep state finances under a spending cap.
“I think that’s a really big deal,” Lamont said of SB 1. “That was my No. 1 priority.”
The bill also expands the state’s support for special education, a legislative initiative accepted by an administration wary of new spending, even as the state is sitting on record budget reserves and continues to pay down Connecticut’s considerable unfunded pension liability.
While the governor posed for selfies with Democratic lawmakers, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, invited him to a brief, private discussion about an unresolved budget issue: a desire by Democratic lawmakers to establish even a modest child tax credit.

It was an unscripted moment.
“I was just walking through. Figured we’re here, say hi to the folks, wish them well. They just said, ‘Come on in. Let’s talk about something,’” Lamont said, as he exited the impromptu negotiation.
His top budget official, Jeffrey Beckham, was hastily summoned to join the chat, which also included the governor’s chief of staff, Matt Brokman. Nothing was resolved during the conversation, and the child tax credit’s prospects faded as the day progressed.
The last days of every annual session are unlike the previous months.
The combination of an unyielding constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight Wednesday and a tradition of unlimited debate means little can pass without bipartisan consent, empowering Republican minorities that hold fewer than one-third of seats in the House and Senate.
That shift means that Senate Bill 4, an effort to reduce Connecticut’s high electric rates, was being rewritten to accommodate a demand by House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, over procedures at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.
“There is definitely movement. I think the PURA language that was important, that we’re negotiating, is going our way. We’re having consensus. The legislature has come together in that language. It looks like we will have rate relief,” Candelora said. “It looks like we’ll be able to run it on Monday or Tuesday.”
On Friday, debate on a highway safety bill, HB 7160, was halted while lawyers discussed whether a Republican amendment increasing the penalty for distracted drivers could be adopted under the rules without a referral to the Judiciary Committee. Such a late referral would kill the bill.
“There are always bumps in the road and things that throw us off, right?” House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said Saturday, before the House convened. “I think there’s general agreement on the underlying bill.”
Indeed, the bill was brought back for passage on a 140-5 vote Saturday evening with bipartisan backing — and the briefest of debates. It now goes to the Senate.

There is nuance in how the tradition of unlimited debate and power sharing in the final days is observed. The legislature’s rules allow a motion to end debate and call a vote, a tool rarely employed. If filibusters are overused, Candelora knows that is an invitation for Democrats to call the question. 
What constitutes overuse is not precisely defined.
Candelora opposes Senate Bill 1, which would create an early childhood trust fund that is off budget and outside the spending cap. It passed on a 101-45 vote with no Republican support. But Candelora did not consider trying to stop final passage Saturday with a filibuster.
“We know this is going to be in the budget. So for us to filibuster this and talk it ’til Wednesday is kind of unrealistic, and it’s physically difficult to get members to stay here for six days,” Candelora said.
A multi-day filibuster likely would have provoked a vote to end debate. 
On opening day on Jan. 8, Ritter warned his own party to have their bills ready for votes before the final weeks of the session, when passage grows more difficult. And he cautioned Republicans not to abuse the filibuster. Both warnings were applauded.

The Senate was not in session Saturday after voting for final passage of House Bill 5002, the session’s major housing legislation, at 2:13 a.m. The House came in at noon and worked into the evening, debating SB 1. Both chambers will be in session Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Ritter, Rojas and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, proclaimed themselves satisfied with the annual session, even if scores of bills will die from inaction, as occurs every year.
“We’re in a really good place,” Ritter said.
“We’ve been working really well together so far. So I think that there’s a good opportunity to get a lot more done still,” Duff said.
Duff said the Senate hopes to deliver final passage of a climate bill that is a House priority. The legislation, House Bill 5004, would strengthen the state’s existing carbon-reduction goals and create a new “Clean Economy Council” to develop strategies and policies to help meet those targets.
Rojas said the House intends to vote on Senate Bill 10, a bill that strengthens the state’s rules to ensure insurers comply with mental-health parity coverage requirements. 
Some bills that languish on the final few days might find a path to passage by being folded into a budget bill, but Duff noted that requires agreement of the House, Senate and governor’s office.
He declined to speculate on which favored few might get such treatment.
Seventy-three House bills await final passage in the Senate. Ninety-three Senate bills were on the House calendar Saturday when debate began on SB 1. A small minority are guaranteed votes.
As for the rest?
Ritter smiled Saturday and alluded to the fact it’s the time of year when pretty much anyone can kill a bill simply by talking. If a lawmaker made enemies during the session, they will find out if one of their bills are called.
“Look, Tuesday and Wednesday, we’ll find out how you treated your colleagues, right?” Ritter said. “It’s the ultimate sign of how people feel about you.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_128-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

It's time for economic justice—now.","By Fay Lenz, President, The Arc CT
May 23rd marked IDD Awareness and Advocacy Day in Connecticut, established in 2023 through the leadership of the IDD Caucus to raise awareness and advocate for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We joined a strong, bipartisan group of legislators at the Capitol to commemorate the day and urge legislative action, because Connecticut’s nonprofit providers are in crisis. Now, just a week later, the situation has come to a head, and we need to act now.
Organizations and the Direct Service Providers that care for and support individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are being asked to do more with less—year after year. Despite small increases, nonprofit providers operate with 30% less buying power than in 2007 due to chronic underfunding and inflation. This financial instability is not an abstract budget issue—it’s a direct threat to the services thousands of individuals with disabilities and their families depend on every day.

This year, nonprofit providers are requesting a $264 million increase for the current fiscal year and $237 million the following year to restore funding, replace federal COVID-era funds, and raise Medicaid rates. This investment is not just overdue—it is essential.
Meanwhile, the gap between what the state pays its employees and what it provides to community-based nonprofits has grown unacceptably wide. According to one recent report, Connecticut state employee pay reached a record $5.4 billion in 2023. Some employees at the Department of Developmental Services (DDS)—the agency charged with overseeing services for individuals with IDD—earned more than $100,000 in overtime alone.
Kimberly, a DSP, finds a strong connection to her work. “We’re not just workers. We are their advocates, we’re their friends, and we’re their family,” she says, despite the low pay and the sacrifices she makes. Credit: The Arc CT
Consider this example: a single DDS staffer has a base salary of $61,000—already significantly higher than their counterpart at a nonprofit provider. However, when factoring in overtime exceeding $177,000, plus benefits and state retirement (SERS) contributions surpassing $134,000, this employee costs Connecticut taxpayers more than $400,000 per year. And this is just one instance—there are many similar examples. As the Governor works hard to reduce the state’s pension debt, the implications of these inflated salaries on Connecticut’s pension liability are staggering.
DSPs support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), enabling them to lead dignified, inclusive lives in our communities. They perform tasks that range from physical care to emotional support. It’s challenging and deeply rewarding work. Yet, despite its necessity, Connecticut DSPs remain profoundly undercompensated, earning on average just $19.65 per hour, significantly below the state’s calculated living wage of $24.13 for a single adult. DSPs are the backbone of the care system, yet we pay them poverty-level wages.
Let’s be clear: this is an economic justice issue. The majority of DSPs are women of color or minorities, many are raising families while earning wages that qualify them for public assistance. These frontline workers are among the most underpaid professionals in the state, despite performing physically and emotionally demanding work that requires deep commitment and compassion.
Connecticut cannot continue to ignore this injustice. If we value the lives of individuals with disabilities—and if we truly respect the people who support them—we must do better and address this funding disparity now.
I urge state leaders to shift priorities and fully fund nonprofit providers, using some of the “second largest surplus in state history” in a way that will have a meaningful impact. Raise wages for direct service professionals to a livable standard. Stop relying on low-wage, disproportionately minority workers to subsidize a system that cannot function without them.

Every person with a disability deserves consistent, compassionate support that will keep them safe. 
Every worker who provides that care deserves respect, a livable wage, and economic dignity. Connecticut must do better—and it must address this injustice now. I urge you, the citizens of Connecticut, to take immediate action. Contact your legislators and the Governor today and advocate for fair, living wages for our DSP workforce and full funding for our non-profit providers.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-01 08:59:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A delicate dance: Maneuvering around CT’s budget cap,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/01/ct-budget-spending-cap/,CT's options to adhere strictly to the spending cap are limited by dysfunctions that have plagued the mechanism through its 34-year history.,"As legislators and Gov. Ned Lamont scrambled last week to craft a new budget before Wednesday’s deadline, they groped for the latest in a string of maneuvers around a spending cap already strained to its limit.
A plan that already would underfund guaranteed worker benefits and shifts hundreds of millions off-budget to support child care and municipal aid would also abruptly boost, and then shrink, payments into the teachers’ pension fund — all to circumvent a fiscal guardrail Lamont assured business leaders was “sacrosanct” just four months ago.
But options to adhere strictly to the cap are severely limited by dysfunctions that have plagued this budget mechanism throughout its 34-year history. Without the extra spending those gimmicks permit, officials say, the legislature wouldn’t be poised to adopt a new budget before the 2025 session ends on Wednesday.
Put simply, a handful of big programs usually gobble much of the allowable spending growth and leave scraps for everything else. Over time, that creates big problems.
Lamont and legislators have avoided this since 2021, thanks mainly to $2.8 billion in emergency federal pandemic grants they’ve been able to spend outside of the formal budget. In other words, when the cap won’t allow more spending on any item, it could be bolstered with federal aid without breaking the rules.
But those pandemic funds largely have been exhausted, and dealing with the spending cap has never been more challenging.
Lamont: ‘A lot of people are gnashing their teeth’
“Let’s face it, I think a lot of people are gnashing their teeth under the [fiscal] guardrails,” Lamont said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon, explaining why he and Democratic lawmakers were grappling with yet another cap-centered impasse in budget negotiations. 
At first glance, the limit is relatively simple. Legislators may budget what they did the prior year, plus some growth that reflects average household income or inflation, whichever is greater. 
About one-quarter of the budget — payments on bonded debt and some pension contributions — aren’t subject to cap limits. Prior to 2017, neither was aid to poor cities and towns.
Legislative leaders told the governor last week they wanted to spend roughly $200 million beyond what the cap would allow in the 2026-27 fiscal year, the second of the new biennial budget. 
The solution they convinced Lamont to accept was unconventional but not illegal.
They agreed to make a one-time, $200 million payment — on top of the required $1.7 billion — into the teachers’ pension fund in 2025-26, which will be the last year of a temporary cap exemption for these contributions.

Rules call for the spending cap limit to grow two years from now to accommodate the teachers’ pension line item when it comes back under this system. But Democrats say the cap limit should grow by an extra $200 million in 2026-27, even though the bonus payment won’t be repeated that year.
That then would leave $200 million legislators could spend on something else without exceeding the cap.
Lamont’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, has been urging lawmakers throughout the 2025 legislative session to remember the system is about affordability and sustainable budgeting.
“We are responsible to taxpayers; therefore, spending must be sustainable and not grow faster than our residents’ ability to pay,” Beckham said in late April after the Appropriations Committee proposed to exceed the cap next fiscal year by $215 million.
Spending cap has plagued governors, legislatures for decades
But the budget is complex, and a few programs can hijack much of the spending growth allowed each year.
While the capped portion of the budget grew just 7% between 2015 and 2019, required contributions to pensions for state employees and teachers combined increased 36%. And that included a deal with unions to defer portions of contributions owed this decade into the 2030s and 2040s.
The state faces a similar problem now with Medicaid.
Since 2021, the capped portion of the budget has grown 30%, sparked by a 40-year high in inflation in the summer of 2022.
But after Lamont agreed two weeks ago to allow a $284 million cap exception in the current fiscal year — chiefly to cover cost overruns in the Department of Social Services’ Medicaid account — spending growth in that program was up 46% since 2021.
Legislators foresaw these potential problems 34 years ago when they created the cap and included an emergency process to overrule the spending growth formula. The governor first must declare a fiscal emergency in writing, and 60% of both the House and Senate must approve.
But from the late 1990s through 2007, Republican Govs. John G. Rowland and M. Jodi Rell teamed up with Democratic-controlled legislatures to legally exceed the cap seven times.
Future governors and legislators would criticize this as fiscally irresponsible. Any exception became politically taboo after Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who succeeded Rell in 2011, inherited a budget deficit topping 18% and approved a tax hike estimated at more than $1.8 billion a year. 
Has CT over-corrected for past fiscal mistakes?
Still, many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats in the legislature say Connecticut has over-corrected for its past mistakes and now is allowing the cap to starve vital services.
Medicaid payments to doctors and others who treat the poor haven’t been adjusted broadly since 2007, leaving many low-income families unable to find treatment.
Nonprofit agencies that serve clients with developmental disabilities miss out on hundreds of millions of dollars annually because state payments haven’t matched inflation for decades. Cities and towns say the same is true of state aid for K-12 schools.
Meanwhile, the spending cap — coupled with other aggressive budget controls enacted by both parties in 2017 — has generated unprecedented annual surpluses averaging $1.8 billion, which equals about 8% of the General Fund.
That’s deceptively large, considering about three-quarters of the budget involves wages, benefits, Medicaid, debt service and other fixed costs.
This year’s projected surplus approaches $2.4 billion, or 10% of the General Fund. Analysts estimate the state will continue to save more than $1 billion annually through at least 2028.
These surpluses, used mainly to shrink Connecticut’s hefty pension debt, have become a source of frustration for many Democratic legislators and other advocates who insist core programs are slipping badly.
“I think members are looking to make a significant investment in our state this year, and we’re tired of hearing the governor say there’s not enough money when we know there is,” said Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, a progressive Democrat from West Hartford.
Co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee, Gilchrest spearheaded a push to invest $250 million across four years in Medicaid rates. Nonetheless, the budget to be adopted this week is expected to order a much smaller investment. Advocates seeking big funds for nonprofit social service agencies also are bracing for little new money.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, called the lack of investments in health care and social services two of his biggest disappointments.
“We do agree with the governor, the state’s in a better position financially” because of the spending cap, he said. “But we probably have gone a little too far.”

Labor groups descended on the Capitol en masse Saturday to protest insufficient spending on core programs and demand immediate reform of spending caps.
“If Gov. Lamont truly wanted transparency, he would declare a fiscal emergency and suspend the roadblocks,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 labor, faith and civic organizations.
Connecticut has pledged in legal covenants with bond holders not to alter any of its budget caps dramatically before July 1, 2028, when many expect a landmark reform debate.
Lamont struggled to keep his own budget proposal under the cap
In the meantime, legislative leaders are trying to bend the limits without breaking them.
They’re not the only ones.
To keep the $55.2 billion two-year budget he proposed in February under the cap, the governor employed several workarounds. 
First, he would underfund contractually required health care benefits for retired state workers by about $114 million per year. Comptroller Sean Scanlon says he hopes to mitigate that gap by negotiating savings with insurance providers, but any remaining deficit would be taken from the retiree health care trust — meaning the cost, plus interest, would be covered by future taxpayers.
Lamont also proposed borrowing rather than paying cash for a $60 million grant program that helps towns cover road paving and winter snow plowing. Borrowing occurs outside of the formal budget and spending cap.
Finally, he would shift $300 million from surplus into an off-budget account to fund future increases in early childhood development programs.
Given these maneuvers and the latest cap workaround involving the teachers’ pension, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Lamont and Democratic legislators clearly are bending the rules.
“It’s a gimmick to pay something off budget in the first year, bring it on budget in the second year, to escalate the spending cap,” he said.

Candelora added he suspects the entire budget “is going to be cobbled together with gimmicks that do [an] end-around the spending cap.”
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, predicted fiscal chaos when Lamont first agreed to legally exceed the spending cap two weeks ago. “Get your pocketbooks, your wallets ready,” he said. “You’re going to give over more of your money [to] the state of Connecticut.”
Lamont spokesman: ‘The spending cap remains sacrosanct.’
Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, heard Lamont’s declaration that the spending cap is “sacrosanct” back on Jan. 15.
The business leader said from the moment the governor proposed his biennial budget on Feb. 5, complete with some cap gimmicks, he feared legislators would embrace them and offer more.
“That’s got us very alarmed, that we’re just ignoring the spending cap when all is said and done and not making hard decisions” to cut spending, DiPentima said.
But Lamont’s political options are limited.
Democrats threatened last week to suspend the 34-year-old requirement that Connecticut adopt a two-year budget — designed to encourage long-range fiscal planning — unless they could find more options to work around the spending cap in 2026-27.
The alternative, Ritter said, was to adopt a plan covering just 12 months through June 2026.
That would be problematic, to say the least, for Lamont, should he seek reelection next year.
Under that scenario, Lamont would have no approved spending plan in place should he fail to strike a budget deal with legislators next spring. And he would be faced with the chaotic prospect of managing underfunded departments by executive order, even as his reelection campaign entered the home stretch.
But despite some of the compromises the governor made this year to secure another two-year budget, spokesman Chris Collibee said “the spending cap remains ‘sacrosanct,’” and while legislators won’t see all the funding they wanted, there are new investments and fiscal stability.
“Our ‘kitchen table’ approach to budgeting over the past six years is the reason why Gov. Lamont was able to provide some flexibility in spending to cover essential services,” he said. “While other states are reducing services and/or increasing taxes, here in Connecticut have not only gotten our fiscal house in order but are doing the opposite.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0531_SR_Session_194-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Bad weather doesn’t keep business hours.
Of the top 10 tornadoes that have wreaked death and destruction in Kansas, most came near or after dark, according to the National Weather Service. The Udall tornado of 1955 struck at 10:15 pm and killed 80, making it the deadliest twister in state history.
That’s why the National Weather Service’s closing of the Goodland forecast office overnight is so alarming. Goodland is among eight locations that had reduced their hours, or were planning to, because of the Trump administration’s cuts to the federal government. Staffing at the NWS has taken a beating under DOGE, according to reporting by the Washington Post. In an open letter, five former NWS directors warned the cuts may “endanger lives.”
The Goodland office serves northwest Kansas and parts of Nebraska and Colorado. About 17 miles from the Colorado border on I-70, severe weather around Goodland ranges from tornado-producing spring storms to winter blizzards that shut down the interstate.
But it’s not just the Goodland County Warning Area, a 21,000-square-mile region with more than 80,000 people, that’s at risk. Understaffing at Goodland and other forecast offices that have curtailed hours, including Wyoming and California, creates an additional burden for meteorologists at fully staffed locations. Somebody has to keep an eye on the weather, because the NWS is the federal agency responsible for issuing advisories, watches, and warnings.
If you live in Tornado Alley, you know how essential those warnings can be. The alley is a broad swatch of the Great Plains, from Texas to South Dakota, where dry cold air from the northwest collides with warm moist air from the south. Kansans are familiar with the feeling along about dusk when conditions are ripe for a twister. The sky turns a peculiar shade of green, a thunderstorm approaches and the air smells like river water.
A public affairs specialist for the NWS at Silver Springs, Maryland, did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. Specifically, the spokesperson was asked if the Goodland office would remain closed overnight, and whether that represented a threat to public safety.
While the NWS did not respond, a spokesman for the union that represents federal weather service workers said there was no immediate crisis. Meteorologists at other regional forecast offices had agreed to keep an eye on the weather while the Goodland office was closed overnight. But, he said, a 20% reduction in forecast office staffing since Trump took his second oath of office poses a long-term threat.
“There is no question that the public safety for the community is at risk,” said Tom Fahy, legislative director of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. “(The workers) have done everything they can to shore up the holes and come up with a work flow schedule that will allow individuals not to be burned out.”
Weather service employees are dedicated, hard-working individuals, he said, who take their mission to protect lives and property seriously.
The Goodland is among the two worst hit of the 122 forecast offices in the nation, Fahy said. Goodland normally has 13 meteorologists, but because of DOGE cuts and a federal hiring freeze imposed in January, is down to just five. It ties with a forecast station in Hanford, California, as the most understaffed.
While we are at the tail end of what is usually thought of as tornado season, May through early June, the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory at Norman, Oklahoma, cautions that twisters are unpredictable. They can come at any time of the year, at any time of the day, and meteorologists still aren’t sure what causes them.
“The truth is that we don’t fully understand,” according to the Severe Storms Laboratory website. “The most destructive tornadoes occur from supercells, which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a mesocyclone. (Supercells can also produce damaging hail, severe non-tornadic winds, frequent lightning, and flash floods.)”
While I’ve seen scores of small twisters form, touch down, and spin themselves away within a few minutes, I’ve never spotted a really large tornado. These storms are measured by the Enhanced Fujita Scale, from 0 to 5, based on estimates of observed damage. A common EF0 has wind gusts up to 85 mph and produces little damage. A rare EF5 has wind speeds of more than 200 mph and produces “incredible” damage. The tornado that struck Udall in 1955 was an EF5. So was the Greensburg twister of 2007 and the Joplin, Missouri, tornado of May 2011, a storm that killed 158 people and demolished a third of the town.
I witnessed the aftermaths of the Greensburg and Joplin tornadoes in my capacity as a journalist, and the devastation of each was nightmare-like. In Greensburg, houses were turned to kindling and schools were reduced to piles of bricks. Trees were snapped off at about 10 or 12 feet, as if somebody had driven a giant lawnmower across town.
At Joplin, there was similar destruction, and the neighborhood where my grandfather’s house had stood was unrecognizable. The area looked like it had been shredded by a buzzsaw and then flattened. The human suffering across town was on a massive scale that night, with bodies in the streets and survivors sitting on curbs wearing trash bags as their only defense against the rain. I’ve never taken a roof over my head for granted since.
The Greensburg tornado was a two-mile wide EF5 that blew up from the southwest. The National Weather Service issued a warning for Greensburg at 9:19 p.m. The storm hit Greensburg dead-center at 9:45, destroying approximately 1,000 homes and businesses, or about nine-tenths of the town. The response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency required 15 federal entities, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Now, cuts to the weather service by DOGE in the name of governmental “efficiency” threaten to cripple the weather alert warning systems that saved untold lives in Greensburg. There was no such warning system in 1955 for Udall, and that’s one of the reasons that casualties were so high. To decrease the number of staff available for weather forecast offices in the name of efficiency is like reducing the number of life preservers on an ocean liner to save space.
But the explanation that DOGE is out to improve government by making it smaller and more effective is a canard. The real reason the NWS and other federal agencies are being kneecapped is to punish federal workers, dismantle the machinery of government, and achieve a long-cherished dream of neoliberalism, an economic philosophy from 1938. Don’t let the name fool you, because there’s nothing liberal or progressive about it.
Never heard of it?
Allow me a few paragraphs to explain.
“Its anonymity is both a symptom and a cause of its power,” write George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison in their 2024 book on neoliberalism. “It has caused or contributed to most of the crises that now confront us: rising inequality; rampant child poverty; epidemic diseases of despair; off-shoring and the erosion of the tax base; the slow degradation of healthcare, education, and other public services; the crumbling of the infrastructure; democratic backsliding; the 2008 financial crash; the rise of modern-day demagogues, such as Viktor Orban, Narendra Modi, Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, and Jair Bolsonaro; our ecological crises and environmental disasters.”
Neoliberalism, according to Monbiot and Hutchison, is an ideology whose central belief is that competition is humanity’s defining feature, but that our greed and selfishness and the free market will lead to social advances. The term “neoliberal” was coined at a conference in Paris in 1938, but it’s been around since at least 1776, when Adam Smith used the metaphor of the “invisible hand” in his “Wealth of Nations.”
Put another way, think of Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone’s 1987 movie “Wall Street.” In the movie, Gekko — played by Michael Douglas — says greed is “good.” Gekko’s soliloquy of nearly 40 years ago sounds disturbingly modern.
“America has become a second-rate power,” Gekko says. “Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. Now in the days of the free market when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the stockholder. … The point is, ladies and gentleman, is that greed, for lack of a better word, is good.”
Greed, according to Gekko, will save that “malfunctioning corporation” called the USA.
What does this have to do with the National Weather Service?
Everything.
The DOGE cuts aren’t meant merely to make the federal government smaller, but also to make certain sectors of it ripe for privatization. The transfer of public sector assets to private companies is a long-held neoliberal tenet. And the privatization of the National Weather Service is an unambiguously stated goal of Project 2025, the right-wing playbook for the second Trump administration.
Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, argued in a March essay that privatizing the weather service would result in the greatest harm to those who are the least able to pay for critical warning information.
“Public services exist to provide parity in access to all people in society without regard to their ability to individually fork out money for such a service,” Declet-Barreto wrote, “so those unable to pay will end up paying twice: once with their tax dollars, and once with their wellbeing or with their lives. Paywalled weather alerts will deprive individuals, households, or towns with lower income of access to life-saving services.”
Fahy, the weather service union legislative director, told me he doubts the weather service will be privatized, because so many commercial firms already get its data for a few dollars a month.
But I’m not so sure, because the “commercialization of weather technologies” is so clearly spelled out in Project 2025. It’s all on page 675, in which the NWS is identified as part of a “colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.”
Know what else is harmful to prosperity? Tornadoes that eat your town.
Here in Kansas, we typically associate weather alerts with tornadoes, flooding, blizzards, and temperature extremes. But every location across the country has its own hazards, from wildfires to volcanic ash to hurricanes.
But weather alerts aren’t the only things under threat by DOGE cuts. Of the 15 federal agencies responding to Greensburg in 2007, many are now targeted for downsizing. This may lead to little warning of severe weather and reduced help after. We’re already seeing the latter, as Trump’s FEMA has denied disaster relief requests from states hit by tornadoes and hurricanes.
Michael Lewis devoted a chapter to the Joplin tornado in his 2018 book, “The Fifth Risk.” The death toll in Joplin was the highest since the government had started issuing tornado warnings, in 1948. But it wasn’t the failure of the National Weather Service that had killed 158 in Joplin, Lewis concluded, because the sirens blared 17 minutes before the storm hit. Instead, it was the inability of citizens to understand their government — and the inability of the government to understand its citizens. Not enough Joplin residents had sought shelter when warned because they had the “false confidence” they would not be hit. Even a congressman misunderstood that weather channels and phone apps come from data provided by the NWS.
For complicated reasons, human beings have a difficult time imagining the things that might actually kill them. Lewis said that’s one of the reasons, after the Joplin tornado, that the weather service began encouraging news outlets to help people imagine what might happen if they didn’t take cover: “Complete destruction of entire neighborhoods … making the area unrecognizable to survivors.”
Comparable warnings are appropriate for the era of Trump and DOGE.
We were told, but we just couldn’t imagine how bad it would be. Surely our weather forecast center, our university, our Medicaid won’t be hit. Now we have some of the damage assessments, and it amounts to an EF5 political disaster.
The crippling of the NWS forecast office at Goodland is a symptom of a hostile takeover of the federal government by a quasi-governmental group, DOGE, that until recently was headed Elon Musk, the president’s biggest donor. DOGE’s actions have made little sense, unless you think cruelty makes sense, or unless you realize they resemble the way in which a corporate raider will strip assets from a company and then sell off the carcass.

No one is trying to collect it.,"“This is the number one form of tax evasion in Connecticut.  Connecticut is losing millions annually and our DMV does not care.”
So says Stonington Tax Assessor Jennifer Lineaweaver, president of the state association for her profession, the Connecticut Association of Assessing Officers.  She’s speaking of Connecticut residents who register their cars in other states to avoid local property taxes.  “Connecticut is also losing money on registrations, emissions, insurance and unpaid parking tickets that cannot be enforced,” she says.


It’s super easy to get Maine plates for your vehicles… without even traveling to the state or having an address there.  You can even register in Montana, a scheme especially popular with expensive motor home owners.
A couple of years ago Vermont admitted there were 3,600 cars registered in that state by Connecticut residents.  In Maine there were 1,400.  In Bridgeport, City Councilman Alfredo Castillo was even caught with five cars registered next door in Shelton, where taxes were lower, trying to save himself $1,300 in property tax.  
“I am absolutely certain that those [out-of-state] numbers are extremely low,” says Assessor Lineaweaver.  So the losses are even worse than you might think.
The problem is there’s almost no enforcement of Connecticut laws.
“Connecticut DMV says that ‘taxation’ is not their issue,” she says.  “A few years ago, we had the law changed so that DMV would have to look up any out-of-state plate that the assessor requests and DMV had the law reversed a year later.  During the one year [the law] was in place, DMV refused to comply with the law and said they would have the law repealed the next year, which they did.”
Not getting much help from the Division of Motor Vehicles, some cities have hired private firms to help. In 2022, Danbury contracted Capital Tax Recovery to scan license plates throughout the city.  Over 8,000 vehicles were under investigation. The firm pocketed 40% of the additional tax revenue collected as their fee, with no upfront cost to the city.  In Waterbury they caught 4,000 cars. In Stamford almost 8,000 cars were caught, bringing that city $1.3 million.
Many towns allow anonymous reporting of scofflaws.  If your neighbor has Montana plates you can also wish them good luck getting a town dump sticker or beach pass requiring proof of local residence.
Connecticut DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera tells me the problem with out-of-state plates is that drivers often claim legal residence in another state, like Florida.  “If they live there six months and a day, they’re considered legal residents [of Florida],” he told me. 
But Connecticut law mandates that vehicles “garaged” in a municipality —meaning regularly parked overnight, even on the street— must be taxed there, regardless of where they may be officially registered.  Spend your winter in the Sunshine State, but more than 90 days each summer in Connecticut, and you have to pay, even with those Florida plates. The penalty is a $1,000 fine.
In Connecticut, the vehicle property tax is a significant source of revenue for municipalities: $1 billion a year.  But why does a car in New Britain pay four times the tax than the same vehicle in Greenwich?  These inequities just encourage tax avoidance which is, apparently, rampant and unchecked.
“We don’t have the staff [to enforce this],” the DMV Commissioner laments. His agency has its own sworn, gun-carrying police force, but Guerrera says they only work on truck inspections…. even though “registration compliance” is, according to law, one of their duties.
How is our legislature handling this problem?  With a “task force” which met seven times in 2023 considering reforms.  But it never reached a consensus and never approved their final report.  In any case, their draft recommendations were given a thumbs-down by Connecticut Department of Revenue Services Commissioner and former mayor of Danbury Mark Boughton. 
So, what’s a car owner to do?  Well, I hear that Montana is a nice place to visit in the summer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/florida-plate.jpg,,,2025-06-01 05:01:18.109461

SPRINGFIELD — Nearly every year, Illinois lawmakers pass a package of measures dealing with the state’s Medicaid program, the joint federal and state health care program that covers low-income individuals.

Known as the Medicaid omnibus bill, it sometimes includes bold components, like a 2021 initiative that made millions of dollars available to local communities to help them plan and design their own health care delivery systems. Other packages have focused on smaller changes like guaranteeing coverage for specific conditions and medications or adjusting reimbursement rates for different categories of health care providers.

And moThe Illinois General Assembly passed a scaled-back Medicaid package on the last day of the session Saturday.st years, the packages receive bipartisan support because they are negotiated, largely behind closed doors, by an unofficial, bipartisan Medicaid Working Group.

This year, however, lawmakers passed one of the narrowest packages in recent memory, due mainly to the Trump administration’s vows to make sweeping cuts in federal funding for the program while state lawmakers faced their own set of budget constraints.

“There were many, many, very worthy program expansions, rate increases that we considered during this process that we were unable to include because of the uncertainty in Washington,” Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, the current chair of the Medicaid Working Group, said on the House floor Saturday.

The Illinois Medicaid program currently costs about $33.7 billion a year, according to the Department of Healthcare and Family Services. Of that, $20.9 billion, or about 62%, comes from the federal government while much of the state’s share comes from taxes levied on hospitals, nursing homes and managed care organizations – money the state uses to draw down federal matching funds.

The program covers nearly 3.5 million people in Illinois, or about a quarter of the state’s population. According to the nonpartisan health policy think tank KFF, the program pays for 40% of all child births in Illinois while covering 69% of all nursing home residents.

This year’s Medicaid omnibus bill, a 231-page amendment inserted into Senate Bill 2437, contains items that could be hugely beneficial to many Medicaid enrollees, but which don’t carry large price tags. In fact, the entire package is estimated to cost just under $1 million.

One of this year’s additions would make it easier for family members of medically fragile children who qualify for in-home nursing care to receive training to become certified family health aides, a designation that would enable them to administer medications, help with feeding and perform many of the same tasks as a certified nursing assistant.

Another provision would require all hospitals with licensed obstetric beds and birthing centers to adopt written policies that permit patients to have an Illinois Medicaid certified doula of their choosing to accompany them and provide support before, during and after labor and delivery.

Although those provisions enjoyed bipartisan support, another provision that extends coverage to certain categories of noncitizens drew Republican opposition Saturday, resulting in a partisan roll  call vote.

The program covers noncitizens who meet the income requirements for Medicaid and have pending applications for asylum in the United States or for special visas as victims of trafficking, torture or other serious crimes. Those individuals can receive coverage for up to 24 months, provided they continue to meet the eligibility requirements.

Moeller said the language was not a new extension of health care benefits to noncitizens, but instead a “technical and administrative fix” to an existing program that had been requested by the Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

But for Republicans, the programs sounded too similar to the more controversial programs, Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors and Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults, that extend health care to a large category of people who are not U.S. citizens, including some who are in the country illegally.

“For us on this side of the aisle, that is the poison pill,” said Rep. Noreen Hammond, R-Macomb, the deputy House minority leader. “So in spite of the fact that we have article after article in here, that is very worthy of a yes vote, I would urge a no vote.”

At Gov. JB Pritzker’s request, the budget bill lawmakers passed Saturday night cancels the program for immigrant adults, which had covered about 31,000 noncitizens age 42-64. But it provides $110 million over the next year, all in state funds, for the immigrant seniors program, which covers about 8,900 noncitizens age 65 and over.

The Medicaid bill passed the House late Saturday night, 76-39. It then passed the Senate shortly after midnight, 36-19.

It next goes to Pritzker’s desk for his consideration.

The state’s largest electric utility says it needs to significantly increase its energy capacity to accommodate a potential wave of data centers.
Georgia Power plans to turn to some renewable energy to generate that electricity, but for the most part, the utility intends to lean on fossil fuel sources like gas-fired power plants to boost capacity.
Those controversial plans, packed into what’s called an integrated resource plan, received a public airing during three days of public hearings. Several clean energy advocacy groups and state regulator staffers urged members of the Georgia Public Service Commission to reject the plan.
Commissioners are set to vote on the proposal in July.
Data centers fuel growth forecasts
Georgia Power projects that over the next several years the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption, and the company is requesting to add about 9,000 megawatts of capacity by 2031. According to the utility’s forecasts, data centers will consume about 80% of the new power generated.
But some have questioned the accuracy of those projections.
PSC staff expert witnesses said this week they are concerned Georgia Power is using incorrect model forecasts. They also say the utility has not provided evidence showing that data centers are likely to materialize at a higher rate than other industries.
Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.
PSC staff questioned the models used by the company that led to forecasting as much as 13,000 megawatts of peak load growth through 2044. The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.
“Our recommendation is to adjust down Georgia Power’s load forecast,” said Robert Trokey, director of the Public Service Commission’s electric unit. “I think it’s important that they continue to file the data that they have been filing in quarterly reports. If we see trends continue over the short term as the projects roll out, then certainly Georgia Power should adjust its forecast methodologies.”
Advocacy groups have argued that overbuilding the infrastructure could shift the cost burden to ratepayers.
Public Service Commissioner Tricia Pridemore pushed back on the criticism, pointing to a recent rule change that requires data centers and other large companies consuming more than 100 megawatts of energy to cover their full electricity costs.
The change included a provision allowing Georgia Power to require companies to put up front-end collateral for energy costs over the lifetime of the contract. State regulators would also review any contract for high-energy users.
Clean energy versus fossil fuels
Georgia Power has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter a pair of coal plants, Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the life of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.
The utility had planned to retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited the projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035 and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.
Energy experts and clean energy advocates expressed concerns about the company’s potential overestimation of electricity demand and the underestimation of gas-fired unit costs, which could lead to higher rates.
They recommended increasing planning flexibility, updating load forecasts, and exploring earlier deployment of renewables and energy storage. Their analysis compared different scenarios, showing that renewables and energy storage are more economical under various future conditions.
Critics of the plan advised the commission to require Georgia Power to present additional research portfolios and improve forecast accuracy. The company was also urged to further increase its investments in renewable energies like solar.

Energy consultant Maria Roumpani, who testified on behalf of the Georgia Conservation Voters, said that renewable energy and storage are much more economically viable than the expansion of gas-fired power plants.
“The analysis should focus on enabling earlier years of deployment for wind and energy storage, especially medium and low duration, as well as higher limits for solar,” she said.
Public, protestors weigh in
Clean energy and consumer advocates held a rally outside the PSC’s downtown offices while the hearing was underway Tuesday, warning of the potential consequences if the commission rubber-stamps Georgia Power’s long-term energy plans.
The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15.
Hundreds of written comments poured into the PSC, many of them dominated by concerns about rising utility bills and health risks tied to fossil fuels.
However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.
The long-term energy generation plan is receiving support from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and local chamber officials such as Timothy Craig, director of business development of Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce.

Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.
“One of the first questions small business owners want to ask is: can I count on the systems that support my business?” Craig said this week. “Energy is at the top of that list. Whether it’s a local bakery or high tech firm, reliable energy is essential. Georgia Power’s plan delivers that reliability.”
Retired educator Bette Holland, founder of North Georgia Conservation Coalition, said it’s important that state regulators accept the science that shows that burning coal, oil and natural gas detrimentally increases the earth’s temperature.
“Solar and wind are much cheaper than fossil fuels to create energy,” Holland said. “The only thing that stops us are the energy companies and regulators who bow to the pressure of the fossil fuel companies. Please begin to think about the survival of the people in Georgia, in this country, on this planet, and about the survival of our natural resources in our wildlife.”

SPRINGFIELD – Giving almost no time for public review, Illinois Democrats pushed through a $55.2 billion budget for next fiscal year late Saturday, bolstering coffers with new taxes on sports bets, nicotine products and businesses.

The $55.2 billion spending plan is supported by $55.3 billion of revenue, including just over $1 billion in new taxes and revenue changes.

The four bills making up the budget and capital spending plan, were part of a flurry of thousands of pages of legislation that went from introduction to passage in the final 48 hours of the legislative session.

The budget marked a roughly 3.9% spending increase from the current year, while Republicans criticized it for containing few cuts. It raises about $500 million more in new revenue than what Gov. JB Pritzker proposed in February to make up for declining base revenues.

The minority party also aired frustration with supermajority Democrats for providing next to no time for public review of the massive spending plan and other major bills.

“We’re rushing this process like we always do. ‘Let’s hide this stuff. Let’s hide it so that the public doesn’t see it until it’s too late,’” Rep. John Cabello, R-Machesney Park, said.

Democrats said it was the best budget they could manage in a difficult year. To address potential uncertainties stemming from federal policy changes, they gave the governor authority over a new $100 million “emergency” fund. And they frequently lobbed criticisms at President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.

“I am very pleased to be able to present a balanced budget crafted to be fiscally and socially responsible, because we see the decisions made in Washington right now are neither,” House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel, D-Evanston said. “Erratic leadership in Washington has affected our economic outlook, our revenue projections, and even threatened federal funding for our most crucial services.”

The GOP also took issue with the tax increases, although the measure did not raise or create new sales, income or service taxes.

Instead, the measures expand state taxes on foreign and out-of-state income for businesses, raise tax rates on tobacco, vapes and sports gambling, and sweep fund balances from several lesser-known and utilized state funds.

The spending measure, Senate Bill 2510, passed the House 75-41 just before 10 p.m. The Senate followed around 11:30 p.m. with a 34-23 vote. The revenue and tax changes, House Bill 2755, and the budget implementation bill, House Bill 1075, both passed with relative ease before the constitution’s midnight deadline and only Democratic votes as well. Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement saying he would sign it.

Another spate of tax increases included in a transit governance overhaul bill surfaced late but sputtered. The failed measure would have added a $1.50 fee on food and package deliveries and taxed electric vehicle charging statewide among other changes. Talks on that bill could resume later this year.

New taxes on vaping, gaming, deliveries 

The revenue bill creates a tax of 25 cents per wager for a sports betting licensee’s first 20,000 wagers accepted, and 50 cents per wager after that.

Consumers will also see new taxes on tobacco products. The tax rate will rise to 45% from 36%. Vape products and nicotine pouches would also now be included under the tax.

The revenue plan amends state law to tax sales from all businesses that transact in the state, rather than only businesses with a physical presence in Illinois. The plan also eliminates a “safe harbor” exemption for businesses that move money outside the state.

Businesses that move profits to other countries would also be subject to the state’s corporate income tax. The federal government currently taxes half of income moved offshore and Illinois would tax the other half under the revenue plan.

Businesses outside Illinois that sell $100,000 or more to people in the state must also collect Illinois sales taxes even if the business doesn’t have a physical location in Illinois. This would apply to businesses like Amazon.

“I will not support this betrayal of hard-working Illinoisians,” Sen. Don DeWitte, R-St. Charles, said. “And if you care about the people who sent you here, if you truly represent them, you’ll vote no too. Enough is enough. It’s time for this body to stand with taxpayers, not stand up against them.”

Another source of new revenue is a delinquent tax payment incentive program designed to help the state recuperate overdue tax payments. It will generate $228 million, Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said.



[caption id=""attachment_69376"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1140""] State Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago[/caption]



The state would also pause the final transfer of motor fuel sales tax revenue to the road fund in order to free up $171 million, according to the governor’s office’s estimate.

A separate bill designed to lower prescription drug prices calls for levying a fee on pharmacy benefit managers based on the number of patients they insure. Money from that fee would go into a fund for the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to award up to $25 million a year in grants to independent pharmacies and pharmacies located in rural counties. The remaining money would go to the state's general revenue fund.

The measure also extends the state’s Hotel Operators’ Occupation Tax to short-term rentals like Airbnb and Vrbo.

Immigrant health cuts

A controversial program that provides health insurance to more than 30,000 noncitizens between ages 42 and 64 will be cut in FY26. The program’s elimination saves the state $330 million, but a $110 million program for seniors will remain in place.

Together, the two programs have cost the state at least $1.6 billion, according to an audit released in February, far exceeding budgeted costs for the program.

""We had to make some tough decisions here. That program grew at greater rates, financially, than we thought it would, and we had to make some hard decisions,” Gabel said.

Federally Qualified Health Centers are set to receive $40 million in the budget. The centers provide health services to low-income and uninsured people. Democrats touted that increase to provide care for immigrants who would have qualified for the health care program.

Illinois still risks losing some Medicaid funding under a proposal in Congress that threatens to slash reimbursements for states that provide health insurance to people illegally in the United States. But Gabel noted it’s possible those reductions won’t take place until 2027.

The budget also increases funding for safety-net hospitals with federal Medicaid funding cuts possible. 
Education spending

The state’s evidence-based funding model for K-12 schools calls for $350 million in additional funding each year, with a portion of that going to a property tax relief fund and the rest directly to schools. The proposed budget fully funds the K-12 education portion at $307 million but does not add $43 million in property tax relief funds, according to Democratic leaders.

Funding for the Illinois Community College Board would also decrease by $24 million, mostly because lawmakers reduced spending on a workforce development grant that Democrat leaders said was not being fully utilized.

Funding for state universities  would only increase by 1%. Pritzker proposed a 3% increase for higher education even as most other areas of his budget would’ve increased by 1%. Senate Democrats’ budget leader Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, said the budget allows for an additional 2% increase in FY26 if the federal government eliminates substantial funding.

Pensions

Despite more than a year of discussions, Illinois lawmakers did not tackle pension reform this spring. Illinois' Tier 2 pension system is likely out of compliance with Social Security’s “safe harbor” law that requires pension benefits to be at least equal to Social Security.

Part of the budget package created a new Tier 2 reserve fund that can be accessed if there are violations of the “safe harbor” law. Lawmakers appropriated $75 million for the fund this year, in line with Pritzker’s proposal.

‘Emergency’ fund, raises, more

Notably not in this year’s budget is an increase to the “rainy day” fund. Pritzker has taken pride in the fund’s increases in recent years, as it’s grown to a balance of $2.3 billion, up from less than $60,000 when Pritzker took office. The FY26 budget would suspend the monthly transfer for one year, freeing up $45 million for general fund use.

The budget package also establishes a new $100 million fund that the governor can tap into “in the event of unanticipated delays in or failures of revenues.” The measure, an apparent nod to the uncertainty of federal funding amid ongoing congressional budget negotiations, will come from money swept from other funds.

“That will allow us to respond to actions by the federal government and challenges that present themselves and costs that have been diverted from the federal government to the state government,” Sims said in a committee hearing.

The attorney general’s office would get $116 million from the general fund. Attorney General Kwame Raoul asked lawmakers to boost funding for his office as he engages in a growing number of lawsuits against the Trump administration. Raoul was hoping to receive $120 million in funding.

Direct service providers are in line for an 80-cent per hour wage increase, but Republicans said calling it a funding increase is “sleight of hand,” because the measure would also reduce work hours for DSPs by the hundreds of thousands. That makes the increase negligible, Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, said in committee.

“It’s not a great budget, but it is a good budget and it is the budget we need for this very difficult moment,” Rep. Lindsey LaPointe, D-Chicago, said.

Lawmakers will see their salaries rise as part of the budget, going to a $98,304 base salary from roughly $92,000. That’s an annualized rate of increase that is set by law.

“You raised our pay, you gave yourselves hundreds of millions of dollars of our taxpayers funds to spend on your pet projects,” Rep. Amy Elik, R-Godfrey, said. “So I simply don’t believe you anymore that you ever intended to be fiscally careful.”

No Bears stadium funding

Lawmakers did not appropriate funding for the Chicago Bears to build a new stadium. But NASCAR would be the recipient of a $5 million grant ahead of the sport’s third downtown Chicago race in July, and the PGA Tour would receive a $1 million grant as part of hosting the 2026 President’s Cup in DuPage County. Those were two economic development measures criticized by Republicans during the Senate committee hearing.

The budget also contains $200 million to prepare unused state properties to be repurposed for development, Sims said. Lawmakers removed another $300 million that Pritzker had sought in spending  aimed at offloading surplus property.

Gabel said the state’s employee management department has negotiated more than $100 million in health care cost savings as well.

Any remaining federal pandemic relief funding would also be sent to recipients that have not received payments in previous years before the funding expires in 2026.

But a larger, child tax credit for middle-class families will have to wait at least another year, according to the compromise reached Saturday between Gov. Ned Lamont and leaders of the legislature’s Democratic majority.
“I’m very pleased to have arrived at this compromise that will deliver tangible relief to some of the Connecticut families that are struggling most mightily,” Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said.
Connecticut has about 195,000 households that receive the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program to help the working poor cover basic needs and increase savings. The state credit is worth 41.5% of the federal EITC’s value, meaning it adds an average of $1,061 to a qualifying household’s Connecticut income tax refund, according to nonpartisan analysts.
Couples with three or more children had to earn less than $66,819 last year to qualify for the EITC, according to the IRS. Other limits for couples were: $62,688 for those with two kids and $56,004 for those with one.
Single parents of three or more children had to earn less than $59,899 to qualify. Other limits for singles were: $55,768 for those with two kids and $49,084 for those with one.
Any EITC-eligible filers with children or other dependents would receive an additional $200 based on Saturday’s compromise. That amount would not vary regardless of the number of dependents claimed. Most EITC-eligible households have children, and while legislators didn’t release precise numbers Saturday, analysts estimate the new benefit would cost the state $26 million per year.
The administration’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, confirmed Saturday evening that “Governor Lamont supports this agreement that continues the progress to make Connecticut a more affordable place to live and work.”
The child tax credit was the last major issue blocking legislators and Lamont from compromising on a new state budget, which the House and Senate both are expected to adopt before the 2025 session closes Wednesday.

Connecticut is the only state with a broad-based income tax but no provision that recognizes the cost of raising children. Many Democrats favored a $600-per-child credit, with a maximum benefit of $1,800 per household, available to low and middle-income families. The relief package was projected to cost more than $300 million per year.
At first glance Connecticut easily could afford this. The state has closed the past seven fiscal years with an average surplus of $1.8 billion. Analysts project a $2.4 billion cushion for the current budget, which closes June 30, and expect the state to save at least $1 billion annually through 2028.
But state officials are wary of forfeiting revenue. Proposed federal Medicaid cuts are expected to cost Connecticut hundreds of millions of grant dollars annually, possibly as soon as next fiscal year.
Given those concerns, legislative leaders scaled back the proposed child tax credit to $150 per dependent, lowering the annual cost to about $83 million.
But there were other complications.
Democrats wanted a “refundable” child tax credit. Even if a household earns so little it has no income tax liability to reduce via the credit, $150 per child still would have been added to its refund.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, generally has opposed using state taxes to redistribute income, saying that should occur at the federal level. He did compromise with Democrats three years ago to make Connecticut’s EITC rate one of the highest among states.
The governor instead favors broadening eligibility and increasing from $300 to $350 an existing income tax break that mitigates the municipal property tax bills for about 870,000 filers — chiefly from the middle class — each year.
“We had a property tax credit [proposal.] They like a child tax credit,” the governor said early Saturday afternoon during a visit to the Capitol. “Maybe we’ll marry them in some way and get a rebate out to people in need.”
Lamont’s proposal, which also will not be included in the next budget, would have cost $85 million per year, roughly the same cost as a $150-per-dependent child tax credit.
But legislators and the governor also used several maneuvers to work around the state’s Constitutional spending cap, including moving hundreds of millions of dollars outside of the formal budget to finance future investments in child care services.
Democratic legislators, who have been pushing for a child tax credit for the past four years, are expected to resume their battle in 2026.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said his caucus members have “intense passion” for the credit.
And Horn said lawmakers are confident the EITC dependent program will bring real benefits to thousands of families and only intensify support going forward for a child tax credit.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)When Utah Democrats gathered at Ogden High School for their organizing convention on Saturday, the school hallways loudly echoed the voices of 600 delegates registering and debating whether an established politician or a newcomer had what it takes to transform red districts into blue after the departure of Diane Lewis, who had been in the role for the last four years.
Ultimately, that was decided by thin margins, when 52% of delegates voted Brian King to be the new Utah Democratic Party chair, a choice that reflected the party’s desire to trust widely known names to support its goal of gaining prominence in bright red Utah. 
“This isn’t just some abstract policy debate. What we’re talking about is happening right now,” King said during his pitch. “It’s parents losing their Medicaid coverage. It’s students being told what they can’t study. It’s immigrants being detained without due process and deported. It’s workers picking up the tab while billionaires cash in.”
King, who was a state representative from 2009 to 2024, when he quit to run for governor, highlighted his experience, saying he has been in the party long enough to know the dedication and planning needed to achieve its goals. He has also raised money and has cultivated important relationships across the state.
Utah Democrats to choose between seasoned legislator and young campaigner as new leader

 
He also committed to getting his hands dirty and filling up his calendar to show real progress.
“I’ve been able to stand on the House floor and say to the Republican supermajority, call them out for what they are, extremists who are out of touch with the values of Utah,” King said. “I took on the governor on the fake stage, and I told the truth. I said, ‘He’s not a leader. He’s a lapdog for the legislature.’”
In a statement after his win, King commended the convention’s turnout, saying it was a demonstration of Utah Democrats’ energy, motivation and readiness to fight for their values.
“This is a new era and this is our moment. As chair, I’m ready to lead the charge to hold out-of-touch Republicans accountable, to connect with voters across the state and political spectrum, and to flip seats from the top of the ballot to the bottom,” King said. “Monopolies, in politics and otherwise, aren’t good for anyone and Utahns deserve better.”
The day started early with caucus meetings, as cars filled up the school’s parking lot and neighboring streets. While it’s not an election year, delegates were fiery as party leaders and candidates mentioned some of the flagship policies the Republican Party has implemented in the state’s Legislature and, most recently, since President Donald Trump took office this year — immigration, Medicaid cuts, book bans and controversial culture war issues.
From the prayer to the candidates’ speeches, Democrats expressed profound concerns on the political status of the country under Trump’s direction, with some describing it as “being at war.”

While about 600 delegates showed up in person for the convention, 1,450 voted with the availability of digital ballots — a record number, the party said in a news release.
Tara Benally, who traveled with her mom from the Utah portion of the Navajo Nation in San Juan County for the convention, said she hoped to get more representation in rural areas out of the leadership change.
“Not many people are aware of what’s happening today or what’s going on within the state, because a lot of information stops somewhere along the way and just doesn’t get disseminated,” she said.
Especially, she added, when tribes are so deeply concerned with the status of public lands, the expansion of extractive industries, and the transportation of uranium through their neighborhoods.
“What is being done to help resolve a lot of the emergency issues that have been brought? What has been done to help monitor the air quality? A lot of these things we hear up in the Wasatch Front, but have not come down to our area,” Benally said. “When is that going to happen?”

A couple of hours before the voting started, the candidates made their pitches to delegates, with King arguing that the choices they made on Saturday would define the state and the party for years to come, as many started to pay attention to real impacts of policy coming out of the White House and the Legislature. 
Ben Peck, a young campaigner and former executive director of the Salt Lake County Democratic Party, highlighted his track record running campaigns that led to the election of Democrats including Natalie Pinkney in a tight race for the Salt Lake County Council, Sheila Srivastava, the first woman elected to serve as Salt Lake County treasurer, and Rosalba Dominguez, a freshman Utah House representative.
“Our democracy is facing an existential crisis. We need a party that acts like that. We don’t have time for part-time leaders anymore. We need a leader of our party whose full-time job is being the leader, building our party,” Peck said. 
Other candidates for the role, Archie Williams III and Jonathan Lopez, also made their case, however, but fell well below King and Peck in the in-person support.
The party also voted to approve a platform highlighting values they hope to lift up, including economic security, equality of opportunity, investing in the common good, and American leadership. Additionally, it overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning efforts to extend presidential tenure beyond two terms, as well as denouncing mass workforce reduction and benefit cuts in the Department of Veterans Affairs.

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA, S.C. — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care, and encouraged people to get involved and vote, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes Rep. Jim Clyburn’s (D-S.C.) annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.
“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the state Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.

“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
While both declined suggestions that they’re running for president, there’s wide speculation otherwise. Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.
Walz will also speak Saturday at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said of Moore and Walz.
In 2019, the fish fry drew more than 20 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows it won’t. He doesn’t care if the state is first, just that it’s early, he said.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event. “I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third. Please, let us be at least four.”
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset. Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.

Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. But they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, had asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker at Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner because of the veto. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tonya Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 people with convictions for cannabis possession, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Game and Parks Commission)LINCOLN — One of Nebraska’s oldest trees has died, and officials are blaming drought conditions.
The “Old Wolf Oak,” a burr oak with a 9.8-foot circumference located along a hiking trail at Ponca State Park, was estimated to be more than 380 years old.
The tree was a popular stop for park visitors, given that it was 223 years old when Nebraska became a state in 1867 and was a silent witness to the Lewis & Clark Expedition of 1804-06.
But Nebraska Game and Parks Commission officials say drought conditions in eastern Nebraska have created large areas of dead or declining mature trees, including the stately oak.
The past two years have seen extreme drought across Nebraska, officials said. While native species like the bur oak are drought-tolerant, prolonged drought causes dieback in the canopy and root systems, weakening tree defenses.
This creates an opening for pests and pathogens, officials said, and makes a tree more vulnerable to infection.
Game and Parks staff had been monitoring and, where possible, treating bur oaks for bur oak blight, which can weaken a tree. Officials also identified a new threat to trees, hypoxylon canker, a fungus that invades the vascular systems of drought-stricken trees and dooms a tree.
The old oak will soon be cut down under a response plan developed after consulting with experts, Game and Parks announced. Infected material must be destroyed on-site, officials said, to avoid stressing the surrounding healthy trees.
A sign at the Wolf Oak, erected in 1964, states that it “began its life in 1644.” But more modern dating techniques later added another half century to its age.
Ironically, it was not a state champion tree in its category. A registry kept by the Nebraska Forest Service lists a burr oak with a circumference of 18.7 feet near Peru as the state champion.

Using flawed studies and scientific journal publications, abortion opponents are building a body of research meant to question the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, a key target for the movement.
The effort comes as federal officials have expressed a willingness to revisit the drug’s approval — and potentially impose new restrictions on a medication used in the vast majority of abortions.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Mainstream medical researchers have criticized the studies, highlighting flaws in their methodology and — in the case of one paper published by the conservative think tank Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) — lack of transparency about the data used to suggest mifepristone is unsafe. The vast body of research shows that the drugs used in medication abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol, are safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy.
“There’s a proliferation of anti-abortion propaganda right now. I think it is a coordinated attack on mifepristone,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco who studies medication abortion.
Released in April, the EPPC paper suggests that mifepristone results in serious adverse events for 1 in 10 patients — substantially higher than the widely accepted figure of .3 percent complication rate most research has attributed to the pill. The paper appears to count what other researchers say are non-threatening events, such as requiring follow-up care to complete the abortion, or visiting an emergency room within 45 days of an abortion — even if the patient did not end up requiring emergency care — as serious adverse effects. That paper also did not go through peer review, a standard process for scientific research in which other scholars review a study’s findings and methodology before it can be published.
Another paper, a commentary piece published this week in the journal BioTech, challenges the commonly cited statistic that mifepristone has a lower complication rate than acetaminophen, or Tylenol, tracing the history of the comparison and arguing that it is mathematically flawed. The paper’s author, Cameron Loutitt, is a biomedical engineer by training and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research arm of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.

“My hope is that this paper sparks action in my peers in the research and medical community to more critically evaluate these unfounded claims regarding abortion drug safety,” Loutitt said in a statement.
Days later, a group of researchers from the institute published another study, this one arguing that emergency rooms are likely to identify medication abortions as miscarriages, which they say increases the risk of needing hospital care.
A miscarriage and a medication abortion are medically indistinguishable, and patients will sometimes visit an emergency room to ensure the drugs worked, or if they suspect possible complications. In places where abortion is illegal, patients may also tell health care providers they experienced a miscarriage to minimize their legal risk. Studies like the Lozier Institute paper suggest complications from medication abortions are being undercounted.
That study was rejected by another journal on April 12 before being published this week, noted Upadhyay, who had served as a peer reviewer in that rejection process. A similar paper written by many of the same researchers behind the Lozier Institute’s was retracted a year ago by the journal that published it, along with two others suggesting mifepristone was unsafe.
“They keep trying to publish the same junk science,” Upadhyay said.
James Studnicki, the Charlotte Lozier Institute’s director of data analytics, who led the second of its new anti-abortion papers and the study retracted last year, did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson for the institute said the organization is challenging last year’s retraction through an arbitration process. This March, Studnicki said in a statement that the retraction placed “politics over publication ethics.”
These studies and papers all fall outside the scientific consensus. More than 100 studies over decades of research have found that mifepristone — and the medication abortion regimen as a whole — has a low complication rate and is very safe to use for abortions. Papers like these aren’t new, and their scientific accuracy has long been questioned. But the bevy of new reports and analyses comes at a moment when abortion opponents may have more influence in shaping public policy.

Mifepristone restrictions are a top priority for the anti-abortion movement. About two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are now done using medication. Even in states with abortion bans, pregnant people have increasingly turned to abortion medication, which they receive from health providers in states with laws protecting abortion.
Nationwide, about 1 in 5 abortions are now performed using telehealth; almost half of those are for people in states with bans or restrictions. Mifepristone is currently approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a Senate committee that he has directed the Food and Drug Administration to review the approval of mifepristone, citing the EPPC paper specifically. Jim O’Neill, who is nominated for a deputy secretary role, has also said he is in favor of a “safety review” of the drug — a move that could result in new restrictions on how it is prescribed.
Meanwhile, physicians and researchers are highlighting the rigor of the FDA approval process.
“FDA approval of mifepristone must reflect the rigorous clinical evidence that has proven unequivocally that it is safe and effective for use in medication,” 13 reproductive medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said in a statement after Kennedy indicated the drug may undergo a new FDA review. “Mifepristone has been used for decades for abortion and miscarriage management by millions of patients, and complications are exceedingly rare, minor, and most often easily treatable.”
The International Institute for Reproductive Loss, an anti-abortion nonprofit, has explicitly prioritized the publication of research that supports restrictions on medication abortion. Presenting at an anti-abortion conference last September, that organization’s science director, Priscilla Coleman, highlighted strategies that she said could help result in the retraction of studies showing mifepristone’s safety, such as finding “agenda-driven, poorly developed and conducted studies published in peer-reviewed journals” and writing to journal editors. Coleman did not respond to a request for comment.
Though no scientific consensus has changed, anti-abortion lawmakers have rallied around the suggestion that complications are common. In a private Zoom meeting reported on by Politico, abortion opponents cited the EPPC paper as a potential tool to justify further restrictions on mifepristone — even while acknowledging that the report is “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything.”
Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the EPPC paper in a letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who had only a day before the report’s publication indicated openness to reviewing mifepristone’s approval if new evidence emerged.
“The time to act is now. It is time to revisit and restore the FDA’s longstanding safety measures governing mifepristone,” Hawley wrote. His office did not reply to a request for further comment.
“They’re producing this terrible ‘science’ because they don’t have any real science that backs them up. And all they’ve gotten from the administration is, ‘Yeah, we’ll study it,’”  said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has advised state legislatures on crafting abortion-protetctive laws.
Through the courts and Trump administration, abortion opponents have pushed to reverse a 2021 FDA decision allowing mifepristone to be distributed via telehealth. In addition to calling for the in-person requirement to be reinstated, abortion opponents are asking for restrictions such as the dispensation of the drug to require three in-person visits, and for mifepristone to only be approved for use only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Many have also argued the drug should be taken off the market entirely.
The Trump administration said on the campaign trail that it would leave abortion policy up to the states. So far, there has been little indication from the federal government that such changes are imminent.
“Pills are kind of just spreading, as we predicted, without almost any restriction and so far the anti-abortion movement hasn’t figured out what to do,” Cohen said.

While Nevada’s elected leaders have expressed a commitment to addressing the climate crisis, a new proposal under consideration raises questions about our state’s priorities. The proposed expansion of Nevada’s film tax credit program, which would direct hundreds of millions of dollars in public subsidies to Hollywood studios, risks sidelining urgent environmental and climate needs. At a time when bold action is needed to protect our communities and natural resources, this approach feels out of step.
It’s abundantly clear that Nevada is in a climate emergency. Wildfires are burning hotter and longer, filling our summers with smokey skies. Land managers warn this summer could bring catastrophic wildfires. The Great Basin is drying, and Lake Mead is sitting at thirty percent full. Communities from Las Vegas to Reno are enduring extreme heat, toxic air, and prolonged drought, and hundreds to thousands of Nevadans are dying each year as a result. We have proposed projects to protect our public lands, prevent extinction, and invest in sustainable transit, but we’re told there’s “no money.”


The proposal would allocate $95 million in annual transferable film tax credits for 15 years beginning in 2028, expanding our already-existing tax giveaways. The proposal will kick into place in 2028, and yet we have no way to know what our fiscal situation will be at that point in time. Just think of the roller coaster ride the 2020’s have been so far, and the looming federal budget that could have sweeping impacts to Nevada’s fiscal viability. Meanwhile, extreme heat is only getting worse, the Colorado River and Lake Mead are only getting drier, and our special places are only becoming more threatened.




Our organization has spent years fighting for clean air protections, better public transportation, rooftop solar access, and the preservation of special landscapes like Red Rock National Conservation Area and Lake Tahoe. We’re constantly met with budgetary constraints, told to be patient, to compromise. And yet the same state that balks at funding protections for pollinators and soil health is ready to roll out a red carpet for corporate film giants.
Supporters of the film credit expansion claim it will bring jobs and economic growth, but as the independent economists at Applied Economics reported, the state would have a negative return on investment. States across the country have learned the hard way that film subsidies rarely pay off. Meanwhile, climate investments create durable jobs, foster resilience, and protect our future. Where are the investments for fighting wildfires, restoring wetlands, or public transportation?
If Nevada has hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, let’s spend it on the people and places that make this state worth living in, and ensure it will be livable in the next several decades, not on fleeting glitz and glamour. Let’s fund the transition to a clean energy economy, build transit-to-trails networks, restore our watersheds, and protect the wild lands that make Nevada extraordinary.
We have shelled out enough for corporations working against our interests. Why do we give tax handouts to the Boring Tunnel instead of funding mass transit? Why do water intensive data centers get huge tax breaks when we can’t get funding for water conservation? Why did we give millions of dollars to build the A’s stadium in the Las Vegas core when we can’t get funding for urban forestry and mitigating urban heat?
This proposed tax credit isn’t just a bad policy. It’s a missed opportunity to lead. Nevada should act in the best interests of those who live here, instead of enacting Hollywood handouts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1421734795-scaled-e1732293900334-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-05-31 15:03:28.216641

A Kodiak man has been sentenced to jail for illegally transporting Alaska crab out of state. (Photo provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service)A Kodiak fisher has been sentenced to spend a year in jail for illegally shipping thousands of pounds of tanner crab, much of it infected with a parasitic disease, out of Alaska to Washington state, federal officials said.
The fisherman, Corey Potter, was also sentenced to two years’ supervised release following his jail term, during which he will be barred from commercial fishing anywhere in the world, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
The investigation was led by NOAA Fisheries’ Office of Law Enforcement. The sentence was imposed on May 13 by U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Burgess in Anchorage.
The case concerns tanner and Golden king crab harvested in 2024 in Southeast Alaska. Potter owned two vessels, one of them captained by his son, Kyle Potter, and the other by employee Justin Welch.
Rather than unload the crab catch in Alaska, as is required by state law, the three men kept the live crab in the vessels and took the catch to Washington state, passing through Canadian waters along the way. The motivation was to fetch higher prices for their catch, according to prosecutors’ documents.
At the time, according to evidence presented in court documents, the men knew that a large proportion of the catch was infested with Bitter Crab Syndrome, a parasitic disease that usually kills the crabs and renders their meat inedible. Bitter Crab Syndrome is not toxic for people, but infected crab meat can be bitter and eating it is likened to chewing on aspirin.
That evidence included text messages from other Alaska fishers who cautioned Potter and his son against bringing infested crab to market, with one expressing concerns that their actions would hurt the reputation and marketability of all Alaska crab.

	Bitter Crab Syndrome affects numerous species, and it is considered a possible contributor to the crash of Bering Sea snow crab and king crab stocks that led to an unprecedented string of harvest closures between 2021 and 2024. The main reason for the stock crashes, scientists believe, was the warmth in the habitat, which led to crab starvation. In the years leading up to the fishery closures, however, there was an increase in Bitter Crab Syndrome. The disease is linked to warming waters and climate change, according to scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Kyle Potter and Welch pleaded guilty last year. In October, Kyle Potter was sentenced to five years’ probation and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine; Welch was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.
Ultimately, the loads of crab they delivered never made it to any market. They were seized by Washington state law enforcement officers and deemed unfit for sale or consumption. Of the Golden king crab, 42% of the catch was dead upon arrival; of the tanner crab, so much was infested that the entire load was disposed of in a landfill, federal officials said.
Potter pleaded guilty in February to two counts of violating the Lacey Act, the federal law that concerns transport of wildlife and fish across state lines. Prosecutors identified him as the leader of the scheme and therefore requested heavier penalties.
Potter, in a presentencing memorandum, asked for probation rather than jail time, arguing that his long career of fishing in Alaska has now ended and that at the age of 64, he is now financially ruined. “As a result of last year’s terrible crabbing season, which included the instant offense conduct, he has been financially destroyed. One of the boats involved in this offense was foreclosed on, and the other is believed to have been seized by the state. He has been reduced to relying upon family for assistance and has no viable means to support himself,” the May 6 defense memo said.
But prosecutors, who argued for 18 months imprisonment, said actions with the diseased crab fit Potter’s yearslong pattern of sloppy maintenance and unsafe behavior.
In their presentencing report, also filed on May 6, prosecutors listed numerous past problems with the vessels Potter owned. They have been cited for chronically leaking oil, broken down at sea – requiring crew members to be rescued – and sunk in different sites, the report said.
“The defendant’s track record as a vessel operator in Alaska is abysmal. He has shown a total disregard for the safety of his crew, the safety of Alaskan waterways, and the health of the marine environment,” the prosecutors’ presentencing report said.
Yet to be determined is the amount of restitution that Potter will be ordered to pay for the trafficked crab. The government is seeking $187,187 in restitution. A hearing on that subject is set for July 15.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1280_EvN4ANCaZ2z3.jpg,,,2025-05-31 14:04:12.317876

That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn’s annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.

“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.
“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
While both declined that they’re running for president, there’s wide speculation otherwise. Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.

Walz will also speak Saturday at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said.
In 2019, the fish fry drew more than 20 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows it won’t. He doesn’t care if the state is first, just that it’s early, he said.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event.
“I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third. Please, let us be at least four,” he said.
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset.
Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.
Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. However, they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker of Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tony Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 cannabis convictions, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5517-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-31 14:04:12.317876

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A strange turn of events followed the arrest of Ramón Morales Reyes, a 54-year-old Mexican-born man, who was living in Milwaukee as he sought a U-visa — a type of visa available to victims of crimes. 
On Friday, advocates from Voces de la Frontera joined immigration attorneys representing Morales Reyes to dispute accusations made by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that Morales Reyes — who does not speak or write in English — drafted a neatly handwritten note in English threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump. Voces de la Frontera and Morales Reyes’ attorneys are calling for DHS to correct the record and clear his name.
The affair began on May 21, when Voces de la Frontera received a hotline call reporting a possible sighting of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Milwaukee. Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, said during the Friday press conference that one of the group’s “trained community verifiers” contacted local residents who confirmed the sighting and also provided video footage of Morales Reyes being detained. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“His vehicle was left on the side of the road, and using the license plate we were able to identify the owner and communicate with his family,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “Shortly after, Ramón’s daughter came to our office to seek help. We assisted her in completing a power of attorney and ensuring that her father received the essential medication that was critical to his health. We immediately contacted attorney Kime Adbuli, who has been representing Ramón in his ongoing U-visa case.”
Neumann-Ortiz explained that a “U-visa” is a form of immigration relief for crime victims who have suffered emotional or physical abuse and who have helped law enforcement or government officials in the investigation and prosecution of a crime. “It provides a temporary legal status, and a pathway to permanent residency,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “In the past, the Morales Reyes family had sought resources from Voces.” 
Days after the arrest, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem provided statements for a press release describing Morales Reyes as an “illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump.” Noem added, “this threat comes not even a year after President Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania and less than two weeks after former FBI Director Comey called for the president’s assassination.” 
Noem was referring to Comey sharing a picture on Instagram of sea shells arranged into the numbers “8647”, which “86” interpreted as slang for “get rid of” and “47” being a reference to Trump, the 47th U.S. president, NPR reported. Comey is now being investigated by the Trump administration. “All politicians and members of the media should take notice of these repeated attempts on President Trump’s life and tone down their rhetoric,” Noem said. “I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of President Trump.”
The DHS press release included an image of the note, neatly handwritten in turquoise-colored pen and in flawless English. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans,” it began. “We have done more for this country than you white people — you have been deporting my family and I think it is time Donald J. Trump get what he has coming to him. I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 to shoot your precious president in is (sic) head — I will see him at one of his big ralleys (sic).” The reference to “30 yard 6” may be an incorrectly written reference to 30-6 (pronounced as “30 odd 6”), which is a high caliber bullet for rifles.

Morales Reyes’ family says that it is impossible that he wrote the note. Described by his attorneys as a soft spoken,  hardworking and committed family man, Morales Reyes works as a dishwasher. He was described as coming from a rural part of Mexico where it’s common for people to have no more than a third-grade education. Morales Reyes had difficulty filling out paperwork, does not speak English and is not proficient in writing in Spanish. Neumann-Ortiz said that his family called Voces organizers, confirming that Morales Reyes had very little formal education, and could not read or write in Spanish. 
Since his arrest, Morales Reyes’ family has received death threats on social media. “They want his name cleared,” said Neumann-Ortiz. On the day he was arrested, CNN reported, Morales Reyes was questioned by detectives from the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), who suspected that someone may have been setting him up to get deported. Police were reportedly investigating jailhouse calls from a person who’d allegedly assaulted Morales Reyes during a September 2023 armed robbery. 
CNN reported that ICE agents were given a handwritten note by Morales Reyes with family-related information, and agents realized that the handwriting did not match. The questions surrounding the letter are reminiscent of those stemming from the arrest and deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was accused by the U.S. government of being a member of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13. President Trump held up pictures which had been altered to appear as though “M S 1 3” was tattooed on Abrego Garcia’s knuckles.  
Getting Morales Reyes deported would prevent him from testifying against the person in custody for allegedly attacking him, his attorneys said at the press conference.

Attorney Kime Abduli said there are due process concerns around Morales Reyes’ arrest, as it could interrupt his testimony as a victim in a criminal proceeding and  also impact his U-visa case. The specific visa process which Morales Reyes is undertaking “is really meant to offer protection to people who may be undocumented who are victims of crime in the United States,” Abduli explained. 
“It’s meant to encourage them to report those crimes, when they are victims of those crimes, to the authorities, and to cooperate in the investigation. Where a person may be undocumented and fearful of reporting these sorts of things, Congress basically established the U-visa to make it ‘safe’ for them to come forward with that information. As long as they’re cooperating with law enforcement, the U-visa is intended to offer some protection for that individual.” Obtaining a U-visa can be a very lengthy process spanning seven to eight years at a minimum, Abduli said. 
Attorney Cane Oulahan, who is representing Morales Reyes in his deportation proceedings, said that ensuring due process is his top priority. Oulahan said that a bond hearing is expected in the coming days, where he expects the government to argue “vigorously” for Morales Reyes to be deported. It’s likely that the accusations from Noem’s DHS will also be raised before the judge. 
Another controversial deportation in Milwaukee
The controversy and questions come as ICE attempts to expel another Milwaukee resident. Yessenia Ruano, a teacher’s aide in Milwaukee Public Schools, was ordered recently by ICE to return to her home country of El Salvador in a matter of days. This is despite Ruano having a pending visa application for trafficking victims, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
On Friday, the same day Voces and attorneys held a press conference about the Morales Reyes case, ICE ordered Ruano to get on a deportation flight on June 3. Ruano will leave behind her 9-year-old twin daughters, who are U.S. citizens. Ruano’s attorneys said that it appears that ICE is abandoning policies of waiting for processing of T and U visas, which protect people from deportation. Ruano has lived in the U.S. for 14 years, has no criminal record, has a valid work visa, and is employed at a bilingual public elementary school. She said she is hoping that a final legal filing could pause her deportation.

Ruano’s case spurred a flurry of condemnation from local Milwaukee officials. “Deporting valued members of our community who are raising and educating our kids, assisting law enforcement in their important work, and giving back to our neighborhoods should alarm us all,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley wrote on X. “These individuals are victims of a broken immigration system. The Trump administration told the country they were only going after ‘the worst of the worst’. But time and time again, we see them targeting the very people who contribute the most — our neighbors, our coworkers, or friends.” 
Crowley said that he is “deeply alarmed that our country continues to turn its back on our most vulnerable.” He went on to say that “by not standing up and protecting our neighbors, we’re not just failing them — we’re failing our entire community. Due process is under attack, and that should concern all of us in Wisconsin and across the country.”
Congresswoman Gwen Moore also released a statement, calling Ruano a “beloved member of her community,” and declaring that “deporting Yessenia will not make our country safer.” Moore said the deportation order “will only separate Yessenia from her children and her community while exposing her to danger she was forced to flee in El Salvador. Instead of making America a beacon of hope for people like Yessenia, this Administration’s focus is only pushing cruelty that demonizes immigrants.”
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said that the Trump administration’s deportation of Ruano is “wrong and harmful.” Clancy said in a statement that Ruano had volunteered at her local Catholic parish, worked in her neighborhood school, and was taking care of her family.

Recent weeks have seen ICE and the Trump Administration focus more on Milwaukee. Since late March, at least four people have been arrested by immigration agents after attending regularly scheduled hearings at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Local officials denounced the courthouse arrests, only for Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan to also be arrested by federal agents for allegedly obstructing authorities by escorting a man sought by ICE from her courtroom into a public hallway.
“Yessenia is an asset to our community whenever she touches it,” said Clancy. “Our community and her daughters deserve to continue to have Yessenia with us here, and Yessenia deserves to continue to build a thriving life with her family in Milwaukee.” Clancy condemned ICE, saying the agency “continues to act arbitrarily and with cruelty. We must all do what we can to protect our neighbors from it.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Vacated construction sites, rapid protest organizing, and confusion — the immigration raid in Tallahassee this week hit close to home for many Panhandle residents.
Some protesters in front of the Florida Capitol Friday evening had politics on their mind, while others told the Phoenix they were there because others, who had been detained or are scared to leave their homes, couldn’t be. 
ICE raids FSU College Town construction site, buses away workers

The protest drew hundreds of people, a day after Immigration and Customs Enforcement and state police raided a construction site in Tallahassee and detained many of the workers.
“There’s a lot of people who can’t be out here right now. A lot of them are scared to leave their house, so I gotta do it for them,” Luis Arreguin said.  
Arreguin moved to Tallahassee 10 years ago from Mayo, Florida, where people had more respect for laborers, he said. 
“Blindsided, corrupt,” Arreguin said of the raid. “They’re not doing it for right reasons but, whatever, it is what it is. All we can do is do this right here, what we’re doing. There’s a god up there, he sees it all, he knows what happened yesterday.”
Wearing a white button-up shirt, Arreguin sat quietly on a bollard in front of the Capitol, holding a sign reading, “IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME HERE,” while others chanted, encouraged honking from drivers-by, and cheered for speakers.
“We’re not bad people,” Arreguin said, referring to “Mexicans, Hispanics, immigrants.” 
“This nation was built on immigrants. So, I don’t know what the hell happened in the last 10-20 years that we forgot,” Arreguin said. “Some of the greatest inventions that’s come out of this country have come from immigrants. It’s just the passing of the torch, man, you just gotta wait it out.”

According to ICE, “100+ illegal aliens” were arrested during the “targeted enforcement operation Thursday.” The agency said people arrested were from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Honduras “to name a few.”
The operation was directed by ICE Homeland Security Investigations Tallahassee and assisted by Florida Highway Patrol, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals Service, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, and Drug Enforcement Administration. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis, who called a special legislative session earlier this year to create laws cracking down on illegal immigration, characterized the raid as a “Major bust in Tallahassee!”
Ivette Martinez, a daughter of immigrants, traveled from Bainbridge, Georgia, to join the protest. 
“It’s inhumane,” said Martinez, whose husband works five minutes away from the construction site. “It could’ve been my husband.”
“My question is, we present a birth certificate, Social Security, a Real ID that we have, and they still be saying it’s fake,” Martinez said, concerned about cases such as one the Phoenix reported on in which a U.S. citizen was detained under the new immigration laws after showing his ID. 
“So what, me as a USA citizen, do I have to prove in order to prove that I am a USA citizen? If they don’t take my word, they don’t take my real ID, Social Security, or birth certificate, what else? Am I just supposed to let them detain me or fight back?”
After entering the construction site near the Florida State University campus, federal and state officials asked workers for identification and separated them into two categories, witnesses told the Phoenix. According to ICE, one worker during Thursday’s raid was charged with four counts of assault on law enforcement officers and another attempted to pull a weapon on officers.
Some were free to go; others were handcuffed and led onto white buses with metal-plated windows to be transported away from the worksite, escorted by the Highway Patrol. Officials, many masked, on the scene declined to provide information about the operation.
Construction workers who’d been allowed to leave told the Phoenix that law enforcement officers had surrounded the site on West Gaines Street in FSU-adjacent College Town before the raid began at about 9 a.m.

Kat Spiegel drove an hour and half from Jennings, Florida, with politics on her mind. 
“I’m here because Trump is dismantling our entire democracy. He’s trampling over the Constitution,” Spiegel told the Phoenix. “ICE is out of control and they’re running around, they’re not identifying themselves, we have no idea who they are, they’re masked, it’s disgusting, he needs to go.”
DeSantis posted to social media Friday that federal officials “are pursuing the subcontractor responsible for hiring the illegal alien workers…”
“These types of enforcement actions aim to eliminate illegal employment, holding employers accountable and protecting employment opportunities for America’s lawful workforce,” said ICE Homeland Security Investigations Tallahassee Assistant Special Agent in Charge Nicholas Ingegno in a news release. 
“HSI Tallahassee, working alongside our state, local, and federal partners, will continue protecting public safety by enforcing the immigration laws of our nation.”

‘Immigrants Make America Great’
Tony Alas, who works in construction, was at the protest with his family, holding a sign covered in stars and hearts that read, “Immigrants Make America Great.”
“They say we come here to steal. We’re not stealing anything. We’re just doing the job that nobody else wants to do,” Alas told the Phoenix.
“They say, ‘Come here, do it the right way.’ The immigration system is broken and they need to fix it,” Alas said. 
“Because sometimes it’s people with no papers and it’s not about money, it’s about your kin. Some of my friends, they had to go back. When you have a wife and kids, you don’t want to go back to your country and wait like, like, what? Three or four years, 10 years to get your papers straight? So you take the risk to stay with no papers.”
Tony Alas’ 19-year-old daughter Wendy, joined him.
“Me and my siblings, this country is all we’ve ever known. This country is where we grew up, we know everything here,” Wendy Alas said.
“It’s so heartbreaking, and I don’t know what I would do in a situation where my family or any of my other families like my aunts, my uncles, were sent back and I wouldn’t be able to see them again,” Wendy Alas said.

As the crowd formed and speakers aired concerns, protesters chanted, “One, two, three, four, immigrants are worth fighting for,” and, “Five, six, seven, eight, no more ICE in our state.”
“Say it once, say it twice, we will not put up with ICE,” they chanted, accompanied by drums and megaphones.
Groups involved in the protest included Tallahassee Immigrant Rights Alliance, Leon County Democratic Environmental Caucus, Young Democratic Socialists of America, Students for a Democratic Society, Voices United Gadsden, Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and Food Not Bombs
Protesters held up signs reading things like, “Abolish ICE,” “Due process for all,” “Let people work,” “No 287(g),” and “Melt ICE.”
“When our communities are under attack, we stand up and fight back. Politicians won’t help us, the people in power don’t want to help us, so we have to show them that we won’t stand for it and the people will rise up,” Joelle Nunez, an organizer with Tallahassee Immigrant Rights Alliance, said through a loudspeaker. 
“If they’re focused on gang members and drug dealers, why are they focusing on arresting people that are simply trying to earn a living for their family?” Nunez told protesters. 
Nunez, an FSU senior in biology, said she would ask politicians to “stop facilitating these immigration raids.”
“Florida, of all the states in the whole United States, has the most 287(g) agreements; we have a Immigration Enforcement Council now and, all in all, we’re not only taking Trump’s immigration policies in hand, but actually like stepping them up on the local level, and I think that’s not right. What we need to be seeing is a sort of, some type of opposition to the immigration policies,” Nunez told the Phoenix.

Justice Eric Rosen, from row left, wrote the dissenting opinion in the case raising questions about Fourth Amendment rights in searches and seizures. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Supreme Court photograph)TOPEKA — Wichita police officers Donald Bailey and Shawn Isham were watching a suspected drug house in 2020 when Gina Wilson parked a vehicle in the driveway, entered the residence, reappeared a few minutes later and drove away.
The officers followed Wilson before pulling her over on Greenfield Street, allegedly for twice failing to properly use a turn signal. Wilson denied committing the traffic infractions, but informed officers she didn’t have a valid driver’s license.
What happened next as Wilson stood on the curb with police officers was closely examined by the Sedgwick County District Court, Kansas Court of Appeals and Kansas Supreme Court. In the end, Wilson lost her bid to exclude evidence of a drug offense and the state’s highest court exposed a disagreement regarding constitutional rights of individuals subjected to searches and seizures by law enforcement.
On Friday, the Supreme Court’s majority opinion from Justice Caleb Stegall affirmed the officers’ compliance with the Fourth Amendment in terms of constitutionally conducting the traffic stop and deploying Oden, a drug-sniffing dog, to examine the exterior of Wilson’s vehicle. Wilson had refused to consent to a search of her vehicle. However, the canine alerted to presence of illicit drugs. A subsequent examination of the car’s interior by Wichita officers led to discovery of a packet of oxycodone pills.
Stegall concluded that because Wilson had no legal ability to drive the car away at conclusion of the traffic-related portion of the stop, officers didn’t overstep their authority by nominally extending the encounter to allow for the dog sniff. Four minutes elapsed between when the officers completed her traffic citation and the time Oden alerted to presence of drugs.
“Even though she was not under arrest, Wilson argues that because she was not free to leave during these four minutes, she was unconstitutionally seized as an extension of the traffic stop,” Stegall said in the opinion. “As such, she concludes that the search of the car was also unconstitutional and therefore the evidence gained from the unconstitutional search must be excluded.”
Stegall’s majority opinion argued Wilson’s suspended license created an unusual circumstance enabling officers to deploy the K-9 around her legally parked car that no one was attempting to move.
“Oden’s alert provided probable cause, which allowed the officers to perform a warrantless search of the car … and the pills were properly admitted into evidence,” Stegall’s opinion said. “Therefore, officers do not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment’s protections by performing a dog sniff of any vehicle that is legally parked in public.”
The dissent by Justice Eric Rosen, which was joined by Chief Justice Marla Luckert and Justice Melissa Standridge, said the drug evidence should have been suppressed because prolonging a traffic stop to complete the drug sniff without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.
Rosen held the Wichita officers seized Wilson and the vehicle, extended the traffic stop, deployed Oden and discovered an envelope containing 30 oxycodone capsules in the car’s console.
Rosen expressed frustration the majority opinion “pronounces some new legal rules for which it provides no supporting authority.” He challenged the majority’s declaration that a vehicle directed to the side of the road during a traffic stop shouldn’t be characterized as seized by law enforcement.
“The majority likens this car to any car that was voluntarily parked in a public place,” Rosen wrote. “From here, the majority announces that officers can perform a dog sniff on any car legally parked in public.”
In 2022, Wilson was convicted of driving while suspended and illegal possession of opiates.
She unsuccessfully argued in district court for suppression of drug evidence while alleging the officers impermissibly extended scope of the traffic stop to create a window for deployment of the K-9 unit.
The Court of Appeals sided with the district court in 2023 after concluding there was “no evidence that the dog sniff meaningfully extended the duration of the original stop.” The divided Supreme Court affirmed Wilson’s constitutional rights weren’t violated.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kansas-Supreme-Court-members.png,,,2025-05-31 09:59:47.240990

Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.










Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
 

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 
  Balanced markets 

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
  Help for teachers 

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”
