Then James Wayman, a chef who was conducting his own soy experiments, got involved.","An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things Credit: ct mirror
In 2018, Bob Florence tapped out a message on Instagram. Would James Wayman, then head chef of Mystic’s Oyster Club, try the soy sauce that Florence had been brewing in barrels in his basement? 
Florence didn’t know that Wayman was already conducting his own nascent experiments with koji on the second floor of Oyster Club. Koji, a mold that transforms soybeans into soy sauce and rice into miso, has been a tool in Asian cooking for millennia, but Wayman was just beginning to explore how it might be deployed in his kitchen, from fermenting charcuterie to baking bread. 
“Koji has been the single biggest game changer in the food I’ve made over the years,” said Wayman, sitting at a picnic table on a sunny October day outside of his cafe, Nana’s, in Mystic. When koji is used to inoculate beans and grains, it releases sugar from starch and amino acids from protein. Those flavors — of sweetness and umami — linger on the palate. Together they play a chord of flavor, Wayman says, rather than a single note. 
“Some of the most amazing foods in the world don’t do that. An incredible peach is so amazingly delicious, but you eat it, you have the flavor sensation, and it’s gone, right? Koji has the ability to draw that out and make it bounce around all of your taste buds.”

Koji was also the critical ingredient transforming soy beans into the soy sauce in Florence’s basement in Mystic — a slow-motion Maillard reaction, the same chemical process that occurs when proteins and sugars are heated and rendered delicious. Think: the sear on a steak, or the caramel notes in the crust of a baguette. 
When Florence took on soy sauce making, he was moving on from a long career that combined manufacturing with chemistry. Early in his career, he lived in Detroit and sold industrial plastics to the automotive industry, back when manufacturers were replacing clunky metal parts with plastic to lighten vehicles and improve mileage. Later, Florence worked in electronics manufacturing. Both industries brought him frequently to Japan and China, where he became a disciple of local cuisine. 
Florence eventually used his training as a chemist to pivot from plastics to renewable energy, working with a startup that turned algae into oil. The science worked, but the business wasn’t profitable. By then, Florence was living in Mystic with his wife, children’s book author Debbi Michiko Florence. After selling off the equipment to the algae fermentation company, Florence started casting about for a new idea. He embarked on what seemed, at first, to be a hobby: brewing soy sauce at home. 
“If you go to a grocery store in Japan, there might be a selection of like 20 different soy sauces, whereas in America you might have one or two or three,” Florence said. Often made by small family companies, local Japanese soy sauces, or shoyu, were “beautiful” to Florence. They were thick, opaque, umami-rich, and they enhanced food more deeply than the mass produced translucent varieties on U.S. shelves.
“My question was, how are they made? And can they be made here? And can I make them?” 

Patiently, Florence waited. His koji-inoculated soy beans and wheat turned into soy sauce. He worked up the courage to ask Wayman to try it. Immediately, Wayman asked to put it on the menu at Oyster Club — written into the ingredient list as “Bob Florence Soy Sauce.”

“I was sort of tapping the brakes on being commercial. I was just looking for feedback,” Florence said. “But the next thing I know, he put it on the menu.” 
Wayman could immediately tell that someone who cared about food was making the soy sauce. 
“It was almost like an extension of him, in a way. His food felt like Bob,” Wayman recalled. The soy sauce and the human being who created it both possessed “a quietness, a softness almost, but an intensity and intellect.”

But even after that milestone, Florence continued to tinker. He sought advice from experts, sending a letter to 15 CEOs of Japanese soy sauce companies.  
“My letter to them was really simple. It was, ‘Hi, I’m Bob. I make soy sauce in America, and I’m coming to Japan. Would you mind spending a few minutes talking to me about soy sauce?’” 
Three CEO’s responded. “They were kind and gentle,” Florence said. They let him know his soy sauce was “OK.” Good enough to keep going. Of those CEO’s, Kyosuke Iida, president of Chiba Shoyu, became his mentor. 
Florence, his wife Debbi, and Wayman invested in scaling up the business together, a brand they would call Moromi, which refers to the mash of ingredients put in a barrel to brew what will eventually be pressed and become soy sauce. They searched for a space to expand production and, just before the COVID pandemic hit, found a former batting cage in North Stonington, complete with AstroTurf, and transformed it into a soy sauce brewery. Today, Florence says that Moromi is one of just a handful of U.S.-made soy sauce brands.
Debbi, a third-generation Japanese American, has also written children’s books that play on the theme of cooking, like a picture-book biography of Michelin-starred Chef Niki Nakayama. 
Over the years, Wayman has brought his perspective as a chef to the venture, convincing Florence to experiment. Many of these renditions highlight a single additional ingredient, like maitake mushrooms, sugar kelp, or rye, to create new flavor profiles. Florence would be happy, he says, just making a single version of Moromi, but the experiments have played a part in attracting chefs from across the country to bring Moromi to the tables of their restaurants, to more than 200 shops, and even to Connecticut for visits to the Moromi brewery in North Stonington where they sign their names to the “chef’s wall of culinary creativity.”
Wayman is no longer affiliated with Oyster Club, but at his Nana’s locations in Westerly, R.I., and Mystic, Moromi and koji can be found all over the menu. There are miso glazed sourdough donuts, made to order. Pizza sauce with koji (“it makes a tomato taste more tomatoey,” Wayman says). Koji porridge sourdough bread. Even daily specials like a poke bowl highlight Moromi, with a splash of sugar kelp shoyu. 
“It’s easy, if you know how to cook already, to integrate into your food,” Wayman said.

Even ice cream shop Mystic Drawbridge has gotten in on the fun, crafting their Sweet ‘n Salty Shoyu scoop with a touch of vanilla — cooking Moromi with sugar results in a deep, salty caramel that is at once simple and decadent. 
These days, Florence runs the day-to-day of the business. He gets up early, has a cup of coffee around 4:30 a.m., goes over orders and makes shipments. Perhaps he presses a batch of soy sauce, or inoculates a batch of soy beans which sit in a sauna-like room, paneled with cedar planks. Florence has just one assistant on staff, and though Moromi is carried in stores across the U.S., the operation is small enough that they can handle the volume. Moromi isn’t carried by big box stores, which Florence says is a conscious choice in a business that’s defined by patience. 
“It’s like anti-fast. Everything is slow. The fermentation. The pressing,” he said. “There’s nothing rushed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MOROMI-SOYSAUCE-1001-DE-202-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-30 05:56:11.582771

Authorities obtained a search warrant for his publication’s Facebook account to search for evidence of criminal trespass after he took photos at the location a month earlier. (Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)The trouble started one wet Friday morning in late October when Jarom Smith walked past a weathered red gate in a brushy area near the southwest corner of the Emporia city limits. Smith, a citizen journalist, wanted a couple of photos of the old police shooting range inside to post for his readers.
“I simply walked around the gate,” Smith recalls. “I didn’t open anything. I didn’t climb anything. I didn’t have to.”
Smith says he didn’t notice a sign saying the area is for law enforcement only.
We’re standing on the dirt lane outside the open gate, two days before Thanksgiving. As we speak, Smith is being investigated for criminal trespass and authorities have obtained a search warrant for the Facebook account of his digital newspaper, the Lyon County Observer. It seeks “all records” from three days in October.
There are no officers inside practicing, no sharp reports cracking the November air, just a few city workers. They appear to be moving dirt or preparing to. There’s a bulldozer idling on the shoulder of the road behind us. We’re a few hundred yards away from the city transfer station, which before the days of recycling and waste management would be called the city dump.
There’s a “Dead End” sign near the red gate to the shooting range, but the warning sign is behind us and to one side of a low-water bridge maybe 25 yards away. I don’t spot it myself until Smith points a finger at it.
Suddenly the bulldozer comes roaring up behind us and passes close as it goes through the gate. A few minutes later, the transfer station supervisor comes up in a white city truck. The supervisor, a guy named Tim in a dark ball cap and a safety-green shirt, is visibly irritated.
He says the area is posted. I say we’re on public property.
“We’ve already run this guy off twice,” the supervisor says, indicating Smith with a tilt of his head.
Then he steps on the gas and briskly enters the off-limits area.
On Oct. 24, Smith posted the images of the range to the Observer’s Facebook account and then forgot about them. He was surprised when he got a phone call from an investigator with the Emporia Police Department a couple of weeks later saying he was investigating a criminal trespass complaint at the joint city-county shooting range.
“He asked me if I had stepped onto it,” Smith recalls. “I told him I took two photographs and left, and that I didn’t notice any ‘No Trespassing’ sign. He said there was.”
On Nov. 16, he was notified by Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, that the company had received a search warrant for the Observer’s account. When Smith said he didn’t know what the warrant could be about, Meta sent him a copy of the warrant. On its “Information for Law Enforcement” page, the company says it may be compelled, upon receipt of a warrant showing probable cause, to disclose “the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, photos, videos, timeline posts, and location information.” While friends and family chats are now end-to-end encrypted, according to Meta, Smith said he doesn’t believe the same protection applies to business chats.
Signed Nov. 14 by a Lyon County judge, the warrant did not identify the crime being investigated, but it said evidence had been given under oath to find probable cause that an offense had been committed. The warrant sought “all records” for the account from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25.
Meta said Smith had 10 days in which to challenge the warrant or it would release the information. Smith didn’t know what to do. He was afraid he might go to jail through an honest mistake, and he worried about the hundreds of readers who had sent him news tips and other confidential information through the Observer’s account. How could he protect his sources if the police had access to all that information?
It might, Smith feared, be the end of the Observer, a digital upstart on a shoestring budget.
Smith, 41, posts nearly every day. He covers government meetings, publishes crime reports and runs interviews with candidates for local elections. He lives in Olpe, about 14 miles south of Emporia. The Observer has 5,000 followers, and Smith gives them the news with a twist. He’s not afraid to voice his opinion, and that has made him a polarizing figure in this struggling college town of 24,000.
“I really want to see Emporia become a bigger town,” he said, “a stronger town and a more free town. And everything I’m doing is towards that goal.”
Smith defines “more free” as being more transparent, and he believes spending millions on a new shooting range and emergency dispatch center are symptoms of government obfuscation. In one post, he accused a county official of lying about the true cost of the project.
“I don’t think I’m going to stop it from being built,” Smith said, “but it’s time that people speak out and not be afraid.”
It’s a troubling thing for democracy when any news outlet receives a search warrant, and alarming when the warrant is a clear abuse of power. In 2023, the Marion County Record made international news when its newsroom, and the home of its publisher, were targets of a police raid looking for evidence of a nonexistent crime. Authorities improperly seized computers, cellphones, and records. The stress of the raid may have contributed to the death of 98-year-old Joan Meyer, co-owner of the newspaper. The Marion raid, the most brazen example of a challenge to press freedom in recent American memory, has resulted in lawsuits being settled with the paper’s management, its reporters and others in the millions of dollars.
Reporters exercising their First Amendment right to gather news are supposed to be protected by an array of state and federal laws.
“The federal Privacy Protection Act of 1980 sharply limits whether law enforcement can use search warrants against journalists,” David Greene, a senior staff attorney and civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. “The search warrant (in the Lyon County Observer) case would seem to be so overly broad that it would violate the PPA.”
Greene’s foundation is a San Francisco nonprofit devoted to protecting digital privacy, defending free speech, and promoting internet civil liberties. He said he didn’t think the Kansas Reporter’s Shield Law applied in this case, because the warrant sought material from Meta and not the journalist. While subpoenas for information are fairly common, Greene said, search warrants are less so.
“What the Privacy Protection Act is really saying is use a subpoena,” he said.
A subpoena allows a challenge before authorities can seize documents and equipment. There are exceptions, of course, such as when national security is at risk or a person’s life is in danger. It also does not give journalists carte blanche to commit crimes, although it is unlikely that mistakenly setting foot on a prohibited property would be worth more than a warning in most jurisdictions.
Greene pointed out that the act actually doesn’t identify “journalists” in its language but instead defines the protected material as that gathered with the intent to disseminate to the public.
“Everyone who has social media or uses online services (to reach the public) is covered,” Greene said. “So that doesn’t require someone to be a professional journalist.”
Smith said he considers himself a journalist, although many in the community don’t. Reporters from some legacy media outlets will move across the room to be away from him when he covers meetings. Some officials have taken issue with the accuracy of his reporting, and Smith acknowledges that he is still learning but tries to correct any mistakes quickly.
Smith is a largely self-taught journalist. He graduated from Emporia State University with a BA in political science in 2018, but makes his living as a contractor painting homes and businesses. He spends 10 to 15 hours a week gathering news, maintaining the Facebook account and updating the Observer’s dedicated platform called ShareThere. He says the Observer doesn’t yet make any money, and that his income from the contracting business subsidizes the digital publishing venture. He doesn’t have a fancy camera, so he relies on his phone for just about everything, and he often excuses himself to take a call. It’s important, he said, that he answers when the phone buzzes.
Hundreds of people have contacted him through the Observer’s Facebook account with confidential news tips and other information. In the past 90 days alone, he said, after checking his phone, he’s had 141 conversations with readers.
“Sometimes it’s just people saying hey, I like what you wrote,” Smith said. “Sometimes it’s somebody saying, ‘I’ve got a story for you.’ In the past couple of days I’ve had people who want to meet with me. I don’t write about every story that people ask me to, but I guess I’ve become known to cover things that others don’t.”
He files Kansas Open Records Act requests, attends lots of meetings, and asks many questions. Name an entity in Lyon County — the city commission, county officials, the local hospital — and they have likely been stung by Smith’s opinion. Local officials often find him irksome, some told me confidentially, but others said they had a growing respect for his plainspoken tenacity. His pieces aren’t as polished as those of veteran reporters, but he is building a dedicated audience through aggressive reporting and sharp point of view.
“Emporia’s economy has taken hit after hit — Tyson gone, Holiday Resort closed, Morgan Advanced Materials shuttered — yet the Regional Development Association continues drifting without leadership, purpose, or result,” he wrote in one recent post.
In another:
“On Tuesday, three new (city) commissioners were elected, backed by the same circle of old-money power brokers that have steered this town for decades.”
And, back in April 2025, this commentary about the county’s purchase of land to build a new law enforcement shooting range and 911 communications center at a cost of $2 million:
“For what purpose was this tract of land bought?” Smith asked. “A shooting range. Not a public one for you and me, but for the sheriff’s department. Never mind the fact that they already have one about 300 yards away from the new site. Never mind the fact that there is an additional one a few miles north of town off of the turnpike.”
The price of the project, according to local reports, has now risen to more than $5 million. At least $1 million — including a $250,000 federal grant — has already been approved for the gun range. I emailed Lyon County Commission Chair Ken Duft for comment on the project and Smith’s criticism. Duft did not respond to the request.
While I seldom agree with Smith because our politics are so different — until recently he called the Observer the Lyon County Conservative — I find him an easy man to talk to, somebody who appears sincere in his beliefs. When he sits for an interview, he is freshly showered and wearing clean clothes but still has paint — a dark, institutional brown — from the day’s contracting job clinging to his hands.
When some readers complained that he called out others for misbehavior but was ignoring his own past, he posted his own mugshot from years ago, when he was booked for a misdemeanor. Smith said the offense was later expunged. In 2020 and 2024, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for county commissioner, coming in third both times.
Like others with connections to legacy media, I was irritated at how Smith began his digital newspaper. It’s not the way I would have done it, I tsk-tsked to myself. But now I realize that is the point of the Observer, because it’s a publication made not for me but for a different audience. It’s an alternative. And anybody who says he’s not gaining needed journalism skills isn’t paying attention.
But the quality of Smith’s reporting is not a factor when it comes to the search warrant. What does matter is the chilling effect on free speech that occurs when investigators seek warrants to access the social media accounts of those who inform the public.
That Smith was the target of a search warrant from officials who should have known better, especially since the Marion raid, is inexcusable. A literal misstep should not be subject to the full force of investigative discovery. What did investigators hope to gain from the Observer’s social media account? Smith had already shared with them the photos he took and admitted to straying into an area where he didn’t have permission. And the county prosecutor, according to Smith, said she hadn’t even seen the search warrant until it was posted on the Observer’s Facebook account.
Since Nov. 25, Smith has been represented by Max Kautsch, a Lawrence attorney specializing in media law who has also contributed columns to Kansas Reflector. Kautsch declined comment. Smith, however, told me a second, narrower search warrant was in the works for the Observer’s account.
I contacted the county prosecutor, Amy Aranda, and asked her about the case. What crime was being investigated? What local code or state statute did investigators suspect of being broken? What did the second search warrant hope to uncover?
“I cannot comment on an ongoing criminal investigation,” Aranda told me in an email, “except to state it is my understanding that a search warrant was withdrawn, no records were produced, and a second search warrant will not be served relating to the matter you’re inquiring about.”
When I described the email to Greene, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyer, he chuckled.
“Well good for them,” he said. “They did the right thing.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-30 09:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,A better holiday via Amtrak,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/30/amtrak-holiday-travel/,Why chose the train instead of driving? Because the investment in its infrastructure is finally paying off with better service.,"How was your travel this holiday weekend?
If you’re one of the 82 million Americans who traveled at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving, perhaps some of you opted for Amtrak instead of driving. Our nation’s passenger railroad estimates a 6% boost in ridership this year, as Amtrak’s growth and popularity continues.


Not that taking the train is cheap: A one-way, last-minute fare from Stamford to Washington, D.C. on Thanksgiving day was as much as $400 on one train! It’s a matter of demand exceeding supply. Still, Amtrak is proud of these fares which, nationwide have seen the railroad increase overall revenues by 10%.
Aside from worsening highway traffic and delays, why chose the train instead of driving? Because the investment in its infrastructure is finally paying off with better service.
Stations are being improved, crucial bridges (like the Walk Bridge in South Norwalk) are being reconstructed, new tunnels are being built, tracks and overhead power lines replaced. You can see the improvements as you travel.
And then there’s the new equipment.
Amtrak’s long expected (and four years delayed) NextGen Acela is turning eyes as it whooshes up and down the corridor. It’s a really sweet train, with only five sets in service so far but with 23 more sets to come by 2027. But these sleek new trains are having problems, especially between New Haven and Providence, one of the ‘curviest’ parts of the Northeast.
Fast trains abhor curves. While the new Acela can go as fast as 160 mph, it can do so only on about 40 super-straight miles of its 450-mile journey from Washington to Boston. In the rest of Connecticut it can go no faster than Metro-North.
In fact, the new Acela is slower than the old Acela, especially from New Haven to Providence. The reason? Tilting, or lack thereof.
To handle all the curves in Connecticut, Acela is designed to automatically tilt into the curves, maintaining speed without having passengers’ beverages sliding off their tray-tables into their laps.
But because the NextGen Acela is still awaiting final certification by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), it’s limited in how much it can tilt into curves. That means that, between Providence and New Haven, the new Acela takes ten minutes longer than the older models, worsening those supposedly-faster trains’ on-time performance.
Because our tracks in Connecticut are older and placed closer to together than in other parts of the corridor, the tight clearances between passing trains could cause a problem… especially if two passing trains should both be tilting in the wrong direction and sideswipe each other.
As the NextGen Acelas prove their reliability and improvements are made to our tracks, it’s expected that the Federal Railroad Administration will lift some restrictions and all the new trains will ultimately operate at maximum efficiency.
With more and faster trains, the increase in available seats may lead to lower fares. But what Amtrak really needs is competition… the topic for another story.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NexGen-Acela-3-AMTRAK.jpg,,,2025-11-30 04:56:39.813851

Sarah Beckstrom, who had graduated from the school just two years prior.
“Sarah was the kind of student teachers hoped for,” said Webster County High School Principal Gabriel Markle, who taught Beckstrom when she was a student. “She carried herself with quiet strength, a contagious smile and a positive energy that lifted people around her.” 
Beckstrom, 20, died on Nov. 27 after a targeted attack in Washington, D.C., where she was serving with the National Guard. 
“Her commitment to service, both in our school and in our nation’s military, spoke volumes about her character,” Markle said.

Webster Springs is a small town, and dozens of people in attendance Saturday evening knew Beckstrom or her family members. 
They described Beckstrom as a peacekeeper, someone who was quick to help and who often stepped up to serve. She had dreams of becoming an FBI agent, prompting her to join the National Guard. She was part of a Military Police company.
“It’s a terrible thing that happened, but I’m glad that she was the person that’s in the spotlight and is representing not only West Virginia, but our county,” said Amy Jones, 25, who knows Beckstrom’s family. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey attended the candlelight vigil, telling the crowd that justice would be served in Beckstrom’s death. 
“She loved her state, she loved her country, and she wanted to serve,” the governor said. “It’s hard to sit here and not be angry at what happened to Sarah.”
The suspected gunman, 29-year-old Afghan refugee Rahmanullah Lakanwal, will face a first-degree murder charge along with other charges after shooting two National Guard members, including Beckstrom.
The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition. Wolfe is also from West Virginia.

The Webster Springs community held three vigils for Beckstrom following her death.
“The loss of Sarah Beckstrom in such a tragic and senseless manner has been devastating for all that knew her and loved her,” said Sen. Robbie Morris, R-Randolph. “The grief is palpable everywhere you go. The vigils have been filled with tears and broken hearts. My prayers continue to go out to her family, friends and fellow Guardsmen.”
On Saturday evening, the crowd prayed and sang the hymn, “Amazing Grace,” before lighting candles. Many in attendance wore blue ribbons to honor Beckstrom; wreaths in the same shade of blue hung around town in the miles winding to the high school. 
The high school’s Junior ROTC members presented the colors. 
“I feel like it was a worthy homage to her, and it’s good knowing that you know we have the resolve to get through this as West Virginians, as a whole state, rather than a single county,” said Junior ROTC member Liam Versmessen, 17, who attended high school with Beckstrom. 
Funeral details for Beckstrom haven’t been released. 
Morrisey said that Wolfe and Beckstrom were friends while serving in the Guard. The pair were patrolling near a Metro station blocks from the White House at the time of the shooting.
“We pray to lift up Andrew, who is continuing to fight,” Morrisey said. 
Morrisey originally sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. in August, at the request of the Trump administration for “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.”
About 150 members of the West Virginia National Guard are still in D.C., and have been deployed there on a voluntary basis since about Nov. 15.
In the wake of the attack on the National Guard members, President Donald Trump announced he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” though he didn’t specify which countries would be included.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska state agencies are partnering with Lexington nonprofits and other groups to help connect Tyson Foods workers and their families with support as 3,200 people lose their jobs with the closure of the town’s longtime beef plant.
On Wednesday and Thursday, a state and local “rapid response layoff services” event is scheduled for Tyson workers at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, according to a statement Saturday from Gov. Jim Pillen’s office.
Representatives of the Nebraska Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Economic Development and Agriculture will offer information about available resources, including unemployment insurance benefits, job search help and economic support programs, the statement said.
Tyson is to convey timing for the event to workers.
“This holiday season will look different for these families, but we know that Nebraskans show up for each other,” Pillen said. “We are seeing that happen in Lexington.”
State hunts way forward after Nebraska got ‘butts kicked’ by Tyson plant closure

Tyson on Nov. 21 announced it is closing the longtime Lexington beef plant, eliminating jobs around Jan. 20. The company also is laying off about 1,700 workers at its plant in Amarillo, Texas.
Tyson’s announcement of the closures did not specifically address why it targeted the Lexington plant over other facilities. A recent earnings report indicated the processing giant stands to lose $600 million in its beef business next fiscal year, on top of the already-incurred $720 million loss over the last two years.
Pillen has said a factor was the age and efficiency of the plant, which originally was constructed around 1973 to manufacture combines and other farm machinery. It was converted and opened as a meatpacking facility in 1990.
State labor officials said workers should file an unemployment claim when their employment ends, not before. Individuals who quit their jobs due to an upcoming layoff are generally not eligible for unemployment benefits, the statement said. The state Department of Labor says it will provide reemployment services to impacted workers. Inquiries can be emailed to ndol.rapidresponse@nebraska.gov.
State Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said Nebraska employers also are coming together for job fairs. Details are to be announced soon.

In addition to state agency efforts, the Lexington Community Foundation is distributing information about local organizations providing and accepting assistance to support workers. People can visit givebiglexington.org for more information.
Pillen has said he did not learn of the Tyson decision until around noon on Nov. 21, the afternoon Tyson released a public statement on the closure. The governor told the Examiner that the “good news” is that Tyson officials are exploring other options for the Lexington plant property, including repurposing it into a specialty, “value-added” agricultural operation.
Tyson did not respond to a reporter seeking comment on that possibility. 
“This is a difficult time for the community and the impacted workers, but they have truly come together to help make DOL’s efforts possible,” Thurber said in the Saturday statement about the outreach session. “An event of this size would not be happening this quickly without community support.”

Here are instructions on how to look up your new Property Tax Bill on the New Castle County website.
New property tax bills are being sent to all New Castle County property owners this week.  If you haven’t received yours – or wish to dig a little deeper and understand the changes that have occurred for your – here are instructions to into your record on the New Castle County website.  This is best accomplished using a desktop, laptop or tablet computer.  It is possible to do on a smart phone, but requires a bit of finesse with the smaller screen.  For the easiest experience, you could print out this article and have it for reference, as you navigate to your information.
First, go to the New Castle County “Parcel Search” screen.  Use this link or use your browser search engine to navigate there (enter “New Castle County Parcel Search”).
https://www3.newcastlede.gov/parcel/search/
Once on the screen, below, it is usually easiest and most successful to enter the absolute minimum information.  I recommend “Street Number”, “Street Name” (use “contains” and the primary word, no direction), and the “City” (Wilmington, Newark, Middletown, etc…).  Select “Search.”
 
Step one. Enter your address.
 
The screen should display your record and, perhaps, others that fit the broad search terms your entered.  Simply click on the line for your property.  That will take you to the detailed screen for your property.  Once there, you will see the property description and your current assessed value.  This value has been updated by the reassessment process and reflects your property value as of July 2024, which is the basis for your taxes.  This screen also shows any building and plumbing permits, historically, District & Zoning information (identifying your various state and county representatives and zoning information).  It also shows the “Deed History” for this property.
Step 2. Confirm that this is your home… click on View Tax and Sewer Bills
 
Select “View Tax and Sewer Bills” to see your current (and a dozen or so prior) tax and sewer bills.  Your current Tax Bill should be dated about 11/17/25.  For comparison, you can view last year’s bill, dated about 7/23/24.  There is also the preliminary bill that was issued in July of 2025, before actions were taken to readjust that tax rates for residential versus commercial property owners.  The 11/17/25 bill should be identical to the bill you will receive in the mail, shortly.
Additional details on your property are visible by selecting “Property Characteristics” on this menu.
Step 3… click on Property Characteristics
Your 2025 Property Tax is due by December 31st.  If you have a mortgage and your taxes are paid through escrow, your lender should handle payment.  If your escrow is insufficient to cover a possible increase, they may notify you of the need to make a supplemental contribution to your escrow account and your future mortgage escrow payments may be adjusted for next year.  Contact your lender with questions or concerns about this.  If you do not have a mortgage or pay your property tax separately, then the payment must reach New Castle County before the end of the year to avoid penalties.
Lastly, be aware that some formal appeals are still in process.  If you did not appeal your 2025 property tax bill, you can still seek changes for 2026.  However, the deadline for 2026 appeals to be filed is March, 14, 2026.  If you are a “Senior” (either owner is over 65 years old), there is currently a “Senior School Tax Credit” of $500, but it must be filed by April 30, 2026, if you have not previously filed for this relief.  There is no income restriction on this particular credit, only age is required to qualify.  You only file once for the Senior School Tax Credit, then it continues automatically.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-29-141411.jpg,,,2025-11-29 14:57:47.885935

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/SD Searchlight)South Dakota’s wetlands aren’t just pretty places on a map; they’re our lifeline, filtering drinking water, keeping rivers clean, and soaking up floods before they reach our basements.
But here’s the deal: The EPA just finalized a rule proposal that slashes federal protections for these vital lands, especially those without a “continuous surface connection” to rivers and streams. This rollback isn’t theoretical. It’s real, and it’s happening right now. If we let these rules fade away, we’re risking more than a patch of grass. We’re putting our water, wildlife and future growth on the line.


Comment period open
On Nov. 20, the proposed rule “Updated Definition of ‘Waters of the United States'” published in the Federal Register, triggering a 45-day comment period will that will close on Jan. 5.
Comment portal >


Think about the last heavy rain that flooded our fields or sent muddy water racing through our streets. Without wetlands acting as nature’s sponge, those floods hit harder. This new EPA rule invites more tile drainage and agricultural expansion, meaning less water gets filtered and more pollution goes straight into our streams and lakes, risking algal blooms and drinking water problems.
But the story isn’t just about water. South Dakota’s wetlands are bustling habitats for waterfowl, deer, and the wild things that make our prairie special. Hunters, anglers and birdwatchers feed local businesses and bring millions into our state. Strip away those habitats, and rural economies take a hit. The EPA’s recent move exposes nearly 2 million acres of South Dakota’s wetlands to new risks, and with no strong state-level protection, we could lose even more.
Some say wetland regulations hold us back, but in the long term, that’s just not true. Wetlands save us money on water treatment, protect property values, and attract outdoor recreation and tourism. Communities with strong wetland protections bounce back faster from disasters and keep dollars flowing long after a storm rolls through.
Letting wetland protections vanish under the new EPA rule is a short-sighted bet South Dakota can’t afford. If we want strong towns, thriving farms, and a future for our kids to hunt, fish and enjoy clean water, we need to defend what’s left of our natural infrastructure. This isn’t about red tape, it’s about resilience. Our wetlands make South Dakota stronger. When they lose, we lose.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-29 17:33:10+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,How a 1940 electoral system reform in Cambridge made its 2025 housing breakthrough possible,Andrew Justus and Alex Armlovich,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/how-a-1940-electoral-system-reform-in-cambridge-made-its-2025-housing-breakthrough-possible/,This is more than just a housing “win.” It’s a triumph for Cambridge’s unique brand of representative democracy—one that balances citywide priorities with fair representation for diverse communities.,"Last winter, Cambridge quietly accomplished what few cities have dared: through an ambitious zoning reform, it legalized four-story buildings across nearly every neighborhood. The reform is projected to increase the city’s capacity for new homes. 
This is more than just a housing “win.” It’s a triumph for Cambridge’s unique brand of representative democracy—one that balances citywide priorities with fair representation for diverse communities. 
Why did Cambridge succeed where other cities have failed? The answer lies not just in zoning, but in how Cambridge elects its city council.  
When cities shift from all at-large councils to district-based council seats, housing construction falls by 21 percent. This is because district- or ward-based council members are strongly motivated to block new development in their neighborhoods. When every member follows that instinct, the city builds less housing. 
Traditional electoral systems with all at-large seats can so thoroughly suppress minority representation that they violate the Voting Rights Act. Cities then face a dilemma: Either prioritize citywide interests like housing, or ensure fair representation for localized minority groups. Faced with this tradeoff, many housing advocates have steered clear of debates over electoral design altogether. 
Cambridge City Councilor Burhan Azeem, first elected in 2021, campaigned – and won –on a citywide pro-housing platform. When we spoke to Azeem, he said, “In a district-based system, there may not be enough renters in any one district to elect a council member.” In our conversation, he added, “But in an at-large system, renters from across the city can vote for candidates that reflect their priorities.” 
This victory was not accidental, but the product of a skilled political entrepreneur and a growing pro-housing movement, empowered by an electoral system that resolves the tradeoff between citywide needs and minority representation. 
In a city with district-based representation, the political costs and benefits of development are fundamentally misaligned. The backlash to a new apartment building can be concentrated in a local council member’s district. The benefits are often spread across the entire city or region. 
This imbalance creates a legislative norm of deference to the local council member on land-use matters. While the phenomenon has different names in different cities, the outcome is the same: homebuilding stops. 
As then-Mayor Ed Koch warned when New York City adopted this model in 1989, it is a recipe for “land use paralysis.” In such systems, only a powerful, independently elected strong mayor can consistently champion citywide interests against the council’s localized concerns.  
But Cambridge has a city council-city manager form of government, which vests some of the executive power of a strong mayor system with the council, making the council’s electoral system crucial for enabling citywide coalitions.  
Since 1940, Cambridge has elected its city council through an at-large ranked-choice system. Candidates win by reaching a vote threshold—just over 10 percent of ballots—ensuring that any political or demographic group with modest support can earn a seat. 
That guarantee of minority representation without resorting to geographic wards is what allows Cambridge to pursue citywide goals like housing. 
The system does not eliminate geography as a basis for representation—it prevents it from being the sole basis. If voters in a neighborhood want to organize as a bloc, they can band together to elect a representative of their choosing. 
Cambridge’s electoral system doesn’t guarantee pro-housing outcomes. As public opinion shifts, it allows a new consensus to gain power proportionally.  
According to Azeem, the system acts as an “accelerator for enacting the voters’ preferences.” In a traditional winner-take-all system, the pro-housing movement would remain shut out of power until it could command a plurality. In Cambridge, it gained a foothold on the council as soon as support crossed the 10 percent threshold. 
Housing advocates on the city council methodically built a coalition to remove barriers to housing. Their first goal was to eliminate parking minimums – an ambitious first choice and proof of concept for the pro-housing coalition. The coalition then moved to reform affordable housing requirements, making it easier to get units built without onerous affordability requirements. Only after crossing these two hurdles did the pro-housing coalition attempt a broader rezoning of the city. 
As Massachusetts communities grapple with state housing mandates and the legacy of local control, Cambridge offers a powerful lesson: good governance design can make reform politically possible. With an electoral system that balances majority rule and minority rights, cities can build coalitions that deliver both representation and results. 
They can – and should – have both.

When the olive green charter bus pulled into the suburban civic center in a conservative area east of Cincinnati just after 9 p.m. on Friday, the women were ready.
They loaded duffels and coolers and bags of snacks into the bus. They carried handmade “Impeach, Convict, Remove” signs, transgender pride flags, and the red hooded cloaks and white bonnets made famous by “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the dystopian feminist novel adapted into a popular Hulu series.
Cincinnati was the first of three stops in a “turn and burn” trip from Ohio to the nation’s capital for a “Remove the Regime” protest — and it didn’t follow the most logical route. Stops in suburbs outside Columbus and Cleveland added hours to the drive. The women didn’t seem to care.
The passengers piled into the dark bus — a dozen or so in Cincinnati, 14 near Columbus, 20 on the outskirts of Cleveland. Some of the women brought along friends, a few came with their spouses and others traveled on their own. There were brief introductions among seatmates as each new group boarded and everyone settled in; a couple of them built blanket tents to block the cold air that seeped in and the lights from cars passing the bus on the highway.
They would need all the rest they could get. This protest trip would involve two overnight bus trips in 36 hours and just 12 hours on the ground.

For people like Judy Routhier, who boarded in Cleveland, the trip to Washington was the latest in a string of public efforts to oppose the Trump administration. This mother of four married to a military veteran said it was her 72nd protest since February. She brought laminated signs that read, “Hump-y Trump-y Must Fall! He’s on the Epstein List” and “This ‘Piggy’ Won’t be Quiet! IMPEACH. CONVICT. REMOVE.”
Deann Ragsdale, who boarded in Cincinnati, was embarking on her first public action despite her opposition to just about every facet of Republican Donald Trump’s presidency from its start. The longtime labor-and-delivery nurse and mother of three teenagers — one of them transgender — keeps a grueling hospital schedule. The protest happened to fall on a weekend off. “Something has to change, and we have to start somewhere,” she said.
Like at many events opposing Trump and his administration, the majority of the bus passengers were women, though a couple who spoke to The 19th noted that men are increasingly joining them in their local protest efforts. The women said they were spurred into action by the administration’s moves to restrict reproductive rights, its attacks on the rights of LGBTQ+ people, its hostility to immigrants and its disregard for the rule of law.
The “Remove the Regime” event was organized by member organizations of the Removal Coalition, a grassroots effort just like the Ohio bus trip. The trip had come together just days earlier, when a woman from Florida raised more than $30,000 through crowdfunding to “find affordable buses and coordinate seats so that no one is left behind just because they can’t pay for a ticket.” Someone else created a “Get to DC” page on Facebook to connect travelers. There were also local events in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fairmont, West Virginia, for those who could not make it to Washington.

When the bus pulled into Union Station, near the Capitol building, just before 9 a.m. on Saturday, Jen Mazzuckelli, who acted as point person for the Cincinnati group, changed into her Handmaid cloak and headed to the Lincoln Memorial. Like many on the bus and at the larger protest, Mazzuckelli is involved with a grassroots political movement known as 50501 — as in 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.
“If somebody says ‘50501,’ you know they’re in the fight, you know they’re in the resistance,”  Mazzuckelli, 52, said. “I feel like we’re in Star Wars.”
Mazzuckelli, a mother of three who extracted herself from an abusive marriage, knows on a personal level how looming Republican cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid health insurance and SNAP nutrition assistance might impact her exurban Ohio community. After her divorce, she said she relied on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which provided cash assistance for necessities until she started receiving child support. She currently receives disability benefits due to a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. She spends more and more of her time protesting the Trump administration and is weighing another run for office after an unsuccessful bid last year for her county’s GOP-dominated board of commissioners. For now, she tries to be a thorn in their side, showing up to meetings.
As Mazzuckelli and other women dressed like Handmaids sat on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial alongside a massive copy of the U.S. Constitution, she thought to herself: “This will probably end up in history books, if we have real history books … It’s a historical moment, and I’m glad I was able to be a part of it instead of watching it on TV.”
“Remove the Regime” was a three-day action that included lobbying, trainings, an event honoring the military and its veterans, then the rally and a march. There were music performances from the Dropkick Murphys, among others, and a sold-out “Comedy Church” fundraiser with a set from North Carolina’s Cliff Cash, who is known for humor skewering Southern conservatism. Cash was one of the first to join the Removal Coalition, founded by Jessica Denson, a former staffer on Trump’s 2016 campaign who brought a class-action lawsuit over its use of nondisclosure agreements. Rep. Al Green, a Texas progressive, spoke at the rally, as did House of Representatives contender Kat Abughazaleh from Illinois.
The protest events came after a particularly tumultuous week for Trump that highlighted his past treatment of and continued hostile rhetoric directed at women. After months of delay tactics on behalf of GOP leaders, Congress voted on Tuesday to compel the Justice Department to release its files on disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump snapped, “Quiet! Quiet, piggy,” at a female Bloomberg News reporter who asked about releasing the Epstein files aboard Air Force One. But then he reversed course, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: “I DON’T CARE! All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT.”
Epstein references abounded on signs at the rally; Routhier, who was also wearing a fuzzy pig hat, was one of hundreds who had worked Trump’s exchange with the reporter into their protest gear. A woman from Northern Virginia carried a “Quiet, Piggy, lil’ fascist piggy” sign. A woman in a Trump mask with pig ears and a snout held a sign that urged “IMPEACH the Piggy!!” as she stood next to her Air Force veteran husband. At least a half dozen protesters were dressed up as Miss Piggy from The Muppet Show.
It wasn’t the largest event opposing Trump, but it was meaningful for those in attendance.
Amber Curry, a 36-year-old from Georgia, said the president’s treatment of women was a big factor in drawing her to Washington for her first-ever protest. Her husband is a disabled veteran and her family of six relies on programs like SNAP — which disproportionately serves women, children and older and disabled Americans — to feed themselves and make ends meet. Their benefits, disrupted during the record-breaking government shutdown that ended earlier this month, still aren’t back to normal. Curry warned that she might cry when talking about her reasons for attending the protest. “It’s so beautiful, people here are listening, because no one around me listens,” she said.
After the speakers and musical performances wrapped, the Miss Piggies and the inflatable eagles, polar bears, frogs, sharks, foxes and at least one Cookie Monster lined up behind the Handmaids and began to march. When Marine Force One flew directly overhead as Trump returned to the White House from an aerial tour with Jack Nicklaus of a planned golf course near Joint Base Andrews, fists and middle fingers rose into the air.
At the end of the day, the women from Ohio made their way back to Union Station, convening in the basement food court to wait for the bus. They rolled up their signs ahead of the journey back to America’s Heartland. There was a buzz of excitement as they shared their experiences.
Erin Nezi, 45, said she was initially drawn to protest the Trump administration because she “felt a camaraderie with all of these women,” referring to the Handmaids, who had by then changed out of their cloaks. Nezi’s first local protest was in February; in recent weeks, she’d begun making trips to the nation’s capital. She is part of a group of women trying to build a Handmaid “army” in rural and exurban southern Ohio.
Nezi is currently unemployed after spending years on an assembly line building steering wheels for Ford vehicles. Her husband is a fully disabled Navy veteran dependent on benefits from Veterans Affairs. She said she is protesting for him — and also for other women like her, for her LGBTQ+ family members, for immigrants in her community and for her 69-year-old mother, who relies on subsidized housing. A constant question that runs through her mind, she said, is, “When is it going to come for me?”
The women boarded just after 9 p.m. The bus made its way out of Washington, crossed Maryland and Pennsylvania, and then stopped in Cleveland, Columbus and finally Cincinnati as the sun rose over the horizon. They thanked the bus driver, also a woman. She thanked them for going to the protest.
Routhier said her 73rd protest is already planned.
Ragsdale is considering making a video to share about how she assembled her sturdy, reusable sign.
Mazzuckelli wants to pursue “deep organizing” in rural, conservative pockets of Ohio, perhaps in conjunction with the Working Families Party.
“My idea is to get a committed group here in Clermont [County] and start pushing eastward,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trumpfeb242025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-29 10:57:22.598691

As of November 2025, the U.S. has already recorded 20,939 cases for the year. That’s slightly lower than the 21,391 cases during the same period in 2024, but these numbers are significantly higher than in 2023, when there were 2,993 cases by this time. Texas has issued a health alert on a surge in cases, and rates are rising in other states, too.
Third unvaccinated Kentucky baby dies of whooping cough

Kentucky is in the midst of its largest spike in whooping cough since 2012. The disease has killed three babies in Kentucky over the last 12 months. None of the infants or their mothers had been vaccinated against it, the Kentucky Department of Public Health confirmed.
Like measles, which is also spreading at unprecedented levels, whooping cough, more formally known as pertussis, can be prevented by a safe and effective vaccine. But with anti-vaccine sentiment increasing and cuts to immunization services, vaccination rates for whooping cough over the past two years have declined in children.
The Conversation asked epidemiologist Annette Regan to explain why pertussis has become so prevalent and how families can protect themselves from the disease.
 What is pertussis and why is it dangerous?

Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Researchers in France first identified the B. pertussis bacterium in 1906. The first recorded epidemic of pertussis is thought to have occurred in Paris in 1578.
Infection can cause an acute respiratory illness characterized by severe and spasmodic coughing spells. The classic symptom of pertussis is a “whoop” sound caused by someone trying to breath during a bad cough. Severe complications of pertussis include slowed or stopped breathing, pneumonia and seizures. The disease is most severe in young babies, although severe cases and deaths can also occur in older children and adults.
Some doctors call pertussis “the 100-day cough” because symptoms can linger for weeks or even months.
The World Health Organization estimates that 24.1 million pertussis cases and 160,700 deaths occur worldwide in children under 5 each year. Pertussis is highly contagious. Upon exposure, 80% of people who have not been previously exposed to the bacterium or vaccinated against the disease will develop an infection.
Fortunately, the disease is largely preventable with a safe and effective vaccine, which was first licensed in the U.S. in 1914.
 How do cases last year and this year compare with past years?

During the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022, pertussis cases were lower than usual. This may have been a result of limited social contact due to social distancing, masking, school closures and lockdown measures, which reduced the spread of disease overall.
In the past two years, however, pertussis cases have surpassed figures from before the pandemic. In 2024, local and state public health agencies reported 35,435 pertussis cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a rate five times higher than the 7,063 cases reported in 2023 and nearly double the 18,617 cases reported in 2019 prior to the pandemic.
Between October 2024 and April 2025, at least four people in the U.S. have died of pertussis: two infants, one school-age child and one adult.
 Why are pertussis cases rising?

Although vaccines have resulted in a dramatic decline in pertussis infections in the U.S., incidence of the disease has been rising since the 1990s, except for a brief dip during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before the start of routine childhood vaccination for pertussis in 1947, its rates hovered between 100,000 and 200,000 cases per year. With vaccines, rates plunged under 50,000 annually by the late 1950s and under 10,000 per year in the late 1960s. They reached a low of 1,010 cases in 1976.
Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, however, the U.S. and several other countries have been seeing a steady resurgence of pertussis cases, which have exceeded 10,000 cases in the U.S. every year from 2003 to 2019. They dropped again during the pandemic until last year’s resurgence.
There is no single explanation for why cases have been rising recently, but several factors probably contribute. First, pertussis naturally occurs in cyclic epidemics, peaking every two to five years. It is possible that the U.S. is headed into one of these peaks after a period of low activity between 2020 and 2022. However, some scientists have noted that the increase in cases is larger than what would be expected during a usual peak.

Some scientists have noted that this apparent resurgence correlates with a change in the type of vaccine used in children. Until the 1990s, the pertussis vaccine contained whole, killed B. pertussis bacteria cells. Whole-cell vaccine can stimulate a long-lasting immune response, but it is also more likely to cause fever and other vaccine reactions in children.
In the 1990s, national vaccine programs began to transition to a vaccine that contains purified components of the bacterial cell but not the whole cell. Some scientists now believe that although this partial-cell vaccine is less likely to cause high fevers in children, it provides protection for a shorter time. Immunity after whole-cell vaccination is thought to last 10-12 years compared with three to five years after the partial-cell vaccine. This means people may become susceptible to infection more quickly after vaccination.
Vaccination rates are also not as high as they should be and have started falling in children since 2020. In the U.S., the percent of kindergartners who are up to date with recommended pertussis vaccines has declined from 95% during the 2019-20 school year to 92% in the 2023-24 school year. Even fewer adolescents receive a booster dose.
 How can people protect themselves and their families

Routine vaccination for children starting in infancy followed by booster doses in adolescents and adults can help keep immunity high.
Public health experts recommend that children receive five doses of the pertussis vaccine. According to the recommendations, they should receive the first three doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, then two additional doses at 15 months and 4 years of age, with the aim of providing protection through early adolescence.
Infants younger than 6 weeks are not old enough to get a pertussis vaccine but are at the greatest risk of severe illness from pertussis. Vaccination during pregnancy can offer protection from birth due to antibodies that pass from the mother to the developing fetus. Many countries, including the U.S., now recommend that women receive one dose of pertussis vaccine between the 27th and 36th week of every pregnancy to protect their babies.
To maintain protection against pertussis after childhood, a booster dose of pertussis vaccine is recommended for adolescents at 11 to 12 years of age. The CDC recommends that all adults receive at least one booster dose.

Because immunity declines over time, people who are in contact with infants and other high-risk groups, such as caregivers, parents and grandparents, may benefit from additional booster doses. When feasible, the CDC also recommends a booster dose for adults 65 years and older.
Vaccine safety studies over the past 80 years have proven the pertussis vaccine to be safe. Around 20% to 40% of vaccinated infants experience local reactions, such as pain, redness and swelling at the vaccination site, and 3% to 5% of vaccinated infants experience a low-grade fever. More severe reactions are much less common and occur in fewer than 1% of vaccinated infants.
The vaccine is also highly effective: For the first year after receiving all five doses of the pertussis vaccine, 98% of children are protected from pertussis. Five years after the fifth dose, 65% of vaccinated children remain protected.
Booster vaccination during adolescence protects 74% of teens against pertussis, and booster vaccination during pregnancy protects 91% to 94% of immunized babies against hospitalization due to pertussis.
Families can talk to their regular health care providers about whether a pertussis vaccine is needed for their child, themselves or other family members.

And a former Nebraskan is behind it.
Rising from a dusty, prairie ridge along Interstate 90 near this Badlands-area town is a collection of firetrucks dubbed “Firehenge.”
Its creator, an Omaha Burke High School grad who runs a Rapid City brewery, said the ring of 10-ton firetrucks vertically arranged in a circle is more about promoting his Firehouse Brewery Company than trying to lure away visitors from Alliance, Nebraska’s popular Carhenge, about 200 miles to the south.

The new South Dakota version of the roadside attraction, which sits just off I-90, also includes a collection of buried fire hydrants called “Doghenge.” By next summer, the new henges will include a gift shop where visitors can purchase brewery souvenirs and canned beer and wine from the Firehouse Brewing Co., South Dakota’s first and oldest brewery.
“We are just having a ton of fun out here. Just come out and see it,” said Bob Fuchs, the co-owner of the brewery who graduated from Burke in 1981. And, he adds, bring your dog.
A city official in Alliance, which took over ownership of Carhenge in 2013, said she doesn’t expect local residents to mount a monumental fuss over a competing “henge” in the general vicinity.
“I think all of these things are fun,” said Shana Brown, the director of cultural and leisure services for Alliance.
As it turns out, both Carhenge and Firehenge have plenty of competition in tourism’s Carhenge-replica category.
There’s a “Foamhenge” (made out of foam) in Virginia, a “Truckhenge” near Topeka, Kansas (made out of farm trucks), a “Phonehenge” (made out old telephone booths) in South Carolina, and a “Strawhenge” (made out of bales) in Bavaria, Germany.
Years ago, a “Twinkiehenge” was built during a Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. There was once a “Snowhenge” in Michigan and a “Fridgehenge” (made out of old refrigerators) once graced the plains near Santa Fe before complaints caused its demise.

A couple decades ago, a reporter was summoned to Chadron, where a suspected “Hayhenge” had been built northeast of town. Round hay bales had been arranged in a circle at a local ranch.
In the kinda-old-henge category, there’s a full-size concrete replica of Stonehenge in Maryhill, Washington, that was built in 1918 to honor people lost in World War I.
And near Carbury, North Dakota, there’s a circle of granite walls that serves as a 21st Century solar calendar, which is the suspected purpose of Stonehenge, a prehistoric circle of stones aligned for ceremonial purposes to indicate the summer and winter solstices, and the spring and fall equinoxes.
Carhenge was built in 1987 by Jim Reinders and his relatives as a memorial to Reinders’ father, who had lived on the farm north of Alliance where the collection of 39 American cars – arranged to align with the solar calendar – now sits.
The off-beat attraction draws about 100,000 visitors a year, according to Brown, and features a staffed gift shop from May through September. An estimated 4,000 people gathered there for the solar eclipse in 2017.

Carhenge has appeared in films, commercials, television shows and in song. Last summer, it hosted a group of muralists, who painted murals on the grey-painted cars, providing a new look for the motorcar monument.
Fuchs, the Firehenge creator, said he’s not haunted by henges but had visited Carhenge shortly after it was first created.
The inspiration for his firetruck circle came during a recent marketing meeting for his brewery, which was established inside a former Rapid City firehouse built in 1915.
Fuchs has long parked old firetrucks, purchased from all corners of the Midwest, next to his brewery billboards to draw more attention to his business. He says that he often hears that visitors to Rapid City’s downtown area ask “where’s the Firehouse?”
“It’s guerilla marketing,” Fuchs said during a recent visit to Firehenge. “It’s very effective.”

At the marketing meeting, one of Fuchs’ aides was playing with a toy firetruck. Once she set it on end, vertically, an idea was born.
He said he has no plans to hoist a firetruck so it sits horizontally across two vertical trucks — like the stones at Stonehenge and cars at Carhenge. Too many liability concerns, Fuchs said. More firetrucks may be planted this spring, though, he said. And a YouTube video, featuring a visit by aliens to Firehenge, is in the works, Fuchs adds.
Over the din of a front-end loader smoothing out a gravel parking lot, he said it’s been a lot of fun.
“I get to explore my artistic side by planting fire trucks in the prairie,” Fuchs said.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)Liz Dunnebacke isn’t dying, but for a recent end-of-life care workshop in New Orleans, she pretended to be.
Dunnebacke lay still atop a folding table that was dressed as a bed, complaining that her legs hurt. Registered nurse Ana Kanellos, rolling up two small white towels, demonstrated how to elevate her ankles to ease the pain.
“ Mom’s legs are always swollen? Raise ’em up,” Kanellos said.
About 20 New Orleans residents listened intently, eager to learn more about how to care for loved ones at home when they’re nearing the end of their lives. Attendee Alix Vargas said she used to be terrified of dying. But about three years ago, a close cousin’s death led her to attend group writing workshops, helping her embrace her grief and conquer her fear.
“ I’m feeling very called towards this work,” she said. “It’s definitely knowledge that I wanted to obtain and expand my mind in that way. And this is also something that we’re all going to encounter in our lives.”

The workshop made her think about a neighbor whose mother has dementia.
“ I was immediately thinking, ‘OK, there’s someone in my immediate orbit that is experiencing this,’” Vargas recalled. ‘“Here’s a practical way to put the mutual aid in use.’”
Demand for home health care, including at-home hospice care, has skyrocketed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the number of family caregivers. An estimated 63 million people in the U.S. — nearly a quarter of all American adults — provided care over the previous year to another person with a medical condition or disability, usually another adult, according to a 2024 survey by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving. In the past 10 years, about 20 million more people have served as caregivers.
With nearly 1 in 5 Americans expected to be 65 or older by 2030, health care experts predict the demand for at-home caregivers will continue to rise. Online resources for end-of-life care are widely available, but hands-on training to prepare people to become caregivers is not, and it can be expensive. Yet untrained family members-turned-caregivers are taking on nursing and medical tasks.
Donald Trump promised more support for caregivers during his 2024 campaign, including a pledge to create new tax credits for those caring for family members. He endorsed a bill reintroduced in Congress this year that would allow family caregivers to receive tax credits of up to $5,000, but the legislation hasn’t moved forward.

Meanwhile, the Medicaid cuts expected from Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Trump signed in July, could prompt states looking to offset their added expenses to reconsider participating in optional state Medicaid programs, such as the one that helps pay for at-home hospice care. That would threaten to make dying at home even more unaffordable for low-income families, said advocates and researchers.
Advocates like Osha Towers are trying to help caregivers navigate the uncertainty. Towers leads LGBTQ+ engagement at Compassion & Choices, a national organization that focuses on improving end-of-life care, preparation, and education.
“It is certainly very scary, but what we know we can do right now is be able to just show up for all individuals to make sure that they know what they need to be prepared for,” Towers said.
In New Orleans, a nonprofit called Wake, which focuses on supporting family caregivers providing end-of-life and death care, is one of the organizations trying to help fill the knowledge gap. Wake put on the free, three-day September workshop where Dunnebacke, the group’s founder, pretended to be a dying patient. Such workshops are aimed at preparing attendees for what to expect when loved ones are dying and how to care for them, even without costly professional help. Full-time at-home care is rare.
“You don’t have to have any special training to do this work,” Dunnebacke said. “You just need some skills and some supports to make that happen.”
 
In some ways, the evolution of end-of-life care in the U.S. over the past century has come full circle. It was only starting in the 1960s that people shifted from dying at home to dying in hospitals, nursing homes, and hospice facilities.
Such institutions can provide immediate advanced medical support and palliative care for patients, but they often lack the human connection that home care provides, said Laurie Dietrich, Wake’s programs manager.
Now, more people want to die in their homes, among family, but with the support and technology that comes with modern medical facilities.

In the past decade, death doulas — who support the nonmedical and emotional needs of the dying and their loved ones — have grown in popularity to help guide people through the dying process, helping to fill that gap. Douglas Simpson, executive director of the International End of Life Doula Association, said his organization recognizes the lack of resources for death care, so it is training doulas to be community educators. He hopes doulas can be especially useful in rural communities and lead conversations about dying.
“Making people more open, more comfortable about talking about death and considering their mortality,” Simpson said.
Death doula training varies depending on the organizer, but Simpson’s group focuses on teaching attendees about the dying process, how to maintain the autonomy of the dying person, and how to be aware of how they show up to a job and take care of themselves while caring for others.
Some people who attended Wake’s workshop had also attended some form of death doula training in the past. After Nicole Washington’s mother was killed in 2023, she considered becoming a death doula. But she thought the doula training, which can cost $800 to $3,000, was clinical and impersonal, as opposed to Wake’s community-based approach.
“I feel very energized, very uplifted,” Washington said. “It’s also really nice to be in a space with people who are familiar with death and grief.”
Ochsner Health’s Susan Nelson, who has worked as a geriatrician for 25 years, said there is a need for more specialized programs to train and prepare caregivers, like Wake’s.
“Learning caregiving skills is probably, unfortunately, more trial by fire,” Nelson said.
Compassion & Choices is another organization trying to educate caregivers. Towers said the group’s training ranges from advanced planning to acting as a health care proxy to caring for the dying.
“We’ve gone to a place in our country where we’re so removed from end-of-life care in a way that we didn’t used to be,” Towers said.
She said the movement to care for people at home and give them community support has roots in the AIDS epidemic, when some doctors refused to care for AIDS patients. Friends, especially in the lesbian community, started coordinating food delivery, visits, bedside vigils, and even touch circles, where patients could receive comforting forms of touch such as hand-holding to ease pain and feelings of isolation.
“I like to look at it as a blueprint for what we can get back to doing now, which is again just prioritizing community care,” Towers said.

(Photo by Blake Fagan/AFP via Getty Images)The U.S. government has caused massive food waste during President Donald Trump’s second term. Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and temporary and permanent cuts to food assistance programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.
The U.S. government estimates that more than 47 million people in America don’t have enough food to eat — even with federal and state governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on programs to help them.
Yet, huge amounts of food — on average in the U.S., as much as 40% of it — rots before being eaten. That amount is equivalent to 120 billion meals a year: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year.
This colossal waste has enormous economic costs and renders useless all the water and resources used to grow the food. In addition, as it rots, the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane — a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.
As a scholar of wasted food, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025. Despite this administration’s claim of streamlining the government to make its operations more efficient, a range of recent federal policies have, in fact, exacerbated food wastage.
 
Immigration policy
Supplying fresh foods, such as fruits, vegetables and dairy, requires skilled workers on tight timelines to ensure ripeness, freshness and high quality.
The Trump administration’s widespread efforts to arrest and deport immigrants have sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies into hundreds of agricultural fields, meat processing plants and food production and distribution sites. Supported by billions of taxpayer dollars, they have arrested thousands of food workers and farmworkers — with lethal consequences at times.
Dozens of raids have not only violated immigrants’ human rights and torn families apart: They have jeopardized the national food supply. Farmworkers already work physically hard jobs for low wages. In legitimate fear for their lives and liberty, reports indicate that in some places 70% of people harvesting, processing and distributing food stopped showing up to work by mid-2025.
News reports have identified many instances where crops have been left to rot in abandoned fields. Even the U.S. Department of Labor declared in October 2025 that aggressive farm raids drive farmworkers into hiding, leave substantial amounts of food unharvested and thus pose a “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”
 
Foreign aid cuts
When the Trump administration all but shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development in early 2025, the agency had 500 tons of ready-to-eat, high-energy biscuits worth US$800,000, stored to distribute to starving people around the world who had been displaced by violence or natural disasters. With no staff to distribute the biscuits, they expired while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai.
Incinerating the out-of-date biscuits reportedly cost an additional $125,000.
An additional 70,000 tons of USAID food aid may also have been destroyed.
 
Tariffs
In the late 20th century, as globalized trade patterns grew, U.S. farmers struggled with agricultural prices below their production costs. Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration did not protect small farms.
And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, severed U.S. soybean trade with China for months. Meanwhile, there’s nowhere to store the mountains of soybeans. An October 2025 agreement may resume some activity, but at lower price levels and a slower pace than before, as China looks to Brazil and Argentina to meet its vast demand.
Though the soybeans were intended to feed the Chinese pig industry, not humans, the specter of waste looms both in terms of the potential spoilage of soybeans and the actual human food that could have been grown in their place.
 
Other efforts lead to more waste
Since taking office, the second Trump administration has taken many steps aimed at efficiency that actually boosted food waste. Mass firings of food safety personnel risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, tainted imports, and agricultural pathogens — which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah.
In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that helped schools and food banks buy food from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were unable to count on a key revenue source to keep their farms afloat.
Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters — including restoring power to food-storage refrigeration.
The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, derailing communities’ ability to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who benefit substantially from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients — to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying SNAP customers must pay the same prices as other customers.
Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies — though they claim to be seeking efficiency — have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need. This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food — as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.

The approval means Malone will not be required to publish his personal finances and that the financial condition of three GCI-related subsidiaries will also remain secret. The finances of GCI Liberty, the parent company, are already public due to required filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In October, Malone, 84, told the Wall Street Journal that he would be stepping away from day-to-day operations of his various companies but would retain his controlling interests. Bloomberg has estimated his net worth to be approximately $10.6 billion.
The approval was published just before 4 p.m. on Black Friday. The five governor-appointed commissioners said they were granting the requests because they were in line with the commission’s prior practices, because they don’t have the power to regulate much of GCI Liberty’s business, and because “the public interest in disclosure of the financial information of (the three subsidiaries) is outweighed by the potential competitive financial disadvantages demonstrated in the petition.”
The chair of GCI’s parent company, GCI Liberty, Malone holds shares controlling 53.5% of GCI Liberty’s voting power. But Malone’s personal power has been restricted until recently to 49.32% of the company’s voting power, regulatory filings state.
Now, Malone is seeking to increase his voting power above 50%. 
The commission’s Friday order does not decide that request; it addressed the combined requests for financial secrecy on behalf of Malone and the three GCI Liberty subsidiaries.
Alaskans submitted a combined 67 comments across three dockets related to Malone’s proposal. Almost all were opposed to the request for secrecy. 
In a response to those comments, Malone’s attorneys said “no legitimate public interest will be served by requiring (Malone) to file his personal financial information.”
The response also said that “the acquisition … will be seamless and transparent to customers because the GCI companies will continue to provide the same services to Alaska customers under their same experienced management. There will be no operational or management changes to the GCI companies as a result of the acquisition.”
GCI’s attorneys had argued that the financial statements of the three subsidiaries should stay confidential because GCI’s competitors were not required to reveal their finances, and it would be unfair for them to open their books.
“We find that disclosure … might create a competitive or financial disadvantage,” the regulators concluded.
In addition, unlike the way that water and power utilities’ rates are regulated by the RCA, GCI’s prices are not regulated by state law. 
For that reason, plus the fact that GCI Liberty’s combined financial statements are publicly available, regulators concluded, “public interest in disclosure … is outweighed by the potential competitive financial disadvantages demonstrated in the petition.”
On the request for secrecy covering Malone himself, Malone’s attorneys argued that he isn’t legally obligated to provide financial support to GCI Liberty, and thus, “requiring the submission of his personal financial information would not advance a public interest objective.”
They also argued that in 2018, when wealthy telecom entrepreneur Jane Eudy obtained full control of several Interior Alaska telecom companies by taking 100% control of American Broadband, a national firm, the RCA did not require her to publicize her finances.
Members of the public argued that disclosure is in the best interests of Alaskans. 
Megan Johnson, one of dozens of people who offered public comments, said, “Telecommunications in Alaska are not just about convenience, they are lifelines for education, healthcare, emergency services, and economic development, especially in rural and Indigenous communities. Decisions made by owners unfamiliar with our terrain, seasonal challenges, and cultural values risk undermining the progress we’ve made in closing the digital divide.”
Kirsa Hughes-Skandijs of Juneau wrote, “I am gravely concerned about the idea of concealing financial information, particularly when it comes to consolidating control of a public good like an ISP, broadcast and telecommunications company.”
Commissioners ultimately sided with Malone.
“We find the circumstances presented in these dockets similar to those we considered (in 2018),” they wrote.
“We find that under the circumstances … no legitimate public interest will be served by requiring Dr. Malone to provide a statement of financial condition.”
Commissioners are scheduled to make a final determination on Malone’s takeover by April 1.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/keyboard.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 22:56:53.300527

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The state of Alaska is close to finalizing rules for a program that would allow companies to bury carbon dioxide deep underground, a process known as sequestration.
While sequestration can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by heavy industry, it also would be a boon to the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline. Many sources of natural gas on the North Slope are mixed with large amounts of carbon dioxide, and that carbon must be separated from the natural gas before shipment.  
Venting that carbon dioxide to the atmosphere would notably increase global greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating climate change.
On Tuesday, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission announced that it had completed draft regulations for the state’s “carbon storage and underground injection” program, which will involve the state taking over regulation of carbon dioxide wells from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The Alaska Legislature passed — and Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed — a law in 2023 that allows the takeover. The initial phases of the project were funded by the Biden administration under a federal grant. Subsequent years are expected to cost the state about $386,000 per year.
Four other states — Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming — have already assumed regulatory authority over “class VI wells” used to inject carbon dioxide; state control has tended to permit faster action on carbon sequestration projects. 
Alaska’s proposed regulation changes cover 105 pages of technically dense language. One important change: A carbon dioxide well wouldn’t be permitted if it needed to pass through a drinking water aquifer. The state allows exemptions for other types of wells, including some that could later be converted to carbon dioxide wells.
The proposed regulations include clauses that require insurance or bonds to cover the costs of accidents and a requirement that carbon dioxide wells be firmly capped when abandoned.
The AOGCC has scheduled a public hearing on the draft rules for 10 a.m. Jan. 13 at its office in Anchorage. Members of the public interested in participating in person or by teleconference at that meeting should send an email to samantha.coldiron@alaska.gov at least two days before the meeting. Written comments may also be emailed to that address.
When the new regulations are finalized, more work remains for the state. Alaska will have to formally draft its takeover application to the EPA, which will involve another public comment period.
That application will be submitted to the EPA “ASAP after public process,” according to the state’s published timeline, and actually assuming authority over EPA-regulated carbon wells would take another 12-18 months, the state expects.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC05295-2-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-11-28 22:56:53.300527

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska regulators have assessed a $695,900 fine against Hilcorp for violations at two wells in a North Slope oil field that is a satellite of the giant Prudhoe Bay field.
Hilcorp violated regulations for up to two years when it injected enriched gas into the reservoir at the Polaris Oil Pool, which is part of the Greater Prudhoe Bay Unit, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission said in a Nov. 24 decision and order.
Hilcorp is a Texas-based private company that now operates the state’s largest oil field. It is the second-biggest fine for the company ever proposed by the AOGCC.
The highest proposed fine was $720,000, which the commission initially assessed against the company in late 2015 for violations that led to an accident earlier that year that nearly killed three workers at the Milne Point oil field.
Ultimately, the AOGCC in 2017 reduced the fine to $200,000, though the commission assessed other fines at about the same time for other violations at Milne Point. Those fines ranged from $20,000 to $80,000.
In its new enforcement action, the AOGCC said the fine for the Polaris field violations is justified by the company’s pattern of violations.
“Hilcorp’s repeated failure to comply with fundamental injection authorization raises the potential for similar behavior with more serious consequences. Hilcorp’s repeated failure to comply with AOGCC rules and regulations combined with ineffective corrective actions, warrant increased civil penalties to deter similar behavior,” the order said.
Also influencing the fine size is the duration of the offenses. At one well, the unauthorized injection continued for 759 days, the AOGCC said. At the other well, the unauthorized injection went on for 480 days.
Enriched gas is sometimes injected into oil fields to boost oil recovery.
The enforcement action has been in the works for several months.
The AOGCC said that in February, it formally notified Hilcorp that it was investigating the use of enriched gas at the two wells. Hilcorp then conducted an internal investigation, responding to the AOGCC in March with an analysis of the root cause and actions to correct the problem and prevent a recurrence.
Because of that response earlier in the year, the AOGCC said it is not requiring Hilcorp to submit any further written explanation.
Hilcorp has the right to appeal the $695,900 fine. If it does not appeal, Hilcorp must pay within 30 days of the decision, the order said.
A company spokesperson said Hilcorp itself brought the violation to light and that it did not result in any safety or environmental problems.
“This issue involved a highly specific and previously unrecognized authorization gap that neither Hilcorp nor prior Prudhoe Bay operators had identified. We discovered it through an internal review informed by recent AOGCC findings, and we immediately notified the Commission and self-reported all details,” Hilcorp spokesperson Matt Shuckerow said by email.
Shuckerow said the use of enriched gas is safe and permitted on many neighboring wells “as part of an effort to increase resource recovery, which results in increased royalty and revenue to the State of Alaska,” he continued.
“It caused no safety risks, environmental harm or impacts to resource conservation. We have completed a comprehensive review of all wells to ensure no similar gaps exist and will continue working transparently with AOGCC to uphold the highest standards of safety, conservation, and regulatory compliance,” he said.
Shuckerow did not address the question of appealing the fine.
Hilcorp entered Alaska in 2011, focusing first on the Cook Inlet basin, where it is now the dominant operator, before expanding to the North Slope in 2014. In 2020, when BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. sold its remaining Alaska assets to Hilcorp and ended its activities in the state, Hilcorp became the operator of the Prudhoe Bay unit. Prudhoe Bay is now co-owned by oil companies ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Hilcorp.
Since it began operating in Alaska in 2011, Hilcorp has been the subject of 20 AOGCC enforcement orders, including the latest order, according to the commission’s website. Eleven concerned violations on the North Slope and nine concerned violations at Cook Inlet sites, according to the website.
Five of those orders were issued in 2024, including one that assessed a $452,100 fine for unauthorized injections at Prudhoe Bay of a type of gas used to enhance oil recovery.
Different type of enhanced recovery technique gets OK
Although the AOGCC faulted Hilcorp for its unauthorized use of enriched gas at Polaris, it has approved Hilcorp’s plan to try out a different type of enhanced recovery at the field.
The commission on Nov. 25 gave the go-ahead for Hilcorp to use polymer flooding at a different Polaris well for a 12-month test period.
The approval is unrelated to the Nov. 24 order and decision on the enhanced gas violation.
Polymers are natural or synthetic materials, such as cellulose and nylon, that consist of chains of molecules arrayed in a repeated pattern.
Polymer flooding in oil fields injects water-soluble polymers into reservoirs to increase oil recovery. The injected polymers blend with water to better sweep out oil. Polymer flooding is considered an effective technique to boost oil production, but it does not work in all types of reservoirs, according to scientists. The technique is most appropriate for enhanced recovery of heavier oils, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Hilcorp pioneered the use of polymer flooding on the North Slope, starting in 2018 with a test project conducted at Milne Point in collaboration with the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the U.S. Department of Energy.
The pilot project was deemed successful, and Hilcorp now uses the technique more widely at Milne Point, where polymer flooding has allowed for much better recovery of the thicker oil that is within that field.
With the help of polymer flooding and other actions, Hilcorp has increased Milne Point production from about 18,400 barrels per day in late 2014 to about 50,000 barrels per day now.
Hilcorp in 2014 acquired 50% ownership in Milne Point from BP and became the operator that year. Hilcorp took full ownership in 2020, after the acquisition from BP was completed.
The company has for years considered expanding some of the practices that have improved production at Milne Point to the parts of the Greater Prudhoe Bay Unit, which also holds some heavier oil. The now-authorized 12-month test at the Polaris well is part of that strategy.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)While the federal government steps away from climate agreements, Salt Lake City is reiterating its commitment to become more sustainable ahead of the 2034 Olympic Games with a 2040 deadline to achieve goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
In an update presented to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, the city’s Sustainability Department highlighted milestones, including a major one — the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 11% from 2009 to 2024, said Catherine Wyffels, air quality and environmental program manager at the department. 
“This is primarily due to a shift to cleaner energy sources,” Wyffels said in a presentation. “So while this 11% may not seem like much, it’s important to remember that it happened during a period of a lot of growth.”

Per capita emissions also declined 25% in the same period, she said. But there’s still a long way to go to meet the city’s climate goals.
After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.
“People are interested in anything they can do in their homes to save under utility bills,” she said. “A lot of support for clean renewable energy for both homes and businesses. People like street trees in their neighborhoods, and then also a lot of support for increased access to transit, walking and biking infrastructure.”
All of those are solutions to the city’s primary climate risks, which according to the Sustainability Department, are driven by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.
The report presented to the City Council is still preliminary and is scheduled for an update next spring. Whenever it’s done, the city hopes it can help trace a path to achieve its goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2030 and cutting 80% of emissions by 2040. 
Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said. Urban development amid continued growth is expected to exacerbate the issue.

The city’s sustainability department also highlighted some achievements including an 80-megawatt solar farm that provides a lot of the city’s municipal energy and has saved around $1.5 million in electricity bills, said Sophia Nicholas, deputy director at the city’s Sustainability Department.  
“We have a lot of the solutions at hand. We just need to have the wherewithal, political will, money, to implement them on a global basis,” Nicholas said. “And it is happening actually in other countries, but when you’re looking at our emissions profile in Salt Lake City in particular, about half of it comes from electricity, and that’s why it’s been so exciting to see that we have realized a reduction in our electric grid carbon intensity due to investments in a cleaner grid.”
Despite the progress there are still some issues. Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said. In the last 50 years, the average temperature in Utah has risen more than 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, about twice the global average. 
“That may not sound like much,” she said during the meeting, “but a few degrees change in the average temperature means our city and our region is and will continue to experience increasing drought, wildfires, flooding, extreme heat days and poor air quality.”
The city met federal air quality standards
For 15 years Salt Lake City and Provo, some of the densest cities in Utah were nonattainment areas for the Environmental Protection Agency’s 24-hour standards for fine particular matter pollution known as PM2.5. This month, however, the federal agency announced both municipalities were finally in compliance. 
“The achievement of cleaner air in Utah resulted from extensive planning and collaboration among the public, industry, and various government levels, leading to significant investments and the implementation of 23 new rules targeting emissions from multiple sources,” Bryce Bird, director at the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement.
He pointed to some efforts supported by the state Legislature, including incentives for retrofitting and replacing high-emission wood stoves and diesel vehicles, as well as transit updates and education campaigns. 
However, in terms of energy, the state also modified its policy in 2024 to consider energy resources by listing these attributes in order of priority: adequate, reliable, dispatchable, affordable, sustainable, secure and clean. That law worried environmentalists, who said it could lead to the prioritization of coal and move the state away from a strong market of renewables.
Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Holidays are a time for tradition, and for state officials and health advocates that means renewing the annual call for Marylanders to get vaccinated for respiratory illnesses ahead of holiday gatherings.
But with a difficult influenza variant emerging this season, combined with contrary messaging from federal health agencies and an anticipated rise in vaccine hesitancy, public health experts worry that the 2025 flu season will be more challenging than in previous years.
“It’s hard to predict these things, but it’s safe to say we’re at the beginning of the flu season, things are going to get worse,” said Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches respiratory illnesses. “So now we’ve got time to get the vaccine to try to minimize your risk.”
Vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the newest challenge this year is the unanticipated influenza variant called subclade K, which public health experts say is “less sensitive” to the flu vaccine created for this year.
It’s a regular challenge for scientists developing the annual flu shot, who make an informed and researched prediction on what strand of influenza virus will be the prominent strain. But the subclade K variant is contributing this year to spikes in Canada, Japan and other countries.
“With the flu, it is often very unpredictable,” said Susan Polan, associate executive director with the American Public Health Association. “They decide what the vaccine should be a very long time in advance and sometimes they don’t get it exactly right.”
But Polan, Pekosz and other experts say the vaccine still offers some protection and it is worth getting the flu shot as the season of holiday gatherings gets underway this year.
Health advocates worry feds’ new COVID vaccine guidelines will mean fewer vaccinations

But there lies another problem. Pekosz says that there’s still a challenge in getting people to vaccinate at all, noting that vaccine uptake has been on the decline.
State data shows that for the current respiratory season, weekly flu vaccinations peaked in October at 170,666 during the week of Oct. 11. Compare that to last year, when vaccinations peaked the week of Oct.5 at 186,868 flu shots that week.
That tracks with a national decrease in flu vaccinations between last year and now. Polan notes that there are a couple factors at play, but says the Trump administration is contributing to vaccine skepticism and overall confusion.
“The myths and misinformation that is coming out of the federal government right now related to vaccines broadly, I think a lot of people are going to be confused,” she said.
Under President Donald Trump, federal health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have broken with other public health organizations on vaccine recommendations. Most recently, the CDC issued a controversial update to its website saying that “Studies supporting a link” between autism and vaccines “have been ignored by health authorities” contrary to the agency’s previous long-running stance that there is not a link.
Polan said the fact that the CDC has brought the debate to the forefront will likely only further vaccine hesitancy.
“The conversation has become so much more mainstream that the expectation is that vaccine hesitancy is going to get worse,” she said. “And that is a difficult challenge that we have to try to address and combat.”
But the flu is not the only respiratory illness that goes around this time of year, with COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) still posing deadly threats, particularly for the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.

Access to those vaccines can be challenging for people who don’t have health insurance to cover the costs, which can also result in lower vaccine uptake.
Polan notes that some families find it hard to justify paying out of pocket for a vaccine when there are more immediate challenges to handle.
“We know when people have to pay out of pocket for prevention, they’re less likely to do it,” Polan said. “If I have a limited amount of money available, what do I do? Do I take care of an immediate need? Do I take care of food, medicine, rent, mortgage, all of these things? Or do I pay for something … and I am not going to see the immediate impact?”
To counter this challenge, Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a new program last week to help uninsured and underinsured individuals get access to vaccines at local health departments in Baltimore, Garrett, Montgomery, and Somerset counties, with availability expanding to more counties in later weeks.
“Nobody should be denied basic health care because of an inability to pay,” Moore said in a written statement. “At a time when the federal government is undermining public health and creating unnecessary confusion around vaccine policy, Maryland is investing … and stepping up to make sure our people are protected.”
‘Not too late’ to get vaccinated
Pekosz hopes that the Thanksgiving holiday will give Marylanders who have not yet gotten vaccinated for the respiratory illness season an additional push to do so.
Maryland advocates hope new multistate public health coalition will clarify vaccine ‘confusion’

“Now is the time that we oftentimes see a last push of people that go out looking for the vaccine,” he said. “They go to family events where people are sneezing and coughing and that makes it very real for them. I’m really hoping that this last November, December push will get some of these vaccination rates more similar to previous years.
“Cases are increasing with the flu, but they won’t peak for another four or five weeks, and the vaccine takes about two weeks to work,” he said. “It’s not too late to get your flu or your COVID or your RSV vaccine.”
Meanwhile, Marylanders are recommended to take other measures to reduce the spread of illnesses this winter, including washing hands frequently and wearing masks in crowded places like the grocery store.
“This message is primarily towards those high-risk populations,” Pekosz said. “But these are things that all of us should be practicing because everything we can do to limit the number of cases overall in the population provides that extra safety for the ones that are truly vulnerable to severe respiratory infections.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235638589.jpg,,,2025-11-28 20:56:54.505086

This location is used for late-fall and winter photography sessions. (Photo by Sanya Wason)Jerry Fleming drives a green-and-yellow John Deere tractor around Butler’s Orchard, circling the rows upon rows of Christmas trees — planted in fields he personally pulled the stumps from years ago and hand-sheared by him and his coworkers recently as they prepared for the holiday rush.
“It’s never cold here — the weather might be cold, but the way we work, it’s never cold,” said Fleming, sporting overalls, a black-and-yellow flannel and sunglasses perched on his hat
Fleming is one of the many workers at Butler’s Orchard in Germantown who work months, and years, for a couple of weeks of sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas — when they start all over again.
Ben Butler, the farm’s finance and farm manager, calls the Christmas tree farm industry an “old man’s game” in reference to the time it takes to get a tree farm to the point where a farmer can begin selling trees.
Butler’s Orchard is home to more than 44,000 trees — with 45 acres of land growing about 980 trees each. It typically takes about 10 years to get one of those fields to market size.
A field at Butler’s is cleared for replanting each year. That includes adjusting the pH of the soil and removing old stumps. It takes a few weeks to clear each stump of the 2,000-2,500 cut-your-own trees the farm sells per holiday season.

A cover crop is planted to rehabilitate the soil during the summer, followed by grass seed in September. New trees are finally planted in the spring and then tended for the next seven to eight years for the trees to get large enough to be sold.
“We are hoping we can have enough [trees] to make everyone happy, but not enough to keep in this lot,” Butler said about selling enough trees to clear out the field after the holiday season.
As they grow, trees are sheared by workers to keep the proper shape. Workers individually shear trees at sunrise in the warmer months, to avoid the heat, though sometimes work stretches through hotter times of the day. They wear shin and thigh guards to protect themselves from getting hurt from the shears, and are sometimes stung by bees who hang around the trees.
“Every tree you see is hand sheared by somebody, somewhere — it’s a tough job,” Butler said.
But Fleming says there are few complaints about the work. The mood is upbeat, said Fleming, who is known to bring a speaker to play Christmas music while he and his co-workers shape up the farm.
“People beg us to come back to work here,” Fleming said. “You never even think about what time it is.”
Fleming has worked at the farm since 2017, learning all he knows about trees during those eight years. He said the holiday season is his favorite time on the farm — bringing a nostalgic feeling of the “old days” when he would cut down a tree from the woods with his grandfather.
Christmas trees are far from the only business at Butler’s Orchard, a pick-your-own farm with a calendar that starts in April for asparagus and continues through the end of October for apples and pumpkins, and hosts seasonal festivals throughout the year. That means workers spent recent weeks from autumn-themed attractions to the holiday season, with workers shoveling thousands of pounds of corn kernels out of a play area for kids on a Friday morning, and mowing paths between the rows of trees.

The area that now holds 750 pre-cut trees was changed over from Halloween decorations in a matter of days. It now boasts a holiday themed welcome sign and a Christmas tree made from stacked painted tires, along with a playground and petting zoo. The makeover was mostly done from Nov. 10-14 — even though Agritainment Manager Gina Giantonio called her team off work on Nov. 11, when a brisk wind made the temperatures feel below freezing.
Giantonio was confident that her team would still be able to finish before the pre-cut trees arrived Nov. 19. Most of the pre-cut trees are shipped from North Carolina or Pennsylvania, to ensure taller trees are available for purchase, and the rest are grown at Butler’s.
Workers get training each year on how to load trees onto the baler, which wraps trees in netting before customers take them home, and safely manage the trees each year during training. The cut-your-own workers go through similar training, with the addition of evening out the cut end of a tree and tying it to the customer’s car.
“It takes a team — it takes a village,” Giantonio said. “You can’t just do it by yourself.”
She recalled one day during a previous season when her team worked through pouring rain and slippery ice, yet still had at least 25 customers come to the pre-cut area to purchase trees.
“You work around the elements, you’re here rain or shine — you’re a farmer,” Giantonio said.
It’s not just the elements: Christmas tree farmers have been competing artificial trees, too.
“We’re up against the fake tree — the fake tree industry has done a great job of marketing their trees and we need to combat that,” said Joncie Underwood, treasurer for the Maryland Christmas Tree Association.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Butler said some customers believe buying an artificial tree may be better for the environment than cutting down real trees, but in reality, the opposite is true. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, emit fresh air and can be recycled into mulch, according to a statement from Kristin Hanna, the Maryland Department of Agriculture’s director of special projects. Butler himself has also seen birds, bees and even praying manitises make the trees their home.
“We encourage people to buy more trees so we can plant more,” he said, “If people aren’t buying them, we aren’t planting them.”
Not only is buying a real tree better than buying an artificial tree shipped in from overseas, Butler said, but it also directly supports the local economy and farm workers.
“When you support your local farmer, not only are you helping the farmer with his or her livelihood, you are also keeping the funds here — in your state,” Underwood said. Christmas trees are a product that creates jobs and revenue in both the United States and in the farmer’s region, she said.
“Tree farmers keep land open and productive,” Hanna said. “You also can’t beat the smell of a real Christmas tree in your home.”

It still has businesses concerned and some collectors moping about its demise.","The U.S. Mint ceased production of the penny on Nov. 12, although experts expect the coin still will be in your mix of change for years to come.

WASHINGTON – Earlier this month, the last-ever penny was minted in Philadelphia. Here’s what this means for Maryland consumers, businesses and collectors.
The Nov. 12 end to production of the penny had been in motion since February, when President Donald Trump announced he had met with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to discuss the cancellation.
“For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “This is so wasteful!”
Rising costs in the production of one-cent coins played a large role in the decision, the U.S. Mint said. Over the past 10 years, the cost to produce a penny has risen from 1.42 cents to 3.69 cents per coin.
“Economic and production factors, combined with evolving consumer behavior, have made its continued production unsustainable,” the U.S. Mint said in a statement.
Around half of consumers agree, according to a February survey from the National Association of Convenience Stores.
Although the idea has been circulating for decades, this marks the first time that the Treasury Department has made that final call in discontinuing the one-cent coin.
The end of penny production is expected to save the Mint around $56 million a year.
What happens now?
The penny still will remain in circulation and be accepted as legal tender for the foreseeable future. Stores are expected to round cash transactions to the closest 5 cents, but this may ultimately prove unnecessary, given that enough pennies still remain in circulation.
The U.S. Mint produced over 3 billion pennies in 2024, adding to the 300 billion pennies currently in circulation.

Legislation has been introduced in the House to help ease the transition by codifying guidelines for businesses, but the bill has yet to be voted on. The Common Cents Act was introduced in April by Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) and is eligible for House consideration within the next few months.
The law would “provide the guidance and regulations needed to help stores, banks, and consumers make a smooth transition while modernizing our currency policy,” McClain told Capital News Service in a statement.
Canada implemented similar rounding recommendations after discontinuing its penny in 2012, also maintaining the coin as legal tender despite halting production.
Among the 21 countries in the European Union sharing the euro as the common currency, the minting of one-cent coins (and two-cent coins) has been discontinued in eight nations: Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Slovakia.
Getting rid of pennies or their equivalents has been a global trend.
Australia hasn’t had one-cent and two-cent coins since 1992. New Zealand jettisoned both coins in 1990. Mexico stopped minting the one-centavo coin in 1992. South Africa ended one-cent and two-cent coin production in 2002. Brazil said farewell to its one-centavo coin in 2005.
The United Kingdom, meanwhile, hasn’t given up yet on its one-pence coins.
Impact on local businesses
Maryland Local Businesses, an organization supporting small businesses across the state, maintains that the end of the penny will have minimal impact on owner and customer experiences.
“Consumer transactions are predominantly credit card-driven … so they can still price things that way,” said Connor Edwards, marketing director of Maryland Local Businesses.
Cindy Calhoun, owner of a Washington-area souvenir penny machine company, known to collectors as “elongateds,” is not very concerned about the impact on her business.
“As with all things, we learn to adapt to changes and I expect the hobby of collecting elongateds will continue to grow and adapt,” Calhoun told CNS in a statement. She theorizes that many machines will transition to pre-loaded blank copper, or convert to stamping dimes or quarters.
Others, however, are more skeptical about the policy’s implementation.
Thanksgiving by the numbers: How much Marylanders can expect to spend this holiday

“The way the U.S. went about it was thoughtless and without consideration,” said Chris Russotti, a Virginia coin collector. “The government did not pass any legislation or provide any guidance for how to handle transactions going forward.”
A group of national trade associations wrote to congressional finance committees in September about the lack of federal guidance.
Stores across the country are hoping for guidelines on rounding, handling Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) purchases and check-cashing.
“If these remedies are not addressed in short order, it will be challenging to legally engage in cash transactions with customers in growing swaths of the country,” the letter warned.
Impact on penny’s value
“I do not think the value of the penny will rise” among collectors, Russotti said, citing the massive supply of coins already available.
Edward Van Wesep, a professor at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder, shares this opinion.
“I doubt that they will ever be worth anything more than a penny, and the value of a penny goes down every day due to inflation,” he said.
However, some collectors mourn the penny’s demise.
“I enjoyed buying boxes to go through,” Russotti said. “I’m saddened that I can no longer buy them from a bank.”
“It’s a strange feeling after well over 200 years for it to be over,” said “Twosheds” Gabbard, a Louisville, Kentucky, collector.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-29 01:02:42+00:00,Mississippi Today,Kiffin’s contemplation of his own future scrambles the narrative as Ole Miss wins the Egg Bowl,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/28/kiffin-future-egg-bowl/,"Ole Miss defeated Mississippi State 38-19 in the Egg Bowl, but the rivalry game was largely overshadowed by Lane Kiffin's indecision about whether he would remain as the Rebels' coach.","STARKVILLE — This should be a column about how OIe Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, the best story in college football this season, threw for 359 yards and four touchdowns and played error-less football to lead the Rebels to a 38-19 Egg Bowl victory.
It should be a column about how Ole Miss completed an 11-victory regular season, the first in Mississippi NCAA Division I history.
Rick Cleveland
It should be a column about how Kewan Lacy ran around through Mississippi State for 143 yards and a touchdown and continues to give Ole Miss the ground game the Rebels lacked last season. Lacy might be the biggest reason why the Rebels will go to the FBS playoffs this year instead of falling just short as they did last year.
This could also be a column about how the future of Mississippi State football, whose name is Kemario Taylor and who raced for 173 yards and two scores and threw for another 178 yards in a losing cause. Taylor is a tall, sleek, ridiculously talented freshman you can build a program around, as 60,000 or so fans could attest on a sunny, brisk Friday afternoon at historic Scott Field..

But none of that is the focus of this column, and you knew it wouldn’t be. Lane Kiffin and his immediate future sucked the air out of all the rest of the storylines. Kiffin was the reason why several national sports reporters found their ways to Starkville on Friday. He’s the reason why so many Ole Miss fans will have their nerves wracked for at least one more day.
And, no, Kiffin had no definitive answers Friday. No, he said, he hasn’t made a decision. Yes, he allowed, he will have a decision sometime Saturday. “I feel like I’ve got to,” he said.
“It is not as enjoyable as people think it is,” Kiffin said of the decision-making process.
For those who have been completely out of touch, Kiffin is weighing offers from LSU and Florida against remaining at Ole Miss. To coach his Rebels in the playoffs, he would have to turn down the other suitors.
“I’ve got some praying to do to figure this thing out,” Kiffin said. ”I’m living one day at a time. I know that doesn’t help you, but it helps me.”
Kiffin said he had no idea when an announcement on his future will come Saturday. “If’s a fair question, but I really don’t know. It’s not my call,” he said.

Kiffin said he planned to go watch his son, Knox Kiffin, quarterback the Oxford Chargers in their playoff game  Friday night at Tupelo.
“I’m gonna go be a dad,” he said.
Above all else, Kiffin seemed hellbent on making it clear that he was never worried about how his players would respond to all the noise about his future.
“I know the storyline about the distractions,” Kiffin said. “But we build our team different. What you may think is distracting, I don’t think is. We teach our players to focus on what they control and to block out the rest. If anything, all that distraction bonds them together to stay focused.”
Perhaps, but that doesn’t explain the Rebel collapse in 2022 when Auburn was the well-publicized Kiffin suitor and the distracted Rebels lost four of their last five games.
As for the decision he faces now, Kiffin is clearly anguished. This comes from a sports writer not a mind reader, but Kiffin really did appear to be struggling with the decision post-game. That was especially apparent when he was asked about people he could reach out to for advice and when he appeared to become emotional. He mentioned Nick Saban and Pete Carroll.

“Obviously, my dad,” Kiffin said, pausing to gather himself. “I’ve really missed him this week.”
Monte Kiffin died 16 months ago.
So what will Lane Kiffin do? Hell if I know. I think, given his track record, he won’t make the call until he has to. Apparently, he has pretty much ruled out Florida and it the decision is between staying at Ole Miss or leaving for the Rebels’ bitter rival LSU.
My guess?
My guess is that Lane Kiffin really wants in his heart of hearts to take the LSU job. But then, I don’t see how any coach could lead his team to 50 victories over five seasons, lead his team to the playoffs for the national championship – and then say good-bye to them before the first playoff game is played.
Lane Kiffin might do that, but I’ll believe it only when it happens.

Native American and Alaska Native students attending a tribal college or university are eligible to submit up to two designs. The deadline for submissions is January 15, 2026.
The College Fund describes itself as the nation’s largest charity supporting Native higher education for 35 years. Pendleton Woolen Mills describes itself as “focused on a legacy of creating quality lifestyle products with timeless styling.”
Montanans have taken the prize in the past, according to records from the College Fund. Since the contest’s inception in 2019, it has had two students from Montana tribal colleges and universities as winners.

In 2020, Deshawna Anderson, of the Little Big Horn College in Crow Agency, won for the Courage to Bloom Blanket, the College Fund said. In 2021, Chelysa Owens-Cyr was the winner for Unity Blanket. The College Fund said Owens-Cyr, of Fort Peck Community College, continued to work with Pendleton to create jigsaw puzzles for her design and did “an amazing design with Nike N7 in November 2024.”
Bob Christnacht, with Pendleton, said the company’s partnership with the College Fund is one of its most meaningful and enduring collaborations.
“We are deeply honored that the students choose to share their artwork with us, and we remain humbled by the opportunity to help amplify their voices within their communities and beyond, Christnacht said in a statement. “Each student’s design is a reflection of personal story and heritage, and we are grateful to play a part in honoring their artistry and supporting their lasting legacy.”
The Tribal College Blanket Design Contest elevates the work of promising artists attending tribal colleges and universities, a press release said.
The first-place winner will have their design distributed on products internationally, with the top three designers also receiving scholarships and cash prizes. The winning design from each year is added to Pendleton’s American Indian College Fund collection of wool blankets.
Pendleton has worked with the College Fund since 1995 and has provided more than $1.5 million in scholarship support for American Indian and Alaska Native students attending tribal colleges and universities, the press release said.
TCUs provide a critical link to higher education, career advancement, and Indigenous knowledge for their communities, often located on Indian reservations and remote, rural areas. The College Fund provides millions of dollars to thousands of TCU students every year; the blanket design contest adds to that support while elevating Native art, culture, and stories.
Submission guidelines and applications are available on the College Fund’s website at https://collegefund.org/pendleton. Formal artistic study and textile design experience are not required. Contest design winners are selected each year by a committee comprised of Native American artists and College Fund and Pendleton staff.

But the state can achieve the first without worsening the second, he says.","Maryland needs more clean energy but it doesn't need to consume farmland and open space to do so, writes Marshal Cahall, who points to options lke putting solar panels on manmade structures like roof and garages, and who said nuclear needs to be an option. (Stock photo/Getty images)Maryland is losing farmland at an alarming rate, with over 12,000 acres disappearing in just the last five years. This trend jeopardizes our food supply and drives up costs for local products. At the same time, our state undoubtedly needs to increase its domestic energy production.
But the sad fact is that recent policies intended to produce energy have put even more of our finite farmland at risk, threatening the very future of Maryland’s agriculture.
For instance, a new law overrides local zoning to fast-track solar development on agricultural land. Similarly, the controversial Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project transmission line raises the possibility of using eminent domain on farm parcels. These actions prioritize energy development without considering the long-term cost to one of our state’s most valuable resources — our finite and limited farmland.

Fortunately, we don’t have to choose between energy and agriculture. We can meet our energy goals by investing in smarter, more sustainable solutions.
First, let’s prioritize solar development on existing infrastructure. Solar panels should be placed on rooftops, over parking lots or on brownfields — areas that are already developed and don’t require the sacrifice of farmland. Incentivizing this approach would make these locations the default for new solar projects.
Second, we can leverage existing rights-of-way for new transmission lines. At the same time that the MPRP was being discussed, Baltimore Gas and Electric advanced a 59-mile project in a very similar area by utilizing existing pathways for transmission lines. Their project showed that by building necessary infrastructure on existing pathways, you avoid the need for eminent domain and prevent conflict with landowners.
Finally, and perhaps most effectively, Maryland can invest in nuclear energy. Long gone are the days when investing in nuclear energy was considered a risky proposition. Nuclear power is clean, highly efficient, and requires a minimal land footprint to produce a massive amount of energy.
Members of the Maryland Farm Bureau recently had the opportunity to tour Maryland’s lone nuclear energy facility, Calvert Cliffs. We were incredibly impressed by the efficiency, production and safety measures taken by the operation. This single facility contributes 87% of the state’s clean, carbon-free energy output. Imagine the impact even a single new reactor could have on our energy needs without consuming precious farmland.
Moving forward, our state leadership must choose a path that protects our farms while powering our future. By investing in these common-sense solutions, we can ensure Maryland remains a leader in both agriculture and energy.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-panels-in-field-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 18:57:02.465483

Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

The lawsuit is the second the state has faced that attempts to stop Magellan of Idaho’s plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The patients filed their lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday, and are seeking class-action status to protect all Idahoans on the program. 
Their arguments echo claims made by mental health clinics in a state court lawsuit last week: That the cuts would effectively end the program, risking worsening mental health conditions and overall public safety. 
The cuts, patients argue, “will have cascading negative consequences for plaintiffs and for their families, including increasing acuity of mental health symptoms, more frequent and intense mental health crises, and an overall functional decline in their day-to-day lives not only impacting family and social connections but also their own well-being and personal safety as well as the safety of others and the public at large.”
Magellan’s cuts, announced late last month, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. The private company, which runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, plans to cut peer support services and the mobile treatment program, called Assertive Community Treatment, on Dec. 1.
Spokespeople for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Magellan declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying they don’t comment on pending litigation.

“Acting under color of state law, the government-official defendants either have directed or authorized the State’s contractor to make devastating changes to the administration of the … program,” patients argue in the lawsuit. “But their actions were unlawful, and this Court should grant relief to the plaintiffs.” 
One patient suing, identified only as Ramon in the lawsuit, has seen his symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia drastically improve since receiving services through the program that is slated to be cut, the lawsuit says.
“Ramon is a new person. He has leveled out, is consistent with his medications, and follows through with his … treatment and management plans,” the lawsuit says. Since receiving services through the program, “Ramon has not been incarcerated, hospitalized, or institutionalized, which is quite a change for him given his prior pattern of incarceration and hospitalization.”
Before he was on the program, “his family relationship had been severed,” the lawsuit says. But the program, the lawsuit said, “has been instrumental in reuniting Ramon with his family.” 
Many of the roughly 400 to 500 people on the program will end up homeless if the program ends, Tueller Counseling Clinical Director Tom Tueller previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.

Humphreys, 68, feels betrayed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. “As federal employees, we sacrificed good salaries in the private sector because we thought the benefits from government would be better now, in retirement,” he said.
As the nation’s largest employer-sponsored health insurance program, the FEHB Program covers more than 8.2 million federal government employees and retirees, and it was once celebrated as a national model for controlling costs while giving enrollees many health plan options.
But next year, average enrollee premium payments in the system are set to jump more than 12%, on top of a 13.5% hike in 2025. The two-year increase is higher than what many private employers and their workers are experiencing.
The FEHB rate hikes are similar to those for plans sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges — excluding the government subsidies most enrollees get, a major point of contention on Capitol Hill. The premiums insurers charge for Obamacare plans are rising 26% on average for 2026, following a 4% increase this year.
What’s making the latest hike in FEHB premium payments even harder to stomach for millions of federal employees is its timing: The 2026 increase was announced in October, when many federal workers were on unpaid furlough during the 43-day government shutdown.
Unlike most private employers, the FEHB Program gives its enrollees numerous health plans to choose from. That allows some people to lower their monthly premium payments by switching to plans with higher deductibles or copayments. But each year only about 5% of enrollees switch plans, according to the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the program.
Humphreys, who has stayed with the same health plan for decades despite steadily higher prices, said it’s difficult determining which plan is best based on their health conditions. He has glaucoma and diabetes, and his wife, Julianne, has faced heart issues.
Their FEHB plan covers costs for their care not covered by Medicare, which typically pays 80% of their health bills.
“There’s a fear that if you do something and change plans and it’s wrong, you could be in a bad spot,” he said.
Open enrollment for federal employees and retirees runs through Dec. 8.
Among the factors causing premiums to increase, according to OPM, are an aging federal workforce with more chronic conditions, as well as prescription drug use, including pricey GLP-1 medications for weight loss.
About 42% of federal employees are over the age of 50, compared with 33% in the general workforce, OPM says. About 7% of federal employees are under the age of 30, compared with about 20% of workers overall.
OPM officials said the Trump administration’s policies aimed at lowering drug costs and focused on prevention of costly medical conditions will hopefully help it control premiums in the future.
“None of these initiatives of course will happen overnight – turning a $79 billion ship takes slow and steady progress,” Shane Stevens, OPM’s associate director for health care and insurance, said in a news release. “But, we are committed to improving the quality of life and quality of care for our members while also ensuring that healthcare remains accessible and affordable for those who work (or have worked) for the American people.”
OPM didn’t respond to requests for comment.

John Holahan, a health policy fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, said OPM’s explanation left out a key reason for rising premiums: hospital consolidation. While the FEHB Program is a collection of health plans, in many markets — including the Washington, D.C., area — those insurers must negotiate with a handful of powerful health systems that have bought up other hospitals and doctors. That market power enables them to drive prices higher on FEHB plans, he said.
Jacqueline D. Bowens, president and CEO of the D.C. Hospital Association, said in a statement that “the costs borne by patients are not determined solely by the care they receive, but by how insurance companies choose to price, reimburse, and restrict access to that care.”
Holahan said it’s surprising that FEHB premiums are rising even faster than those of other, smaller employers. But he is not surprised federal employees don’t switch plans more often, even when it may be in their financial interest.
“It’s that people find the health care world so complicated,” he said. Holahan, a noted health economist, said he, too, finds it daunting to switch Medicare health plans.
Mike Lindquist, a scientific review officer for the National Institutes of Health, said he’s not happy with the rise in his premium payments the past two years. “It’s tough, as it’s a big expense.”
Lindquist, 43, who lives in Brunswick, Maryland, has been on the same Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan through the FEHB Program the past few years even though he evaluates his options each fall.
“By not switching, you don’t have to worry about choosing a new plan that might not take your practitioners,” he said.
Jonathan Foley, a health consultant who worked as a senior adviser at OPM during the Biden administration, said premium increases will be a hardship for many enrollees. While the FEHB Program offers 200 health plans in total, with about 10 to 20 in each geographic market, enrollment is concentrated in just a handful of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
“This concentration reduces competition and gives outsize influence” to rate increases by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Foley said in an email.
He said the FEHB Program also faces higher costs because it requires its health plans to cover GLP-1 medications, such as Wegovy and Ozempic. Nationally, fewer than half of large employers offer this benefit, according to the Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Another cost pressure has been more members using behavioral health benefits to treat depression and anxiety since the start of the covid pandemic, Foley said.
The Trump administration’s federal workforce reductions also have contributed to cost increases, Foley said. OPM has lost about a third of its employees in the past year, leaving fewer workers to oversee the FEHB Program and negotiate with dozens of health insurers, he said.
“The workforce reductions and the unpredictable nature of policymaking in the Trump administration has created considerable uncertainty among health insurance carriers,” Foley said. “The response of actuaries to increased uncertainty is to raise rates.”
A Government Accountability Office report this year found that recent OPM staffing vacancies led to a suspension of fraud risk assessments in the FEHB Program.
John Hatton, staff vice president for policy and programs at an advocacy group called the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, said higher prices mean it’s critical for FEHB members to shop and compare plans for next year. “The program was designed to promote competition to mitigate and drive down costs,” he said.
Hatton said OPM surveys show the main reasons people don’t change plans is they are overwhelmed by their options and worried about making a mistake. Switching to a plan with even a slightly higher deductible, he said, could save people a few hundred dollars a month on premiums.
But Humphreys, the Georgia retiree, said he likes that his current plan comes with low out-of-pocket costs for him and his wife. They owed little money when his wife suffered a kidney stone infection and sepsis, which put her in the hospital for 12 days.
That reassurance will soon come at a higher cost: Their FEHB and Medicare premiums will take up more than half of his pension check next year after accounting for taxes.
“I can take a lower-premium plan, but it’s a gamble I am not willing to take,” he said.

In Southeast Vermont, a group of school districts are already out of the gate putting into practice a key feature of the redistricting task force’s proposal — forming regional cooperatives to share services. 
For several years, the Mountain Views Supervisory Union — which serves students in the towns of Woodstock, Barnard, Bridgewater, Killington, Plymouth, Pomfret and Reading — has been partnering with seven nearby districts in Windham, Windsor and Rutland counties to pool their resources under the Vermont Learning Collaborative.
Officials there say the initiative shows clear cost benefits and improvements to educational programs, two central goals of Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law.

The districts’ collaborative — a precursor to the type of regional entity now being proposed by the task force — facilitates the sharing of services in special education, professional development, human resources and more.
A state law passed in 2024 enables districts in Vermont to form a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, or BOCES. The Mountain Views Supervisory Union’s collaborative will soon be officially recognized by the state’s Agency of Education as the first in the state.
The five regional partnerships envisioned in the task force’s proposal, called Cooperative Service Areas, would similarly allow districts to collaborate and save money by sharing services at scale.
The educational structure is commonplace in much of the United States. Forty-three states, including smaller, rural states like West Virginia, Maine, Mississippi and Montana, utilize a form of regional cooperative service agencies.
The collaborative has generated cost savings for participating districts, officials with the Mountain Views Supervisory Union said. Districts that would otherwise be siloed and forced to pay for duplicative services have been able to access professional development services at a larger scale thanks to their collaborative, saving individual districts an average of 66% on those costs, according to Jill Graham, the collaborative’s executive director.
The task force’s proposal has generated interest throughout the state. Other districts have approached the Agency of Education about adopting a similar structure, according to previous reporting. Campaign Vermont, an advocacy group, said in a release that the state could save $334 million annually if districts share services.
The Mountain Views districts’ special education services have also seen improvement. Their collaboration has led to a reduction in the number of students who are placed outside of member districts, school officials said.
“We are seeing the impact of this resource,” said Sherry Sousa, the superintendent of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union. “And we’re getting the payback.”
Sousa says the Agency of Education is reviewing the articles of agreement between the partnering supervisory districts and will soon approve its formation. The approval comes with a $10,000 grant from the state.
‘Legacy inefficiencies’
The task force’s proposal was finalized in a draft report that will be sent to the legislature by December 1. But it has faced heavy criticism from Gov. Phill Scott’s administration.
Scott has made direct consolidation of the state’s 52 supervisory unions and supervisory districts and 119 school districts a key priority of the broader reform envisioned in Act 73. 
The change would wrest control of local spending away from school districts, but much of the law’s changes to education finance may not happen without agreement on a new map of districts.
Regional cooperatives are one facet of the task force’s proposal for the public education reform envisioned by Act 73. The group is recommending voluntary mergers of the state’s school districts.
Those mergers could be incentivized by using state construction aid to facilities creating regional high schools, a more long-term proposal in their recommendation.
Gov. Phil Scott and his education secretary, Zoie Saunders have panned the proposal, and said the task force ignored their mandate to consolidate the state’s existing districts and draw new maps of those possible boundaries.
Saunders, in a letter to the task force, said their plan “inverts the Governor’s original plan” by maintaining the state’s 52 supervisory unions and districts and 119 school districts, “while adding” five regional entities on top.
Each regional cooperative, she wrote, would “have its own governing board, executive director, and staff—expanding, not reducing, administrative footprint,” she wrote.
“The result is more governance, more overhead, and the preservation of legacy inefficiencies,” she wrote.
Scott was more forceful in his criticism, telling reporters this month that the task force “failed” in their task.
“They didn’t redraw the lines, and they were supposed to put forward three maps for consideration, and they failed,” Scott said.
Task force members have pushed back on this. In a draft of their final report, task force members wrote that they could not find evidence that direct consolidation of school districts would help alleviate primary cost drivers like health insurance, special education, facilities and transportation.
“Regional coordination, shared staffing, and well-planned high school collaborations address these drivers more effectively than mandated structural change,” the task force wrote.
The disagreements between task force members and officials in Scott’s administration foreshadow a difficult legislative session to come. Lawmakers will have to agree on a new map of school districts for much of Act 73 to see the light of day.
The debate has generated a vast amount of uncertainty in the state’s public education landscape. Keri Bristow, the board chair of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union, said the task force’s proposal preserves a local democratic process.
“You can make any map you want, but if the people don’t have any affinity with the other groups they’re pushed with, there’s just going to be a lot of problems trying to meld those people, those groups, into an Uber School District,” Bristow said. “We would prefer to choose our partners.”

The state Department of Corrections announced the Thanksgiving night death of 37-year-old Larry Thomas Dukes Franklin on Friday. Franklin was incarcerated at the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s maximum security Jameson Annex in Sioux Falls.
DCI spokesman Tony Mangan confirmed that the agency is investigating the situation as a suspected overdose.
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

Franklin’s death is the fourth this month in the state’s prison system. Overdoses are suspected in two of the other November deaths, of 33-year-old Travis Long Fox at the penitentiary, and 46-year-old Timothy Tyree at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield.
Shane Ostercamp, 44, also died in November. He died in a comfort care setting in Springfield.
Five other inmates died of suspected or confirmed overdoses this year before November, all but one from a synthetic drug known as “K2” or “spice.” 
Attorney General Marty Jackley has indicted a handful of people in and outside the prison system for drug distribution, including one former corrections officer. Of the eight total suspected overdose deaths this year, four occurred after Jackley announced the most recent round of charges in mid-September. One of the deaths occured less than a week after the press conference announcing them.
Twenty-two men have now died in Department of Corrections custody in calendar year 2025, the highest figure in recent memory. In addition to the drug deaths, four died by suicide and others died of natural causes.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Valerie Brown doesn’t personally know her two classmates at Western International High School who were detained Thursday morning by federal immigration officials and sent to Texas, but that didn’t stop her from helping organize a press conference that became a rally for bringing the students home.
“I have friends who have told me they are afraid to go to school. You shouldn’t be afraid to come to school,” Brown told Chalkbeat after speaking during the press conference, saying the fear is magnified by rumors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking kids “whether they have papers or not.”
“They’re scared to be outside, to be with their friends. They’re kids.”
The press conference was organized to support the two 16-year-old students, who are cousins and attend Western International High School in Southwest Detroit. Outlier Media and Chalkbeat reported Monday that students were born in Venezuela and arrived in the U.S. in 2023. They were taken into custody along with two of their parents when agents raided their home on the Eastide in search of a different migrant.
Brown and others spoke in front of a backdrop at Detroit’s Clark Park. Dozens of people were there, some of them holding signs and shouting “for shame” whenever a speaker brought up something they thought was particularly egregious. All of them called for the release of the teens and the parents.
Some of the speakers, including Valerie, called on school, city, and state officials to be more involved in ensuring the safety of students who fear moving throughout the community because of immigration actions. Some called on the Detroit school district to have an immigration attorney on retainer to assist students who’ve been detained and to ensure students know their rights.
“Instead of the (students) chilling with their friends, they got to be stuck in a detention center with ICE,” Brown said during her speech. “We don’t even know where they’re going. We don’t even know if they’re going to a country that’s theirs or is even safe for them or even if they have family anymore.”
One of the speakers, attorney George Washington, said ICE agents entered the home while the occupants were sleeping. “Suddenly, ICE appears at the door, busts into the place, and tells them that they’re all being arrested.”
All four who were detained had pending asylum petitions, Washington said.
“We have a tremendous immigration lawyer from Detroit who did everything he could,” to assist the four while they remained in Michigan. But, Washington said, they were sent to Texas “too quick.”
“He’s going to continue representing them and we’re going to get them out,” Washington said.
After the event, Sen. Stephanie Chang, a Democrat from Detroit, issued a statement about the detentions:
“I am standing with Detroit teachers, friends, family and community members of these two students in urging their immediate return home to Michigan,” Chang said. “I understand that they have been following the asylum process and have upcoming immigration court dates. ICE should release them and allow them to proceed with the asylum process.”
Many of the youth attending the event were from Western International, located across the street from Clark Park. Others came from schools such as Southeastern, Cass Technical, and Detroit International Academy for Young Women.
Kenneth Russell, who attends Southeastern, was among the speakers.
“It’s better for us to all be connected than apart,” Russell said.
“It’s awful what’s happening,” said Theo Edwards, who’s attended Western for nearly a month. He was holding a sign that said “People are not illegal,” with the “not” underlined. “It’s scary, especially for those who are Hispanic.”

He is a second-generation member of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, where he serves as business manager of Local 668. He also serves as president of the Vermont AFL-CIO, advocating for workers’ rights in the Green Mountain state.
Recently, the richest person in the world was granted a salary of $1 trillion over 10 years.
Let that sink in. $1,000,000,000,000.


One person will receive ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS per year for 10 years to run a company. One person, already unimaginably wealthy, was handed more money than the total budget of the state of Vermont, not to mention that a trillion dollars is larger than most countries’ GDP.
At the same time of that announcement, tens of thousands of federal employees went to work and didn’t get paid because of the government shutdown. Millions of poor and working-class Americans didn’t receive their SNAP benefits and struggled to feed their families. And health care costs for working people are sky rocketing with no end in sight.
Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives, the leaders we elected to run the government, didn’t meet for over a month. The president, with no sense of irony, threw a Great-Gatsby–themed party, a celebration of excess named after a story that was supposed to warn us about it.
The rich got richer. People went to work and didn’t get paid. Millions went hungry. And somehow, this has become normal.
What is happening in our country?
We used to value work. We believed that if you worked hard, you’d earn enough to live with dignity. One job could support you and your family. Now, too many companies and politicians treat workers as disposable and view the economy not as a shared project, but as a game to be won by a handful of shareholders.
The results are everywhere: record corporate profits, record CEO pay, and record levels of despair among working people. The rich continue to spend, propping up our economy while millions of people look for food. When the system rewards hoarding instead of helping, and speculation instead of service, it’s no wonder faith in the American dream is fading.
It doesn’t have to be this way. We can value labor over luxury, community over greed, and people over profits. But that means demanding more — from our government, from corporations and from ourselves. 
At the Vermont AFL-CIO, we  work every day to support workers throughout the state and raise up their voices. Through the power of collective bargaining and union organizing, working families in the Green Mountain State can restore hope for tomorrow.
Our strength lies in our unity, whether on the picket line, at the bargaining table or in the halls of government. We are one movement fighting for justice for all. We are building a future where every Vermonter earns a fair wage, has a safe workplace and can live with dignity and security. 
Because if we keep rewarding the richest for taking and punishing the rest for working, we won’t just lose our paychecks. We’ll lose our soul as a country.

(Photo by Keith Weller/USDA)Artificial intelligence and robots have potential to boost agricultural production — and their possibilities are only beginning, a University of Florida researcher told the Florida Senate last week.
UF broke ground this month on the Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture at the Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Hillsborough County.
According to Nathan Boyd, a professor at UF studying weed science and associate director of the center, artificial intelligence will provide a 35% boost to agricultural production, including in Florida, by 2030. 
“We’re just seeing the start of what artificial intelligence and robotics can do in agriculture,” Boyd said while presenting to the Senate Committee on Agriculture.
Using AI to target spraying and harvesting crops could allow use of fewer pesticides and streamline processes otherwise done by humans, he said.
“Labor is a critical issue. The reason it’s becoming more of an issue is, number one, we do have aging farm operators — that’s part of it. We also do not have or have a very, very small domestic labor force for agriculture, which means we’re relying on labor outside of our domestic population, and the result of that has been labor shortages. And if you look at population trends here and in other countries, this is going to get worse, not better,” Boyd continued. 
As of May 2024, Florida had 9,640 crop, nursery, and greenhouse workers, the second-most in the United States, behind only California, which has more than 10 times as many workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area had the highest number in the state and 11th most nationwide.
As of April, Florida farmers paid near the bottom of the nation to field crop workers at $15.71 per hour, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Earlier this year, in the thick of legislative discourse about cracking down on illegal immigration, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson predicted the effort would not affect farm help. About two-thirds of crop farmworkers in the U.S. are immigrants, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. At the time, Simpson said H2A visas give permission to “the vast majority” of farmers to hire foreign nationals on a temporary basis.

“We have to come up with a solution of, ‘How are we going to continue to grow the food that we do in Florida, understanding that we feed our country in the winter time? How are we going to continue to do that with fewer people?’ So, here comes the robots,” Boyd said. 
As technology improves, so do yields and quality of products, Boyd said. Technology can monitor plant health and development.
The technology, although often more accessible to larger growers, can be developed for small growers, according to Boyd.  
The Florida Department of Commerce, upon groundbreaking for the center, named agricultural technology as a new target industry. That means the state recognizes it as having a high potential to generate “significant returns on investment through job creation, innovation, and long-term growth.”

Robotic harvesting, a $236 million industry in 2022, is expected to be worth $6.8 billion by 2030, according to Boyd. Agriculture drones are expected to constitute a $18 billion dollar industry in five years, too.
The center at UF will have resources to design and build robots for agriculture, with about 100 employees. In the 2025 state budget, lawmakers dedicated $2.25 million for the center.

Vermont policymakers see the five-year grant, worth an annual $100 million-plus, as a potential lifeline in the face of looming Medicaid spending cuts, though they also caution the funds cannot replace that lost revenue.

The wishlist for achieving a more stable health care system in Vermont is a long and lofty one: By 2031, the Agency of Human Services says it aims to strengthen the rural health care workforce in the state and increase access to timely care in those rural areas, all while increasing quality and reducing cost. 
One big piece of achieving those goals rests in moving more of the health care Vermonters receive outside of hospitals, the agency argues in its latest vision for hospital transformation, made public last week.
In a bid for a five-year federal rural health grant worth at least $500 million to the state, the agency proposes a sweeping range of expenditures, ranging from the broad — like allocations for incentivizing primary care providers to increase appointment access — to the specific — like funding more recovery housing for those with substance use disorders or investing in dialysis and ventilator units in nursing homes, rather than hospitals.

What might become a reality depends in part on grant funding decisions the federal government is expected to make by the end of this year.
The national opportunity became available in September after funding for the program was inserted into the federal budget reconciliation package to win the needed support of rural Senate Republicans concerned about the impacts of Medicaid spending cuts in that bill. 
Since then, health care professionals across Vermont have closely watched how the state might use the grant, to solidify the otherwise eroding foundation of the health care system in the state. 
“It does give us a lifeline if we use it really well,” Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told VTDigger in October, before the state submitted an application.
Still, now that the agency’s application is public, much remains up in the air about how much funding will come to the state and what exactly it will go toward when it does.
The new funding availability comes at a time when the majority of Vermont’s hospitals face serious solvency risks and Vermonters bear some of the highest health care costs in the country. At the same time, the state’s rural populations are overall less healthy than the rest of the state, with higher rates of chronic disease, obesity, opiod-related death and suicide.
Many providers, patients, regulators and lawmakers in the state agree that the system is in dire need of a radical reboot. Some are still waiting for the details of that reboot to become more concrete.
“The proposal is more of a list of priorities than a detailed plan of what Vermont would do with federal funds if or when they arrive,” Alex Garlick, a UVM political science professor who specializes in health care policy but who is not involved in the application process, told VTDigger. 
“The ideas for shoring up the delivery of rural health care are sound, but I’d categorize them as incremental instead of transformational,” he said.
‘A holistic view’
Part of the plan’s high-level scope is because of how the federal government plans to dole out the funding.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they will award $10 billion a year between 2026 and 2030. Each year, half of that will go equally to each approved state — suggesting that each of the 50 eligible U.S. states are expected to get $100 million per year. The remaining $5 billion pot will go to states based on a more competitive grant evaluation criteria. 
Agency staff think it’s likely that Vermont will receive only its share of the half promised to all states, said Julie Mazza Olson, AHS’s director of Medicaid and health systems, who oversaw the application process. The federal agency has already posted its scoring metrics that the state can judge its eligibility against.
Nevertheless, the state proposed a budget for $200 million of spending each year in part to make a bid for the higher amount. But also the state agency can’t be sure which of the proposed priorities the feds will accept as ways to spend the state’s allocation, so Olson says the agency intentionally made the application flexible.
Olson said her agency tried to build upon programs for health system transformation that the state has already set in motion largely through a 2022 law, known as Act 167, a bill focused on shoring up the state’s hospitals. 
That was a practical necessity because the application needed to come together quickly: CMS released the applications in mid-September and gave states until Nov. 5 to submit them. 
“It’s a really really short amount of time to develop a plan and get the kind of input that you want when you’re doing something as complex as this,” Olson said.
Still, while trying to move quickly by building off existing projects, Olson said that the agency also tried to broaden the scope beyond hospital-specific reform. Often receiving care in a hospital is more expensive than getting the same treatment in an outpatient clinic or independent facility.
“If we’re going to have less care in hospitals, we’re going to need more care somewhere else,” Olson said. “There are other providers who we haven’t really engaged with in the same way on transformation.” 
Specifically, the application identifies investments in staff, technology and supplies for nursing homes, home health care, community mental health and substance use clinics, as well as through increased support and training for EMTs and paramedic emergency response teams.
Garlick, the UVM professor, specifically pointed to training programs for licensed nursing assistants and supporting primary care as good ideas for ways to strengthen the delivery of rural health care. 
“There are also outside-the-box considerations, including grants to increase the housing stock available to health care workers, which show the state is taking a holistic view of the problems related to health care finance,” he said.
A far bigger federal challenge  
Health care officials remain clear-eyed about the importance these funds can have in boosting a system in such dire straits. 
“Vermont’s healthcare system, including all provider types, remains under significant financial strain,” Foster, the care board chair, wrote in a Friday email to VTDigger. “We are seeing many service line closures and disruptions to patient care.  Hospitals are expected to continue to experience great financial pressure at a time when Vermonters cannot afford to pay more for healthcare.” 
Foster wrote that he was optimistic that Vermont’s application for the program would garner support, adding that he was encouraged by its recognition of the importance of preventative care and community-based providers. “Vermont has committed to intentional and meaningful health system transformation, and these critical funds would bolster our ability to transition Vermont into a sustainable and modern health system,” he said.
Still, strong headwinds remain against the rural health care system across the country as well as in Vermont. 
The changes to Medicaid enshrined in the big budget reconciliation President Donald Trump signed into law this July could result in a $137 billion loss to rural hospitals over 10 years, an analysis by the health care news organization KFF found. Comparatively, this five-year $50 billion rural health transformation grant, also included in that law, cannot balance the scale.
“The dollars that are available to us are really addressing a different set of concerns than the dollars that we’re losing. This is an opportunity, and we want to use this opportunity, but from a policy perspective it doesn’t make up for [other losses],” Olson said. 
Those losses don’t include the potential drop in income that rural hospitals can expect to come as a result of the loss of some of the federal subsidies for plans purchased on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. Thousands of Vermonters are expected to reduce or entirely drop their insurance due to the increased expense.
The KFF authors also point out another imbalance of this funding opportunity that Vermont officials are also keenly aware of: While the changes to Medicaid would require future congressional action to ever reverse the cuts, this federal funding opportunity is finite. After five years, it is gone.
“It’s one-time money, so we have to think about how we can invest in ways to sustain it or turn things on and off,” Olson said. 
It’s an opportunity, she sees, to strengthen the system at the root, to do things like invest in concrete pieces of equipment — ventilators, mobile care technology — or programs that will have long dividends for the state, like education and training for the health care workforces.
She is wary of seeing it as the catch-all solution for all the challenges the system is facing.  
“The rural health transformation grant is not our entire healthcare system or all the things we’re doing on healthcare reform,” she said. “It’s an opportunity that we want to make the best of, even if it does not solve all of our problems.”

Free.,Trump social media post claims to void Biden orders,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-social-media-post-claims-void-biden-orders,,"President Donald Trump said Friday he will try to reverse any law, pardon or still-in-effect executive order that former President Joe Biden signed with an autopen, though it wasn’t immediately clear how that would work or whether it would be legal. Trump declared in a social media post that any documents Biden signed with the autopen are “hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect.”“I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,” Trump alleged. “Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”The White House press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for the list of documents Trump believes he has the ability to rescind based on the manner they were signed.States Newsroom also asked the Trump administration if officials believe the president would need to sign an executive order in order to implement his social media post. Experts dismissed earlier autopen challenge The post was similar to one Trump published in March when he claimed any pardons Biden signed with the autopen were void, something legal experts said at the time was “absurd” and a “red herring.”Trump brought up his frustration with autopen use again in June when he ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when and why Biden administration staff used an autopen. Trump said during an Oval Office appearance at the time he hadn’t found any evidence Biden aides violated the law.“No, but I've uncovered the human mind,” Trump said. “I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's one of those things, one of those problems. We can't ever allow that to happen to our country.”Biden and spokespeople working for him have repeatedly said he knew what official documents were being signed in his name and rejected claims that White House staff used the autopen without his authorization or knowledge. Biden released a statement in June following the Trump memorandum, saying the investigation “is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.”“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” Biden wrote at the time. “Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.""While presidents have regularly rescinded their predecessors executive orders, usually within their first few days or weeks in office, Congress would very likely need to act in order to alter or eliminate any laws that Biden signed with an autopen. Trump seeking to overturn a law, or part of a law, unilaterally would likely lead to a lawsuit over whether he holds that power. Trump doesn’t cite legal authorityIt also wasn’t immediately clear what legal authority Trump believes he has as president to undo pardons if Biden used an autopen to sign the documents. David Super, a constitutional and administrative law professor at Georgetown University, told States Newsroom in March that “the Constitution does not require signatures for pardons. It simply says the president has the power to pardon.”“So if President Biden wanted to simply verbally tell someone they're pardoned, he could do that. It wouldn't have to be in writing at all,” he said. “Administratively, of course, we want things in writing. It makes things a lot simpler, but there's no constitutional requirement.”Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-28 15:57:31.477217
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-28 20:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT strengthens data protections in wake of federal requests,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/ct-data-protections-ice/,"Federal officials approached CT's third-party vendor, asking for SNAP recipients' personal information. State officials took it as a warning.","Concerned that residents’ locations and schedules could be obtained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, state lawmakers passed a bill this month to prevent public agencies from sharing such personal information.
The bill prohibits state and municipal agencies, including schools, from sharing an individual’s address, hours of work, public agency appointments or “any other information that provides the date, time or place where such individual may be located.”
Scott Gaul, the state’s chief data officer, said he will be working with agencies on procedures that protect the outlined information and how to handle requests for data.
“The underlying intent of the legislation is to make sure people can trust in government and feel that they can interact with state agencies and the benefits that they’re entitled to,” said Gaul.
Since March, the Trump administration has required states to provide “unfettered access” to information like names, birth dates, addresses and Social Security numbers from all state programs that receive federal funding. Connecticut did not comply.
Then, federal officials approached the state’s third-party vendor for SNAP recipients’ personal information.
The vendor turned down the request, but it was a warning to Gaul and others that personal information could be obtained through unexpected — and “aggressive” — means, Gaul said.
Gaul spoke recently at a series of seminars geared at helping nonprofits understand how to protect their clients’ sensitive information when data requests come through the back door.
At one seminar, Eric Giannella, a researcher at Georgetown’s Massive Data Institute, advised nonprofits to provide default answers for sensitive questions and use encryption keys.
But Giannella acknowledged that many of these methods have traditionally only been available to large organizations that have designated technology staff.
For Tabitha Sookdeo, executive director of CT Students for a Dream, it feels like a “Catch-22. You’re trying to protect [your clients’] data, but you really need it for your organization’s function.”
For example, in July, Sookdeo needed to find the parent contact information for a high schooler who was picked up by ICE. Sookdeo needed to have the data on hand but was concerned that if it were obtained by ICE, it would present a risk for her client. 
“We have to become data experts,” she said.
The new legislation protects data held by Connecticut agencies, but it cannot stop federal agencies, such as the IRS, from sharing data with ICE. 
Sookdeo has been fielding questions from young immigrants and their families about whether to pay their taxes this year. For many, “the benefits outweigh the risk, because, for lots of immigration purposes, if you’re filing and you’re in the process of trying to get something, you have to show continuous tax paying activity,” said Sookdeo.
Attorney General William Tong joined a multistate lawsuit in July challenging the Trump administration’s effort to collect SNAP recipients’ personal data. He also joined a lawsuit that blocks HHS from sharing personal information of Medicaid recipients with ICE.
Sookdeo notes that the new legislation does not specifically address reproductive health care, or the sex or gender of a person. Chelsea-Infinity Gonzalez, director of public policy and advocacy at the ACLU, said, “It’s encouraging that the legislature recognized this and took an initial step during the special session.”
While Connecticut has existing shield laws and “best practices” around maintaining demographic data privacy, “something that Connecticut does not have are really holistic privacy policies for the public sector,” said Gaul. “I think this is kind of a step in that direction. But, you know, there is more that could be done on that.”
Democratic control of both the executive and legislative branches has assisted Connecticut’s ability to protect its own data, Gaul said. Last week’s legislation passed largely on party lines, with three Republicans joining the vote to send the bill to Lamont’s desk.
In Vermont, Republican Governor Phil Scott obliged the federal government’s request and handed over the data of SNAP beneficiaries, despite opposition from a Democratic-controlled legislature.
Connecticut has also been impacted by budget cuts to federal data collection.
States rely on the federal government to “set standards” of how data like race and address are collected, Gaul said. The Census homepage went dark one weekend, and the Department of Justice no longer collects data on gender-identity-based hate crimes, raising doubt about the reliability of federal statistical data.
For now, Connecticut will be selective of any cross-state data sharing initiatives, Gaul said. Some initiatives may been a “great idea three years ago,” but not now.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25161836500390-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 15:57:31.477217

About a decade ago, a group of visitors pointed to the photos and asked: Who are they?
When Clyburn explained, the visitors told South Carolina’s longest-serving representative they thought he was the first Black congressman elected in the state. Clyburn told his staff perhaps it was time to write a book about the history of the state’s Black representatives, himself included.

“The First Eight,” which hit shelves Nov. 11, interweaves the achievements and challenges of the state’s Black representatives in post-Civil War 1800s with Clyburn’s own experience during his three decades in Congress, he said.
“People are shocked when I tell them that there were eight African Americans representing South Carolina in Congress before me,” Clyburn told the SC Daily Gazette. “They are absolutely flabbergasted when I tell them at one point South Carolina had five members of the House of Representatives, and four of the five were Black.
“And they are beyond belief when I tell them that there’s 95 years between number eight on this list and yours truly, number nine.”
Rep. George Washington Murray left office in 1897. Clyburn was first elected in 1992.
For years, South Carolina’s only Democratic congressman worked on the stories strictly as historical accounts. That changed with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by a mob attempting to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the next president. The attack only delayed certification by hours.
Clyburn’s mind went back to the 1876 governor’s race, when the paramilitary Red Shirts who supported Confederate Gen. Wade Hampton used violence and intimidation to keep Black men from voting. Hampton’s victory brought the end of Reconstruction, the post-Civil War period of federal control in the South, as President Rutherford B. Hayes — needing the electoral votes of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana to take office — agreed to withdraw federal troops.
Clyburn decided to draw parallels from the experiences of his predecessors to current events.
“What I decided was, rather than just inform, it needed to be sort of constructive,” Clyburn said.
Nation’s first
Clyburn’s book begins with Joseph Rainey, the nation’s first Black congressman, who represented South Carolina from 1870 to 1879.
Though Rainey was born a slave in Georgetown, his father bought the family’s freedom when he was 10 and moved to Charleston, where he was secretly tutored and worked as a barber at the Mills House hotel. After the Civil War, Rainey helped found the state Republican Party and was a delegate to the majority-Black convention that wrote South Carolina’s 1868 constitution that allowed the state to rejoin the Union.
Rainey won a special election two years later to represent South Carolina’s 1st District and was reelected four times, becoming the longest-serving Black congressman during Reconstruction. In 2022, a room in the U.S. Capitol was renamed in his honor.
Clyburn’s narrative tells the stories behind each of the eight men.
Among them are Robert Smalls, who Clyburn called “the most consequential South Carolinian who ever lived.”
Also born into slavery, Smalls hijacked the Confederate supply ship he worked on in 1862 and steered his family and fellow enslaved crew members to freedom. Piloting past Confederate forts, he delivered the ammunition-laden Planter to the Union.
Smalls then became the first Black man to pilot ships for the U.S. Navy.
He too helped write the state’s 1868 constitution, which undid the Black Codes and promised free education for all children and voting rights to all men. His five terms in the U.S. House are especially remarkable when considering they followed the end of Reconstruction and the reversal of rights for freed slaves.
He also attended the post-Reconstruction rewriting of the state constitution. As a Black delegate to the mostly white 1895 convention, Smalls pleaded unsuccessfully for a constitution guaranteeing “fair and honest” elections, even while recognizing the purpose of the convention was to disenfranchise Black voters.
A statue of him is in the works, for placement on the Statehouse grounds.
Although Smalls’ story stands out for its heroism, the most interesting story to Clyburn is that of Thomas Miller, the state’s seventh Black congressman.
A state legislator before and after his stint in Congress, Miller briefly held the seat previously represented by Smalls after successfully contesting the results of the 1888 election on the grounds that Black voters were prevented from casting ballots. A vote by Congress didn’t seat him until September 1890. He lost re-election later that year in another disputed contest.
Miller was raised by two freed slaves, Richard and Mary Ferrebee Miller. But he had fair skin and claimed both of his biological parents were white. Whether that’s true is unknown.


Where to see Clyburn talk about the book

Regardless, Miller presented himself as African American. Born in 1849, Miller moved to Charleston with his parents two years later and attended schools for free Black children. During the Civil War, he delivered newspapers between Charleston and Savannah, where he spent two weeks in a Union prison camp. He completed his education after the war, graduating from Hudson School in north of New York City and Lincoln University, still a historically Black college in Pennsylvania.
In 1872, he returned to South Carolina and earned a law degree from the then-integrated University of South Carolina before the end of Reconstruction closed it to Black students.
Like Smalls, Miller was a delegate to the mostly white 1895 convention that rewrote the state constitution. He went on to found what became South Carolina State University, Clyburn’s alma mater, and served as its first president from 1896 to 1911.
People don’t know these stories as well as they should, Clyburn said. That much is clear in how often people tell him they think he is South Carolina’s first Black representative, he said.
He also often sees misunderstandings about what it meant to be a Republican or a Democrat in his predecessors’ era, he said. All eight who came before him were Republicans.
Through telling the men’s stories, he hopes to correct the record and leave people better informed.
“I’m doing my part with this book to try to fill a gap in the education of people in South Carolina,” Clyburn said.
Clyburn continues to see echoes of the past in the news. Recently, that’s been through calls to redraw congressional maps across the country in efforts to pick up more seats for a single party, he said.
Voting lines must be redrawn after every census to account for population changes, since each U.S. House member is supposed to represent roughly the same number of people. But this year’s changes are occurring mid-way through the normal decennial process.
South Carolina has made no moves toward an interim redrawing, especially since a court fight over the state’s most recent maps ended just two months ago.
Some ultra-conservative members of the Freedom Caucus have called for redrawing the maps to potentially replace Clyburn with a Republican in the 6th District, which was gerrymandered after the 1990 census to create a majority-Black district. Clyburn has represented it ever since. But those proposals are unlikely to gain any traction.
Still, Clyburn likened the nationwide attempts to alter voting maps to the 1895 rewrite of the state constitution that ushered in the Jim Crow-era South.
In addition to South Carolina lacking a single Black congressman for nearly a century, the state Legislature had no Black representation for seven decades. In 1970, voters elected James Felder, Herbert Fielding, and I.S. Leevy Johnson to the state House. The number of Black legislators jumped to 13 four years later, after a lawsuit forced the state to redraw voting lines.
“Are we going to learn from the lessons that I tried to share in this book about what happened in 1877 (at the end of Reconstruction)?” Clyburn said. “Or are we going to sit idly by and allow history to repeat itself?”
Despite its warnings about letting history repeat itself, the book ends on a hopeful note, he said.
In the epilogue, Clyburn points to South Carolina’s less popular official motto: “prepared in mind and resources.” The saying reminds him of one of his favorite Bible verses, Hebrews 11:1: “Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.”
“What that says to me is that just because you do not see success doesn’t mean you should not prepare for success,” Clyburn said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Clyburn-92NY.jpg,,,2025-11-28 14:57:19.368099

The U.S. State Department confirmed the release of Mohammed Ibrahim in a statement sent to the Phoenix on Friday. “The Department of State welcomes the news […],"Screenshot of video taken of Mohammed Ibrahim on Thursday (from CAIR-Florida press release)A 16-year-old Palestinian American youth from Brevard County was released from an Israeli prison Thursday after being held since February on allegations of rock throwing in the West Bank.
The U.S. State Department confirmed the release of Mohammed Ibrahim in a statement sent to the Phoenix on Friday.
“The Department of State welcomes the news of the release of U.S. citizen Mohammed Ibrahim from detention in Israel,” said a State Department spokesperson, who added that “the Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens.”
During a press conference in Tampa in August, an attorney for his family said that Ibrahim had originally been held in Israel’s Megiddo Prison, where they said he had contracted scabies but been denied medical treatment. Family members said he had lost more than 25 pounds since his detention began.
In a press release issued Thursday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)’s Florida chapter, the organization said it had shared a sworn statement with members of Congress detailing how Ibrahim had been “beaten with rifle butts, starved, denied medical care, and threatened by masked interrogators who coerced him into a false confession under fear of further violence.”
CAIR and CAIR-Florida are calling on the State Department, members of Congress, faith leaders, and civil-society organizations to press for a full public accounting of Ibrahim’s treatment and “concrete consequences for the Israeli officials responsible.”
NPR reported earlier this month Ibrahim had been charged with two counts of stone-throwing at a moving vehicle, which could have resulted in a penalty of 20 years. A military court had been scheduled to hear his case on Dec. 15.
The Guardian reported earlier this month that the Israeli embassy in Washington had been circulating a letter in the nation’s capital defending its nine-month detention of Ibrahim and the medical treatment. The publication said the letter had not mentioned his dramatic weight loss or that his family had virtually no contact with him since he was arrested in February for allegedly throwing “rocks at vehicles belonging to Israeli citizens” or a confession after being interrogated the night of his arrest.
In October, 27 members of Congress, including Florida Democratic U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor and Maxwell Frost, sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee expressing “grave concerns” over Ibrahim’s treatment, and called on them to press the Israeli government to release him.
Maryland U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen also signed that letter.
“I was relieved to hear from his family today and to know that he’s safe and where he belongs — with his family,” Van Hollen said on X on Thursday.
The letter noted that Ibrahim was the cousin of Sayfollah Mussalet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Tampa who was reportedly beaten to death by Israel settlers in July, with no one yet held in account regarding his killing.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0-4-1024x509.png,,,2025-11-28 14:57:19.368099

You can read more about the section here.

A few weeks ago in a conversation with a Mississippi legislator, I, as superintendent of the Oxford School District, was challenged to stop simply pushing back on school choice proposals and instead offer solutions.
The question was fair: If not school choice, then what? That challenge stayed with me, because I believe we can’t just oppose ideas. We must offer better ones. The truth is, there are smarter, more impactful choices we can make in education – choices that would transform Mississippi’s future without dismantling the public school system that serves the vast majority of our children.
As Mississippi continues to debate school choice, it’s time we ask a deeper question: What kind of choice actually creates opportunity for our children and moves our state forward?
For years, the conversation around education reform in Mississippi has centered on competition – where students go to school and which school gets the funding. But real improvement doesn’t come from competition. It comes from collaboration, consistency and a shared vision of success.

The truth is, Mississippi doesn’t need more schools to choose from. Instead, it needs more opportunities within the schools it already has.
Mississippi currently ranks among the lowest in the nation in labor-force participation, with barely half of working-age adults engaged in the workforce. It’s not that we lack jobs. It’s that too many Mississippians finish high school or even college without a clear path into meaningful work. As a result, we struggle to retain our own talent, fill high-wage jobs and sustain economic growth. 
If we want to strengthen our economy and our communities, we need to redefine what “choice” means. True educational choice shouldn’t be about choosing between public and private schools. It should be about creating more high-quality pathways within public education –  from the earliest years of a child’s life through the transition into adulthood. Instead of dividing our resources, let’s align them by investing in the full continuum of learning that starts in preschool and ends with a productive career.
The first and most transformative choice Mississippi can make is to invest in early childhood education for all families. Research consistently shows that the earliest years of life are the most critical for brain development.
During this time, children form the language, social and problem-solving skills that determine how they learn for the rest of their lives.
Yet in our state, access to high-quality early learning remains deeply unequal. Some communities are fortunate to have public or private preschool options, while others have long waiting lists or no programs at all. Many parents simply cannot afford tuition, leaving too many children behind before they even begin kindergarten. 
When children start school already behind, it can take years to close that gap. Many never do. We see this in literacy rates, in third-grade reading outcomes and later in high school graduation data. The gaps that emerge early in life become barriers to achievement, employment and self-sufficiency. The good news is that these gaps are preventable with a bold, statewide commitment to early learning. 
Universal access to early childhood education would be a game-changer for Mississippi. Children who attend strong preschool programs are more likely to read proficiently by third grade, graduate from high school and attend college or technical programs. They are also less likely to need special education services or repeat grades. The benefits ripple outward: Families gain stability, parents are more able to participate in the  workforce and communities thrive. 
High-quality early learning doesn’t just shape individual children. It strengthens the entire economy. When parents can rely on safe, affordable childcare, workforce participation increases. Businesses benefit from a more reliable labor supply.
Over time, the return on investment is remarkable. For every dollar spent on early childhood education, economists estimate a return of seven to 10 dollars in reduced costs for remediation, welfare and incarceration, and increased earnings and tax revenue. 
Imagine what it would mean for Mississippi if every 3- and 4-year-old had access to a strong early learning environment – one that emphasizes language development, curiosity and relationships with caring adults. Imagine what it would mean if every parent could go to work knowing their child was learning in a safe, enriching setting. Imagine what it would mean if kindergarten teachers welcomed classes of students who were all ready to learn, not already behind. 
The states that lead the nation in education and workforce development have already made this investment. It’s time Mississippi does the same. If we truly want to transform our schools. our economy and our future, it must start with the youngest learners.
The second critical choice Mississippi must make is to build a modern system of educational pathways that extend from high school into college, career and beyond. 
Around the world, countries that have aligned education and workforce systems are preparing students not only to graduate, but to thrive.
In one nation, nearly two-thirds of students participate in paid apprenticeships that blend classroom learning with real world experience. In another, students begin exploring careers in middle school and progress through flexible learning tracks that connect seamlessly to college or technical training. In a third, every student graduates with credentials recognized by both employers and universities, ensuring that no one’s future is limited by a single choice at age 16 or 18. 
These systems treat education as a shared responsibility between schools, employers and government. They prioritize flexibility, allowing students to shift between academic and applied learning. And they value all forms of success equally – whether a student earns a university degree, completes an apprenticeship or starts a business. 
Mississippi can design its own version of this model. Imagine a state where every student has access to three respected pathways: 
• A college-ready pathway for those pursuing four-year degrees. 
• An applied-learning pathway that combines academics with paid, hands-on work experiences leading to a certification or associate degree. 
• A direct-to-career pathway that connects students to high-wage industries like health care, advanced manufacturing or information technology. 
Each of these routes would be flexible and interconnected, allowing students to move between them as their goals evolve. Every pathway would be designed in partnership with local employers to ensure students graduate with both knowledge and experience. And every pathway would be valued equally with no stigma and no hierarchy – just options that recognize that success comes in many forms. 
This approach is already working in parts of Mississippi. Districts that have developed strong career academies or early college programs are seeing higher graduation rates, better attendance and stronger engagement. Scaling this across the state would require a coordinated effort among K-12 districts, community colleges, universities and industry, but it’s possible. In fact, it’s essential.
Both of these investments – early childhood education and career pathways – represent the smarter kind of school choice Mississippi needs. They focus not on competition but on capacity. They don’t pit schools against each other. They unite them around the shared goals of preparing every child to contribute to their community and reach their full potential. 
If Mississippi is serious about improving its economy, reducing poverty and retaining  homegrown talent, these are the choices that matter most.
Let’s choose to invest early, ensuring every child begins school ready to learn. Let’s choose to build pathways that prepare every graduate for college, career and life. Let’s choose collaboration over  competition, opportunity over ideology and a future where every Mississippi child has a path to success from cradle to career. 
That’s the kind of “school choice” worth fighting for – one that truly changes lives.

Many of the state’s fishing spots are open in the winter, though specific regulations on what can be taken when, what bait can be used and which places have seasonal closures is always something to bear in mind. 
Checking both ice conditions and Montana’s 2025-26 fishing regulations is a good idea before getting out on the ice. FWP suggests fishing during the day when fish are most active, and that people might have some luck around dams. Fish change their behavior in the winter, often moving to areas with less temperature variance. They also tend to slow down and look for areas that are more oxygenated.
“The most popular winter fly fishing rivers are typically tailwaters – those stretches below a dam,” Adam Strainer, who heads FWP’s fisheries division, said in a release.
The agency recommends never to ice fish alone, wear an extra layer under waders, consider using a wading staff and to avoid flowing water above your knees.
Ice should be at least 4 to 6 inches deep, avoid open water and keep a sharp eye out for holes left by other people. Spreading out in larger groups is also generally recommended.
Ice fishing can be dangerous, especially when it comes to burns — a 2016 National Institute of Health study found that about 38% of fishing injuries happen in January. However, the study found that thermal injuries are actually more common than hypothermia.
Alcohol was also mentioned in the study.
“Intoxication was reported twice as often in the narrative of ice-fishing injuries compared to traditional fishing injuries warranting further investigation,” the study reads.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-11.06.12-AM.png,,,2025-11-28 13:56:54.094944

The federal funding for LIHEAP, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes, has been held up during the beginning of the cold-weather season because of the federal government shutdown, which ended Nov. 12.
“This release of LIHEAP funding is essential and long overdue,” Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, said in a statement. “Families can finally begin receiving the support they need to keep the heat on as winter begins.”
States typically receive their allocations at the beginning of November.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, has not yet issued a formal public announcement about resumption of the funding. After the federal shutdown ended, HHS said one of its agencies would “work swiftly to administer annual awards,” blaming the delay on congressional Democrats.
Wolfe said state agencies told his organization they’ve received award letters from HHS, enabling them to begin distributing assistance to households.
A message was left seeking comment with HHS.
On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. House members sent a letter to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to release the LIHEAP funds by Nov. 30. Given the heating season has already started in many parts of the U.S., they said “there is no time to waste,” especially for households that use home heating oil or propane. Those fuels typically aren’t affected by state moratoriums on utility shutoffs during the winter months.
Roughly 68% of LIHEAP households also receive SNAP food benefits. Wolfe said delays in both programs during the shutdown “put many households in an even more precarious situation than usual.” While Friday’s funding release is welcome news, he said the need for assistance “remains enormous,” especially given rising energy prices. He noted that arrearages remain near record highs.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25301782677114-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 13:56:54.094944

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Des Moines Area Community College President Rob Denson prepares to step away from the role — and the campus community he’s spent more than two decades serving — he said he’s working to make sure the college, ongoing projects and its new leaders are in the best place they can be.
After 22 years leading DMACC and more than 40 years in higher education, Denson will retire at the end of the year, with interim president Liang Chee Wee set to take over until a permanent president is found. Looking back on his career at the community college, Denson said he has no regrets.
“We’ve got a great organization. We’ve got enough facilities to handle everybody in central Iowa or be available to everybody in central Iowa. I think the operation is pretty good. We’ve got a very strong team, a leadership team that’s passionate about what they do,” Denson said. “But other than that, you know, I think I’m going to feel like I’ve done enough.”

A couple of capital projects currently in progress are still itching at him, however, namely new construction for the dental hygiene and assistance programs and industrial trade facilities. Construction crews have already broken ground on both of the projects, Denson said, but he was hoping to see at least $2 million raised by the college for both projects before he retires.
The community college foundation’s lack of an executive director has slowed fundraising, he said, and a search to fill the position didn’t see success. With Denson’s retirement coming up, he said the plan was to wait until a new president is in office to start the search up again. But with the presidential search itself delayed due to candidates withdrawing, he’s now spoken with Wee about trying to hire for the job instead of holding back.
“Since we’re not going to a permanent president probably till next June or July, we’re going to go ahead and fill that position, because I want to get that person up and running as far as raising that money,” Denson said.
In his time as president, Denson said he’s seen new technologies change the direction of higher education, from cell phones to artificial intelligence. DMACC is already offering both noncredit and credit courses in AI and related technologies, having been the first college in Iowa to partner with Intel to create curriculum and resources on the subject.
Employers Denson has spoken to in his role as president have said they’re looking for hires with skills and competency in AI tools. Denson predicted that AI training will be incorporated into “every program going forward,” whether that’s at community colleges, four-year universities or training offered directly by companies.
“I think the technology that we have and the ability to support students is really exciting, and this means that we can help them get through easier,” Denson said. “And there is so much support in Iowa.”
A more recent sign of change Denson said he’s not quite so hopeful about is the possibility of community colleges offering four-year degrees, something the association Community Colleges for Iowa explored at the prompting of Iowa lawmakers.
Community colleges already have amazing partnerships with Iowa’s four-year institutions, Denson said, and there aren’t any crises of capacity causing the need for such a shift in programming. When he worked in higher education in Florida, Denson said something similar occurred, but that was because universities simply didn’t have the room for all of the students.
“I think the Legislature is pretty smart, and I think they’ll work with the four-year institutions, and with us, and if there’s a gap there somewhere that we can fill, we’re happy to do that,” Denson said. “We do it all the time, but a blanket bachelor degree authority is probably not something that I would be excited about.”
Nearly two years after breaking the record to become DMACC’s longest-serving president, Denson’s favorite part about his job has now become the thing he will miss the most — graduation.
Seeing all of the students and families come out to celebrate such an important milestone as graduation, especially as more than one-third of DMACC students are low-income and more than half are first-generation, has been the highlight of his career, Denson said. He’ll miss the students, as well as the faculty, staff and leadership he has worked with for so long.
“Then again, you know, I’m not going to be lonely,” Denson said. “I’ve got plenty to do.”

(Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Detroit Lions tight end Sam LaPorta and his wife, Callie LaPorta, sent a letter earlier this month to state legislators in support of “Queenie’s Law,” a bill that seeks to ban all experimentation on dogs in Michigan public institutions. 
The bill was introduced in the state Senate by Sen. Paul Wojno (D-Warren) and in the House by Rep. Joe Aragona (R-Clinton Twp.) in March. The legislation sits in committee in both chambers, though in late October it moved out of the House Committee on Regulatory Reform to the House Committee on Rules.
“Dogs used in labs are no different than our incredible rescue pup Bonnie,” the letter from the LaPortas states, quoted in a press release circulated by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.
The group added that the couple is thankful that science is moving away from dog experimentation.
The letter urged House Speaker Matt Hall and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks to prioritize and advance the legislation, which is named after a dog that died after being used in experiments at Wayne State University. 
“Michigan’s dogs are lucky to have Sam and Callie on their side,” said Ryan Merkley, director of research advocacy for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which worked with the LaPortas on the letter. “Taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill for painful, dead-end dog experiments.”
Other celebrities have also expressed support for the legislation, including actors Lily Tomlin and Ernie Hudson, who appeared in a TV ad in support of the bill.

Carnegie Mellon University annually attracts thousands of students from more than 150 nations with its highly ranked degree programs and abundant research opportunities. But this year, amid geopolitical tensions and tightening federal immigration policy, those numbers edged down.
Compared to last fall, there are currently 223 fewer students enrolled from China and 272 fewer students from India, for instance. That’s a dip of 7% and 15% respectively. A spokesperson for CMU acknowledged that international enrollment is “down in undergraduate and graduate programs,” but said that this decline is “smaller than that experienced by many other institutions.”

In 2020, U.S. universities experienced a steep drop in international enrollment as COVID-19 swept the globe, but numbers quickly rebounded. Now, international enrollment is facing new pressure from a changing U.S. immigration system.
Some U.S. policymakers are concerned about the perceived threat of international students, particularly Chinese students in STEM fields. And increasingly feverish language on the strategic rivalry between the U.S. and China — some of which has been heard on CMU’s campus this year — could also dent future international enrollment.
“I have international grad students who are scared and freaked out right now, and don’t feel welcome in this country,” said Carrie McDonough, a professor of chemistry at CMU.

In the 2023-2024 academic year, U.S. universities enrolled more than 1.1 million foreign students. While nationwide enrollment figures for the 2025-26 academic year are not yet available, other metrics are.
For instance, data from the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office show that 19% fewer international students entered the U.S. in August 2025 than during the same month last year. In Pennsylvania, the number of visas issued to Chinese and Indian students has dropped by 6% and 4% respectively, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) database.

Restrictions on international students could also hinder U.S. innovation, as CMU President Farnam Jahanian noted at a July AI summit on the campus. He said then that “we … need to have an immigration policy that allows us to recruit the best and the brightest to come to this country,” and pointed to data indicating that 90% of CMU’s international .”
 The China scare and visa insecurity

Contrary to Jahanian’s recommendations, many U.S. policymakers are seeking to limit international enrollment due to security and economic concerns.
On March 19, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent a letter to CMU and five other universities urging them to curtail their enrollment of Chinese students due to a fear of espionage and the subsequent loss of U.S. technological supremacy. “As China aggressively pursues dominance in strategic industries, the unchecked enrollment of Chinese nationals in American institutions risks facilitating the technological transfers that strengthen Beijing’s military and economic competitiveness at our nation’s expense,” the letter said.
In late March, the State Department followed up by revoking hundreds of student visas across the country, sometimes without warning, claiming the recipients were suspected of taking part in “activities that are counter … to our national interest.” Then in May, visa interviews were paused for three weeks to expand the vetting process, limiting the number of foreign students who could be admitted this semester.

According to McDonough, once the U.S. government showed its willingness to swiftly revoke visas, many international students stopped voicing their political beliefs around campus. “A lot of people feel really scared about saying anything that might be construed as un-American.”
For many, a student visa is the first step toward permanent residence. Research by the National Science Foundation shows that 73% of foreign PhD recipients who study science or engineering in the U.S. remain after graduation, while, according to a separate study by the Economic Innovation Group, only 17% of bachelor’s recipients stay.
 ‘There’s really no incentive to coming here’

CMU has not been spared from visa revocations.
On April 7, Jahanian notified students and faculty that “two current CMU students and five recent graduates had lost their visa status.” The students were given no reason for the revocations, although one who came forward with their story suggested it could be related to an expunged DUI case from 2023.
Six of the seven individuals soon had their visa status restored, but the move sent a chill through the international community. In the words of a Chinese-born graduate student who spoke with Public Source but asked to remain anonymous, the message was: “America don’t welcome you, you can come here to study, but be prepared to leave sooner or later.”
For those seeking longer-term U.S. residence through a work visa, the outlook is no more promising. In September, the administration introduced a $100,000 fee per H-1B visa, likely limiting the number of foreign workers that U.S. companies are able to hire. Public Source spoke with two Chinese graduate students at CMU who expressed that their plans to work in the U.S. after graduation may be thwarted by this new fee.
“I think we are at the peace before the storm,” one said. “What is now in contention is the policy position, the idea that America is a country that welcomes foreign talent.”
Korawich Kavee, a Thailand native and PhD student in CMU’s College of Engineering said even highly ranked American schools could struggle to attract foreign students like him if the U.S. keeps to its current path.

“Basic safety concerns, how is it going to work in terms of the visa, or in general the cost of living” are likely to make the U.S. less appealing for prospective students in Asia. “People can go to Canada, people can go to the UK, people can go to Australia,” he pointed out.
This changing visa policy doesn’t pose an immediate problem for Kavee, who will return to Thailand after graduation, but it does have “a strong impact on those who are thinking of coming to the U.S.,” he said.
A decline in international students could hit CMU hard. According to a dashboard maintained by the university, roughly 40% of CMU students and 14% of faculty have been foreign born since it began collecting data in 2021. The school’s primacy in fields like computer science and AI rely heavily on its ability to attract, as Jahanian put it, the “best and brightest.”
 ‘Our war with the communist Chinese’

On July 15, CMU took center stage as host to U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Energy and Innovation Summit. The event brought together leaders of industry, academia and government to discuss the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence.
McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, took the opportunity to announce that $90 billion of investments will come to the state to develop AI data centers powered by natural gas. He promised that “tens of thousands of jobs” will come to Pennsylvania if the region embraces the “AI revolution.”
Many speakers, though, raised concerns about a looming AI race with China, framing it as a matter of national security.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said that “losing the AI arms race” was one of the “existential threats” facing the United States. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright compared the current situation to World War II, claiming that “AI is our second Manhattan Project.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei spoke about the ability of AI “to find the needle in a haystack, the next September 11 … The better our AI can be, the better we will be able to contend with what our adversaries are able to do.”

Throughout the discussion of threats and adversaries, China was repeatedly singled out as the primary concern.
“If the United States does not lead this revolution on our own terms we will hand control of our infrastructure, our data, our leadership and our way of life to the Chinese Communist Party,” said McCormick. Gov. Josh Shapiro echoed this sentiment. “We do not want China to beat us in the AI race.”
Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick alleged that opposition to the AI revolution based on environmental concerns may be the result of Chinese manipulation. “The number one investor in the environmental narrative is China,” he claimed. “China … is trying to get us to close a coal plant a week.”
Some speakers were even more hawkish.
Rick Perry, former secretary of energy and former governor of Texas, praised President Donald Trump for acknowledging the “war that we’re in, and our war with the communist Chinese. That’s what this is all about, don’t get confused.”
Some experts on U.S.-China relations caution against such a blanket assumption of hostility.
“I worry about the feedback loop of fear and escalation, which I think can quickly spiral out of control,” said Kyle Chan, a researcher on industrial policy for the RAND institute and a post-doctoral researcher at Princeton University, in an interview with Public Source. Chan is currently writing a book about China’s tech-industrial policy. “I think words matter here a lot.”
He expressed hope for a more productive technological competition between the two nations, particularly in the field of AI, but he points out that “uncertainty over visa and immigration policies, and targeted attacks on some of the country’s most prestigious universities have sent a chill among foreign researchers in the U.S.”

Illah Nourbakhsh, a robotics professor at CMU and executive director of the Pittsburgh-based Center for Shared Prosperity, pointed out how a political environment that fails to welcome foreign talent may also hinder innovation. “The foreign and national students in our country are all outstanding. If we fail to encourage one group to innovate here, then we lose the chance of their innovations here.”
Nourbakhsh said the current climate reminds him of the first Trump administration, when “we started seeing more and more of our excellent students think about, ‘Should I set up that startup company here? Get a job at a university here? Or should I go to Europe? Or should I go back to a developing country where I come from perhaps, where the opportunities are sparser but I know I’ll be welcome?’”

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she believes troops from West Virginia should remain in the city only on a voluntary basis.
Capito’s statement to reporters came after President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard members be sent to the city in the wake of the shooting on Wednesday. About 150 members of the West Virginia National Guard are still in D.C., and have been deployed there on a voluntary basis since about Nov. 15.
“I like that idea — for West Virginians to be in a voluntary status. We’ve certainly served our time over in DC,” Capito said. “… I don’t know where [Trump] is going to draw his 500 extra guardsmen from. I think West Virginia should stay on a voluntary basis, and that will be up to the governor.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Morrisey originally sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. in August, at the request of the Trump administration.
Trump’s order to increase military presence in D.C. came after two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot in a targeted attack blocks from the White House on Wednesday.

West Virginia National Guard member U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died on Thursday evening, according to officials. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained hospitalized in critical condition on Friday morning, according to a news release from Morrisey’s office.
In an interview with CNN’s Sarah Sidner on Friday morning, Morrisey said he was “supportive” of keeping West Virginia National Guard members who volunteer in D.C. He did not indicate whether more troops would be sent from the state, but said he agreed with Trump’s move to bring more military into the U.S. Capital. It would be wrong, he continued, to pull the National Guard out after the recent attack.
“The last thing in the world we should do is turn around and reverse course and let the bad guys, the evil-doers win,” Morrisey said. “… We cannot turn around and give in to them. We have to send a clear message that if you’re going to mess with our troops, you’re going to pay the price.”
The suspect was shot during the incident and taken into custody. On Thursday, federal law enforcement officials searched the home of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan refugee who worked with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Lakanwal allegedly drove across the country from Washington state to D.C. to target the troops, officials said.
Lakanwal is currently facing a murder charge as well as three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. 
In the wake of the shooting, Trump and other federal officials have vowed to crackdown on immigration. On Wednesday evening, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said that all applications from Afghan nationals were being put on pause.
On Friday, Capito said she was “concerned” about the immigration process and the policies that allowed Lakanwal to come to the United States.
“I mean, what kind of vetting processes do we have? Are they thorough?” Capito questioned. “… I think that this is a sad way to point out that we don’t have good and accurate information [on our different immigration processes] that we need to get. We need to get more granular. I think that’s why the President put a halt on a lot of this, so that we can evaluate our processes.”

Pictured here is a deer in Ashworth Park in Des Moines on March 10, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is seeking feedback on its 25-year wildlife action plan, which must be reviewed every 10 years per federal law. 
The action plan, according to DNR, is a strategy for how the department will conserve wildlife in the state. It was last updated and reviewed in 2015, but was initially approved in 2006. 
A draft version of the 2025 update to the plan is available for review on the DNR’s website and public comments will be accepted on the plan through Dec. 5. 
The wildlife plan includes an overview of wildlife and conservation in the state, species of greatest concern, research, conservation priorities, a cost-benefit analysis and more.

The 2025 draft chapters have updates of wildlife statistics. For example, public conservation lands accounted for 1.7% of land area in the state in 2004, 2.48% in 2015 and 2.5% this year. 
The new version also updates the species of greatest conservation need in Iowa. Subcommittees of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan working group evaluated 1,601 species and determined there were 799 species of greatest conservation need. The 2025 list included bumble bees, moths and plants that were previously not considered. 
The initial plan outlined six “vision elements,” with a goal of Iowa recognizing these visions at the end of the 25-year plan, or in 2030. 
The 2025 draft version includes “implementation highlights” of the six vision elements. Listed below are the six vision elements, followed by DNR’s interpretation of how the visions have been implemented over the past 20 years. 
The visions express hope that by 2030, Iowa will have: 
“Viable wildlife populations” that are “compatible” with modern landscapes and human tolerance. 
Inventories and monitoring programs in the state show that some species, like the Olympia marble butterfly and the starhead topminnow were spotted in Iowa after decades of absence. Some reintroduction programs for species like peregrine falcons, trumpeter swans and osprey, have been “highly successful” in the state, as have citizen scientist monitoring programs. 


Comments on the plan maybe submitted: 
via email to Katy.Fullin@dnr.iowa.gov
or by mail to Katy Fullin,
Iowa DNR, 6200 Park Ave., Ste 200, Des Moines, IA 50321.
Comments are due by Dec. 5, 2025.


“Healthy ecosystems” incorporating “diverse, native” habitats that can sustain wildlife populations.
The state has improved bird conservation areas, led stream restoration projects for freshwater mussels, “enhanced and expanded” native prairies for butterflies and mapped species of greatest conservation need.
Communities that are developed with “adaptive ecological management principles.” 
The department employs land management plans that try to “recreate prairie ecosystems” which once comprised more than 80% of Iowa’s landscape. The chapter said restoring native ecosystems for specific species is difficult with “much of the landscape being used for agriculture.” The department also works to maintain the native landscapes by controlling invasive species.  
More Iowans who participate in “wildlife-associated recreation.” 
DNR continues to expand wildlife-associated recreation opportunities by maintaining access to public land and other programming, including a recent effort to engage birding communities in the state. 
Iowans who respect wildlife and advocate for the conservation of wildlife and habitats.
DNR works to provide outdoor recreation opportunities for Iowans. Part of this includes the department’s online atlases for public and private hunting lands.
“Stable, permanent funding” for the management of wildlife, at a level “adequate to achieve the visions” laid out in the plan. 
The chapter said “funding has never been dedicated to wildlife conservation at a level adequate to achieve plan goals,” but partnerships, like the DNR license plates and the Chickadee Checkoff  have enabled some larger-scale projects. 
The 2025 draft also calls for a marketing campaign to persuade Iowans, lawmakers and other leaders to fund the plan. 
According to the cost-benefit analysis included in the plan, implementation of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan would cost about $165 million annually. This funding would allow the department to increase the amount of permanently protected acres in Iowa to 4% and continue habitat protection, management, survey and research activities.
Under that estimate, annual funding is $127 million short, according to the 2025 draft plan. 
The latest version of the plan said the original action plan, with its goal of permanent protection for 4% of Iowa’s land, required an annual rate – via conservation easements and land acquisitions – of 31,600 acres per year. The actual rate has been between 8,350 to 13,934 acres annually. If the current rate of land protection continues, the 4% goal would be achievable in 2055, but not 2030. 
The plan said the cost of land and “varied” federal funding, has impacted the state’s ability to protect land. 
2023 figures included in the 2025 draft of the plan found the outdoor recreation sector had more than $2.19 billion in wages over 46,000 jobs. Outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, target shooting and wildlife watching contributed nearly $2 billion in economic development in 2024. 
The draft plan said the “conclusion is clear” that conservation is a “solid investment for Iowa.”
“As implementation of the Iowa Wildlife Action Plan continues, more benefits will be seen across the state for wildlife as well as for the people who enjoy outdoor recreation and who value wildlife and wild spaces,” the 2025 draft said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-28 17:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Qué saber sobre las leyes de CT relacionadas con las interacciones con ICE,Christina Lee,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/ct-leyes-ice-interacciones/,CT modificó las leyes que rigen la interacción de funcionarios locales con los agentes del ICE y limita las actividades del ICE en el estado.,"Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Read this story in English.
La legislatura de Connecticut modificó recientemente las leyes que rigen la interacción de los funcionarios locales y estatales con los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de EE. UU. (ICE) y limita las actividades de los agentes de ICE en el estado. Las modificaciones a la ley estatal se realizaron en respuesta a las preocupaciones de los residentes sobre la política federal de inmigración. Divididos por partidos, los Demócratas estatales han trabajado para abordar las afirmaciones de los inmigrantes de que viven con miedo.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre las actividades de ICE en Connecticut.
¿Qué cambios se implementaron en la última legislación estatal?
En la sesión especial de noviembre, los legisladores estatales aprobaron el Proyecto de Ley 8004 de la Cámara de Representantes, que incluye secciones que limitan la capacidad de ICE para realizar arrestos en los juzgados. El proyecto de ley prohíbe a los representantes de las autoridades policiales locales, estatales o federales arrestar a personas dentro de los juzgados estatales sin una orden judicial. Los agentes de ICE tampoco pueden usar mascarillas en los juzgados sin un requisito médico.
También existen medidas para proteger la información personal de los inmigrantes. Las agencias estatales no pueden compartir información personal como fechas y horas de audiencias y citas judiciales, domicilios particulares y lugares de trabajo.
El Gobernador Ned Lamont promulgó el proyecto de ley poco después del período extraordinario de sesiones.
¿Pueden las fuerzas del orden de Connecticut entregar inmigrantes al ICE?
En 2019, los legisladores de Connecticut aprobaron la Ley de Confianza, que especificaba los motivos por los cuales los funcionarios locales y estatales podían entregar inmigrantes no autorizados al ICE. La ley prohíbe a las fuerzas del orden estatales arrestar a personas únicamente con base en órdenes de detención (solicitudes del ICE para retener a alguien hasta por 48 horas para que los agentes puedan detenerlo).
Los agentes del orden solo pueden cumplir con las órdenes de detención si el ICE cuenta con una orden judicial para realizar un arresto, o si la persona bajo su custodia ha sido condenada por un delito grave de clase A o B, o está identificada en una lista de vigilancia terrorista. Los delitos graves de clase A o B incluyen asesinato, secuestro, agresión sexual, robo y homicidio en primer grado.
La Ley de Confianza se modificó en mayo de este año. Ahora, las personas pueden demandar a las ciudades y pueblos si se viola la ley. Además, se ampliaron las circunstancias bajo las cuales las fuerzas del orden deben cumplir con las solicitudes de detención del ICE para incluir 13 delitos más y definir quiénes se consideran agentes del orden.
¿Qué sucede cuando el ICE realiza un arresto?
Si bien las leyes recientes buscaban hacer que los juzgados sean más seguros para los inmigrantes en Connecticut, los agentes del ICE aún pueden realizar arrestos en otros lugares públicos sin orden judicial si tienen una sospecha razonable de que la persona a la que se dirigen es un migrante no autorizado, según la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad.
Además, fuera de los juzgados, no existen leyes que exijan a los agentes del ICE mostrar su rostro ni que prohíban el uso de mascarillas. Esto significa que los agentes del ICE aún pueden acercarse a una persona con mascarilla y realizar un arresto sin orden judicial.
¿Cómo recomienda el estado que las agencias estatales respondan a las visitas del ICE?
En un documento de la oficina de Lamont emitido en enero, el estado proporciona orientación sobre cómo las agencias estatales deben gestionar las visitas del ICE para cumplir con las leyes estatales y federales, a la vez que protegen el derecho a la privacidad de las personas.
La guía instruye a los funcionarios estatales a solicitar información sobre el motivo de la visita del agente de ICE, notificar a un asesor legal y abstenerse de compartir información personal o documentos, como su estatus migratorio, hasta que un asesor legal revise la solicitud.
ICE también tiene acceso limitado a áreas no públicas. Tienen prohibido acceder a áreas no públicas de un edificio de una agencia estatal sin una orden judicial. Sin embargo, no existe legislación que limite sus movimientos en las instalaciones públicas de un establecimiento. Por ejemplo, un agente de ICE podría realizar un arresto injustificado en una acera fuera de la instalación estatal.

No coroner candidate crossed the 50% vote threshold to avoid a runoff. Jeramiah Howard, the current interim coroner, came close at 41% of the vote. He and Stephanie Meachum, who received 16.7% of the vote, are vying for the position. 
The winner will complete the term of Sharon Grisham-Stewart, who served as county coroner from January 1999 until December 2024. She still had a year left in her term.
In Grisham-Stewart’s final years as coroner, her office along with Jackson Police Department were scrutinized for not adequately notifying families of missing persons about their loved one’s burials at the county pauper field.
Howard and Meachum previously worked in the Hinds County Coroner’s Office under Grisham-Stewart’s leadership. She endorsed and campaigned for Howard.
The Hinds County Board of Supervisors appointed Howard as the acting coroner in January. He served as chief deputy coroner under Grisham-Stewart for five years. He also served as chief of the Pocahontas Volunteer Fire Department for 10 years.
Meachum served as office manager responsible for budgets and agency records for the coroner’s office from 2011 to 2016. She has led the death division at the state Department of Health’s vital statistics office since 2016.
On Election Day, Howard won nearly every precinct from Utica to Jackson, only losing roughly 10 precincts out of 108. He won by his widest margins in Pocahontas and other northwestern precincts located in the county. Meachum performed best in central Jackson. 
Only 12.75% of 165,069 voters turned out for Election Day in Hinds County.
Howard has signs in most precincts in the county, in front of private homes and off interstates and highways. Some went up as early as July. He estimates that his team has placed 30 big signs, 100 medium signs and over 600 yard signs across the county.
“It was a team effort,” he said. “I feel blessed to have this much support across the county.”
He also wanted to thank his nearly thirty volunteers.
“Running for office is a noble deed,” he said. “My fellow candidates ran good races and deserve credit for putting their name on the ballot and reaching people in the community.”
Meachum has been her own campaign manager since she first filed. Her team sometimes included a few friends and family. Since the runoff announcement, she has received calls from potential volunteers.
“I feel inspired to reach more voters,” she said in an interview with Mississippi Today on Oct. 5. “Some are still unsure of what the coroner does, and I’m hoping to reach them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04160529/Voting-14.jpg,,,2025-11-28 12:57:16.166568

Concern about federal duties not being carried out effectively, concern for colleagues’ wellbeing, concern about how the reduction in the federal workforce will affect the economy, and concern about jobs being cut at any moment.


From insiders to ousted
This is the final story in a series about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


About 154,000 federal employees took buyouts — officially described as deferred resignations — early this year, providing them with pay through the end of the fiscal year in exchange for leaving their position. The Trump administration made the offers as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said recently that he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
During the recent federal government shutdown, an estimated 670,000 federal employees were furloughed, and another 730,000 were required to work without pay.
Excluding contractors and postal workers, there are 8,123 federal civilian employees living in South Dakota. When retirees are added, South Dakota’s “federal family” is just shy of 22,000, Zimmerman said. Just under 800 belong to his organization, which advocates for members, their pay and their benefits.
“The federal employee is there to serve the American public. We are here to help you,” Zimmerman said. “We’re not the enemy. We’re not the root of the problem. We’re just trying to do our job to take care of you.”
‘We’ve lost institutional knowledge’
Zimmerman worked for decades for the U.S. State Department as a security engineer. He was paid lower than what he would have received in the private sector, but he felt his role was noble. He felt called to serve his country even into retirement.
The 68-year-old participated in the State Department’s re-employed annuitant program after he retired in 2010, which allows retired foreign service or civil service workers to temporarily fill staffing gaps or work on special projects. Zimmerman, who lives in Sturgis, would often live in a country overseas for a few months to fill critical roles.
Zimmerman retired completely in October 2024, and has since heard from former colleagues about Department of Government Efficiency cuts. A Trump executive order in February directed agency heads to “separate from Federal service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject” to reductions in force.
A drastic reduction in the workforce means there aren’t enough people to do necessary work, which requires cutting back programs, Zimmerman said. He thinks cutting back the State Department’s re-employed annuitant program makes the problem worse and will jeopardize national security.
“I’ve seen programs cut that I don’t think they’ve thought through the impact of those cuts,” Zimmerman said.
It’ll take years and significant costs to build back the federal government, even to verify and reanalyze the need of programs, let alone hire people back, Zimmerman said. Many federal jobs require a specialized skillset.
“We’ve lost institutional knowledge,” Zimmerman said, “and that costs a lot of money and time to rebuild it back to where we need it to be.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-11-28 16:28:46+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Judges’ ruling offers warning to public bodies about excluding the public,Terrence T. McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/28/judges-ruling-public-bodies/,Public bodies too often use exemptions in the Open Public Meetings Act to exclude the public from matters that concern them.,"The Monroe Township Board of Education meets on Oct. 15, 2025. The board was sued over its decision to appoint a new member before holding a public discussion.A panel of appellate judges this week shined a spotlight on the all-too-common issue of government bodies in New Jersey hashing out decisions behind closed doors.
If you’ve ever watched a public meeting, you know what I’m talking about. Officials tell the public they have legal matters to discuss, so they meet privately, sometimes for hours. The state Open Public Meetings Act allows them to do this, with limits, but any reporter or gadfly will tell you they suspect a lot more goes on during these private sessions than the law allows.
The appellate decision from this week involves the Monroe Township Board of Education, which met on Oct. 18, 2023, in part to fill a vacant seat on the nine-member board. It met in closed session for 45 minutes to discuss the candidates, reached a consensus pick while meeting privately, then returned to public session to appoint a guy named Matthew Gorham, without giving the public a chance to weigh in before their vote to add him to the board. That was a violation of the Open Public Meetings Act, the appellate court ruled.
“Substantively, the public only witnessed the nomination and vote to install Gorham. The Board did not take any questions or comments from the public about the candidates or the process because it moved directly to the nomination and vote,” this week’s ruling says.
Making matters worse, the board had previously told the public they’d be interviewing candidates at the meeting, then decided not to.
The Open Public Meetings Act certainly gives the Monroe school board the legal right to discuss potential appointments to a vacant seat outside of public view. But the law also requires them to bring that discussion back before the public before acting, as the new ruling says.
“The fact (that) all its deliberations regarding candidate qualifications and whether to interview those candidates took place in private, without giving the public any insight into these decisions, was problematic,” it says.
Walter Luers, who represented the plaintiff in her lawsuit against the Monroe board, said he’s pleased the appellate panel issued an “important rule of law” stating that school boards, when appointing a new member, must explain the decisions they make behind closed doors to the public.
“This is an important rule for transparency and Board governance in New Jersey, and is consistent with existing New Jersey caselaw,” Luers said.
The fight over the Monroe school board appointment is largely moot — Gorham lost in his bid to stay in the seat in April 2024 — but I hope other public entities take note here. State law governs when you can and can’t meet in private, and simply saying “we’ve got legal matters to discuss” isn’t a good enough reason to shut the public out of matters of public concern. Luers agrees. 
“I hope it moves the needle closer to public entities having more disclosures and discussions in public, and certainly when appointing an official that ordinarily the electorate votes for, a higher standard applies,” Luers said.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from injuries she sustained during a Wednesday shooting a couple of blocks from the White House. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained hospitalized in critical condition. Both were West Virginia National Guard members.The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who worked with United States forces, entered the country on Sept. 8, 2021, as part of Operation Allies Welcome, according to a statement from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.No details of immigration proposalsThe White House press office declined to say Friday which countries would have their residents barred from entering the United States under the new order, referring back to the president’s social media posts, which did not include a list.“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump wrote. “Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!”Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a Thursday afternoon statement the administration would pause immigration applications for Afghan nationals.“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” she wrote. The Trump administration will also review “all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration,” McLaughlin said, saying those cases required more vetting. Biden Afghanistan policy blamedIn a separate post, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden for allowing the alleged shooter into the country. McLaughlin echoed that sentiment.Lakanwal “was paroled in by the Biden Administration.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Paul Lasley’s hobby of restoring old and broken violins and donating them to Iowa State University’s instrument collection program didn’t start with a violin of his own, or really any other stringed instrument — it started with a tin clarinet.
When the retired ISU sociology professor was growing up in Queen City, Mo., he wanted to join his elementary school band. Lasley said his family couldn’t afford a new, black-painted wood clarinet, so he had to borrow an older, metal instrument from the school.
Now he’s working to make sure students who hope to find belonging and opportunity through music like he did have better equipment than was available to him, through finding and fixing fiddles and giving them to an instrument drive run by Iowa State Center’s Stephens Auditorium staff.

“We’re enculturating the value of helping others, and that’s what we really should be about …,” Lasley said. “I was loaned a tin clarinet, and while I really would like to have had a better instrument, I had the opportunity.”
Instrument drive puts music in the hands of area students
Lasley has donated 15 violins to the instrument drive so far, he said, and he has more he’s currently repairing to donate. While he originally planned to be an anonymous gifter to the instrument cart that sits in the lobby of the auditorium ticket office, Lasley said his wife took a sneaky picture and posted it online.
The retired professor’s face would be recognizable to many on campus, as he worked at the university for 40 years. His creation of the Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll provided a way to track agriculture and farm life, and how changes in these areas affect farmers and rural society, according to the poll’s website.
Lorna Carroll, outreach coordinator for Stephens Auditorium, and other staff got wind of Lasley’s identity and reached out to him. While Lasley said his first thought after answering Carroll’s call was “Uh-oh, what might I have done,” Carroll assured him they just wanted to connect with the generous donor.
What started as seasonal instrument drives in the winter and spring have turned into a year-round practice, Carroll said. Donations of working and non-working instruments — except pianos — may be dropped off at the collection cart when the ticket office is open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday.
Since the drive’s start in 2023, Carroll said 113 instruments have been donated, with Lasley having donated the most. The instruments go to area school bands and orchestras, where they are loaned to students.
“It’s super expensive to buy an instrument, and even to rent one,” Carroll said. “It’s out of reach for a lot of families, and so the school districts do what they can to provide what they can, repair what they can, but what a gift that (Lasley has) given.”
Making fiddles sing again
Lasley said he only repairs beginner and intermediate-level fiddles, as high-level instruments should be taken to professional repair workers.
“I am the equivalent of a shade tree mechanic with automobiles,” Lasley said. “I’m not a luthier, I’m a shade tree violin fixer upper.”

Violins are found in shops, flea markets and on Facebook Marketplace, and even in pieces they can be useful. An electric violin Lasley said he was unable to fix hangs as an art piece on his office/workshop door and instruments both in need of repair and all fixed up are on the walls, a bucket of old bows in the corner and cases not fit for use set against the wall.
Lasley buys new bows and cases for the instruments before they’re donated, he said, so students can have new materials that can take the beating often provided by young musicians.
Each violin has its own work that needs to be done, Lasley said, and no two violins are the same. They each have their own history, told through the dings and etchings on the wood that Lasley said he keeps if they have a particular meaning, like the “DMPS,” standing for Des Moines Public Schools, he found on a fiddle he’s already donated.
Lasley said his hobby was born from woodworking, a lifelong hobby he spent more time on after retiring. There are only so many pieces of furniture friends and family can accept before there isn’t any room for more, he said.

One violin he’s yet to start on has come apart, with the top completely separate from the back and evidence of previous repairs that need to be fixed. Lasley said he’ll start the project by scratching off old glue, patching cracks and gluing the top plate back on. Once the front has been reattached, Lasley will insert a soundpost that, once restrung, will be held in place by 55 pounds of pressure.
Before he restrings it, however, Lasley said he’ll have to shape a bridge and attach it to the face of the violin to hold the strings.
“You end up doing everything while eyeballing and measuring, and then I get frustrated. That’s when I come over here and practice,” Lasley said, gesturing to another corner of his office where a music stand is set up, sheet music laid out.
Playing on
Lasley started playing violin when he was 69 years old. Now 73, the retired professor said he mainly learns by listening to recordings of his teacher playing over and over until he’s got the tune in his head and can sing it out on the strings. He emphasized that while he — and his teacher — can both read sheet music, this is his preferred learning style.
Holding the violin owned by his great-grandfather, who died in 1922, Lasley wondered if the melodies he plays on it were made more than a century ago on the same instrument, 30 years before he was born.

Lasley was lucky, he said, to have grown up with music constantly in the background — guitar from his father, upright bass from his mother and a reed pump organ he remembers playing at 4 years old with his grandmother, who had to push the pedals since his feet couldn’t reach.
In addition to playing the clarinet, Lasley said he played the bass clarinet and saxophone in school and played upright bass in his own band for years.
As he continues to search for fiddles to make sing once again, with the goal of getting them in students’ hands, Lasley said he hopes they help to instill values of paying kindness and generosity forward.
“It’s about helping the next generation,” he said.

She lost her job in a restructure done by the national organization. (Screen capture of Child Welfare System Oversight Committee)TOPEKA — A national organization supporting social workers restructured, stripping Kansas of its local executive director and leaving a long-time system advocate without a job.
Becky Fast, who has led the Kansas chapter of the National Association of Social Workers since 2017, was let go from her position when NASW announced internally two weeks ago that it was combining 14 state chapters into pairs that would be overseen by one director.
Kansas now is paired with Iowa, said LaToya Evans, NASW spokeswoman.  
Fast was stunned by the decision to restructure the NASW’s entire system and said it was not discussed or voted on by member states or representatives. The decision was made at the executive committee level.
“The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) is undergoing a national, internal realignment to strengthen operational efficiency and support for social workers,” Evans said in an email. “As costs within nonprofit organizations continue to increase, it has become necessary to continue transitioning to a dual-chapter executive director model in states that have fewer members or were supported by part-time employees.”
Fast, who is also a Johnson County commissioner, worked 30 hours per week as executive director, she said. 
Organization dues in Kansas pay for the local chapter costs, including her salary, so financial considerations are not the full reason for the restructuring, Fast said. In a letter announcing the new structure, the national board said “appropriate steps were taken to ensure that we adhered to our financial, legal, and ethical duties.”
Evans said Kansas and Iowa will each maintain a leadership council and chapter identities. The new model has been tested in some states, providing full-time employee support between neighboring chapters and maintaining local engagement and collaboration, she said.
Across the country, social workers and state NASW leaders took to social media to complain about the decision. In some states, including Arkansas and Kentucky, entire boards running state chapters resigned at once in disagreement with the national association’s decisions.
The Kansas NASW chapter board wrote a letter expressing its anger at how the restructuring decisions were made, citing the lack of clear communication, one of the bedrock principles of social work, as leaving board members and volunteers “confused and frustrated.”
“As the Kansas Chapter President, I have not been informed about the rationale, process, or decision-making steps leading to the elimination of our Kansas Director,” Kansas board president Tonya Ricklefs wrote in a letter signed by all board members.
The letter listed accomplishments Fast made as a state leader, including moving the organization out of a financial deficit and organizing one of the largest “advocacy day” efforts in the NASW organization. On social media, one upset Kansan pointed to Fast’s recent testimony in front of a Kansas legislative committee addressing questions about workforce issues.
“Frustrations have arisen from the lack of communication about realignment plans, no publication of approval of major changes, lack of opportunity for board and executive director input, and lack of understanding of how this cost savings will be allocated and how NASW will be structured to support our local advocacy efforts,” Ricklefs’ letter said.
Fast, the Kansas board of directors and others worry that eliminating the local chapter will weaken statewide advocacy efforts, particularly at a time when social workers are needed to support many industries.
“I’m not only sad that I’ve lost my job,” Fast said. “I’m sad for the social work community, the social workers, because it’s taken me years to build up (legislative) relationships.”
The lack of direct Kansas leadership raised such concerns that advocates have called a virtual meeting on Dec. 6 to discuss whether there is a way to create “a new Kansas social work organizational structure with the first priority being legislative advocacy,” one Facebook post said.
Fast said she’s worked with numerous Kansas legislators to educate them about social work, and the result is relationships built on trust so that government officials will call and ask for presentations and information.
The power of relationships was brought home to Fast recently when she filled in for her Oklahoma counterpart who was on sick leave. As she tried to work through issues, Fast said, she struggled with who to contact and even finding social workers in the state willing to testify. In Kansas, she has helped social workers become confident and willing to share their stories.
Fast said each state’s licensing laws are different and it’s important that the person speaking for Kansas social workers understands the nuances of the laws, particularly in a time when the Trump administration has proposed removing social workers from a list of professional degrees.
Melinda Lewis, a University of Kansas professor and director of the Center for Community Engagement and Collaboration, said the loss of someone with Fast’s knowledge of Kansas-specific challenges is significant.
“I do think the Kansas chapter of NASW with Becky’s leadership has made great strides in helping policymakers — not just legislators but state agencies and local leaders who pay attention to what’s happening in the Legislature — understand what social work does for Kansans,” Lewis said.
“We are in a different and a much more promising place now than we were several years ago, and (Kansas NASW) and Becky Fast aren’t the sole reason those advances have been made but they have been significant in it,” she added.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Becky-Fast-11-25-screen-capture-1024x536.png,,,2025-11-28 11:57:32.391845

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The State Library of Ohio got some good news as a federal agency from which they receive grant money won a battle in federal court against an executive order from President Donald Trump.
Last week, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island blocked Trump’s order that would have dismantled the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
The institute is the sole source of federal funding for libraries, according to Ohio’s State Librarian Mandy Knapp.
The State Library of Ohio receives funds through the institute’s Library Services and Technology Act for training, administration of grant programs, and to support sharing resources through a consortium for “significant cost-savings for taxpayers.”
“In our state, we use these funds to enhance summer reading so that our children don’t lag behind academically, to conserve our culture heritage to make sure that future generations will be able to share in our collective past, as well as to implement the latest research such as the Science of Reading in our libraries,” Knapp said in a statement.
The state librarian previously told the Capital Journal the loss of the federal funding would “totally and utterly devastate” the agency.

The most recent grants distributed by the state library from the $5.4 million received from the institute went to programs including monthly story times for the deaf, technology for use with historical records, and digital materials for the home-bound.
In addition, the Toledo Lucas County Public Library received a grant to support the Science of Reading, and 18 rural libraries received money for public technology training.
The struck-down executive order was issued March 14, ordering the elimination of the agency all together.
After the order, the Trump administration removed the board of the institute, terminated grants from the agency and planned mass layoffs.
The American Library Association said the actions left the institute “unable to fulfill its duties required by federal law and interrupted library services across the country.”
“Convincing a federal judge that shuttering a supposedly obscure agency would have an immediate and devastating impact on millions of Americans is no small feat,” said Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, after the order was struck down.
“Libraries also strengthen local economies by supporting jobseekers, small businesses and community learning.”
While the State Library of Ohio sees the court win as a positive sign, they are still struggling due to cuts the state made in its most recent operating budget.
While previous state budgets have had separate line items for the State Library of Ohio, in the most recent state operating budget, the method of distributing state funds for the agency is through a transfer from the Public Library Fund, a fund that previously was earmarked for local public libraries outside of the state agency.
The Public Library Fund is tasked with providing funds for the State Library of Ohio, the Library for the Blind, the Ohio Public Library Information Network, the Regional Library Systems Fund, and the Ohioana Library Association, according to budget documents.
The state funds the Public Library Fund using shares of the monthly General Revenue Fund tax receipts, to the tune of 1.75% of the revenue.
In the next two fiscal years, the state library is set to receive $4.5 million in each year.
State Librarian Knapp said when the changes were announced in budget drafts that the number amounts to a cut of $245,000 in 2026 and $331,000 in 2027 compared to previous drafts of the budget.
The cuts also came as Knapp laid out the situation at the state library, where staff and health insurance costs rose, and the library facility was “no longer suitable to house the State Library’s collection.”
The library holds historical documents like the state’s founding documents as part of their conservation role with the state.
A spokesperson from the state library said the entity has “evaluated the services (it) provides and determined where we should focus our resources.”
As a result, the library has had to cut some services like information technology support in meeting rooms, and left an Information Services & Technology Department position open after it was recently vacated.
The library plans to monitor the federal case in case it’s appealed to a higher court, and the upcoming federal budget resolution, which is set to expire on Jan. 30, 2026.

The private university announced its Learning Institute for Fulfillment and Engagement, or LIFE, program will offer both synchronous and asynchronous online options for students starting in the spring.
Designed for adults ages 23 and older with at least three years of work experience, the LIFE program runs five-week courses throughout the year in Dubuque and Cedar Rapids. According to a news release, students can earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business, human resources, accounting, marketing, criminal justice and health care through the program.

“Adult learners are balancing careers, families, and community commitments and they deserve an education model that works for them,” said Lee Noethe, senior director of LIFE admission – Dubuque, in the release. “The new LIFE HyFlex format empowers our students to take control of their education and advance their careers with the same quality, rigor, and personal attention UD is known for.”
Classrooms at both the Dubuque and Cedar Rapids locations are being updated to provide the best experience for students no matter their method of learning, the release stated, with the addition of cameras, microphones and other technology. This work is already complete in two Dubuque classrooms and one Cedar Rapids space.
“The upgraded program and lower tuition combine UD’s hallmark personal touch with the latest in educational technology,” Noethe said in the release. “We’ve created a model that meets students where they are, supports them every step of the way, and opens the door to meaningful credentials and careers.”

Ned Houston wore many hats during his 37 years on staff at Sterling College, from president of the tiny Craftsbury Common college to what he called, “lowly faculty member.”
Ned Houston and his wife, Susan, a former Craftsbury Selectboard member for 18 years, have lived in the small Northeast Kingdom town for decades. They’ve seen first hand the economic and cultural benefits that the environmentally focused school has had on Craftsbury since its founding in 1958.
The school, one of the smallest four-year colleges in the country, once attracted students from around the country to Craftsbury, a collection of small villages that includes Craftsbury Common.

Here, students and faculty did significant work, heading out to conduct field work in the Himalayas, and resource management projects along the Colorado River, not to mention their work in Vermont itself.
The college has helped define the economic and cultural life of the community, made up of born-and-raised Vermonters mixed with alums of the school who decided to stick around. The college, community members say, played a part in bucking Vermont’s longer-term demographic trends when, in the 2020 census, it saw its population actually increase.
“I think, despite our location in a very rural area, we gave quite a lot of world exposure to students, and to ourselves,” Ned Houston said.
But this month, after 65 years of operation, the school announced it would be ending its academic programming following the upcoming spring semester. College officials said the school faced persistent financial and enrollment challenges.
The news has spurred plenty of worry in the town of roughly 1,300. What does a future in Craftsbury without Sterling College look like?
“We had been a relative success story,” said Gina Campoli, a Craftsbury Common resident. “And now we’re getting hammered.”
The closure has also reinforced anxiety around the future of higher education in Vermont. Sterling College is just the latest in a string of transitions and closures at small colleges in Vermont and in New England.
More than a half dozen colleges in Vermont, including Green Mountain College in Poultney, the College of St. Joseph in Rutland and Goddard College in Plainfield, have shuttered after facing similar challenges around finances and enrollment.

“Sterling has always seemed to have this unique niche of people and has been able to survive some challenges in the past,” Campoli said. “And to have this reality hit us now, it’s very sad.”
Cultural impact
Emily McClure first purchased The Genny, Craftsbury’s local general store, with two other business partners in 2012. In the years after, McClure said Sterling College students have been a routine presence at the store — as customers, employees and community members.
Those students have for years had an indelible influence on the culture of the town, she said.
“There’s this young energy that comes with a college in your town,” McClure said. Craftsbury Common would not be what it is, she said, without Sterling College having been there for nearly 70 years.
Having a college in town brings academics and thinkers into the community to speak at events and “adds a great deal to I think that just the general depth of discussions of things here in the college,” Ned Houston said. The college has also served as a major employer for the region. 
Alums, too, are a big part of the community’s social fabric. Susan Houston said many graduates become ingrained in the community and settle down, working in the area, having children and sending them to the local K-12 public school, Craftsbury Academy.
“I think that that has really helped boost our population,” she said.
But McClure said the town and college’s populations have decreased since the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of students who remain in the community after they graduate has also dwindled, she said.

“It really has been this kind of slow decline in the presence of the college over the last five or so years,” she said. “Whereas I feel like, when I first got here, it just felt like it had a bigger presence.”
The college is set to officially shut its doors in the summer. “I’m sure we’re going to feel it, but I think we’re going to feel it more in an energetic way than we are financially,” McClure said.
Susan Houston, too, fretted over the longer-term impacts of the college’s closure, particularly on the population of alums.
“We won’t have new alums living in our community anymore, and that just makes me really tragically sad because I’ve so enjoyed knowing these students as anxious and excited 18-year-olds, and now they’re in their 30s and in their 40s, and I loved having them as community friends,” she said. “I think we’re going to really miss that.”

Water woes
The town’s civic infrastructure also could take a big hit when Sterling College closes.
Paula Davidson, the treasurer of the Craftsbury Fire District #2, a volunteer body that manages the local water system in Craftsbury Common, said the college has been key to the water district’s operations since the body was founded in 1983. The district serves residential homes, a church, libraries and the Craftsbury Academy.
Kestrel Owens, a commissioner of the water district, said the college’s closure will “have a major impact on our budget in terms of what sort of income we have to run the water system.”
The college has historically been the district’s largest customer, representing 45% of the district’s water usage and 36% of district’s customer income, Davidson said.
The district maintains water connection for Craftsbury Academy, which represents 12% of its income and serves approximately 180 students. The district also operates 40 other metered connections in Craftsbury Common, serving roughly 68 residents.

Without the college, “I’m not sure how we will proceed,” she said.
Davidson said the district expects to begin charging more in the coming years to build capital reserves. “We also hope to find grants and loans to help us afford the looming infrastructure repairs and replacements,” she said.
But she said the district “will be anxiously watching to see what happens with the Sterling College buildings.”
What happens next is unclear. Sterling College President Scott Thomas previously said the focus now is getting the remaining students through their last semester.
Thomas said the college’s board of trustees will determine how to steward the college’s remaining resources.
“I don’t know what’s next, but there will be resources remaining,” he said earlier this month. “We do have a very clear mission, and we do have a fantastic board, so we’ll see what happens at that point.”
Ned and Susan Houston said there are many ideas floating around about what to do with the Sterling College campus and its properties.
“I’m hoping that there will be a group of people who will convene community members and whoever, alums and whoever,” Susan Houston said, “so we can together creatively help design what the future will be, because most of us really need to keep some of the whole vision of the college alive and well through whatever the next reiteration is.”

(Photo by Dale Hogg for Kansas Reflector)BARTON COUNTY — The problem sounds easy: Kansas has too few houses for sale, especially in small, rural communities struggling to attract young people and new businesses.
The simple answer is to build more houses.
But those in real estate say this shortage has been years in the making, and it may take years and creative thinking to emerge from it.
“We’ve been under-building for decades,” said Mark Tomb, vice president of governmental affairs for the Kansas Association of Realtors. “We’re just not building enough homes.”
If all goes as planned, efforts in Barton County may offer a blueprint. The county commission has tapped economic development funds and other resources to help housing developments in three communities.
“If we were to announce one housing development in one city, it would be a big deal,” Commissioner Shawn Hutchinson said. “In this case, we are announcing three different and unique housing developments in three different communities, potentially totaling over 40 new homes in Barton County.”
Hutchinson credited the projects to “exceptional collaboration with community partners.”
“Without growth, we are dying on the vine,” Hutchinson said, stressing the need for central Kansas to innovate. “No one is coming to save us. We have to save ourselves.”
Hoisington, Ellinwood and Claflin are the three communities undertaking projects.
“Housing is a major challenge for our region, impacting our county’s ability to grow and hindering business development, retention and growth,” said Jonathan Mitchell, city manager of Hoisington. “Local governments need to find ways to work with private individuals and organizations to help encourage and facilitate growth.”
Mitchell is “spot on,” said Bekah Selby-Leach, director of the Wichita State University Center for Economic Development and Business Research.
“The smaller markets are just being ignored by developers,” she said.
With a youth exodus and an aging population, she said, these areas don’t make sense for risky speculative construction.

The projects
On Oct. 14, Barton County commissioners approved allocating up to $125,000 in economic development dollars to help a new $600,000-plus development in Hoisington. The project will add 12 new homes to the community of 2,600.
The Hoisington funding will reimburse the city for installing essential infrastructure: curb, gutter and a new concrete street in the new northern subdivision.
Mitchell detailed the city’s significant investment. The city purchased the former Windgate Apartment property, demolished structures, addressed environmental concerns and prepared the grounds. The city has already spent more than $549,000 on the project, with sanitary sewer extensions bringing the total city investment to nearly $691,000.
Hoisington requested the county’s financial aid to expedite construction. The goal is to begin by year’s end or early 2026.
Meanwhile, east of Great Bend, the city of Ellinwood is in the final stretch of a development “about three years in the making,” said city administrator Chris Komarek. The two-square-block Northwest Addition on the community’s northern fringe will house up to 14 new homes in the city of 2,000.
“The county had a pretty significant role in the purchase of the materials,” he said.
The county contributed $200,000 for infrastructure supplies — like sewer and water pipes — for the new Ellinwood District Hospital and the new development. The city has invested about $300,000 so far.
Komarek’s city council approved the sale of the first two lots on Oct. 13, and buyers are interested in two more by year’s end.
“We’ve had quite a bit of interest over the past three years,” he said, noting it waned as the project dragged on and interest rates climbed.
“But, once we get the streets in up there, it will start to look more like a housing addition,” he said.
Water, sewer and communications infrastructure are already in place. Streets should be completed within the month, followed by gas lines.
“We should be done by the end of the year” with all prep work, Komarek said.
Then, home building will begin.
“By the spring, it will be exciting to see,” he said.
In the northeast corner of the county, the Hidden Hills Development sits just outside Claflin’s northern city limits. Developed by the Miller family, owners of Millers of Claflin furniture store, the project includes 16 lots between three and five acres each.
“We hear it every day in the store,” said Brad Miller of comments about the lack of housing in the town of 543 residents. “We got tired of hearing about it and decided to do something.”
He said 12 lots have already been sold. One home is under construction, and two more should break ground after the first of the year.
Even though the Millers bought the land, Miller said, it took community support. The site falls in the Independent Township, which helped surface the roads, and Barton County provided culverts.
“The township and the county have been wonderful to work with,” he said.
City water will serve the area, but homes will use individual septic systems. Natural gas and electric infrastructures are being installed now.
Since the development is in Claflin’s one-mile extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction, it required the city to sign off on the plat. The county commission also had to authorize the layout plan.
The initiative has been in the works for almost two years, Miller said. The Millers originally asked Claflin to annex the site, but city officials decided that taking over the property was too much of a financial burden.
Driven by growth at the nearby ONEOK gas plant and hospitals in neighboring Hoisington and Ellinwood, the area is seeing an influx of young families filling the schools, which has exacerbated the housing shortage.
“We’re happy with this. It’ll be good for the area, and it will be good for the city of Claflin,” Miller said.
 
A new normal
Maranda DeSanto, CEO of the Kansas Association of Realtors, said year-to-date, Kansas has seen 36,790 new listings.
The month’s supply of inventory — a measure of how long it would take to sell all properties at the current pace — was up 4% from a year ago but remains low at 2.6 months. A balanced market traditionally holds four to six months of supply.
But DeSanto said the concept of a balanced market is likely changing.
“We haven’t seen those numbers for about 10 years, so I think we have to agree there’s a new normal to the market,” she said.
The Kansas housing market saw higher prices and persistent low inventory in September. The median sales price for a home rose to $269,000 in September, a jump from $255,000 in September 2024 and $248,000 in September 2023.
DeSanto said the pricing trend is a direct result of the long-term shortage.
“With the basics of supply and demand, this is also a conversation about sales price,” DeSanto said. “While there are always homes for sale, tighter inventory will generally show up in the pricing.”
It’s not just a shortage of houses, Selby-Leach said. It’s also the price points. Fewer lower-priced homes, often starter homes, are being built, while more high-end homes go up. Even homes being built in urban and metro areas are priced out of reach for many buyers.
While mortgage rates seem high, Tomb said, they are hovering near the long-term norm.
Tomb also referred to the 2021 Kansas Statewide Housing Needs Assessment, the state’s first comprehensive housing study in nearly 30 years. It noted that to keep pace with need, 3,800 to 5,000 new homes must be built annually — which is not happening.
The assessment revealed several key challenges: a pervasive shortage of quality, affordable housing for middle-income families; specific housing needs for the state’s aging population; and depressed housing values in many rural areas, hindering investment.
A final key challenge was a severe labor shortage in the building trades, complicating new construction and rehabilitation.
The assessment launched several initiatives in the 2022 legislative session, including the Moderate Income Housing program and the Rural Housing Incentive District program.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Barton-County-housing-Ellinwood-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-28 09:59:58.302022

One of the incidents involves a caregiver who mistakenly dispensed the wrong drugs for a resident, and a nurse who then concealed the full scope of the error from the resident’s treating physicians.
That incident took place at Northgate Care Center in Waukon, which has been fined $10,000 by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing for failing to properly assess and treat the resident, who subsequently died.

According to state inspectors, the staff at Northgate mistakenly gave the woman medications intended for another resident — including melatonin to encourage sleep, an antidepressant, an antianxiety medication and an anticoagulant.
Video surveillance footage recorded a short time later showed the resident sitting in a recliner, standing up and immediately falling to the floor. The inspectors’ written description of the footage of the woman’s fall is not entirely clear, with some words apparently missing, but it reads as follows:
7:31:52 – 7:32:04 — The resident stood from her, tripped over her catheter tubing, fell on her left side and hit her head on the recliner all the while Staff A, Licensed Practical Nurse, and Staff B, Certified Nursing Assistant/Certified Medication Aide stood at the nurse’s station.
7:31:59 — Staff A remained at the nurse’s station while Staff B walked around the front of the station with her head positioned down as she looked at an item in her and walked down the north hallway. The resident in site.
7:32:08 — The resident stood from the reclined electric chair.
7:32:13 – 7:32:23 — Staff A casually walked to the resident positioned on the floor and held out her hand towards the resident.
Inspectors say the staff walked the resident to the dining room without first assessing the woman’s injuries. At 9:21 p.m., after the woman complained of pain, an ambulance crew arrived and took her to a hospital where an X-ray indicated she’d sustained a broken leg.
According to inspectors, the resident’s family chose to forgo surgical intervention, which led to hospice care and, at some unspecified point over the next few days, the resident’s death.
According to the inspectors’ report, Staff A, the licensed practical nurse, admitted that after the resident was taken to the hospital, she called the emergency room to report the resident had been given only one incorrect medication — not four — shortly before the fall.
“When asked why she had not told the truth in the beginning, Staff A responded by stating, ‘Because I knew I was wrong,’” the inspectors’ report states.
Other deaths trigger $500 fines
The other recent care-facility deaths that have resulted in state fines are:
REM Iowa in Coralville: This care facility has been fined $500 for failing to provide adequate supervision for a 30-year-old male resident of the home who was diagnosed with a severe intellectual disability and autism.
According to state inspectors, the staff at the home found the man unresponsive in his bed at about 6:55 a.m. on June 30, 2025. He was pronounced dead at 7:35 a.m., with the death certificate listing the cause of death as natural causes related to complications associated with epilepsy.
State inspectors allege the home failed to have checked on the man at least once every 30 minutes, but that he had not been checked after receiving his morning medication at 6:18 a.m.
Harmony House Health Center in Waterloo: This facility has been fined $500 for failing to coordinate and integrate necessary supports for a 29-year-old male resident with severe intellectual disabilities, autism and a history of eating non-food items.
State inspection reports indicate the man was found on the floor of the facility at 5:55 a.m. on Oct. 5, 2025, and was pronounced dead 20 minutes later. Inspectors reported the medical examiner’s office indicated the man had two gloves in his stomach and one lodged in his trachea that blocked his airway, as well as a subdural hematoma sustained in a fall.
Inspectors alleged that despite the man’s documented history of eating cloth, paper, gloves, bugs, towels and virtually anything he found on the floor, the home was unable to produce a behavioral assessment that spoke to the man’s habit of ingesting non-food items.

Since its founding in 2015, the center has offered free and low-cost legal services to more than 25,000 immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers in the Detroit area.
One of those new initiatives is a year-end donation drive, aiming to bring in $250,000 in donations by the end of the year to expand free and low-cost legal services for immigrants and refugees across Southeast Michigan.
The center is also inviting business and community partners to join in its mission of expanding access to justice through collaborative initiatives, which the center uses to expand its legal services.
It is also working on volunteer engagement, with the center continuing to invite attorneys, legal students, translators and researchers to support their goal of ensuring immigrants are welcomed into their communities and that justice does not depend on how much money someone has.
“Each person who walks through our doors carries dreams and challenges,” the center’s Executive Director Kevin Piecuch said in a news release. “To have served 25,000 clients since 2015 means 25,000 steps toward justice, safety and belonging. We’re proud of what has been accomplished – but even more excited about what’s ahead.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-28 14:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,The duck hunters in the ‘poor line’ pay into wetland conservation,"Héctor Alejandro Arzate, Mississippi Ag & Water Desk",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/28/duck-hunters-pay-into-wetland-conservation/,"The Mississippi River is one of the major rrivers that flow along a key route for migratory birds., known as the Mississippi Flyway,.","COLUMBIA, Mo. — Flocks arrived by the dozens in the dark before sunrise. Some travelled in groups. Others flew solo. They all wanted to land in a wetland, but these specimens needed to wait for the Missouri Department of Conservation to get all their ducks in a row. The MDC and a small bingo cage would decide who got a spot.
No, this was not a crowd of mallards. It was hunters waiting for a shot at migrating waterfowl. 
Throughout the state, duck hunting is permitted at 14 public wetlands but daily reservations are required. Half the spots get awarded through an online lottery before and during the season. The rest are for the “poor line.” Historically, this queue is for people who don’t have access to private land or didn’t score a public reservation.
On a November morning 30 hunters were at Eagle Bluffs Conservation Area near Columbia, Missouri. 
“You get up at four in the morning for a chance to get a spot at one of Missouri’s conservation areas,” Jake Rice said.
There were nine spots available for the drawing. An MDC biologist spun the cage for the hunters, who each got a ball. The lower the number, the better the odds.
The cradle of migrating waterfowl in North America
Eagle Bluffs is located in an alluvial plain of the Missouri River, and over 280 migratory bird species visit the 4,429-acre area each year.
As MDC’s resource supervisor for the region, John George said one of the main goals of the conservation area is to provide birds with a place where they can rest and find food – small acorns from oak trees, seeds, insects and even crops like rice, soybeans, and corn – for the long journey. “They can’t just fly the whole length of the Missouri and hope that they find something at the other end,” George said.
The Missouri is one of the major rivers, along with the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, that flow along a key route for migratory birds. Known as the Mississippi Flyway, about half of all North American species utilize the corridor to get from as far as Canada all the way down to Central and South America, and then back. 
“The Mississippi Flyway is definitely the cradle of migrating waterfowl in North America,” said Jared Mott, who grew up hunting in the state of Mississippi and now serves as conservation director of the Isaak Walton League of America, a national conservation organization.
The region is ideal for duck hunters, too. For the 2024 season, there were an estimated 1.3 million active duck and geese hunters throughout the United States, according to a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service report from August. Of that number, about 40 percent of the U.S. total were in the Mississippi Flyway, which includes 14 states from Minnesota to Louisiana. All together, they harvested approximately 6.4 million ducks and 1.4 million geese.
“It’s got the most ducks, it’s got the most hunters,” Mott said. “When it comes to waterfowl, you just about can’t overstate the importance of wetlands and the habitat that they provide.”
Waterfowl need the habitat not just for migrating south in the winter but also as their breeding grounds in the Prairie Pothole region — which consists of states like Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota. It’s nicknamed the “Duck Factory” because it produces millions of birds each year. 
The success of duck populations – and hunting – is largely dependent on habitat quality and quantity. Both are at risk. Mississippi has 24 wildlife management areas throughout the state that are managed for waterfowl.
More than 130,000 acres of wetlands in the Mississippi River Basin were lost between 2009 and 2019, according to a 2024 report from the USFWS. This has largely been caused by drainage and fill from farming over the past century, along with modern land development and climate change.
In Mississippi, between 1930 and 1973 approximately 8, 170 acres of coastal marshes were filled for industrial and residential uses, according to a  1999 Mississippi’s Coastal Wetlands report from the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources Coastal Preserves Program. 
While many migrating waterfowl have access to state and federally managed wetlands, they also depend on private land throughout the U.S. Yet, in late November, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new guidelines redefining which streams and wetlands qualify for federal regulations under the Clean Water Act. 
The proposal was praised by EPA administrator Lee Zeldin and some agriculture groups, but environmental groups have already raised concerns about the potential impact on the Mississippi River basin’s wetlands. 
“It’s not pretty,” Mott said. 
The rule is open to public comments until January 5, 2026.
The first conservationists in America
Historically, duck hunters played a crucial role in conservation throughout the U.S. They were among some of the first to advocate for the protection for all migratory birds, not just waterfowl, which resulted in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.
Today, duck hunters pay into conservation by purchasing state and federal hunting permits. That includes the Federal Duck Stamp, which has raised more than $1 billion to protect approximately 6 million acres of wetlands since 1934. It’s also a popular art contest with hundreds of entries each year. 
“Without those duck hunters, there’d be a lot less habitat out there for waterfowl,” said Jake Spears, the region biologist in Arkansas for Ducks Unlimited, a nonprofit for waterfowl and habitat conservation.
A federal tax on the sale of handguns, as well as other firearms and ammunition, generates funding for wildlife restoration each year — approximately $989 million for fiscal year 2024. Additionally, every state has its own way of sourcing conservation funding. For example, in Missouri,  0.125% of the state’s 4.225% sales tax collects funds for state conservation programs.
Eagle Bluffs, where the hunters waited in the poor line for a chance to shoot a duck, is just one example of what that money can do. It’s a restored wetland constructed in the 1990s to fight the loss of nearly 90 percent of Missouri’s wetlands due to agriculture and development. By recycling waste water from a nearby treatment facility, along with river pumps, the area’s wetlands have returned as 17 shallow pools. 
It’s not just duck hunters who benefit from wetland conservation. Tim Eisele, in Madison, is both a duck hunter and one of 96 million bird watching hobbyists in the U.S. 
“I happen to hunt the Mississippi River in the western edge of Wisconsin, and to me, that’s God’s country,” said Eisele. “Just being over there and watching birds move around in the morning or evening.”
“Were it not for the waterfowl hunter that wanted to go out in the marsh with his dog and his shotgun and try to shoot a couple of ducks, we would not have those habitats there available to every Missouri resident,” said Garrett Trentham, the head of the southern region’s events team for Delta Waterfowl, a nonprofit conservation organization.
It’s not even about killing ducks
By five in the morning, most of the hunters in the poor line had left. Those with a spot for the day were probably throwing out their duck decoys. The unlucky likely retreated to their beds. But Jack Honey and a friend remained — despite drawing the second-highest number with ball 16. 
“I’m glad they do this,” Honey said. “Even though you won’t get to hunt one day, but it’s for the benefit of the entire waterfowl.”
Like all good hunters, though, Honey waited patiently. And it paid off with the final spot: a blue hole called Buck Pool. Not the most desirable location to shoot ducks, Honey said, but “you can’t kill ‘em on the couch.”
The pair headed out to a flooded grain field with their waders and shotguns. They waited eagerly for the legal shooting light. All around them, the sounds of geese, coots, green-winged teals, mallards, gadwalls, and even songbirds signalled a new day. 
After a morning hunting, they went home empty-handed, but to Honey, it wasn’t even about killing ducks. 
It was about seeing how nature works. “Seeing how God presented it,” he said.

The recent retirements of Nancy Pelosi and other longtime House Democrats have led to more calls for aging members to pass the torch. Incumbents argue their experience is crucial as the executive branch is upending the balance of power in Washington. 


California’s battleground House districts might get the lion’s share of national attention for their role in deciding which party rules Congress’s lower chamber. 
But in a handful of California’s deep blue districts, an intra-party battle over the future of the Democratic Party is brewing in the wake of grim losses during last year’s presidential race.
In Sacramento, Napa County and Los Angeles, three younger challengers are arguing that Democrats need to give voters fresh faces with bold new ideas to energize the party’s base, rather than aging incumbents who are entrenched more in Washington insider culture than in their districts.
“Status quo politics isn’t going to protect our communities,” said Sacramento City Councilmember Mai Vang, 40, who is running against 10-term Rep. Doris Matsui, 81. “We need leaders who can meet the moment. And that’s why I decided to step into the ring.”
Vang is the first formidable primary challenge that Matsui has faced in the two decades since the congresswoman won her late husband’s seat in 2005. Former Rep. Bob Matsui held that seat for 26 years prior.
Two other senior California congressional Democrats have also attracted primary challengers. Rep. Mike Thompson, 74, of Napa County, a Vietnam veteran vying for his 15th term, faces a challenge from Eric Jones, 34, a former San Francisco venture capitalist. 
And farther south, former Obama and Biden White House climate aide Jake Levine, 41, is challenging Rep. Brad Sherman, 71, of Los Angeles, who is seeking his 16th term. All three challengers have vowed not to take corporate PAC money as their incumbent opponents do.
Around California and across the country, younger challengers argue that Democratic incumbents in safe districts take their seats for granted since they so rarely receive serious challenges. That false sense of security, Vang said, results in out-of-touch members who have fewer incentives to show up in their districts and talk to voters.
Part of meeting the current moment, Vang argues, means taking “bold and courageous” positions on important issues, such as speaking out forcefully against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.
Vang said she wants Matsui to more strongly condemn immigration raids that have torn Sacramento families apart and violated residents’ due process rights. She was disappointed that Matsui’s denunciations centered around the unsanitary conditions of the John E. Moss federal building, where advocates said detainees were being held without access to proper hygiene, rather than on the separation of families and indiscriminate detentions.
“For the past several months we’ve had neighbors, people in our community that have been kidnapped by ICE, taken by ICE, and Doris hasn’t spoken up against that at all,” Vang said. “And especially as someone who was born in the internment camps, I would think she would be on the front lines to speak out on the issues.”
Matsui was born in the Poston War Relocation Center internment camp in Arizona, where her parents were incarcerated during World War II.

“That’s nonsense,” said Roger Salazar, a campaign spokesperson for Matsui, noting local news coverage of Matsui’s statement against an immigration raid on a South Sacramento Home Depot and her attempt to access an ICE detention facility. “She needs to watch the news.” 
Matsui in October hosted a rare in-person forum only after constituents spent months calling on her to meet with them. Angry Sacramentans also hosted an empty-chair town hall in March to highlight Matsui’s absence, not even two weeks after House Democrats did a nationwide blitz of showing up in Republican districts to prove a similar point.
Some senior leaders are sticking around
Calls for generational change within the Democratic Party, while not new, have increased significantly as the party works to find its footing after 2024. The dynamic played out first in internal House leadership races earlier this year, where younger members like Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach leapfrogged more senior colleagues to lead powerful committees. 
Rep. Thompson, Matsui’s congressional counterpart in neighboring Napa County, said his constituents have stopped him in public and asked him to run again. 
“I can’t tell you how many times I had people tell me, ‘I sure hope you’re gonna stick around. We need you more now than ever,’” Thompson told CalMatters. “No one’s asked me to retire. No one has suggested that I’ve been there too long. And everyone knows that not only am I capable, but I’m in good shape.”
In Sacramento, Vang, the eldest of 16 children whose Hmong parents came to the United States as refugees, said she has the utmost respect for the Matsuis and their long history of service. 
Still, she has called on Matsui to follow the examples of House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi — who announced last month that she would retire next year and not seek reelection to a 21st term in Congress — and Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York, who told The New York Times that “now is the right moment to step aside and allow a new generation of leaders to step forward.”
But Matsui remains steadfast that she has much more work to do in Congress, such as overseeing groundbreaking for Sacramento’s new I Street bridge and securing federal funds for flood prevention and wildfire recovery, and said she will stay in the race. She emphasized that the deep relationships she’s built over 20 years in Washington are critical to her ability to deliver on those projects. 
“It’s important to not only have advocates, but have people who understand that once you’re in Congress, you have to learn how to govern, too,” Matsui said. “We cannot just throw everything out and start over again.”
As for Vang’s intra-party primary challenge, Matsui said anyone is “perfectly free” to run against her at any time. “I’m fine with that. This is our democracy. This is America.”
But she insisted that her record would reinforce to voters how hard she works.
“I show up every single day working for Sacramento,” Matsui said, “whether it’s in Sacramento or in D.C.”
The risk of Dem-on-Dem challenges 
One risk of primarying veteran members of Congress is the loss of institutional wisdom, said Gale Kaufman, a Sacramento-based Democratic strategist, particularly with the Trump administration testing the limits of the law and boundaries of power. 
“Especially when you’re up against stuff like this, which we’re not familiar with, breaking every norm you could possibly imagine,” Kaufman said, “having some of those people around is not a bad thing.”
Even among younger Democrats, there’s not wide consensus that incumbents are out and young challengers are automatically in. Evan Cragin, president of the Sacramento County Young Democrats, echoed Kaufman’s point that a blanket policy of “vote out all incumbents over a certain age” could be counterproductive. 
While the Young Democrats have yet to endorse anyone in the congressional races, Cragin said he is personally conflicted about who to support.
“I don’t know who I’m going to vote for,” Cragin said. “It’s nice to have a strong member at the moment, but also, there is part of me that wants to make sure we support our younger members. And Councilmember Mai Vang is a very strong challenger. She’s very community oriented.”
Those who support intra-Democratic challenges argue that they drive important dialogue and force candidates to clearly articulate their ideas and earn voters’ trust, rather than taking their support as a given. Incumbent Democrats across the country could benefit from primary challenges as the party soul searches, said Alex Niles, vice president of political affairs for the Sacramento County Young Democrats.
“We need to have a reckoning and figure out, ‘What does it mean to be a Democrat? What do we stand for? What do people want and who are we serving?’” Niles said.
“The circular firing squad in blue districts hurts our ability to win swing districts.”U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman of Los Angeles
Unsurprisingly, many incumbents and political strategists disagree, denouncing intra-party primaries as expensive distractions that deplete safe members’ fundraising that could otherwise support colleagues in more vulnerable districts.
“The circular firing squad in blue districts hurts our ability to win swing districts,” Rep. Sherman told CalMatters in an interview. 
Candidates in safe districts often support their more vulnerable colleagues to gain clout within the party, whether through direct transfers of campaign cash or by urging their donors to channel their contributions to more contested races. Sherman argues that a competitive intra-Democratic primary forces a safe incumbent to invest more in their own reelection rather than helping flip battleground seats. He repeatedly mentioned tight races in Iowa and Ohio that he views as critical to Democrats reclaiming the House. 
“What happens in swing seats may determine whether America’s a democracy,” Sherman said. “Democrats have got to win seats in Iowa, and we can’t do it unless the strong Democrats in Bel Air and Brentwood and Malibu are focused on Iowa.

“It’s hard to get people in Brentwood to focus on Iowa if there’s a real race in Brentwood.”
He added that while it matters which Democrat represents California’s 32nd Congressional District, the Los Angeles-area seat that he’s represented for almost 30 years, it’s “not life or death for our democracy.”
Sherman’s challenger Levine, who outraised the congressmember last quarter and appears to be the frontrunner in a crowded field, agrees that Democrats need to flip GOP-held seats to reclaim control of the House. But at the same time, if their party wants to retain the majority and win back disaffected voters, Democrats need to prove they’re focused on lowering the cost of living and improving their quality of life, in addition to preserving democracy. 
After leaving Los Angeles to pursue a climate policy career in Washington, D.C., Levine moved back home earlier this year to help his mother after she lost her house — his childhood home — in the devastating Palisades Fire. He was frustrated by the disjointed local and state response to recovery, and he had hoped Sherman would step up and coordinate the response. 
“The things that people want to hear about, and the things that I’m trying to talk about, are the issues in the district,” he said. “Those issues really are not about the composition of the House. They’re not about Washington inside-the-beltway questions of power.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A Georgia nonprofit has become more active in environmental battles around the state, from battles over access to air and water to challenging permissive utility regulations that contribute to high energy costs.
Since opening an office in Birmingham 15 years ago, the Southern Environmental Law Center has partnered with other nonprofits and organizations in legal battles in the public and private sectors.
D.J. Gerken, the president and executive director of SELC, said in an interview that climate change was one motivator for their work.
“We are at the beginning of a climate crisis, and the South has a big hand in causing it,” he said. “Right now, we are paying more for electricity because we are subsidizing fossil fuels. We think that is terrible for families. We know it is terrible for the environment, so we have got a lot of attention on that problem.”

SELC lends legal and advocacy expertise to other organizations and nonprofits and assists them with advancing their mission to protect the environment.
“The reality is that we have so many partner groups in this state with different interests, different cases that they want us to work on, that we do the work from partner groups that come to us that really need to be done,” said Barry Brock, director of the Alabama Office for the Southern Environmental Law Center.
SELC partnered with renewable energy advocacy organizations Energy Alabama and the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution to challenge decisions made by the state’s utility regulator, the Alabama Public Service Commission, that typically rules in favor of Alabama Power.
Recently, SELC challenged a request made by Alabama Power to purchase a natural gas power generating station in Billingsley in Autauga County, which would have led to increased utility rates to pay for the acquisition. Alabama Power said the plant would help it meet increased power demand from data centers. The utility said in a filing with the PSC that the Billingsley power plant is the most cost-effective plan for addressing increased energy use.
SELC sought to stop the purchase, arguing the company did not consider other sources, such as renewable energy, to address the demand, and also  overestimated the amount of electricity that data centers will consume. Alabama Power said in a filing last week it wants to delay the implementation of the rate increase.
SELC is also challenging the process that the PSC uses to decide the rate that Alabama Power can charge its customers for the cost of fuel it buys to generate electricity.
“The way they have been doing that is through this secretive procedure where they don’t have a public hearing,” Brock said. “They don’t invite public input.” The rate ECR can be adjusted as often as every month when Alabama Power makes a request to the utility regulator. The Public Service Commission then issues consent orders to adjust the rate.
SELC is also taking on cases that deal with pollution, particularly for residents living in rural areas.

(Getty Images)Total holiday spending in Nevada is forecast to be higher this year than last year, but spending per person will likely decline, while seasonal hiring nationally will fall to its lowest level in 15 years, holiday economic forecasters say.
At an estimated $6.5 billion, total holiday spending by Nevadans is projected to be 4% larger than in 2024, the Retail Association of Nevada (RAN) said in a forecast this week.
That’s in line with a national increase of between 3.7% and 4.2% forecast by the National Retail Federation (NRF).
Both fall short of last year, when national holiday spending grew by 4.3%. 
“Consumers are navigating a complex landscape” in which “inflation, elevated interest rates, and a reliance on credit are all factors contributing to a more discerning shopper this season,” RAN said in a press release.
“While spending will increase in absolute dollars, consumers are prioritizing value, seeking deals, and managing their budgets strategically,” RAN said.
In October, a report for NRF estimated consumers nationally would spend an average of $890.49 per person this year, down 1.3% from last year’s $901.99
A consumer survey performed by Deloitte Insights indicates a much sharper holiday spending decline of 10% from 2024.
Some analysts are predicting a “K shaped” shopping season, where the spending line representing more affluent consumers goes up, and the line for less well-off consumers goes down.
However, Deloitte found spending would decrease among all income groups surveyed, including those with incomes of more than $200,000.
Slow to no hiring
Holiday hiring is also expected to decline this year compared to 2024. “Following a summer of subdued hiring,” said a forecast on seasonal hiring issued in late September from the Challenger, Gray & Christmas outplacement firm, Challenger “expects seasonal retail hiring in 2025 to fall to its lowest point since the recession-hit season of 2009.”
“Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,” said Andy Challenger, the firm’s senior vice president. “While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less.”
NRF’s national forecast released this month was similarly downbeat on seasonal hiring. There were 442,000 seasonal hires in 2024. But NRF’s forecast expects retailers to hire “between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, in line with a slower-paced labor market,” the lowest amount of seasonal hiring in 15 years. 
“Because of the ongoing tariff situation, retailers will be closely monitoring spending patterns and waiting to make staff additions should demand strengthen throughout the holiday season,” said NRF economist Mark Matthews.
RAN’s forecast did not include Nevada-specific seasonal hiring projections.
Souring sentiment
In another indicator of holiday economic activity released this week, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index indicates consumers are entering the season with sour outlooks for business and labor market conditions.
The index fell 7 points in November to 88.7 (1985=100), the lowest score since April, when Donald Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs and launched a global trade war that shocked markets and consumer sentiment. The plunge in April was the lowest the index had been since 2021.
Consumers are “notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,” said Dana Peterson, the Conference Board’s chief economist, in a statement accompanying the index’s release. “Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings,” Peterson added.
But the Conference Board’s release also noted that while consumers’ write-in responses “continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics,” there were also “increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,” suggesting that could also be contributing to tumbling consumer sentiment. 
Also this week, the Census Bureau released revised estimates for U.S. retail sales which, adjusted for seasonal variations, were effectively flat in September (up 0.1% from August) — before the government was shutdown.
Deloitte’s “holiday spending confidence index” was even less encouraging than the Conference Board’s. More than three-fourths (77%) of consumers surveyed expected prices to be higher, and 57% expect the economy to get weaker in 2026, “the least optimistic outlook since Deloitte started tracking economic sentiment in 1997.”
Nevada retailers have strived to adapt to “the new economic normal,” said Retail Associaion of Nevada President Bryan Wachter in a release.
“They are offering compelling value, innovating their business models, and working tirelessly to meet the consumer where they are, both online and in-store.”
“This season won’t be without its challenges, but our members are prepared to deliver a successful and competitive holiday shopping experience,” Wachter said. 
Matthews, the NRF’s president, offered a similarly glass-half-full assessment.
“The economy has continued to show surprising resilience in a year marked by trade uncertainty and persistent inflation,” he said. “As tariffs have induced an uptick in consumer prices, retailers have tried to hold the line on prices given the uncertainty about trade policies.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1450312824-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 08:58:16.176459

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Data center operator DartPoints plans to up the capacity of its Greenville center by 400%.
But unlike the super centers popping up around the Palmetto State, each gobbling upwards of 100 megawatts of power, DartPoints’ growth is on a much smaller scale — 12.5 megawatts, up from a 2.5-megawatt starting point.
The company pledged this month to invest $125 million in the expansion of its Greenville location, adding 88,000 square feet to the facility.
At the heart of the company’s expansion: artificial intelligence.
DartPoints’ customers are now demanding three times the capacity and computing power compared to just a year or so ago, CEO Scott Willis told the SC Daily Gazette.
“AI potentially has the opportunity to change their business in a very dramatic way. We’ve got to come along with that,” he said.
Companies are turning to AI bots to run customer care chats. Robots in manufacturing are becoming more autonomous. And from a health care perspective, hospital systems are offering more computer-heavy remote services, with wearable devices that track vitals like heart rate and blood sugar, Willis said.
So expanding is essential, he said, if DartPoints wants its centers to remain relevant over the next five years.
“It is no longer a ‘nice to have.’ It’s a requirement, on our part, to understand that change, anticipate that change,” Willis said.
More than a decade in SC
DartPoints has operated data centers in South Carolina for more than a decade. With locations in Columbia, Spartanburg and Charleston, as well as Greenville, the state is the Dallas-headquartered company’s largest market.
To finance its expansion in South Carolina, as well as in Ohio and Indiana, DartPoints secured a $250 million investment from a pair of partners earlier this year.
“South Carolina is a great business environment,” Willis said. “It’s a great state, positioned within the Southeast. It’s growing massively in terms of attracting businesses, and we want to participate in that.”
But consumer groups and politicians have pushed back against the proliferation of data centers over the past couple years. Most of that ire is aimed at so-called hyperscale centers, owned and operated by tech giants such as Google and Meta.
Meta invests in SC solar as utilities expect more clean energy-conscious firms to finance projects

These windowless centers, which house rows of servers, are among the largest drivers of growing power needs in the state, generating vast demand for electricity on top of the needs of an ever-growing manufacturing and population base.
Willis is quick to point out not all data centers are the same.
For starters, he said, utilities already have the kind of capacity on their system that DartPoints requires.
“We are a non-invasive partner inside the state,” Willis said. “We don’t disrupt the demand of the grid. We’re not asking Duke (Energy) or other utilities to invest a significant amount of money that could result in price increases for the overall citizens of the state of South Carolina.”
A different kind of customer
DartPoints also tends to serve customers that require a bit more privacy and control over their IT systems.
The company specializes in private, dedicated servers that its customers can access remotely, with guarantees that the computing power will always be available for that customer’s use. Turning to Google or Microsoft or Amazon Web Services, businesses share space on those companies’ servers, using what’s known as a public cloud system, Willis said.
If a DartPoints customer wants even more control, they can choose to have their own servers caged within a DartPoints facility that only that company’s employees have access to. DartPoints simply supplies the space and power it takes to operate and cool the equipment.
Before DartPoints moved into the state, Willis said, companies had to turn to major providers in big cities, such as Atlanta, Charlotte or Nashville or major computing hubs in northern Virginia, for these serices.
Now, companies have a local option that often comes at a lower cost because they don’t have to lay down lines of fiber to get connected to a distant center. The computing speeds are also faster because companies don’t have to wait for their data to travel longer distances over the network, a major bonus as more are turning to artificial intelligence.
In all, DartPoints has about 300 customers that use its four South Carolina data centers, Willis told legislators last September. Those companies collectively generate $60 billion in revenue within the state and employ about 140,000 people.
DartPoints’ customer base mirrors the state’s major economic sectors — manufacturing, health care, some financial institutions and state and local government, as well as higher education.
“DartPoints’ growth in Greenville shows how innovation and infrastructure investment go hand in hand,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. “This project reinforces South Carolina’s position as a destination for technology-driven business and demonstrates how our state can support advanced digital operations with the power, talent and collaboration they require to thrive.”
Construction is underway and the additional space is expected to be operational in July 2027.
The company does not publicize how many people it employs in South Carolina but pledged 10 new jobs as part of the expansion.
After Greenville, Willis said, DartPoints will turn its attention to growing its Columbia center, located within the South Carolina Research Authority Innovation Center. Details on that expansion are forthcoming, he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 08:58:16.176459

(Screenshot)Rural counties in New Mexico have scant news coverage of their communities, and Native American and Spanish-speaking residents have few options in their languages. These are just two of the takeaways from a recent in depth analysis of the state’s news ecosystem, published alongside an  interactive local news map.
The study’s results did not surprise New Mexico Local News Fund Executive Director Rashaad Mahmood, who commissioned the work. The impetus came from the growing national philanthropic interest in supporting local journalism, and the concomitant need for more data to help funders understand local needs. LNF runs a variety of fundraising and training programs across the state.
While national studies in recent years have taken the measure of local news systems, Mahmood wanted a report that would analyze New Mexico at a more granular level, and specifically highlighted Colorado’s News Mapping Project at the outset as a model.
“It was kind of a no-brainer,” Mahmood told Source NM. “If we want to help more people in New Mexico have access to high quality local news information, we need to understand in more detail: Where are the communities that don’t have that, and where are the strengths? And then do some analysis of what are opportunities for our work and for other funders and people to make a difference.”

Gwyneth Doland, a professor of practice in the University of New Mexico’s Communications and Journalism Department, and retired UNM Professor Michael V. Marcotte, who now runs MVM Consulting, co-lead the research behind the more than 150-page study.
The work included a detailed survey sent to news outlets statewide; the creation of a database of 139 outlets (including Source NM); and a content analysis of the strength and effectiveness of each outlet—all data that can be accessed through the map. Doland and Marcotte also surveyed more than 1,100 New Mexico residents about their news habits; conducted focus groups around the state to complement the survey data; and conducted one-on-one interviews with media representatives to “fill in gaps and add context to our data,” a news release announcing the study noted.
The research revealed that close to half of the state’s news outlets are based in Albuquerque/Rio Rancho; Santa Fe; Los Cruces; and Farmington, leaving smaller communities with fewer sources for news and information. Moreover, four counties have no news outlets at all. The state’s digital divide also impacts residents’ news options.
But the work also revealed new initiatives and a fundamental desire among residents to stay informed and connected to their communities.
Marcotte traces the genesis of the recent report back nearly a decade to work he undertook for the national foundation Democracy Fund in assessing New Mexico’s news landscape. Doland also worked on that report.
“We basically just interviewed news leaders and editors around the state to put together kind of a little more of an impressionistic report about what’s happening in local news in New Mexico,” Marcotte, who was the lead author on that study, said. “We called it the precarious local news ecosystem of New Mexico, and that preceded funding for [the Local News Fund] and a lot of the activity that has followed that.”
The growing philanthropic interest in local news, he noted, helped grow the need for “a more sophisticated look at what’s happening on the ground.”
But the seeds of the current landscape—the news deserts and the loss of smaller communities’ newspapers—stretches back farther, Doland said.
“I think we’re on this train of disruption in the media landscape that really accelerated in the early 2000s with the internet all of a sudden becoming the place where things that used to happen in newspapers started happening online,” she said.
That “digital disruption,” Doland continued, “precipitated the loss of news organizations across the country,” including the loss of newspapers. “And that process of newspapers closing their doors makes people freak out,” she said, “because we know that high quality local news correlates directly with civic health.”
That’s why numerous philanthropic organizations and other groups have become increasingly focused on local news, she said. “They want to help,” she said. “They want to improve communities.”
While the study affirmed what its authors already knew about the areas of news deserts across the state, lost newspapers and shrinking television coverage, it also revealed emergent new community media efforts.
“Doing this research was good for us to learn about some of the great things that are out there,” Doland, “some of the new, fun, cool things where there is energy and innovation and creativity happening.” One example she cited is the Cloud Croft Reader, a newsletter whose creators, she said, recently completed the LNF news accelerator training program. “Now they’re growing,” she noted. “They’re doing great work down there.”
Which is not to say that all media endeavors made the cut for the New Mexico News Map and accompanying database.
Retired UNM journalism Professor Michael Marcotte, president and owner of MVM Consulting, says an analysis of New Mexico’s news ecosystem nearly a decade ago laid some of the foundation for a more recent study. (Courtesy photo)
“We kind of set a bar for local news,” Marcotte said. “Are you actually doing local news, or are you just saying words that people confuse as news. Do you have a journalist working there? Are you reporting it? Do you have an ethical code? We made this sort of fine-tuned distinction between what I’m just going to call noise versus news.” As a result, an original list of 360 outlets was whittled down to 139, he said.
Ultimately, the report highlights what’s lacking in the state’s news ecosystem, but also provides actionable recommendations for addressing them. Those include expanding funding for small, rural and tribal news outlets, but also improving broadband access across the state, strengthening training programs and diversifying revenue streams, to name a few.
“One of the primary users of this report, we hope, is the general public,” Marcotte said. “We think the general public should be well informed of what local news is, who’s doing it, where is it happening…and the best we can hope is [for people to] support local journalism.”
But given all the different interest groups: news creators, consumers and funders, Doland said another important recommendation lies in the need for ongoing collaboration.
“One of New Mexico’s great positives and opportunities and successes so far is this level of collaboration between the university and the industry; between the non-profits and the for-profits …between the Local News Fund and the community foundations,” Doland said. “All of this is really good connection so far, and we encourage people to build on that.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newsmap-920x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-28 07:57:51.337645

Jones was semiretired and looking for a way to leverage their property for additional income. One night, they decided to dive into farming mushrooms. After a few late-night online purchases, Root 54 Farm was up and running.
They made some mistakes along the way. But with the help of a now-defunded program from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they spend almost 15 hours a week traveling to various farmers markets and selling to other buyers in Sedalia, Joplin and Springfield.
“Owning a business is overwhelming,” Jones said. “Farming is overwhelming. When the two come together, it’s super overwhelming. So we are really grateful to people who help.”
The Heartland Regional Food Business Center was a part of a Biden administration program aimed at increasing the resilience of local food systems following the COVID-19 pandemic. The program aimed to help small and midsized farms with things like market access and technical assistance to help them grow and maintain their businesses.
But under Trump administration budget cuts, USDA terminated the program.
Now, its leaders are figuring out how to move forward under a new moniker — the Heartland Regional Food Business Coalition — and without the millions of dollars in federal funding once used to support their work.
The program reimbursed farmers for big purchases and helped make connections between farmers and potential buyers. Jones and Munro were never selected for monetary support, but the connections they made helped their business take off.
“We met a lot of the people we needed to meet,” Jones said.
 What’s next for the regional food business centers? 

Heartland was one of a handful regional food business centers established by the USDA. It officially launched in 2023 to help farmers across Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and some Arkansas counties.
The group was slated to get $25 million in funding over four years. But it only made one round of grants to farmers before the rest of the funding was rescinded this summer.
In the only round of grant funding under USDA, Heartland provided nearly $4 million in financial assistance to 90 farmers after receiving nearly 500 applications from across the region.
Heartland was preparing for the second round of Business Builder grants — nearly $9 million in funding — and expected over 1,000 farmers to apply. Instead, it got word that federal funds may be pulled.
The group and its farmers ended up waiting six months to see if that money would actually be paid out.
One farmer was a sunflower producer who was looking for funds to upgrade his packaging process.
“He was ready and poised to expand his market this year,” said Katie Nixon, who currently shepherds the coalition through New Growth, a rural community development corporation in El Dorado Springs, Missouri.
Because the funding comes as reimbursements, farmers had to make the upgrades before they could see any of the money.
“You’re paralyzed — you’ve gotten this grant and they say, ‘If you spend the money, you’re not going to get reimbursed,’” Nixon said. “So do you say, ‘Well forget it, I’m just going to go my own way and lose $50,000, or do you wait?’”
Along with programs like Local Food for Schools, which was also eliminated earlier this year, the federal initiative was part of a larger effort to promote local food systems across the country.
“They took the conditions of the region and really focused to amplify that to provide an unmet demand from the rest of the nation,” said Hannah Quigley, a policy specialist at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition. “They were investing in scaling very regional specialized products.”
Support from the regional centers across the country resulted in more than 2,600 new partnerships between farmers and buyers, a June 2024 USDA brief said.
The June data also showed the program taking off. Farmers were starting to report improved processing, distribution, storage and aggregation of regional food products as a result of the support from their regional centers under the initiative.
Part of the reason for the success is because the money was there to actually keep people involved in the conversation. There are so many demands on small farmers, Nixon said. Without the possibility of some financial support, it can be difficult to prioritize where to spend your time.
“This just helped (relationships) become stronger and more formalized, because you had money to help keep people at the table,” Nixon said.
“We know that a lot of food and farm businesses came to us for technical assistance because they saw the Business Builder opportunity,” Nixon said. “So having that funding to be able to offer really gets people motivated.”
Only a small portion of federal farm support goes to producers of specialty crops, which includes produce like fruits and vegetables or nursery crops, Quigley said.
In the 1970s, the U.S. was a net exporter of those specialty crops. By the mid-1990s, it became a net importer. Still, in 2020 speciality crops contributed nearly $54 billion to U.S. agriculture’s $363 billion in cash receipts, USDA data from 2022 show.
“We have plenty of land and the way that our food system is organized right now, with commodity crops — most of those are grown specifically to send somewhere else to export,” Nixon said. “What if even just a sliver of that energy was actually to domesticate real food products?”
For smaller farmers, having dedicated support for funding and market access could make a huge difference in their success.
Heartland hosts monthly new farmer calls and connects farmers with established mentors to help them grow their specialty crop.
“They were connecting these farmers who might not have immediately known how to get connected to a distributor,” Quigley said. “I think a farmer could figure it out, but it might take them two full years, potentially three different growing seasons … to figure it out.”
From July 2023 to June 2024, the centers nationwide formalized more than 250 partnerships for their farmers. In the last six months of 2024, they finalized 466.
They were trying to reach the farmers who traditionally don’t receive USDA loans, Nixon said.
Nixon and her colleagues are looking for sources to make up for some of the lost USDA funding. But what exactly that will mean is still unclear.
“Local food is not easy,” Nixon said. “We’re trying to make it easier.”
 How to build out a regional food system 

Part of the difficulty in building up more regional food systems comes from connecting farmers to wholesale buyers who need large quantities of produce.
That was some of what the regional centers were aiming to address.
“In some cases, they connected small farmers to an aggregator, or someone who brokered purchases, then they were able to aggregate them, buy from all these small farmers and then sell to a single buyer,” Quigley said.
That structure could help incentivize larger purchasers like food banks, states or school districts to buy more local food.
Because of the control wholesale grocery suppliers have over those markets, it can be more difficult for businesses to stray away from what has become the mainstream model for buying food.
Quigley pointed to agreements the USDA has with states that let states take a more hands-on approach to local food purchasing.
“That brings those contracts down from a national scale or a 12-state scale, down to a single-state scale,” Quigley said. “It allows for a greater number of farmers and businesses to be able to successfully bid on those contracts. They don’t have to have a distribution network to serve 12 states, they can just serve a single state.”
A 2020 local food marketing survey found that the number of farms selling locally produced food fell by 12% nationwide from 2015 to 2020.
Still, Missouri is seeing some growth when it comes to produce farmers. The 2022 Census of Agriculture in Missouri found that the number of farms working in greenhouse, nursery and floriculture production had grown to 485 in 2022, up from 348 in 2017.
In 2021, more than 90% of the farms selling food directly to consumers were considered small farms.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)In any other year, the data that informs an annual report released every Thanksgiving by the Rhode Island Community Food Bank would tell the whole story about hunger in the Ocean State. 
But 2025 has been unlike any other year for the Providence-based nonprofit — especially after the recent federal shutdown disrupted benefits for 42 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including 145,000 Rhode Islanders.
Which is why the release of the annual “Status Report on Hunger in Rhode Island” will have to wait until late January.
“The recent federal government shutdown and SNAP delay has been our top priority this fall,” Melissa Cherney, the food bank’s CEO, said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “We remain committed to putting together a comprehensive report and providing an in-depth look at who is food insecure in Rhode Island that takes into account how the government shutdown has impacted food security in our state.”
First released in 2007, the annual report lists how many households across the state struggle to afford adequate meals, receive food assistance, along with policy recommendations on how to reduce hunger.
Last year’s six-page report focused on the need for Congress to expand federal programs like SNAP, which the food bank projected could help the 90,500 households enrolled at the time to easily afford three healthy meals per day. The report had also urged state leaders to reduce barriers for SNAP enrollment.
The food bank’s report typically relies on hunger data compiled by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health as part of its annual RI Life Index survey. But that survey is conducted in the spring. 
Food bank spokesperson Kate MacDonald said the data would not account for the rapid increase in food insecurity across Rhode Island observed this fall during the 43-federal government shutdown.
Food pantries in the state served around 100,000 people in the month of October. Pantries last year served roughly 84,400 individuals per month, which at the time was the highest total tracked by the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.
“We want to be able to capture that in our status report,” MacDonald said in an interview. “The data we’re working with has to represent what’s going on now.”
Food bank staff had to shift their focus away from completing the report during the shutdown i to ensuring there was enough food to distribute across its 137 affiliated pantries and other agencies, MacDonald added.
SNAP payments have since resumed now that the longest federal shutdown in history has ended, but the fallout continues, MacDonald said.
“Families who were impacted might be seeing these effects for a little while,” she said. “Families have made choices in what bills to pay and what not to pay.”
Then there’s the massive changes to SNAP under President Trump and Republicans’ signature tax legislation, known as the “one big, beautiful bill.” Under the new law, parents and older Americans will be required to meet stricter work requirements, and states eventually will have to share in the cost of SNAP benefits.
The law also cuts off access completely for refugees and other immigrants starting Feb. 1, 2026.
“It’s going to take some time for what that all means for people’s monthly benefits,” MacDonald said.
The food bank’s full 2025 report will be released Jan. 27 to coincide with Food Insecurity Awareness Day, when its leaders will gather at the State House and hold a virtual town hall to discuss the latest findings.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)How best to spend, save and raise money will be a recurring theme when Washington lawmakers convene in Olympia next week for their annual “committee days.” 
The state is facing a budget shortfall that’s poised to dominate the 2026 session, which begins Jan. 12.
Data centers, vaccine safety, bridges hit by trucks, and the states mounting legal payouts are other issues to be tackled in the three days of work sessions, which start Wednesday.
This year, both chambers will be in town at the same time. It will provide a sense of the pace and tenor of policy debates to come in next year’s 60-day session.
Wednesday, Dec. 3, is reserved for meetings of seven committees composed of House and Senate members. On Thursday and Friday, individual House and Senate committees will meet starting at 8 a.m. each day. 
Data Centers will grab the spotlight at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday. That’s when the Joint Committee on Energy Supply, Energy Conservation, and Energy Resilience will hear recommendations of the data center work group established by an executive order from Gov. Bob Ferguson. A report from the work group is due to the governor by Dec. 1. Data centers consume large amounts of electricity, and more are coming online as artificial intelligence technology expands.
Also Wednesday, health insurance costs and vaccine safety will be on the agenda when the Joint Select Committee on Health Care and Behavioral Health Oversight meets at 3 p.m. 
Thursday will be dominated by budget-related conversations.
This year, Democratic lawmakers pushed through billions in new and increased taxes, along with spending cuts, to bridge a projected gap around $16 billion over four years.
Concerns about one of the largest new business taxes that took effect Oct. 1 will be a hot topic in the House Finance Committee at 1:30 p.m. Thursday. 
Senate Bill 5814 imposes new sales taxes on a number of services and is counted on to bring in $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1. Local governments will get a cut of the state sales tax proceeds. Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, the committee chair, has said the law needs fine-tuning to make clearer who is required to collect and pay the taxes.
Operating and transportation expenses will be showcased in four different budget committees meeting at 4 p.m. Thursday.
The Senate Ways and Means Committee has a packed agenda with discussions on future tax collections, growing lawsuit payouts, and state pensions. 
In the House Appropriations Committee, conversations are planned on the state’s budget outlook, plus updates on federal funding and Washington’s strained juvenile rehabilitation system.
Highway maintenance and preservation will be a focus of both the Senate and House transportation panels. The Senate Transportation Committee will devote its one-hour work session to the subject.
Meanwhile, members of the House Transportation Committee will get briefed on how the state Department of Transportation is dealing with bridges damaged by truck collisions. Also on the agenda is an update on the Washington State Ferries multi-billion-dollar electrification program.

Rich Draheim, R-Madison Lake, recently announced that he will not seek re-election in 2026, citing his belief in term limits as his reason for leaving the Legislature.
Draheim was first elected in 2016 to the state Senate, beating out then Sen. Kevin Dahle as part of the Trump red wave that flipped the state Senate and added state House seats to the GOP majority. 
Draheim has been a leader on housing, human services and mental health issues. 
In 2022, he was the chief author of a law directing more than $92 million to mental health initiatives, including services for uninsured youth and mobile crisis response teams. Draheim also advocated for the creation of the Senate Housing and Homelessness Prevention Committee — it had previously been grouped in a committee with agriculture and rural development — giving housing issues more attention in the Legislature.
Draheim is a business owner, having owned a marina, an event center, a wedding shop and other real estate investments. 
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you decide not to run for re-election?
I never really intended on being a politician, so it wasn’t on my radar, and someone asked me to run. I’ve always been a strong believer in term limits. To me, serving is giving back to the community, and I think the more different voices we have, the better we are. A lot of us (politicians) get sucked into that trap of thinking we’re all important, not remembering that the district is the people’s district, not our district. 
I didn’t want to pick my replacement, so that’s why I announced a year ahead of time that I’m not running — so people have the opportunity to get their ducks in a row if they want to run and then just go through the process like I went through the process 10 years ago.
What will you do with the time you get back from not being in the Legislature?
It’s unknown. I’ve been a habitual business starter, and I don’t think my wife’s gonna let me do that. So I will be looking for a new opportunity, a new challenge. I like to have new challenges, usually about every seven years, so I’m kind of overdue.
What are you most proud of from your time in the Legislature?
The effort. It’s a lot of work to run for office and take out an incumbent like I did in a purple district that historically had gone back and forth. I just worked harder than he did, and I knocked on door after door after door and talked to people, just trying to figure out, what are their needs? What do they think the state should be doing differently? 
I’ve been reporting for a couple years on this effort to build more housing in Minnesota. There’s a few ways you could describe it — zoning reform, rolling back regulations, taking away some local government controls. How real is the bipartisan push to build more housing in Minnesota, and do you think that the Legislature will get a big package done on this?
I hope people open up their eyes a little bit on that. It’s something I’ve been working on for nine years. I view everything through the lens of, the state’s responsibility should be to educate our kids to get a career-path job. That career-path job should lead to a pathway to homeownership. That pathway to homeownership should lead to a pathway to retirement.
We know that most people’s largest asset, overwhelmingly, is their home. We’re chasing perfection on the building code and zoning over the fact that people can’t afford to own a home. At some point, I think society needs to say, time out. I’m comfortable living in a house that has the 2000 building code instead of 2025. I’m okay not having the white picket fence, or the hard surfaces in the front, or I don’t need a three car garage or whatever it is.
I think we have to open it up more to individuals to pick what they can have. I mean, in most of the southern suburbs, you can hardly find a home for under $550,000 and I don’t know how these young people can afford it. 
I ran for my family and my kids, and I want to see Minnesota have an environment where, if they choose to buy a home they can afford one — of course, with hard work and savings and smart business decisions — that should be the goal, and I think we’re pushing away from that at full speed. You look at when Minnesota builds or helps pay for an apartment — there was just one last year that the cost of each individual unit was $631,000. We could do better. Our young families deserve better. Our old families deserve better. Our seniors deserve better.
The cost of everything’s going up, but the cost of insurance has gone up by double digit increases every year. And then property taxes, of course, have gone up.
I was reading the blog post you put out after the Annunciation shooting, in which you basically said the Legislature needs to work more on mental health instead of focusing so much on guns. What gaps do you think still exist in Minnesota’s mental health system, even after the work that you’ve been doing on this for many years?
We barely touched the surface on mental health. We’re so far in a deficit. If I was able, I would propose more training for our young people on how to cope. 
One of my colleagues across the aisle told me it wasn’t a mental health problem, it was a morality problem. Well, to me, part of being defined in mental health is what’s right and what’s wrong. We have a big problem — a large portion of our youth don’t value life, and that’s very scary. To me, a normal person, to think it’d be okay to stand outside of church or school and shoot up a bunch of poor, helpless little kids — that’s not healthy to even think about it, let alone do it or celebrate it. Or a health care executive, or anybody for that matter, a national pundit, whatever it is — we shouldn’t celebrate the murder of any individual. That’s a society problem, but I think our kids need to learn to cope. 
God made us all different. We’re all created a little different. We all are fortunate and have different triggers and this and that, but we’ve got to figure out how to live with it, and I don’t think we do a good enough job. I don’t think families do enough of a job to teach their kids, it’s okay, maybe you need to go read books, go shoot baskets, listen to some music, whatever it is. So I think we need to work on that.
What advice would you give to the person who has your seat after you?
It’s the people’s district. The funnest part of being an elected official was having to dig into a whole bunch of different topics, and every committee you’re on, you have to get caught up. Luckily, we have great staff in our caucus that help us get caught up and understand the federal programs, the state programs, the county programs, how they all interact. That’s a challenge — for every committee it’s different programs. That’s been really rewarding for me is to try to learn about a whole bunch of different topics.
Is there anything else you want people to know about your decision not to run again?
I encourage everybody to give back. Our society is so jaded right now, and I ran for my kids, and I ran to give back. I was at a point in my career where I could take a pay cut — which is a whole other issue — to give back to my region down here in south central Minnesota. We need more people that have life experiences to step up — no matter what their background, because all jobs are honorable — to give back to the state and run for office in some form.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/draheim-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 07:57:51.337645

“As the pace of change accelerates, we need to build a more adaptive and competitive state – standing still now only widens the gap,” Jeff Donofrio, president and CEO of Business Leaders For Michigan, said in a news release. “[Our plan] focuses on changing what’s within our control – three areas that, when working well, have the greatest power to change our state’s trajectory.”
Specifically, the plan calls for leaders to transform education, make Michigan the easiest place to build and grow and to modernize its approach to economic development to activate the state’s economic potential.
Donofrio argued that Michigan’s challenge in retaining talent and building its economy is not based on ideas or effort, but consistency and follow-through. 
“When priorities shift, progress stalls,” Donofrio said. “We need a long-term strategy that endures beyond election cycles. Other states have shown what’s possible when that happens.”
In improving education, the group’s plan calls for the state to ensure every child can read by third grade, tackle chronic absenteeism, set a high standard for a high school diploma, and seamlessly connect students to apprenticeships, college and careers.
It also recommends removing barriers to economic growth by supporting a culture of customer service, streamlining regulations and supporting communities ready to innovate.
In addressing the state’s approach to economic development, Business Leaders for Michigan called for the state to empower its regions and adopt a consistent approach for attracting and retaining talent.
Moving forward, the group said the state must have a plan that goes beyond one governor, political party or interest group, and it must be championed by the governor, built by the Legislature and sustained beyond political terms.
“Michigan’s future will continue to be defined by our ability to come together around a common vision for growth,” said Gary Torgow, the group’s chair. “If we continue to stay focused and work together, Michigan can endeavor to lead the nation in creating opportunity and prosperity for all.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A new report urges New Jersey to step up oversight of hazardous rail-borne freight nearly 13 years after a derailment in Paulsboro released tens of thousands of gallons of a toxic gas that left 60 hospitalized.
The new report from New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning Trenton-based think tank, seeks more transparency on train routes and the creation of evacuation zones along them to guard residents against toxic spills.
“Freight rail companies have spent years lobbying against safety rules while prioritizing their own profits over better infrastructure. Meanwhile, millions of New Jerseyans live in evacuation zones without knowing what chemicals are rolling past their kids’ schools,” said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst for the think tank and the report’s author. “Lawmakers need to stop letting corporate interests block protections that could save lives.”
What hazardous materials travel on trains around New Jersey? It’s a secret.

The report cautions that the state lacks protections to adequately guard the 3.6 million New Jerseyans who live within a mile of freight lines that could cause toxic spills or fires, plus the more than 1,300 schools and nearly 120 hospitals.
It also urges additional training and hazmat equipment for first responders and stricter safety rules for the trains themselves.
“Far too many people, including state decision makers, are not truly aware of the risk associated with the thousands of trains carrying hazardous materials throughout every corner of our state,” said Debra Coyle, executive director of the New Jersey Work Environment Council.
Gov. Chris Christie in 2017 vetoed legislation that would require rail firms to disclose train routes, citing national security concerns.
The report says that requiring train companies to report past cargo after a time delay and mandating that the Department of Transportation share bridge inspection reports with the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees hazmat control, could increase safety while allaying security risks.
Some officials have long eyed stricter disclosure rules and requiring response plans to hazardous spills from freight companies, but efforts to pass them have stalled in legislative chambers or on the governor’s desk.
Transportation committee chairs in both chambers are seeking to impose stricter rules on freight that would require at least two crew members to operate any train carrying hazardous materials and impose limits on train length. Longer trains are more likely to derail.
“More than a decade after the Paulsboro train derailment, too many New Jersey communities continue to live with the daily risk posed by freight lines that transport hazardous materials through their neighborhoods,” said Assemblyman Clint Calabrese (D-Bergen), who chairs the Assembly Transportation Committee.
The 2012 Paulsboro derailment released roughly 23,000 gallons of vinyl chloride — a toxic, carcinogenic precursor chemical used in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride polymers — after a conductor’s error sent four train cars off a bridge and into a creek.

Last month, the Federal Highway Administration approved Idaho’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, plans, Idaho Transportation Department Communication Manager John Tomlinson said. 
The NEVI program was created to develop plans for a network of connected electric vehicle charging stations located every 50 miles along designated interstates and highways, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
For several years a working group in Idaho had been developing plans, gathering public feedback and identifying potential sites for electric vehicle charging stations when the federal government halted all work on the projects and suspended approving state plans, the Sun previously reported. On Feb. 6, less than three weeks after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, Federal Highway Administration officials sent state transportation directors letters saying they were immediately suspending approving state plans and rescinding past guidance for the NEVI program.

State officials were told to await further federal guidance, which then arrived in August.
On Sept. 10, Idaho Transportation Department Director Scott Stokes resubmitted Idaho’s plans and requested the state’s share of funding for fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2026, the Sun previously reported. 
Stokes included a siting, feasibility and access study from 2024 when he resubmitted Idaho’s plans and pointed out the parts of Idaho’s plans that addressed the latest federal government guidance from August. But Stokes did not make any big changes to Idaho’s plans, which were updated in 2023 and 2024.
Last month, the feds approved Idaho’s plans, which gives Idaho the authority to get back to work on the state’s NEVI project, Tomlinson said.
“Now that the NEVI Plan has been approved by the Federal Highways Administration (FHWA), we will gather as an interagency working group again in the near future to discuss what delivering the program looks like in Idaho,” Tomlinson wrote in an email to the Idaho Capital Sun. “This will be with (the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho Transportation Department).”
Prior to being ordered to suspend work on the program, Idaho’s working group had begun narrowing down the list of potential locations for electric vehicle charging stations, including identifying potential sites along highway corridors near Pocatello, Bliss and Lewiston. 
Funding for the NEVI program was authorized under the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act that former President Joe Biden signed into law in 2021.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1232464216-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 06:56:20.238641

The Center for Effective Lawmaking analyzed the 118th Congress by party and chamber to determine who the most effective lawmakers were overall and by policy area. The Center is a joint partnership between schools at Vanderbilt University and University of Virginia.
On the Republican side, senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin and U.S. Rep. Tom Cole were highlighted in the report as being some of the most effective. 
The most effective lawmakers are determined by combining 15 metrics, including the number of bills sponsored, how far those make it in the lawmaking process and how substantial the proposals are, according to the report. 
Cole, who represents Oklahoma’s Fourth Congressional District and chairs the House Appropriations Committee, was ranked the third most effective House Republican. He introduced 20 bills and two became law. 
He was also named the most effective House Republican in the policy area of macroeconomics.
“I am a tireless advocate for the taxpayers, passionate about the need to produce a budget that can be utilized to defend our country as well as meet legitimate domestic needs, and willing to work in a bipartisan manner,” Cole said in a statement. “With that being said, I am so proud and honored to be named as one of the most effective House Republicans.” 
Lankford was ranked as the seventh most effective Senate Republican, a new addition to the top 10 list, according to the report. He sponsored 56 bills and two became law. 
He was also named the most effective senator of his party in the policy area of government operations. 
Spokespeople for Lankford did not return a request for comment by the time of publication. 
Mullin was named the most effective Senate Republican in the area of agriculture policy. His overall ranking among Senate Republicans was 37th. 
“As a lifelong cow-calf rancher, agriculture is truly a way of life for us in Oklahoma,” Mullin said in a statement. “In the Senate, I’m fighting to ensure our farmers and ranchers are heard in the legislative process. … While I appreciate the recognition as the most effective Senate Republican for ag, we’ve got more to do. I’ll always put our ag community first and do everything in my power to protect our rural way of life for generations to come.”

Saying farewell to Wyoming is a hard thing. A WyoFile reporter bemoans doing it twice. 
The post A Wyoming goodbye, again appeared first on WyoFile .","I took this photograph in January, just days after moving back to Wyoming from California. 
It’s the view out the window above my desk in WyoFile’s Laramie office. After four years living in California, the visage this day, with snow on the roofs and sidewalks and the sun fading prettily behind the mountains, was a nice welcome home. 
The photograph contains within its frame much of what I love most about Wyoming — the quiet and the community. The rooftops and footprints remind me that beneath Laramie’s complications and contradictions lies the bedrock of a village mentality. It’s a place, like so many towns in Wyoming, where people have gathered together in the middle of an empty, often harsh landscape to build lives together.
Saying goodbye to Wyoming is a hard thing. When I left in the winter of 2021, I had spent five years at WyoFile, the start of my journalism career. I’d lived in Lander, Gillette, Cheyenne and Laramie and filed stories from most towns in the state, as well as a few from a mobile hotspot on a roadside. Leaving on Interstate 80, my heart tugged me backward. Driving west felt like post-holing through deep snow, with a hard-blowing Wyoming headwind to boot. 
One would have to be crazy to say goodbye to Wyoming twice. Alas, I am crazy, or at least restless, so come next week, I’ll be doing just that. In late October, I took a job at the Sacramento Bee covering California’s Legislature. It has been wonderful living in Wyoming again and working with the expanded and ever-more talented team at WyoFile, but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to write about one of the most-watched statehouses in the country. 
So soon enough, I’ll be packing my belongings and battling those headwinds and heartstrings back down Interstate 80, headed west on the highway I drove east on just a year ago. Who knows, maybe the local U-Haul dealer still has the trailer I rode in with. 
My stay this time around was far too short, but at least I packed in a lot of Wyoming. I wore out the tires on my truck chasing stories into Riverton, Rock Springs, Torrington and points in between. I watched the falling sun turn the walls of the Wind River Canyon pink after catching a hard-fighting rainbow trout — and losing more than a few. I bit my skis into untracked powder as I swooped through the silent forests of the Snowy Mountain Range. I clutched my suit jacket tighter around my body and cursed politicians, politics and the very idea of “the news” as I walked through the biting morning wind to the statehouse in Cheyenne. And I swung open the red metal door of a Laramie dive bar, stepping out of the winter night and into the good cheer of a room full of people I know and am fond of. 
So, I hate to leave you again. And who’s to say I won’t ask you to take me back again. But for now it’s goodbye again, Wyoming. There is, quite certainly, no other place like you.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Every home game, Memorial Stadium becomes Nebraska’s third-largest city for roughly three hours, as it will Friday against Iowa.  
Nebraska football and sports are as close to religion as the Cornhusker State’s people will allow. The university’s 85,000-seat stadium has sold out every home game since 1962, feeding more than $1 million in economic impact into the state every weekend the Huskers play at home.
Volleyball engenders similar levels of devotion, selling out the 10,000-seat Bob Devaney Sports Center and packing local restaurants and bars. But those two sports are hardly alone, as other Nebraska athletes know.

Playing for the Huskers also has its advantages in state politics. Several Nebraska athletics alums have run for political office, ranging from school and university boards to Congress and the Governor’s Mansion.
The house’s current occupant, Gov. Jim Pillen, is a former University of Nebraska defensive back, a former NU regent and a hog producer. But he is perhaps best known for recovering a game-sealing fumble against Oklahoma in 1978.
His first campaign for governor ran a biographical advertisement in 2022 recalling that moment in scarlet and cream. Nebraska earned an Orange Bowl berth with the win and shared the Big Eight football title with the Sooners. 
“And Beat Oklahoma,” Pillen said in the political ad. “I mean … lead the nation in job creation.”

Not all Big Red political candidates succeed, University of Nebraska-Lincoln political science professor Kevin Smith said, but playing for the Huskers gives them some “goodwill” at a time when public skepticism and cynicism reign. 
“We’re living in an era where expertise is mistrusted fairly extensively,” Smith said. 
The value of celebrity in politics isn’t new. 
Long before President Donald Trump revived belief in its power, there was former President Ronald Reagan, a movie star. Another west-coast movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, joined Reagan in serving as California’s governor. 
Even traditional politicians seek celebrity endorsements to reach different pockets of people in the hopes of boosting voter turnout. One recent example: Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign touted endorsements from Beyoncé, Leonardo DiCaprio and Taylor Swift, to name a few. Harris won Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Trump won statewide.

In Nebraska, the Huskers are local celebrities. And the list of current, past and potential candidates with ties to NU athletics is long.
Former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, a Republican candidate in Nebraska’s 2nd District for the U.S. House, was a backup quarterback for Nebraska from 1999 to 2003. 
Preston Love Jr., a defensive end in the early 1960s who was part of Nebraska’s Magnificent Eight, ran for the U.S. Senate twice in the past five years. The Democrat was the state’s first African-American U.S. Senate nominee of a major political party.
Jim McFarland, a tight end in the 1960s, served in the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 1986 and ran for governor in 1998 as a Democrat but lost in the primary.  
Hall of Fame college football coach Tom Osborne served three terms in the U.S. House representing the state’s rural 3rd district and lost a competitive GOP primary bid for governor in 2006 to an incumbent, Dave Heineman. 
Pillen, who still calls Osborne “coach,” played for the Huskers from 1975 to 1978.  Trump endorsed Pillen for reelection on Tuesday, and the president mentioned Pillen’s NU playing days in the endorsement.

Nebraska volleyball middle blocker Rebekah Allick was in a political ad for a successful ballot initiative that banned abortions after the first trimester in the state constitution, with exceptions for the life of the mother, rape, and incest. The ad also featured five Nebraska softball players, including pitcher Jordy Bahl.
“Out-of-state activists are pushing a radical amendment, Initiative 439,” Allick said in the ad. 
Allick, who is in her senior year at UNL, also attended the signing ceremony for State Sen. Kathleen Kauth’s bill that requires all student-athletes competing in public K-12 or college sports to play on teams that match their sex at birth. 
Former student-athletes Payton McNabb, a former high school volleyball player from North Carolina, and Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer, attended.

People at the time criticized the Husker athletes for participating.  Audrey Horn, a Planned Parenthood volunteer, told CBS affiliate KMTV that “Husker athletes are like celebrities. So [Protect Women and Children] are leveraging that name recognition, team recognition for their political goals.” 
Allick, speaking with the Examiner, said her experience with politics hasn’t been “great,” but said it’s more about her “faith,” adding that many student-athletes are scared to be political or speak on controversial topics because of the fear of losing sponsorships, popularity and even friendships.
“I have been told like ‘you shouldn’t use your platform,” Allick said. “‘You should just stick to talking about sports.’ But I’m a Christian. I’m a daughter. I’m a sister way before I was an athlete.”

Axiom Strategies Nebraska State Director Daniel Bass, who was directly involved in the ad, said the athletes appearing in the ad were motivated by their passion for the issue. 
“I can’t speak to their future plans, but they’d certainly have a bright future in public service,” Bass said. 
Part of the increasing value of celebrity in politics ties to the rise of populism. It has emerged as a driving force in today’s politics, as some voters have lost faith in institutions and seek alternatives. 
“Nebraskans have a great affinity for sports, and who’s a part of it … sometimes it can be really good [or it] can be a kick in the shins,” Pillen told the Examiner. “Just depends.”  
Pillen and nearly every member of Nebraska’s all-GOP congressional delegation attend most Husker games, as do many members of the Legislature. Former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., used to sell Runzas during Husker games.
Regular attendees include Republican U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, House Republicans Mike Flood, Don Bacon and Adrian Smith. Political candidates, including nonpartisan former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn has tailgated near the stadium. State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln, a season ticketholder, says he rarely misses a game.

UNL and other NU campuses provide access to a limited number of athletics event tickets to legislators as part of the university’s outreach as a state-funded institution, a connection that grows in value as state budgets get tighter. Athletics at UNL is self-funding, a rarity in modern college athletics.
Smith, the UNL professor, said a career in sports can only take people so far, as former players will eventually be judged by how they govern rather than their playing days, because politics is a “different ball game.” 
“Just because you’re good at one [sports], doesn’t mean that you’re going to be good at the other [politics],” Smith said.
Lindstrom, while in the Legislature, helped pass legislation that phased out taxes on Social Security income and pushed bills aimed at reducing income tax rates. He faced criticism for some of his votes, including on the death penalty and how to pay for road construction. 
Lindstrom told the Examiner he doesn’t know if he would be in state politics had he not played Nebraska’s football.
“There’s a lot of stuff behind the scenes that people don’t see with football and politics,” Lindstrom said.

Playing for NU helped Lindstrom prepare for interviews, stump speeches and debates, he said. He compared it to training in the off-season. Running for office takes discipline, he said, and campaigning takes a lot of teamwork — skills that he learned while playing football.
During his bid for governor in 2022, Lindstrom ran a TV ad that emphasized his “teamwork” as a Nebraska football player. It said he would bring “a new generation of leadership” to the state. He lost to Pillen, a fellow Husker alum.
Then and now, Lindstrom said he tried to avoid using his football experience as a selling point, because it could also be a negative, and he has government experience. He pushed back against his staff, who wanted to air a campaign ad for governor about him playing for the Huskers, saying it had been 22 years” since he played.
Smith, the UNL political science professor, said celebrity helps cut through a moment in politics when people distrust politicians.

Smith said the ways in which many people get their information also plays a role. Social media, for instance, has displaced much of traditional media for many.
As Sasse discussed during his most recent Senate campaign, people started treating party and political loyalty like their love of sports teams and religious affiliation, as non-negotiable loyalty tests that define how people interact with one another.
Said Smith: “We’re living in a highly polarized environment where people are increasingly taking politics as a core part of their identity.” 
This time around, Lindstrom plans to focus on his experience as a former state lawmaker, not his days playing for the Cornhuskers, in his bid to be the 2nd District GOP nominee against Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding. But people remember.
“We did it [for governor],” Lindstrom said. “Never again.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)When Thanksgiving rolls around, one thing Montanans pretty much all agree on is how lucky we are to be living in this incredible state.  As ecosystems and native species vanish across the globe, our mountains, plains, forests and rivers still support virtually all the fish, wildlife and native plants that were here when Lewis and Clark went through more than 200 years ago.  Given the largely degraded and degrading state of the rest of the nation and world, that’s pretty much a miracle — and one for which thanks is fully justified.
But of course, it’s not just the incredible landscape we call home for which to give gratitude.  In a nation facing intentionally planned political division and hatred of “the other,” Montanans aren’t irreparably split into opposing teams.  In large part that’s due to the very nature of where we live.  Howling winds, driving rains, temperatures dropping to well below zero and snowstorms that can dump feet in a day or less.
Montanans rely on each other far more than those living in concrete canyons shadowed by skyscrapers.  Here, no one asks what political party or “movement” you belong to before offering a hand to pull you out of a ditch, give you a hand hauling out an elk, or towing a boat with a bum motor back to the dock.  And that attitude, despite our differences of opinion on any given subject or issue, is what binds us all as Montanans under our Big Sky.
Yet, if gratitude is well warranted, so, too, is the flip side of that coin — which is the responsibility to maintain and restore for generations yet to come what we are so lucky to have been given.  And in that regard, public policy and the politicians responsible for developing and funding it are absolutely critical.
The simple truth is that Montana has been through the “rape and scrape” era of the state’s early years.  We still bear the deep scars left by cattle, mining, logging, and railroad barons and we’re still picking up the pieces and trying to put what was damaged and destroyed back together.
We took some hard shots, but we also learned the grim lessons of unregulated development and resource extraction, as reflected in our world-famous Constitution’s guarantees of the inalienable right to “a clean and healthful environment” and that “all lands disturbed by the taking of natural resources shall be reclaimed.”
While the visionary giants of the past are long gone, the benefits of the policies they courageously sponsored live on.  We still have wilderness — and the vast diversity of wildlife, fisheries and native plants that make their homes there. We still have wild and scenic rivers. We still have incredible national parks that are the envy of the world.
None of this was by accident. It took brave politicians who bucked the trends of their times, who stood up to the greedy extractive interests and their puppets in the state and national legislative arenas.
Now, with a flood of billionaires and developers bringing the next wave of destruction, pollution and irreparable damage to Montana, we need a few more brave politicians to see past their demands and “just say no” when the damages — particularly to existing Montana residents and landscapes — outweigh the dollars.
They’re coming for the rare natural amenities we still have thanks to the brave politicians of the past.  What we need right now are a few more brave politicians, those with the courage to say “Montana is not for sale” — and for which Montanans will be thankful long after they’re gone.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BigHole14-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-28 06:56:20.238641

(Courtesy of City of Omaha)OMAHA — An Omaha entity tasked with helping revive some of the most depressed neighborhoods in Nebraska is at odds with state officials it said are refusing to release $11 million in state funds needed for programming.
The Omaha Inland Port Authority, which was authorized by state law and created by the city to promote economic development in northeast Omaha, said it may have to turn to legal action. 
“It slows down our progress,” said State Sen. Terrell McKinney, who chairs the port authority board. “We had things on the table we wanted to launch.”

The North Omaha lawmaker, who helped champion port authority legislation, said the held-up funds should be boosting programming in the roughly 3,000-acre port authority district, including housing and entrepreneurial development. 
“It seems like an intentional effort to make things hard,” said McKinney. “It doesn’t make sense — if they want economic development in the state. I just don’t understand it.”
 ‘Sufficiently vague’ 

An Oct. 20 letter to the Nebraska State Treasurer’s Office outlines a back-and-forth that began in July, with the port authority requesting the funds it said it is due under law. 
Correspondence obtained by the Nebraska Examiner referred to a Sept. 24 response from then-Treasurer Tom Briese saying state law was “sufficiently vague that an immediate release of these funds to the OIPA would not be prudent.”
McKinney contends that there is nothing vague about the language, and he believes Briese, who was a former lawmaker, had consulted with other state officials.
He said Briese “blatantly refused to release the dollars … going against the state statute which clearly outlines what he is supposed to do.” 
Briese resigned as treasurer Nov. 3, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Fremont Mayor Joey Spellerberg to replace him, and Spellerberg was sworn in three days later.

The Examiner on Wednesday sought Spellerberg’s response to the standoff. Noting he was just settling in, he said he had talked that same day with OIPA executive director Garry Clark to set up a meeting about the funding.
The stalled funding comes as the State of Nebraska faces a growing, $471 million deficit. The Legislature is to begin its next session in January, with the Pillen administration and others on the lookout for budget trims.
Projects within the OIPA boundaries have faced some criticism in the Legislature. With installation of its inaugural nine-member board in June 2024, the port authority essentially launched. 
It oversees what many tout as the largest public investment of job and business creation in northeast Omaha’s modern history and has powers such as selling bonds to finance construction and infrastructure within its designated zone.
 Omaha mayor and Chamber CEO sign on

Clark was hired this past summer as the public entity’s first executive director. He is helping steer projects in the district, including a $90 million state-funded plan for a North Omaha business park and a $30 million grant from the state to seed an “innovation district.”
To help carry out Omaha operations, McKinney and then-State Sen. Justin Wayne, also of North Omaha, helped secure additional dollars for the Omaha port authority program by legislatively directing interest from state funding pots such as the Perkins County Canal and new prison projects. 
As a result, the board had expected to receive an $11 million installment in July — the funds the port authority says are being withheld.
‘Unlikely Viking’ foresees revival of Nebraska area ‘stopped in time’ 

The Oct. 20 letter to Briese was signed by Clark, McKinney, Carmen Tapio, a North Omaha business owner who chairs the OIPA finance committee, Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce.
The group asked that the interest funds be released by Nov. 3 and named the applicable statute that governs the process. 
“We are disappointed by your decision not to release these funds following our application sent on July 17, 2025. We are requesting a prompt response to hopefully conclude the matter without further delay.”
The group wrote that the state law provides for the grant award to be triggered by an application that is not subject to “further review” by the state treasurer so long as funds are available. 
“There appears to be no legal reason to refuse the award,” it said.
The group endorsing the letter said the Legislature has had “ample opportunity” to debate and amend pertinent language and “chose not to, respecting the compromises, negotiations and work to arrive at the final law.”

(Photo by Robert Stewart/Verite News)The city of St. Gabriel has zero major fast food chain restaurants, pharmacies or laundromats. But there are nearly a dozen chemical facilities within city limits and at least 30 within a 10 mile radius.
“We have bad smells here at night,” said Reginald Grace, 72, a retired counselor and lifelong resident. “Like a rotten egg, like chlorine.”
The air on a regular day in St. Gabriel is acrid — but many residents seem not to notice anymore. Grace has spent the last 10 years organizing residents against the growing chemical industry. The city is located in Louisiana’s infamous “Cancer Alley” — an 85-mile stretch of land between Baton Rouge and New Orleans home to over 200 industrial facilities along the Mississippi River, where the risk of cancer from industrial air pollution is the highest in the nation.
In the past few years, Grace said several of his neighbors have been diagnosed with or died of cancer. His wife of 41 years, Rhonda, had breast cancer, ovarian cancer and leukemia, which she died of in 2023, despite having no known family history of any of the three, Grace said. He added that he is in remission from prostate cancer.
St. Gabriel is home to the Syngenta agrochemical facility, which repackages a popular but highly toxic farming pesticide known as paraquat under the brand name Gramoxone before it is distributed to other states. The plant is owned by the Chinese company SinoChem Holdings Ltd.
A report released in October by Coming Clean, Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and Pesticide Action and Agroecology Network warned of the dangers of paraquat exposure. Banned in over 70 countries, it remains one of the most commonly used chemicals by farmers in the United States for weed management — with the largest point of entry in the last eight years being the Port of New Orleans, according to Jim Vallete, a contributing researcher to the report.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that inhaling paraquat can cause lung damage. Some research shows that exposure to the chemical is associated with Parkinson’s disease, including a 2020 Louisiana State University study that concluded there was a greater risk of the disease in areas where pesticides, including paraquat, were used. There is currently litigation in Illinois federal court involving over 5,000 people suing Syngenta for alleged development of Parkinson’s from exposure to paraquat.
A sign for Syngenta’s facility, the agrochemical community at the heart of a recent study on paraquat, sits in front of a parking lot with industrial buildings behind it in St. Gabriel on Oct. 22, 2025.

An Environmental Protection Agency memo from 2017 noted that the chemical is so toxic that “one sip can kill.” The same memo said even minimal contact can cause serious injury to the eyes and skin.
The paraquat report includes several statements from farm workers across the country who have allegedly suffered harmful health impacts from exposure to the pesticide. Paraquat has also been linked to cancer and childhood leukemia, the report finds. From production to distribution to application, the report concludes that factory workers, port workers and farm laborers are all at risk of unsafe exposure.
Syngenta declined Verite News’ request to comment on its factory’s health and environmental safety regulations as well as the use of paraquat in Louisiana farming. The facility’s parent company’s home country, China, banned the domestic use of paraquat in 2016.
Human Rights Watch reported last year that Cancer Alley residents commonly suffer from respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic coughs and sinus infections. Migraines, miscarriages and dementia are also common complaints among St. Gabriel residents, according to Grace.
He added that he and other local activists — many of whom said they appreciate the close-knit community, childhood memories and laidback feel of the town —  are not asking for all of the plants to close down. They just want stricter monitoring of the impact on the environment.
“I’m not advocating cutting the plants out,” Grace said. “I know they’ve invested a lot of money into it, but what are you going to do, put money over safety?”

Made with Flourish

Ongoing debate on chemical safety
St. Gabriel incorporated as a city in 1994 partially to have more of a say against the growing chemical industry. The population decreased from a peak of 7,500 in 2020 but is once again growing as of 2022 according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Grace said the area has become popular with retirees from Baton Rouge looking for peace and quiet. Today, the population of roughly 6,800 must travel to the neighboring cities of Baton Rouge or Gonzales for jobs and many basic necessities such as medical care and fresh groceries.
“There’s nothing in this community. It’s a city, but there are no amenities,” Grace said. “People who grew up here, the children, don’t stay.”
Following the publication of the paraquat report last month, Verite News reporters visited St. Gabriel and the surrounding area to speak with residents about their ongoing efforts to minimize the harmful effects of living in an industrial hotspot.
Leroy Conish, 69, owns and operates a farm in Vacherie, downriver from St. Gabriel in St. James Parish. He’s aware that his farm is located in Cancer Alley and said he’s never used a product containing paraquat and aims to gradually eliminate the use of synthetic chemicals on his fields.
“We don’t really need to have the amount of chemicals that we use, because we can go back to farming the way our grandfathers and great-grandfathers used to farm,” Conish said.

Of the 10 acres Conish currently farms, roughly one acre contains no chemicals at all. Conish said once he learns how to make his model cost-effective, he wants to help bring about a farming revolution that helps low-income families in the area learn to sustain themselves in a healthy way.
Conish grows plenty of okra, which he said has antioxidants that he believes fight cancer — especially important “being in an environment that is filled with cancer emissions coming from every direction,” he said. Medical research has yet to conclusively prove that antioxidants do prevent cancer.
Many of Cancer Alley’s chemical plants are located in or near poor and mostly Black neighborhoods. As a Black farmer, Conish added that he believes chemical plants in the area take advantage of the region’s poverty. He wants to see greater regulation of the plants.
“Chronic poverty is a vestige of slavery,” he said. “Without chronic poverty, they wouldn’t have the opportunity to take advantage of poor people and promise them jobs, and I use the word ‘promise’ loosely.”
In a statement to Verite News, David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, called paraquat “a vital chemical to our farmers.”
“Farmers around the world have moved to adopt no-till farming, but this is only possible because herbicides like paraquat are used to control weeds while keeping soil undisturbed,” Cresson wrote. “It remains a widely utilized herbicide due to its fast-acting control of resistant weeds, compatibility with conservation tillage, and lack of residual soil activity.”
Herbicides are a type of pesticide that target weeds and unwanted vegetation.
Cresson added that U.S. regulatory agencies have reviewed scientific studies on the links between paraquat use and Parkinson’s disease and have not found a causal relationship. He did not address why 70 countries have banned the pesticide for health and safety reasons.
Navigating a shared space
Jan Drinkwater, 77, moved to East Iberville, just outside of St. Gabriel, more than 40 years ago. A breast cancer survivor, she said she was not informed of the air pollution in the area beforehand and wishes the agrochemical industry was better regulated.
“We have terrible odors from time to time,” she said. “This is current and frequent. … Why can’t they put that on the news?”
Drinkwater said as a resident, she should be made aware of what she is breathing. She added that despite the health risks, she still enjoys many enrichment activities at the St. Gabriel senior center and does not mind the lack of businesses in the city.
“I didn’t really move here for restaurants,” she said. “I wish it could remain rural … I would never want to go anywhere else.”
Melvin Craige, 75, has known Grace since childhood. Previously the director of St. Gabriel’s community center, Craige said he’s seen how the chemical industry contributes to the community by making investments such as refurbishing the community center’s weight room.
“When I was a director, they did all of the equipment and everything in the community center. They did a heck of a lot of programming,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Craige said he is also aware of scientific research pointing to links between the industry and medical problems facing residents.
“We just buried one of my cousins here Saturday who died of cancer,” he said.
Craige said he would like to see the community and the industry cooperate even more to monitor emissions to ensure better health conditions for the people of St. Gabriel.
One forum that the community and the industrial sector use to communicate on employment opportunities, safety and environmental concerns and industry expansion is the local community advisory panel. The East Iberville Community Advisory Panel has existed since at least the 1990s, and it currently meets every other month on Syngenta property, according to advisory panel members who spoke with Verite News.

Alex Robertson, 56, who has lived in St. Gabriel since his childhood, has been attending the panel’s meetings for about a year.
“We always sit back and complain, and we say what somebody is not doing, but the question is, ‘What are you doing?’” Robertson asked.
Robertson said he worked at the Koura plant in St. Gabriel for 30 years. Now retired, he remains a youth pastor at the Iberville Christian Center. He said his professional success is a testament to the industry providing well-paying jobs. He also said chemicals produced in the city contribute to everyday products Americans use to make their lives better.
But a recent Tulane University study showed Black Louisiana residents live in areas most affected by industrial pollution, yet make up the smallest portion of the industry’s workforce. Iberville Parish, where St. Gabriel is located, was shown to be home to the third largest share of the highest-paying manufacturing jobs in the state — but people of color were underrepresented among these positions.
Robertson joins the advisory panel’s meetings as a volunteer and liaises with the St. Gabriel City Council at public meetings on matters pertaining to the industry. He said he believes in the importance of the industry being a “good steward” to the community, by providing more high-paying jobs to local residents and offering educational opportunities — such as having plant engineers tutor kids at the local schools.
Good stewards should also not pollute the city, he said, and if they do, they should be upfront about it with the community.

‘The fight is not over with’ 
In addition to helping lead Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel, a local advocacy group, Grace sits on the board of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN), an environmental not-for-profit.
Grace said one of his biggest wins against the chemical industry was in 2017, when he and Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel members successfully fought against Adsorbent Solutions, a local carbon reactivation plant that had sought to expand its operations.
“We told the council, if y’all do this, you’re killing your own people,” Grace said.
The St. Gabriel city council voted unanimously against the proposed expansion in April 2017. Adsorbent Solutions closed down its facility shortly after the vote.
Marylee Orr, founder and executive director of LEAN, has worked with St. Gabriel residents to advocate for cleaner air since the 1980s. In 2023, LEAN installed air quality monitors along the Mississippi River, but was unable to do so in St. Gabriel.
“We tried, we waited, we went through all the right authorities,” she said. “But the experience with St. Gabriel was that the public entities did not want the stationary monitor on their property.”
Orr said LEAN plans to expand the air monitoring project and has not given up on installing sensors in St. Gabriel.


Let us know what you think...


 

Lionel Johnson has been St. Gabriel’s mayor since 2011. Despite multiple requests, he did not schedule an interview to talk about public health, the economy and the proliferation of chemical facilities.
“He’s a coward,” Grace said. “He doesn’t mix well with people, but he’s highly educated, and he talks at people instead of talking to them.”
Grace’s son Kyle ran against Johnson in the last mayoral election in 2023, losing by only a slim margin. Kyle Grace’s platform centered on bringing more businesses to St. Gabriel, while Johnson focused on expanding city services.
Reginald Grace said he finds that much of the city has become “complacent” to the harmful health effects of the chemical industry.
“A lot of people are not educated to the fact that they can demand more,” he said. “They’re just trying to live from day to day.”
Grace said despite the health risks, he has remained in St. Gabriel all these years because of his family’s ties to the area and the difficulties of starting over somewhere new.
“I hope I live a few more good years,” he said. “Whatever damage has been done, it’s been done.”
Although the chemical industry has only grown in St. Gabriel, Grace said he urges the younger generation not to pack up and leave or cease their advocacy efforts.
“We’re trying to help the young people understand they have to get involved, they have to be educated and they have to work toward self-improvement,” he said. “The fight is not over with.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)Farmers across the nation are unlikely to be taking a check to the bank at the end of harvest — at least not checks big enough to cover their debt payments. But the government’s so-called remedies are a lesson in contradiction.
As statistics refute themselves, regulations harm more than protect, and trade barriers exasperate challenges facing domestic producers, the government’s role in farming is only adding to the red.
Government data ineptly grasps the financial condition facing farmers. On one hand, the United States Department of Agriculture predicts farm income will increase by 21.65 percent for 2025. But at the same time, direct government payments are expected to increase by 354 percent!
The government is confused by its own statistics and tactics. Despite improved net farm income, federal direct farm support is increasing while farms are dwindling. In all but Idaho, the mountain states exceed the national loss of 8.5% of farms between 2016 and 2024. Data clearly indicates that the numbers and/or tactics are overdrawn.
The only clarification comes for Midwestern farmers. According to the Federal Reserve of Kansas City, Midwestern farm lending activity expanded in 2024, with volume of new loans increasing 40% year-over-year. The story hasn’t brightened in the first quarter of 2025, with weakening agricultural credit conditions, while demand for farm loans continues to grow.
Unfortunately for Western farmers, the Federal Reserve of San Francisco only delivers a one-paragraph qualitative summary alluding to the assumptions of industry contacts. But local voices reiterate that the situation isn’t any better for the mountain states.
Fred Burmester, an Idaho hay farmer, said, “It was a really bad year last year. The commodity prices dropped a lot for us … and our production costs were close to the same.” Regarding an operating loan at 9.2 percent that Burmester took out, he said, “It’s going to take years to pay that back.”
State promulgated regulations also add to this financial difficulty for the mountain state region. In 2022, Washington experienced a 40% increase in farm-related expenses, thanks to the removal of the ag overtime exemption. 29.8% of these costs were attributed to an escalation in labor expenses, which had increased by 52% year-over-year. Another major contributor (10%) was expenses attributed to “marketing, storage, and transportation,” due to the carbon tax.
Tariffs exploit another vulnerability of the mountain states because of our reliance on imported agricultural inputs (like fertilizer) and the global retaliation toward American products. Idaho, Montana, Washington and Wyoming ship their agricultural products across the world, and these markets are not easily reclaimed.
The second Trump administration’s renewed trade war bounced the check on America’s farm resilience. These recent trade disputes revealed long-existing weaknesses in the agricultural economy. Long-term consolidation and anti-competitive trends among agricultural input suppliers have steadily pinched the agricultural economy. Now, in the face of tighter supply chains and global trade wars, the vulnerability of a low-competition system is apparent.
When 70 percent of each market space is controlled by 2-3 suppliers, the companies have less economic incentive to be responsive to one farmer’s needs. A recent Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing even listened to testimony on these trends. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa, chairman) said, “America’s farmers are the most productive in the world. They take the risk, put in the work and feed the United States and much of the world. But they also operate on thin profit margins.”
These thin profit margins are quickly giving way to overdrawn farm accounts, despite the USDA’s estimates that the average net farm income was above $80,000 in 2024. For anyone involved in agriculture in the last five years, very few “average” farmers deposited such sums in their bank accounts. Nor is a recovery expected in 2025, with a record corn harvest overflowing the silos and continuing the price decline.
Yet, the government’s efforts for recovery are more like a teenager with a credit card, rather than a responsible party paying down the debt. Poor data collection outside of Midwestern farms, increases in state regulations, disregard for anti-competitive behavior, and resumed trade disputes all continue to hurt farm margins.
We need policies that improve resiliency and decrease farmer vulnerability to government choices.

A new Roanoke College survey shows Virginians trimming holiday budgets this year while shifting more of their spending toward gifts. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginians plan to dial back holiday spending this year, trimming budgets by about 5% even as the broader economy shows strong growth, according to a new Institute for Policy and Opinion Research survey at Roanoke College.
The poll found that households expect to spend an average of $1,035 this season in Virginia — down from last year — and they’re shifting how they spend, putting more toward gifts while cutting back on personal purchases and experiences.
That pattern echoes national signals of caution. According to the latest Gallup poll, Americans expect to spend about $1,007 on holiday gifts this year, nearly unchanged from the $1,014 forecast last year.
Meanwhile, the Deloitte 2025 Holiday Retail Survey found U.S. consumers plan to spend an average of $1,595, a 10% drop from 2024, indicating restraint in spending on goods and experiences.
 A shift toward “core” holiday spending

The Roanoke College survey, conducted Nov. 9–14 among 912 Virginians, shows a clear recalibration. 
Planned spending on gifts is up 10.6%, while personal, non-gift purchases — such as apparel, electronics and home décor — are down 16.5%. Spending on experiences like dining out and entertainment is down 19.6%.
That shift toward essential holiday traditions mirrors national patterns: consumers preserving the emotional center of the season while scaling back discretionary extras. 
Analysts attribute this to price pressure, job market concerns and tariff-driven cost increases. 
“Holiday spending plans reflect a balancing act between optimism and caution,” said Dr. Alice Louise Kassens, senior analyst for IPOR and dean of Roanoke College’s School of Business, Economics, and Analytics. 
“While the economy shows strong headline growth, households are tightening overall budgets, reallocating dollars toward gifts and away from non-essential purchases and experiences.”
Income brackets also shape spending expectations in Virginia. 
Fewer households plan to spend between $100 and $500; instead more are at the low end (under $100) or high end (more than $1,000). Lower-income households are concentrated in lower spending tiers, while higher-income Virginians more often expect to spend above $1,000.
 Strong GDP, softer labor market

The new survey arrives against a complex economic backdrop. 
National GDP growth remains strong: the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model estimates annualized quarterly growth at 4%. That underscores consumer spending’s role — roughly 70% of the total economy. 
Yet households may not feel that strength. Year-over-year inflation is at about 3%, and labor-market indicators are showing softening relative to 2024.
Those conditions align with national consumer-sentiment readings. While spending intentions remain elevated, confidence is cautious. Tariffs are adding cost pressure in import-heavy categories such as apparel and electronics — items Virginia households say they’re cutting back on. 
In fact, “the continued shift to online shopping, accounting for more than half of planned holiday purchases, underscores consumers’ desire for convenience and value in a season marked by uncertainty. For small businesses, this trend highlights the importance of digital presence and competitive pricing to capture holiday demand,” Kassens said.
 Digital continues its climb

Digital shopping is now the dominant channel in Virginia. The IPOR poll found that 56% of planned holiday purchases will happen online, up four points from 2024. 
That mirrors national retail-industry forecasts: in the U.S., the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurants) of $1.01–$1.02 trillion this year — a 3.7%–4.2% rise over 2024. 
For Virginia retailers, that means refining digital offerings and value messaging could be key. “Consumers are celebrating the season, but with sharper priorities and a watchful eye on costs,” Kassens said.
Overall, the IPOR survey paints a picture of Virginians trying to reconcile the mixed signals of the current economy. While GDP growth is robust, price levels and job-market clouds are giving households reason to pause. 
Across the country, many shoppers say they plan the same or lower spending compared to last year: Gallup found 56% of Americans expect to spend about the same, 23% less.
Other national studies capture that same tension. Deloitte’s survey found 77% of respondents expect higher holiday prices and 57% anticipate a weaker economy in 2026.
Many are employing value-seeking behavior: trading down brands, waiting for deals, and making DIY or handmade gifts. 
“Retailers should anticipate strong demand for early online promotions, streamlined delivery options, and competitive pricing strategies as consumers seek value and efficiency,” Kassens advised.

Justin Taylor/The Current GAWhat’s more bipartisan than a good meal?
Amid a number of contentious partisan debates, it can sometimes feel rare to find issues that lawmakers from across the aisle can agree on. But under the Georgia state Capitol’s gold dome — as in life — food often serves as a uniting force.
Lawmakers chewed on a number of food-related bills during the 2025 legislative session, spanning policies on lab-grown meat to which baked good is worthy of being Georgia’s official state bread. Here’s a few you should know.
Dinner with a side of foreign policy
As you sit down to eat this holiday season, your table may include an extra serving of Georgia state pride. Under a new law passed by the state Legislature earlier this year, two new dishes have become official state symbols, and the fourth Friday in November will be celebrated as “National Sugarcare Syrup Day.”
House Bill 233, introduced by Rep. Rick Townsend, a Brunswick Republican, designates Brunswick stew the official state stew of Georgia. The dish is generally made with a tomato-based sauce, beans, vegetables and meat — these days, most recipes call for chicken or pulled pork, but traditional Brunswick stew was historically made with small game meat, such as rabbit or squirrel.
Both Brunswick, Georgia and Virginia’s Brunswick County claim credit for the invention of the stew, in a rivalry that is unlikely to be settled by the passage of Georgia’s bill.
“Contrary to claims by other states, Georgia, and specifically Brunswick, Georgia, is the  birthplace of Brunswick stew,” the bill states.

Brunswick is also home to the annual Brunswick Rockin’ Stewbilee, which brings together stew lovers for a cooking competition, complete with live music, a car show, and a 5K race.
Ron Adams, one of the event’s founders and a longtime competitor, said that while there is a longstanding rivalry between the states, “it’s all been done, always with tongue in cheek and always in good fun, and nobody takes it too seriously.”
There are also a few regional differences between the two states’ versions of the stew, namely that Georgia’s Brunswick stew often contains pork, and tends to be chunkier than Virginian Brunswick stew. But at the end of the day, Adams added, each recipe is unique to the chef who cooks it.
“Brunswick stew has as many recipes as there are cooks,” he said.
Townsend’s legislation also includes a proposal from Rep. Kasey Carpenter to establish cornbread as the official state bread. 
Carpenter, a restaurant owner, said the variety of cornbread styles and flavors makes for a versatile, crowd-pleasing dish.
“There’s a lot of different flavors out there for people,” the Dalton Republican said. “Some people like jalapeños, some people like it sweet. The traditionalists don’t like it sweet. It’s pretty interesting, the diversity that’s out there.”
Though there was a small contingent of lawmakers who were vying for biscuits to become the state bread, Carpenter said cornbread was the natural choice for him.

“I like biscuits, but most people only eat a biscuit for one meal, people can eat cornbread for lunch and dinner,” he said, adding that cornbread’s Indigenous origins reflect the heritage of many residents of his northwest Georgia district.
“Cornbread has been made in the state of Georgia much longer than biscuits,” he said.
However, the revised bill was not immune from controversy. The Senate’s version included a measure that prevents state agencies from contracting with foreign adversaries such as China, prompting a wave of outcry from some Democrats who argued that the two issues should be addressed separately. 
The bill ultimately passed in a 113-51 vote, and was signed into law by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in May.
Both cornbread and Brunswick stew now join a list of Georgia’s edible symbols that includes Vidalia sweet onions (the official state vegetable), peaches (the official state fruit) and grits (the official state prepared food).
Next course
Lawmakers may have more food-related bills on their plate when they return to the capitol in January for the 2026 legislative session.
House Bill 65, introduced by state Rep. Angela Moore, would make collard greens the official state greens, and establish “potlikka” — a broth made from the boiled greens — as the official dipping sauce of the official state bread. For now though, the Stonecrest Democrat’s bill is stuck in committee. 
Other lingering measures are more serious and seek greater disclosure about the origins of the food we eat. House Bill 163, sponsored by Woodstock Republican Rep. Jordan Ridley, requires restaurants to inform customers when they’re serving lab-grown or plant-based meat. The bill passed the House, and is awaiting action in the Senate committee.
Another measure, introduced by Savannah Republican Rep. Jesse Petrea, would require restaurants to disclose the country of origin for all imported shrimp served to customers. The bill, House Bill 117, passed in the House but was tabled in the Senate near the end of the 2025 legislative session.
Though areas like Savannah are known for their seafood, reporting from Grist and WABE has found that much of the shrimp served at local restaurants is actually imported from other countries. The bill, Petrea said, is “about saving domestic shrimpers, and it’s about letting consumers know that what they’re eating is imported.”
If the bill is enacted during the 2026 legislative session, Petrea said he hopes coastal Georgia will be able to strengthen its shrimp industry, noting that he has already noticed greater awareness around local shrimp since the bill was introduced earlier this year.
“Just since that time, we’ve seen an improvement in the sale of domestic shrimp in our area,” he said, adding that he expects the bill will cross the finish line next year. 
“I’ve already gotten a commitment from the lieutenant governor that it’ll be a priority,” he said.

Drugs like Ozempic have grown in popularity to treat obesity, prompting more than a dozen states to pay for them. But with major budget pressures, several state Medicaid agencies are either stopping coverage altogether or restricting who can get access to the therapy. (Photo illustration by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Some states are rethinking their coverage of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss as budgets tighten and Medicaid programs brace for the cuts included in President Donald Trump’s broad tax and spending law.
As of Oct. 1, 16 state Medicaid programs covered GLP-1s for obesity treatment, up from 13 last year, according to a survey of Medicaid directors by KFF, a health policy research group. But some states have announced they will discontinue coverage or restrict who can qualify for it.
Many doctors and patient advocates say the drugs will save money in the long run by reducing obesity-related diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Many states, however, have concluded they just can’t afford them.
North Carolina Medicaid ended coverage of GLP-1s for obesity last month, citing shortfalls in state funding. California, New Hampshire and South Carolina have said they will end coverage on Jan. 1. Starting next year, Michigan Medicaid will limit coverage to people who are “morbidly obese.” Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin also are considering new restrictions.
In last year’s KFF survey, about half the states said they were interested in covering GLP-1s for weight loss, according to Elizabeth Williams, a senior policy manager at KFF who focuses on Medicaid. This year, most states are moving in the opposite direction.











This likely reflects recent state budget challenges and the significant, significant costs associated with coverage.


– Elizabeth Williams, KFF senior policy manager



“This likely reflects recent state budget challenges and the significant, significant costs associated with coverage,” Williams said. “After a number of years of robust revenue growth right after the pandemic, states are starting to see slowing revenues, increasing spending demands and a lot of fiscal uncertainty due in part to recent federal actions.”
In April, the Trump administration scrapped a Biden-era proposal that would have required state Medicaid programs to pay for some GLP-1s for obesity treatment. Earlier this month, Trump announced that his administration had reached agreements with the manufacturers of Wegovy and Zepbound to reduce the prices of the drugs for Medicaid, Medicare and consumers buying the drugs directly, But it’s unclear whether the deals will reduce costs for states.
Health plans for state workers also are reassessing their coverage of the drugs for obesity. North Carolina, for example, ended GLP-1 obesity coverage for state workers last year, and West Virginia canceled a 1,000-person pilot program.
GLP-1 medications, which balance blood sugar levels, have long been prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. All state Medicaid programs, which are funded jointly by the states and the federal government, cover GLP-1s for those uses.
But the drugs also curb hunger signals and can help people lose significant amounts of weight. Medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound have become wildly popular for that purpose.
Between 2019 and 2023, the number of outpatient Medicaid prescriptions for select GLP-1s to treat diabetes and obesity grew from 755,300 to 3.8 million, according to KFF. During the same period, Medicaid spending on those drugs increased from $597.3 million to $3.9 billion.
A study published last year in The BMJ, the journal of the British Medical Association, found that the number of patients without diabetes who started GLP-1 treatment in the United States increased from roughly 21,000 in 2019 to 174,000 in 2023, or more than 700%.
Biden wanted Medicaid to pay for weight-loss drugs. Trump just said it doesn’t have to.

More than 2 in 5 U.S. adults have obesity, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC defines obesity as having a body mass index — a calculated measure of body weight relative to height — of 30 or higher. Obesity costs the U.S. health care system almost $173 billion per year, according to the agency.
Recently, the manufacturers of some GLP-1s have lowered their prices, selling them directly to consumers for $500 or less per month. But many patients cannot afford to pay that much out of pocket.
States in a tough financial position
In North Carolina, Dr. Jennifer McCauley, a weight management physician at UNC Health, said Medicaid coverage of GLP-1s was “incredibly helpful for our patients.”
“Now they’ve stopped coverage, so those people are now going back, regaining some of the weight, because they’re unable to obtain these medications, and also are suffering the health consequences of obesity,” McCauley told Stateline.
Some critics of expansive GLP-1 coverage say it isn’t cost effective, because many patients gain back the weight they lost when they stop treatment. But McCauley said the “downstream effects of obesity are even higher.”
“There are definitely vulnerable populations that probably would not be able to obtain weight loss without these medications.”
James Werner, a spokesperson at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, blamed the coverage change on the state legislature’s failure to budget enough money for Medicaid.
In an email to Stateline, Werner said coverage of GLP1s for weight loss “would be reconsidered if Medicaid is fully funded.”
Some states are trying to maintain at least some coverage of the expensive drugs by tightening the eligibility requirements for a prescription, according to Colleen Becker, a project manager at the National Conference of State Legislatures, a policy research group.
“States are really looking at how to balance access and provide that access to patients, but they’re stewards of their budgets, and they need to be good stewards of it,” Becker said.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states considering such options. Meanwhile, Connecticut has decided to maintain coverage of weight-loss drugs for state employees, but to require beneficiaries to try online weight-loss counseling before they can get a prescription.
Some future possibilities
One state, North Dakota, has taken a different approach to GLP-1 coverage after legislation that would have required the state’s Medicaid program to cover the drug failed. Instead, North Dakota this year became the first state to mandate that insurers on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace cover the drugs for weight loss.
North Dakota Deputy Insurance Commissioner John Arnold said the insurance department calculated that the mandate wouldn’t cause insurance premiums to rise significantly.
“It’s not that anybody can walk into the doctor’s office and say, ‘Hey, I want to have this covered,’” Arnold said. “It is really for those who have a medical need for the drugs, then it would be covered.”
The insurance department had to ask the legislature for permission to make the change, according to North Dakota Republican House Speaker Robin Weisz. He said insurance carriers were concerned that it was going to be “open season for everybody who could lose 20 or 30 pounds.”
He said it will take time to see whether the policy raises insurance premiums.
“If the carriers can come in a couple years and say, ‘Wow, here’s what we’ve spent on these … we’ll take a hard look at it,” Weisz said. “But, it’s way too early to tell at this point.”
Arnold says other states may have the flexibility to consider mandating ACA insurers to cover the drugs.
“Our biggest concern was reducing those comorbidities and the long-term impact that that has on the cost of insurance in general, because more comorbidities means more claims,” Arnold said, referring to diseases and conditions associated with obesity.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-28 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Federal grants for Yale research on malaria were cut, but the work continues",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/yale-malaria-research-federal-cuts/,"Federal cuts to research have had real-world effects. But for one Yale researcher, the work has continued with alternative funding sources.","Amy Bei, a professor of epidemiology at Yale University, received the cancellation notice from the federal government on May 1. 
The $300,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health was for the first phase of research into a method for tracking malaria spread through communities. Bei had been finishing up that first phase when the notice came through. 
It wasn’t Bei’s first brush with federal funding cuts to research this year.
In January, she’d received a stop-work order from the federal government for a separate project in the central African country of Chad, where she was helping local laboratories introduce new technologies and build capacity for genomic surveillance across the country. She was told she could keep working temporarily on a limited basis, then she received the official cancellation notice in June. The project was funded through the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. 
Bei’s grants are only two of many at Yale and other Connecticut universities that have been cancelled or paused — or for which funding is expected to run out and not be renewed.
According to Lindsay DiStefano, the University of Connecticut’s interim vice president for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, the school had lost $41 million in cancelled grants and nonrenewals as of mid-October. The university has been able to provide about $1.6 million of its own money in the short term for certain projects, according to DiStefano. 
Michael Crair, Yale’s vice provost for research, said 50 grants had been cancelled as of Aug. 12. An additional 22 were either partially cancelled or ordered to pause, and 14 more were told they would not be receiving future funding. Crair said the cancellations amounted to “tens of millions of dollars” in research funds. 
“The loss of federal funding has delayed, halted, and put at risk research essential to advancing life-saving medical breakthroughs, scientific discovery, humanitarian aid, and technological innovation, among other important work,” Crair wrote in an emailed statement. 
Real-world effects of laboratory cuts
At Yale, Bei has been researching malaria spread in Africa since the early 2000s, when she went to Tanzania to study drug resistance and evaluate potential candidates for malaria vaccines. She said the experience changed her life.

“It really made me realize, this is not just a problem that we’re trying to tackle in a Petri dish, but this is truly a disease that has a just unbelievable toll in communities,” she said. 
Bei said when she began working in the field, the medical interventions to fight malaria were limited, and people were getting very sick. Although there’s been a lot of scientific progress since then, Bei said, the parasite has adapted to evade interventions like vaccines and medications.
“Whether you look at death, you look at morbidity, you look at days lost from school, or days lost from going to work, there’s so many different impacts that malaria has on everything from loss of life to even loss of being able to live and be a productive member of society,” said Bei. 
According to data from the World Health Organization’s 2024 report, Senegal reported about 1.2 million cases of malaria and 200 deaths from the disease in 2023. 
Malaria is a parasite, which makes it particularly challenging to vaccinate against. The parasite goes through different life cycle phases and displays genetic variations, making it difficult to narrow down a single target that can be used to protect against all infections. When it reproduces inside a human being, Bei said, the new parasites can appear differently in the body than the ones the mosquito originally transmitted, making the disease unpredictable for anyone trying to develop a vaccine. 
The biomarkers Bei’s project was researching, which originate in a mosquito’s saliva, have several uses. The presence or absence of certain biomarkers can indicate whether government interventions to prevent malaria spread — for instance, widespread distribution of mosquito nets sprayed with bug repellant — are actually preventing people from being bitten. 
The markers are particularly useful in geographic regions where most people aren’t showing symptoms of malaria, but the disease is still being transmitted, Bei said. As people become accustomed to the parasite, they are able to contract it without experiencing symptoms, hiding the fact that the disease may still be alive and well within particular communities.
“We have these areas of the country, and this has actually happened in Senegal, where you think there’s very little transmission going on, but actually there’s sustained transmission that is just kind of going under the radar, or because people are not coming in in a symptomatic way to clinics, but yet they’re still transmitting the parasite between individuals,” said Bei.  
Bei said a future goal would be to develop biomarkers that can distinguish between different types of mosquitos spreading the parasite.

Finding ways to continue the research
Since the grant cancellations, Bei said she’s gotten funding from the philanthropic arm of Tito’s Handmade Vodka to continue some parts of the NIH-funded work tracking malaria spread. 
Tito’s philanthropic arm and a few internal grants from Yale have also enabled her team to keep up the USAID-funded project in Chad, including a training her lab is offering on using genomic surveillance — observing how parasite genomes evolve in response to malarial interventions — to track malaria. 
Still, the loss of funding was disruptive. 
Natasha Turyasingura, a Ph.D. student from Uganda who is working on the Chad project, said she was planning to travel to Africa this past February to train local researchers in how to use a newly developed DNA sequencing panel to analyze the genetic makeup of malaria parasites found in blood samples that researchers collected from different parts of the country.
With a new vaccine recently available, the scientists were trying to understand ways the parasite might evolve to escape the effects of the vaccine, as well as forms of malaria that don’t appear on diagnostic tests or have become drug-resistant. 
But the U.S. government’s order to stop work on the project postponed the trip by nearly a year, as Bei searched for funding to continue the research. With those funds now secured, they plan to travel to Chad in December.
For Turyasingura, the Trump administration’s new priorities have also hit her personally. The length of her visa was shortened from one year to three months, making it more challenging for her to travel and conduct research outside the U.S. 
Meanwhile, other facets of the project in Chad were thrown into limbo. Efforts to meet with village representatives and community members to educate people about the benefits of vaccination, which were being supported through the USAID grant, are now severely limited. 
Bei also continues to relieve additional NIH funding for an effort to develop a “next generation” malaria vaccine. 
The World Health Organization recently approved two vaccines, one in 2021 and one in 2023, to be used in countries where malaria is widespread. But Bei noted that the vaccines have a low rate of efficacy. According to a 2024 World Health Organization paper, the 2021 vaccine was between 45% and 51% efficient in preventing malaria, and the 2023 vaccine was between 66% and 75% efficient. And that protection decreases over time.  
(By comparison, the vaccine commonly given for measles is 97% effective after two doses.)
Laty Gaye Thiam, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal, which collaborates with Yale on the malaria research, said the vaccine they are developing will attempt to complement existing vaccines by targeting a different stage of the parasite’s life cycle. As part of this work, he said, they are looking at the antibodies produced by people who are immune to the disease and identifying the antigens that those antibodies are responding to, in order to understand what factors are protecting those people from the disease. 
Bei said they planned to combine the research that Thiam and others in the lab are doing with her biomarker research to create a broad “panel” that will give researchers more information about malaria spread. 
Thiam, who is originally from Senegal, said he’s seen firsthand the damage caused by malaria. He’s had it himself several times. 
“Having suffered from that, and also being close to kids and infants that are suffering … from our field work, it is really a devastating disease … You can see that it has a huge impact, not only on the child who is sick, but even the mother or the dad who’s carrying that sick child. You can feel the burden of the disease.” 
Cyrianne Keutcha, a Cameroon native and postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Public Health who works in Bei’s lab in Senegal, said she remembers coming down with malaria around age 11. It was a case severe enough to keep her in the hospital for two weeks.
Keutcha is working with Thiam on the research into next generation malaria vaccines. She is testing whether a potential new malaria vaccine developed in the United Kingdom will be effective against the parasites found in the blood of people who are living in places like Senegal, where malaria is prevalent. Keutcha is looking to see if any natural variations in these parasites can escape the effects of the potential vaccine. The vaccine in the UK is in the early stages of being tested on volunteers. 
Keutcha said that much of the research they were doing on malaria could also be used to understand other diseases, ones that are prevalent in the U.S. 
“You are investing in knowledge that can significantly improve the wellbeing of a group of people that you may not know. However, that same technology can be used to significantly improve your well-being as well for another disease that is to come or that’s already present,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4336-1024x672.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 05:56:41.755994

With those words, Republican candidate for governor Charlotte O’Hara launched into her answer to my question: Why write and publish dozens of personal political columns on her campaign website?
“I think that many candidates speak in platitudes and they don’t speak in specifics,” O’Hara said this week. “That’s a real tradition. Candidates don’t want to dive into how they would approach a problem.”
The earliest versions of her political commentary likely started around 2008, when O’Hara (who was then the 3rd District Republican chairwoman) remembers sending out commentary pieces in a newsletter to state delegates. O’Hara now co-owns an Olathe business that manufactures plastics, including casino poker chips.
Her public life also includes past work as a state representative and Johnson County commissioner.
“When I was a county commissioner, I also did columns,” O’Hara said. “So I mean, this is not just because of the campaign. I think it’s just a great way to communicate with people. Most politicians don’t want to be that open with all of their opinions, but I think that the more that the community knows about you, that’s what you really want. It’s important for people to understand where you’re really coming from.”
O’Hara’s writing is certainly specific. Dozens of columns showcase her conservatism, both fiscal and social.
One headline asks, “Men in Women’s YMCA Locker Rooms?” She kicks off with these lines: “We have been so blessed with beautiful spring days. The season of the world awakening from winter’s rest. Now, if only we would awaken to God’s creation of Adam and Eve.”
In “Why is Kansas the High Tax Point on the Prairie?”, a sentence shows her mix of personal writing and focus on specifics: “As a commissioner, I voted no on giving a Chinese company, Cnano, property tax incentives at New Century AirCenter of 30 cents a sq ft. or approximately 12% of what they should be paying.”
O’Hara told me: “People know who I am. There’s not going to be any doubt about that. I pretty well lay everything out there. I’m not hedging anything when I write about an issue. I put it out there, what I think.”
Poetry and music are also avenues for O’Hara to express herself. She has written and performed seven albums of songs on Spotify, including her favorite song, “Last Lullaby.”
She has collected her poetry into a self-published book, “I Wonder.” Part of a poem she wrote this week includes these lines: “Or doomed are we / To be buried in this deluge / Of illusion’s complexity / And lost from our grasp, / Simplicity.”
O’Hara says that Doug Johnson, a political friend, edits her columns. She calls him “a political buddy. We have been in the trenches of politics for the last 30 years.”
Political cartoons accompany each column. O’Hara’s friend Tim McCabe provides caricatures (see Gov. Laura Kelly with blue hair and rainbow pride earrings) and symbolism (see Panasonic as Jabba the Hut gobbling cash) at the top of each page.
The bombastic combination of commentary and cartoons leaves readers — and voters — with a clear impression. As O’Hara says: “Boy, she’s conservative.”
O’Hara’s commentary appears in a few places: on four pages of her website, through an email list and on her campaign’s Facebook page.
“I think it’s just important that I communicate with the people on Facebook,” she said.
Three hundred and forty days before election day for Kansas governor, most candidates competing with O’Hara have campaign websites. The basic formula is a red, white and blue logo. Plus a bunch of family photos. Plus a few basic planks of your platform.
Some websites are spartan — just a single page. (I’m looking at you, Jeff Colyer.) Learning about the candidate’s political thinking can require watching a campaign video.
O’Hara’s writing puts her more clearly on the record. While I don’t agree with most of her writing, I admire her willingness to explain specific misgivings with how Kansas is being governed.
Sometimes, those positions situate her in an unorthodox political niche. She bemoans tax breaks for companies, which she calls corporate welfare. She blames both Democrats and Republicans for approving these tax incentives.
On the topic of President Donald Trump, O’Hara says the legislative branch needs to reassert itself to maintain power, pushing back on executive actions like the recent tariff increases.
“President Trump loves to consolidate power,” O’Hara said. “That’s just how he operates. And it’s not just him. This has been going on forever, but the Congress needs to be big boys. Put their big boy pants on — or however you want to put it. They need to recognize that they have a responsibility for doing their jobs.”
After writing more than 170 columns for Kansas Reflector, I can struggle to find a weekly topic. In fact, this week I asked two editors at the Reflector for inspiration.
For O’Hara, finding a topic is simple, she says.
“It just seems like that they just show up on my front porch,” O’Hara said. “I am a woman of deep faith, and so I pray a lot. They show up on the front porch, and I start writing about them.”
In fact, O’Hara had advice for me at the end of our interview.
“I would just encourage you to be more on autopilot,” she said. “See where your imagination and your creativity takes you. Instead of just (saying), ‘OK, this is who I’m writing for.’ No, it’s an honesty. This is what I’m thinking. This is an important issue that people need to think about. Here’s a different perspective.”

In the hush before dawn, ordinary men and women declared that kings were notdivine, that power was not sacred, that liberty was not to be begged for but claimed.The Revolution was not merely a war of muskets and tea — it was a covenant ofconscience, a vow that no tyrant would sit enthroned above the human soul.
Yet every generation must renew that vow. For democracy is not a relic secured in marble; it is a flame that must be fed — or it dies.

Carlton Highsmith
And so again, as in every age before, the ancient question rises from the dust: When the powerful demand our silence, do we appease — or do we oppose?
Appeasement always comes dressed in reason. It speaks softly of prudence and patience, of compromise and calm. It promises peace in our time — and delivers ruin in its wake.
In Munich, 1938, a man waved a paper and called it peace. A year later, the world was burning. Chamberlain’s mistake was not political but moral — he mistook cowardice for wisdom, and fear for diplomacy. He believed evil could be reasoned with, that tyranny could be tamed by tenderness. But history is clear: authoritarianism does not bargain. It consumes. And long before Munich, America knew that truth.
When the Kansas-Nebraska Act sought to spread slavery westward, Charles Sumnerrose in the Senate and named appeasement for what it was — “cowardice maderespectable.” For his words, he was beaten nearly to death, yet his voice still echoes while his assailant’s name has turned to dust.
In every age, moral clarity is punished before it is praised. When fear swept through the 1950s and Sen. Joseph McCarthy hunted ghosts, it was the courage of journalists and citizens — not the comfort of the crowd — that saved the nation’s soul. Edward R. Murrow stood before the camera’s eye and declared, “We cannot defendfreedom abroad by deserting it at home.”
And when Martin Luther King Jr. was told to wait, to quiet his march toward justice,he answered from a Birmingham jail that the greatest threat to liberty was not the Klansman’s rage, but the moderate’s silence — that “negative peace” which prefersorder to righteousness.
These are not shadows of the past; they are reflections in the mirror we face today.Once more, the drumbeat of authoritarianism sounds — this time cloaked in flags,cheered on by cynicism. We are told dissent is disloyal. That truth is a matter of opinion. That judges are political, the press deceitful, elections corrupt. That the Constitution is too fragile for the moment it built.
But let us remember: Silence is not prudence — it is surrender. Democracy does not collapse in a single blow; it decays through a thousand small surrenders. Tyranny does not storm the gates; it seeps beneath them.
It begins with the normalization of lies, the ridicule of truth-tellers, the corrosion oflaw, and the soft numbing of the public conscience. It seduces the weary with promises of safety, simplicity, and greatness — and in exchange, steals the very freedoms that make greatness possible.
The Constitution was never written to protect the powerful. It was written torestrain them.
James Madison warned that “ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”Our duty, then, is not to obey — it is to resist when obedience becomes complicity.Reinhold Niebuhr reminded us that evil cannot be disarmed by politeness, onlyconfronted by courage. Appeasement is not humility — it is the quiet betrayal of justice dressed in civility’s robe.
History’s verdict is unwavering: democracy survives not by the silence of thecautious, but by the courage of the convicted. It dies not from one great blow, but from the slow corrosion of conscience.
The patriots of 1776 were branded traitors before they were hailed as founders. The marchers of Selma were called agitators before they were canonized as heroes. Courage is always condemned before it is celebrated.
Appeasement offers comfort for a day, regret for a lifetime. Opposition demands sacrifice now — but bequeaths freedom to the generations. The question before us is no longer philosophical. It is moral. It is urgent.
The threat to democracy is not distant — it is domestic. It creeps in through cynicism, apathy, and fear. And so the duty falls, as it always has, to those who still believe — who still dare to speak when silence feels safe.
Let us, then, be counted among them. Let us answer history’s summons not with resignation, but with resolve. Let us rise — not in anger, but in allegiance to the idea that birthed this nation: that free people must never bow to fear. To appease is to abandon. To oppose is to affirm. Silence has never guarded liberty.
Every right we hold dear — to speak, to vote, to worship, to dissent — waspurchased not by the timid, but by the defiant.
The eyes of history are upon us now. The test is before us. And the verdict — as ever — will be written not by our intentions, but by our courage.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The holiday light show at Montgomery County’s Brookside Gardens is open for about a month and a half. But preparing for the show, which involves 1.5 million twinkling lights, is pretty much a year-round affair.
Practically right after each year’s show finishes in early January, staff members are already thinking about the next iteration of the popular event, said Jeff Patterson, the facilities and grounds manager at the garden.
“We’ll have a wrap-up meeting, and then [it’s]: What do you want to do for next year?” said Patterson, who’s in his 24th year setting up the show.
Brookside Gardens is not alone. Throughout the state, drive-through and walk-through light shows have become winter holiday mainstays that require hundreds of man-hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up every year.

In Maryland, popular shows take over parks, gardens, fairgrounds and farmland, beginning some time around Thanksgiving and extending past Christmas and often into the New Year.
The coronavirus pandemic reportedly boosted the concept’s popularity, with stir-crazy quarantined Marylanders eager for outdoor activities that allowed for social distancing.
The Garden of Lights show at Brookside, which is set up by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, has drawn 44,000 visitors each year, on average, dating back to 2022. Before that, tickets were sold per car, rather than per person, making prepandemic comparisons difficult. But anecdotally, COVID provided a boost, Patterson said.
“It increased visitation for a few years, for sure,” he said.
During a recent workday, with the show just a few weeks away, workers used zip ties to affix lights to a large tunnel, decorated to look like a caterpillar, that visitors will walk through near the visitor center. A second crew assembled another tunnel of lights in the yew garden, on the other side of the 50-acre garden within Wheaton Regional Park.
For the Brookside show, which opened Nov. 21, the design work begins in January, after which materials are ordered and then an in-house welder assembles the metal structures the hold the lights.
Patterson said the crew makes slight modifications to the show each year, largely adding more and more attractions, based on what set-ups are popular with attendees. Last year, the team added a group of pink flamingos near a lake in the gardens, Patterson said.
“That was a huge hit,” Patterson said. “So, this year we added palm trees and a whole bunch of other stuff out there.”
Producing this year’s show included a bit of a wrinkle: Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump (R) on goods entering the U.S. from China and other nations drove up prices on the raw materials and light bulbs that have to be purchased for the displays in the early part of the year. Patterson said prices changed so frequently that staffers had to check repeatedly before making purchases.

“We have price limits on what we can spend, being a government agency,” Patterson said. “So, we had to cut back some on supplies, because we had to pay a tariff. And that — I’d never seen that before. So, instead of buying 20 lights, we were going to buy 18 lights, because we had to pay that extra money in tariffs.”
The show’s overall budget is in the hundreds of thousands each year, Patterson said. Admission is $13.99 Sunday through Thursday and $16.99 on Fridays and Saturdays. Children 5 and under are free.
At Brookside, a crew of about a dozen seasonal workers begins assembling the displays in August, first putting together the metal silhouettes for the lights, and then shortly thereafter pulling the lights from four shipping containers, where they are organized by color.
During the off-season, some of the larger metal forms are stored beneath tall roof structures, including a giraffe and tall trees.
“It keeps adding and adding as the show keeps growing,” he said.
The show has also changed over the years. First came the transition to LED lights from incandescent bulbs, a time-intensive process that took place around 2015, Patterson said.
“It took us quite a few years to get all the forms done, because they were all incandescent,” Patterson said. “You have our giraffe, which has the most lights on it, that took three weeks to strip and redo.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The next big thing is displays that are controlled through cellphone apps, which spurred another transition for the staff at Brookside.
“That was a struggle at first — the learning curve of: ‘Oh, we have to get WiFi in the garden now to run all these things,” Patterson said.
The light show is hardly Patterson’s only job. As grounds manager, he also oversees irrigation, custodial crews and more. But it has become a significant part of his day-to-day.
“It’s a huge undertaking, and it takes almost every section here to make it work, from advertising to budgeting to all of our banners and signage we have to put up, and online ads,” Patterson said.

Library of CongressNine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.

But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.
Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined a lawsuit alongside 21 other state attorneys general against the U.S. Department of Agriculture over guidance issued by the department.
The lawsuit said the new guidance would eliminate eligibility for legal immigrants who had previously been eligible to receive such benefits, including those who had been granted asylum or refugee status.
The guidance, issued at the end of October, was intended to provide instructions on how to implement program changes passed in July as a part of H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which narrowed eligibility for noncitizens.
“The guidance in reality goes beyond the act, arbitrarily excluding from SNAP many lawful permanent residents who remain eligible under the statutory scheme established by Congress,” the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Oregon Eugene Division said.
Nothing in the bill, the filing continues, would prohibit individuals who were at one point refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees, now groups no longer eligible for SNAP, from gaining eligibility for the program if and when they gain status as lawful permanent residents. 
“The law is clear on who can receive SNAP benefits, yet the Trump Administration is trying to strip rightful recipients of the support they need to feed their families,” Nessel said in a press release from her office. “It is my hope that the Court puts an end to this unlawful guidance and stops the White House’s ongoing chaos and confusion over Americans’ ability to put food on the table.”
The lawsuit is seeking an injunction to the changes that would prevent states from implementing the eligibility changes in question.
Nessel and 20 other attorneys general sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last week asking for clarification on the new guidance, but they did not receive a response from Rollins.
The lawsuit also alleges that the U.S. Department of Agriculture misapplied its own rules on new regulations about SNAP error rates within states — the legislation passed in July gave a 120-day window for states to address their error rates, but the guidance issued in October stated that the window for that exclusionary period would end on Nov. 1 — a Saturday, one day after the guidance was issued. 
The calculation was done based on the day of the passage of the bill initially, not when the guidance was issued, which Nessel and the other attorneys general argue is incorrect based on federal laws.

President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration in mid-September. The storms the declaration covered happened May 18-22. At least 50 homes were destroyed in southeastern Montana during the storms and water supply contamination was also an issue.
“One of our core responsibilities at HUD is to help rebuild homes, businesses, and communities after natural disasters,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a press release. “We are supporting the Crow Tribe of Montana by providing financial flexibility and disaster recovery resources to those impacted by the recent disasters.”
In a press release Wednesday, HUD noted several options for those impacted by the disaster.
Recipients of Indian Housing Block Grants and Indian Community Development Block Grants can apply for necessary waivers and flexibilities for disaster relief. 
Additionally, there’s a three-month moratorium on foreclosures.
“A 90-day moratorium is issued on foreclosures of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as well as foreclosures of mortgages to Native American borrowers guaranteed under the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee program,” the press release said.
The move also allows individuals to finance the purchase or refinance of a house, along with its repair, through a single mortgage, the release said, adding homeowners can also finance the rehabilitation of their existing home if it’s been damaged.
There’s also further flexibility for those in various federal housing programs.

If not for a series of tones broadcasting her location, no one would’ve known she had died.
Like dozens of other Yellowstone National Park wolves involved in a three-decade-long study, researchers collared wolf 1331F as a pup in 2021 to track her movements. Gray with ribbons of brown fur fading into her pale muzzle and legs, the young wolf lived with the Wapiti Lake Pack, one of the largest in Yellowstone.
Wildlife photographer V.C. Wald watched 1331 supervise black wolf pups hunting a wounded bison on the shore of the Firehole River in the winter of 2023-’24. Easily visible from the road, the pups tried to take the bison head-on, only to scatter as it bluff charged. Then, 1331 demonstrated how to approach the massive ungulate more safely from behind, nipping at its hind quarters, Wald recalls, “[she was] a teacher, of young wolves, and of me.”

The scene isn’t out of the ordinary for the Wapiti Lake Pack, whose territory encompasses Yellowstone’s sagebrush-covered Hayden Valley in the center of the park. They chase elk and bison. They play and sun themselves on cold winter days. Much of this activity occurs under the gaze of humans. But every now and then, pack members leave the park.
In late 2024, Yellowstone Wolf Project telemetry data suggest 1331 started a journey away from her pack. She headed north. First, she spent time around Mammoth Hot Springs. Then she crossed the park’s boundary into Montana. While tourists often lined roads to watch 1331 and her packmates inside the park, wolf watchers are sparser in the rugged and mountainous mix of public and private land just north of Yellowstone. Wolf 1331 had no way of knowing, but she’d crossed an invisible line where the national park gives way to state rule. It’s a consequential threshold: Wolves are protected from hunting on one side, but can be legally killed by gun, trap or snare on the other.
Park officials don’t know if 1331 was permanently leaving her pack or if she would have eventually returned to Wapiti Lake’s territory; it’s not uncommon for female wolves of her age to disperse for days or even weeks leading up to breeding season in February — sort of a lupine rumspringa. But they do know she’d left the pack far behind. On Jan. 24, 2025, staff with the Yellowstone Wolf Project drove north of the park, wielding bulky telemetry equipment to listen for collared elk and wolves. They heard 1331’s signal, indicating she’d moved farther into Montana than ever. But, the beeps suggested, she hadn’t budged in at least 12 hours.
Park staff turned the information over to Montana’s fish and game agency. Wolf 1331 would ultimately be found dead in a trap set by a prolific wolf hunter who manages a large ranch about 10 miles north of Yellowstone. The man who trapped 1331 would receive a warning for violating state trap-check laws and no other punishment. Her journey had come to an end roughly a month after it began.

The Yellowstone bubble
Wolf 1331F’s fate was unusual only in that she made it so far north. When wolves leave the park, they die — often, quickly.
Yellowstone’s roughly 100 wolves are among the most famous and beloved in the world, attracting throngs of wolf-admiring tourists who spend tens of millions of dollars in the region every year. However, protected by federal law and tolerant of their adoring fans, Yellowstone wolves are uniquely vulnerable to hunters and trappers in surrounding states where killing wolves is legal. Their destinies are often shaped by which of the three surrounding state boundaries they cross.

“When we look at the fate of collared wolves that leave Yellowstone, most commonly they don’t survive the next hunting season,” Yellowstone Wolf Project leader Dan Stahler said in a May 2024 interview.
Heading into Wyoming, wolves encounter wilderness and tightly controlled hunts, but greater danger beyond. Step into Idaho and it’s a free-fire zone, though few wolves go that way. Journeys north into Montana are the most common and have proven the most deadly, despite some state efforts to take it easy on park wolves.
Yellowstone’s wolves die from hunting and trapping outside the park every season, but things seem to be getting worse. From 2009-2020, about 4.3 wolves from Yellowstone were killed legally by hunters and trappers each year, according to National Park Service data. From 2021-2024, that number nearly tripled when an average of 12.75 wolves died annually, according to Yellowstone Wolf Project data.
It was clear to Doug Smith, retired lead of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, that the park’s porous boundaries would be an issue almost immediately after wolves were reintroduced in 1995. “This is a long-term problem for wildlife management, and particularly wolves,” Smith said in an interview this fall.
Inside Yellowstone, wolves are managed “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,” the now-famous language adorning the top of Roosevelt Arch, a striking stone gateway often surrounded by selfie-taking tourists at the park’s North Entrance. The sentiment springs from the 1916 act creating the National Park Service and stops at the park’s border. Outside Yellowstone, the states take over wolf management. There, wolves can get into trouble. They kill livestock, the occasional pet, and lots and lots of elk. And they’re especially naive to the many dangers in the new world around them.

Even in the early days of reintroduction, Smith remembers phone calls urging him to do the impossible: keep wolves inside the park. Back then, wolves had federal protections both in and out of Yellowstone. Hunting them was illegal, whether in Montana, Wyoming or Idaho, or inside Yellowstone itself. But within a month of releasing the park’s first wolves from their enclosure, a hunter named Chad McKittrick illegally shot and killed a male wolf, numbered 10M, after it left the park and ventured onto private land near Red Lodge, Montana.
Fast-forward nearly 30 years and death also awaited 1329M, a striking green-eyed black male wolf, when he left Yellowstone. Researchers captured and collared 1329, born into the Wapiti Lake Pack just like 1331F. He was caught and joined the ranks of research wolves in 2021, the same year they collared 1331F as a pup. A year later, park scientists documented the young male, with a touch of silver on his chin, getting into a scuffle with other males, which could have spurred a dispersal. His collar’s GPS data shows he left Yellowstone on May 14, 2022, heading south. “[1329] beelined it all the way down through the trophy game wolf area,” said Stahler, the current Yellowstone Wolf Project leader.

The state of Wyoming tightly regulates wolf hunting in an area where wolves are managed as “trophy game” adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, with the area closed to hunting in the spring. But 1329 kept moving. GPS data shows his route, loping straight through the heart of Jackson Hole, then south, looping through the Wyoming and Salt River ranges. The black wolf headed into a valley where, three years later, Sublette County resident Cody Roberts would fight a felony animal cruelty charge for allegedly making a public spectacle of a wounded, juvenile wolf in a bar before the animal died. The incident made international news and divided the small Western Wyoming community. Wolves are fewer here. There’s a reason.
Within two weeks of leaving Yellowstone, the roughly 2-year-old 1329 crossed another boundary and left Wyoming’s regulated wolf “trophy game” area for its “predator zone,” which covers 85% of the state and where there are virtually no regulations on how wolves can be killed. Running down and bludgeoning wolves with snowmobiles here is legal. The departure meant he could be killed any time of year, by almost any means, and without a license.
Toward the end of June 2022, wolf 1329 stopped moving in the mountains near Salt River Pass, near where the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem transitions into the Great Basin. He’d stepped into a steel-jawed leghold trap. “It had been in the trap about four days,” Stahler says, “based on the location and movement.” By June 26, the trapped wolf was dead. The Yellowstone biologist’s best guess is that 1329 was exposed to the elements and died of dehydration. States surrounding the park require trappers to frequently check their wolf traps to reduce animals’ suffering and minimize harm to non-target species. Negligence is illegal.

‘Risky life choice’ 
Wolves in the Northern Rockies are no strangers to controversy. Indeed, politicians in all three states surrounding Yellowstone have long seized on wolves as a prime example of federal overreach. “I remain seriously concerned with the uncertainty that continues to surround Yellowstone wolf reintroduction as it moves forward,” former Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer wrote to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt in 1995, after wolves were already on the ground. Former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter said he’d be the first to bid on a wolf tag back in 2007. And Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte was issued a warning for killing a Yellowstone wolf without the proper trapper education in 2021.
Death by hunting, trapping or wildlife management official is the most common fate for wolves that leave Yellowstone National Park. Even in a natural system, the act of dispersing is already a “risky life choice,” according to Stahler. Solo wolves end up in territories of other wolf packs, where they clash and get killed. In fact, within Yellowstone, wolves are the leading cause of wolf death.

While the number of wolves that spend the vast majority of their time inside Yellowstone has stayed relatively static for more than two decades, wolf populations outside the park have grown by leaps and bounds. That’s in part because some Yellowstone wolves successfully dispersed and survived. At the same time, other wolves reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness established and bred. And yet more wolves filtered down from the north, crossing the Canadian border into the U.S. Today, populations of animals as reclusive as wolves are tough to estimate, but the most recent figures for Montana and Idaho wolf populations are roughly 1,100 and 1,200, respectively. In Wyoming, which has less mountainous, treed habitat, there are fewer wolves — about 350 — and they’re counted with much greater precision.
While those wolf populations outside the park grew, the human population inside Yellowstone expanded, too. Park visitation hovered around 3 million annually at the time of wolf reintroduction in 1995. Today, that number is closer to 5 million, evidenced by the sprawl of souvenir shops in the Yellowstone gateway towns of Jackson, Wyoming and Gardiner, Montana where tourists snap up T-shirts, stuffed bison and elk toys, and art emblazoned with wolves. This increased visitation, wolf biologist Smith says, is the biggest issue facing Yellowstone National Park as a whole.
“It’s the best place in the world to view wild wolves,” says Smith, adding that in the early days of wolf reintroduction, finding wolves inside the park was exclusive, inside information. That’s changed nowadays, he says, with the influx of eager, wolf- and grizzly-watching tourists. “There’s no inside tips anymore. Just look for the traffic jam.”

Wolf-watching tourism alone contributes at least $82 million annually to communities bordering the park, the most recent data show. However, all those people lining the roads and hillsides of Yellowstone come at a cost. “[When wolves] leave the park,” Smith says, “they get shot because they stand there and look at a hunter.”
Some wolves become so accustomed to people that they become habituated, according to Smith, meaning they walk up to humans in search of food or become so bold that they run off with tripods. In rare instances, park officials have euthanized habituated wolves.
The Wapiti Lake Pack, a major draw for wolf watchers and tourists, has been susceptible to human conditioning. These Yellowstone interior wolves, considered bison-killing specialists, often use groomed park roads to get around in winter, at times walking right by snowmobilers buzzing down the road on their way to places like Old Faithful or Tower Junction. They’ve even been hazed with paintballs as a result.
But the vast majority of park wolves aren’t habituated, Smith says. Rather, they’re tolerant of people. “A wild wolf is avoidant,” he says. “They flee, they run. They know what humans mean: death. That’s not a park wolf.” Tolerance is the curse that leaves them vulnerable outside the park.

Justin Webb, executive director of the Foundation for Wildlife Management, says Yellowstone should do more to instill its wolves with a healthy fear of people.
“Wolves in the park should be given the respect of space, and I think that those wolves shouldn’t be conditioned to people,” says Webb, whose nonprofit makes bounty-like payments to trappers who kill wolves.
On occasion, Yellowstone wolves face circumstances that make them especially prone to human conditioning. The Junction Butte Pack, for example, often dens within eyeshot of Slough Creek, a popular trailhead for hikers and anglers. Tourists and Yellowstone guides have learned about the highly visible location, potentially dooming those pups.
“Why don’t they close the trailhead down?” Webb asked.
Yellowstone wolves leave the park for all kinds of reasons. Some, like 1331F, might take a temporary solo hiatus from their pack, while 1329M was likely in the midst of a more permanent dispersal, searching for new territory or a mate. However, the vast majority of Yellowstone’s wolves spend about 96% of their time inside the park, collar data shows. With no time to learn a healthy fear of humans, the 4% of the time they unwittingly leave their protections behind proves deadly. Instead of other wolves, people — either hunters or poachers — become, by far, the leading cause of death for wolves that depart Yellowstone, Stahler said.

No fear
For the first decade and a half after wolves returned to Yellowstone, the Endangered Species Act outlawed hunting wolves throughout the Lower 48. Protracted legal battles meant the first lawful hunt didn’t occur until 2009, and it revealed the risk facing wolves that spend most of their lives inside Yellowstone.
“They aren’t showing any fear,” one Montana wolf hunter told the Los Angeles Times after a successful hunt that year. “But they will, I’m sure.” Another hunting guide told the outlet about a wolf his client killed: “He was no more afraid of [the hunter] than the man in the moon.”
In 2011, wolves were permanently “delisted,” or stripped of federal protections under the Endangered Species Act, in Montana, Idaho and portions of three other western states by an act of Congress. In Wyoming, the change came more slowly because of litigation. Wolves were most recently delisted there in 2017.

After years of hunts in surrounding states, the story hasn’t changed much. In late 2024, members of the 8 Mile Pack crossed the park boundary into Montana. Three hunters were waiting. They left with four dead wolves. A fifth was found days later, dead in nearby bushes. That many wolves dying at the same time rather than fleeing at the sound of a gunshot, Smith says, likely means they had no fear of people. “Killing multiple wolves at once is a sure sign of that.”
In this way, 1331 and 1329 are outliers. According to Yellowstone National Park data, over the last few years, approximately 81% of wolves that lived in Yellowstone and were killed by hunters died in Montana. That’s largely due to terrain. Think of the Gardiner Basin just north of Yellowstone like a funnel: Elk migrate to the lower-elevation, arid area in search of forage in winter. Wolves follow. Of all those wolves killed by hunters in Montana, nearly 9 in 10 died within just a mile of the park boundary. The forays of 1331 and 1329 outside Yellowstone — clocking about 10 miles and over 100, respectively — mean they traveled much farther than most of their kind before meeting the same end.

The lives of long-distance travelers, like the two Wapiti Lake pack members that died in traps, are less understood. Smith attributes the dearth of data to a simple reason: They die.
“A wolf dispersing has a higher mortality risk because it doesn’t know the landscape,” he says. “So that makes it more vulnerable to getting shot because they’re wandering around going, ‘I don’t know where I am; I don’t know where it’s safe and where it’s unsafe.’”
Montana and Wyoming’s respective wildlife management agencies investigated the trappings of 1331 and 1329. Both were found only because of their collar mortality signals, and both trappers were found to have violated state “trap-check” laws. Wolf traps must be checked every 48 hours in Montana. Leghold traps must be checked every 72 hours in Wyoming’s predator zone, the only place in the Equality State where wolf trapping is allowed.
The Wyoming trapper, a Cokeville resident named Ezra Cluff, was cited and fined $250 on June 30, 2022. “Cluff stated that he had got busy and had indeed failed to do his trap checks on time,” the warden wrote in a citation slip. Cluff did not respond to an interview request.
Nearly three years later and on the opposite end of the ecosystem, 1331 was found in a trap about 10 miles, as the crow flies, north of Yellowstone. The trap was registered to Matt Lumley, who was at the time president of the Montana Trappers Association and vice president of the National Trappers Association. Lumley also has close ties to political leadership in Montana. He helped Gov. Gianforte trap and kill another collared Yellowstone wolf in 2021. Gianforte later described Lumley as his wolf hunting “mentor” in an interview with Lee Enterprise’s Statehouse Bureau. In addition, Lumley is a founding member of the Outdoor Heritage Coalition, a group currently suing Montana, arguing that state wildlife managers aren’t setting policy aggressively enough to reduce the wolf population.

Lumley did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But his comments in the Helena Capitol building are in the public record. “I’ve killed a lot of wolves,” he testified at the Montana Legislature just days before Wolf Project staff heard 1331F’s mortality signal. “I’ve never killed a Yellowstone National Park wolf. I’m killing all my wolves in Montana.”

Matt Lumley, the trapper whose trap wolf 1331F was found dead in, was issued a warning by Montana FWP. The Park County attorney declined to prosecute.

Yellowstone park officials estimate that 1331 died on Jan. 16, 2025. Park staff detected her mortality signal on Jan. 23, and her remains were recovered even later. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks submitted a “request for prosecution” for a trap-check violation to Montana’s Park County Attorney’s Office. Despite the state’s 48-hour trap-check regulation for wolves, the county attorney declined to prosecute.
“After a careful review of the reports, supporting documents, and available evidence, we determined that the facts did not establish a criminal offense that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” Park County Attorney Chad Glenn said in an email to Mountain Journal and WyoFile.
Glenn did not respond to follow-up questions or provide the documents he cited as the basis for his decision. Ultimately, Lumley walked away with a formal warning from FWP. Gianforte also walked away with a warning in 2021 after running afoul of trapping regulations while killing a wolf with Lumley on the same ranch, owned by Robert E. Smith, a co-director of Sinclair Broadcasting Group and contributor to Gianforte’s 2017 congressional campaign.
Elk, livestock and wolves
The saga of Wapiti Lake’s wandering wolves reflects the complexity of managing Yellowstone wolves when they leave protected areas like the park. Over the last few decades, the region has transitioned from an economy based on resource extraction to one heavily reliant on tourism and recreation. Outside the national park, wildlife managers are tasked with balancing hard-to-reconcile viewpoints in states where hunting and ranching have deep roots and large landowners hold sway.
The overpopulated elk herds of Yellowstone’s Northern Range numbered around 15,000-20,000 in the years leading up to the 1995 wolf reintroduction. Counts are now closer to 5,000, much to the dismay of many a hunter who relied on the area’s abundance of ungulates for meat or trophies.
“I’ve got an 18-year-old son that I want to get to experience elk camp in the backcountry,” Webb, the wolf-hunting advocate, told a Wyoming audience in 2022. “I want him to sit on a mountaintop on a ridge and listen to bulls bugle below him as the sun comes up, and I believe that if we don’t do something to control wolf populations, he won’t have that experience.”
Wolves push an elk herd in Yellowstone. Biologists say wolf packs have contributed to the decline in Yellowstone elk numbers over the last 30 years since they were reintroduced to the park, but many also say that the elk population before wolves returned was greater than the area’s carrying capacity. (Matt Metz/National Park Service)
Meanwhile, Lumley the trapper called the decline of southwest Montana elk “the greatest loss of hunting opportunity in the world” during the same legislative hearing he touted killing “a lot of wolves.” Decades before wolf reintroduction, elk were so numerous in the area that Yellowstone sometimes culled thousands of the animals in a single year. Later, the park took a more hands-off approach. Elk hunting outside the park became the primary management tool to deal with the overpopulated ungulates. Locals recall a “firing line” of hunters as elk moved toward winter range outside the park’s protections.
Wolves were a factor — but not the only factor — in the region’s decline in elk numbers. Mountain lions and bears eat elk, too. And so do people. A long-running late-season elk hunt in the Gardiner area also played a role in the elk population’s shrinking size. Despite a drastic decrease in numbers from the days before wolves, elk populations north of Yellowstone still remain at or above the state-set goal for elk numbers. Access to elk is yet another important part of the hunting puzzle. Some hunters say the wary ungulates that remain in the area often take shelter from wolves and hunters alike on private land, making them next to impossible to pursue.
Part of the tension around hunting both wolves and elk also centers on economics. While wolf-watching brings millions of tourist dollars into communities surrounding the park, outfitters north of Yellowstone have lost business as elk herds declined after reintroduction. The lawsuit filed by the Outdoor Heritage Coalition features outfitter Craig Neal, an outfitter in Townsend, Montana, as a plaintiff. Neal, the brief contends, “has been negatively impacted by restrictions on wolf hunting in Montana from a personal and economic perspective … his business opportunities are limited by the insufficient wolf quotas and reduced elk available for hunting.”

Elk aren’t the only hooved creatures wolves impact, either. Outside Yellowstone, they also occasionally kill livestock. Although wolf-killed cattle and sheep are a drop in the bucket among the many factors that kill domestic livestock, the impacts aren’t trivial for individual ranchers in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
In Wyoming and Montana each year, wolves typically kill at least a few dozen of the more than 3 million cows in the two states — though many ranchers argue that wolf kills can go unproven since remote carcasses are consumed before the kill can be documented. Depredation numbers in Wyoming notably spiked from 2014 to 2017, topping out at 121 wolf-killed cattle — a pulse of conflict that coincided with the three years Wyoming wolves were relisted under the Endangered Species Act. While those federal protections prohibited hunters from killing wolves at the time, wildlife managers trying to avert conflict could do just that. And they did, killing a record number. In Montana, complaints about wolves eating livestock peaked at 233 in 2009. Since then, in the wake of delisting, the number of reports has dropped off drastically, hovering at 100 or fewer annually from 2015 to 2024.
Pressure cooker 
To control the wolf population and mitigate their impact, hunting has become a fixture of wolf management in the Northern Rockies. Since legal seasons began earlier in the century, some animals that spend most of the year in Yellowstone are always lost to hunters’ bullets and traps outside park boundaries.
In an attempt to resolve the tension between the park and surrounding states, Montana carved out small areas with more limited hunting called “wolf management units” directly north of the park. Wyoming tightly controls its hunts immediately adjacent to Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and has had minimal overall impact on Yellowstone populations. Idaho takes an aggressive, statewide approach to wolf hunting and trapping, but the topography and location of Yellowstone packs have limited its influence on park populations.

The vast majority of harvested Yellowstone wolves die in Montana, where tensions continue to flare over setting the state’s wolf season. In 2021, the Montana Legislature mandated a reduction in the state’s overall wolf population, numbering roughly 1,177 at the time. The new law simply set a minimum of 15 breeding pairs (corresponding to 450 wolves). In the years since, setting policy to reduce wolf numbers has fallen to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission, a citizen board appointed by the governor, currently Gianforte. The commission has considered a slew of ways to meet the mandate: lengthening hunting and trapping seasons, instituting a statewide quota, night hunting on private land, and neck snaring, among other approaches. Some of those aggressive tactics have taken effect. Others haven’t. Yet today, four years after the legislative mandate took effect, Montana still hasn’t seen a meaningful reduction in its wolf population.
In 2021, about six months after Gianforte trapped and killed a Yellowstone wolf north of the park, the commission also removed quotas in the wolf management units, or WMUs, just outside Yellowstone. That winter, hunters killed at least 25 wolves that spent the vast majority of their lives inside the park. Roughly 1 in 5 park wolves perished — more park wolves than in any hunting season before or since. Yellowstone biologists worried about the impact of the hunt on their three-decade-old research project — some packs dissolved due to the hunt, and others formed. Behavior and reproductive rates changed, too. Wildlife guides were furious, concerned they’d lose business or wolf-watching opportunities altogether.
Ultimately, the quotas were restored. But over the next two years, outcomes for Yellowstone wolves only marginally improved. At least 13 park wolves were killed in the 2023-2024 hunting season. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly voiced his concern to the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission in a 2024 letter. “Wolves that primarily live within Yellowstone are exceedingly valuable to a great number of people across Montana, the country, and the world,” he wrote. “The park generates hundreds of millions of dollars in additional economic activity to Montana economies and wolves and other wildlife rate as a top reason why people visit the park and region.”
The pressure cooker of hunting policy around Yellowstone hasn’t let off steam. At the January 2025 legislative hearing, Lumley complained that the Fish and Wildlife Commission was setting policy that was too protective of wolves and listening only to out-of-state interests, particularly Yellowstone. Just 3% of the national park lies in Montana. “That’s what you are elected to do, protect Montana’s interests,” Lumley testified. “Not Yellowstone National Park’s.”
In a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting months later, Chris Morgan, Lumley’s successor at the Montana Trappers Association, made similar claims. He alleged that policy safeguarding wolves in the region around Yellowstone is a “political ploy” and touted the state’s responsibility for wolf reduction rather than wolf watching.

“We don’t have any state mandate that requires us to make sure that ecotourism thrives,” Morgan said. “Our mandate is to reduce the state’s population of wolves. Plain and simple. Period.”
Wolf advocates were just as fired up in the day-long meeting. Cara McGary, a Yellowstone guide and cofounder of Wild Livelihoods Business Coalition, argued that plenty of Yellowstone wolves — like 1331F— die even outside the protective boundaries of the wolf management units. Southwest Montana receives far more wolf hunting pressure than anywhere else in the state, despite a lower overall wolf density than Montana’s northwest corner, according to Montana FWP data. It’s also the only area in the Treasure State where the wolf population was already on the decline. In 2024 alone, at least six wolves from the park died legally in the Yellowstone-adjacent WMUs and another five outside their boundaries. “That’s almost 10% of the product that our businesses depend on,” she testified.
At the time of publication, wolf hunting season in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho is well underway. The heat over wolf hunting regulations around Yellowstone in that August commission meeting led to something of a middle-ground approach. But already this year, a Montana hunter legally killed a Yellowstone wolf beloved to the wolf-watching community, which described the dark black 1479F as playful and tolerant of crowds.
“She was one of the few wolves in the park that would walk right through a crowd of people to reach her destination,” wildlife photographer Deby Dixon told Cowboy State Daily.

The year of the wolves





Infamous wolf captor Cody Roberts pleads not guilty, trial set for March




The National Park Service has two chief goals: preserving and protecting natural systems, and visitor enjoyment. Wolves figure into both, and the scientific gains from studying Yellowstone packs are unparalleled: They’re both uniquely visible and, at least in theory, uninfluenced by humans. But as wolves deal with such direct mortality when they set paw outside the park, Smith wonders: “Do you have a natural wolf population or not?”
Some data suggests not. A 2023 peer-reviewed study led by then-University of Montana PhD student Brenna Cassidy found that Montana’s wolf-hunting regime has a clear effect on the overall survival of Yellowstone wolves. Without hunting, park wolves have a nearly 90% chance of surviving any given year, but the rate falls to about 80% when hunting occurs with quotas. When there’s unlimited hunting outside the boundary, Yellowstone wolves’ chances of surviving a year dip closer to 70%.
Smith, Yellowstone’s retired wolf biologist, wants to be clear: He’s a hunter as well, and a self-described “gun guy.” At times, though, he worries that all the focus on Yellowstone’s wolves has an overlooked downside. It sucks the air out of the room in wolf management conversations, leaving too little focus on the thousands more wolves in Montana and the rest of the Northern Rockies that don’t have the same vocal proponents as animals in and around the park. Those wolves die too — often very quickly or brutally. In Montana, hunters and trappers can take a total of 458 wolves this season, including six in the WMUs outside Yellowstone and 60 in the larger region where 1331 met her end. There are no limits in Idaho, and it’s a wolf hunting free-for-all in Wyoming’s predator zone, where 1329 died in an illegally monitored trap.
Thinking about intense hunting pressure throughout the Northern Rockies, Smith thinks wildlife managers should consider a bigger question: “Where do wolves get to be wolves?”

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 26, 2025.
Hyde Park Electric ratepayers are bracing for a 20% increase in their electric bills following the revelation that their municipal utility is struggling under a mountain of debt. Meanwhile, a neighboring utility manager has stepped in to try to right the ship as every option is on the table — even the potential dissolution of the utility.
The double-digit increase will take effect in the new year. It was imposed as the first part of a two-phase rate case approved by the Vermont Public Utility Commission to allow Hyde Park to keep the lights on as the state and the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority attempt to untangle its knotted finances amid significant financial distress.

In October, Hyde Park Electric’s long-simmering financial crisis came to a boil as its inability to cover expenses became known to the state. It was originally estimated that the small municipal utility, with 1,400 customers, was carrying $1.5 million in debt. After a few weeks of forensic accounting by the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, that number has climbed to $4.5 million.
Shortly after news of Hyde Park Electric’s financial crisis broke, former village manager Brian Evans-Mongeon resigned. Evans-Mongeon bore the brunt of the Vermont Department of Public Service, which advocates for ratepayers, and its attempts to push the village of Hyde Park to face the seriousness of the situation. Even though village trustees had discussed the future of his position with the town, Evans-Mongeon resigned on his own volition, according to Fredericka French, chair of the Hyde Park Village Board of Trustees.
With a VPPSA employee now installed in the Hyde Park office, Morrisville Water & Light manager Scott Johnstone has been tapped to step in to take the helm in Hyde Park village. A former secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, Johnstone has led the neighboring municipal utility since 2022.
Last Thursday, Johnstone held a public question and answer session prior to the trustees’ regular meeting. Frustrated ratepayers crowded into the village’s low-slung office building situated across from the imposing brick facade of the Lamoille County Courthouse.

Johnstone told village electricity customers that this phase-one rate increase is only the beginning — he said a 20% percent increase is what it will take to keep Hyde Park Electric’s and its customers’ lights on. How much ratepayers will have to pay to keep the utility solvent will be determined next spring, following completion of phase two of the rate case.
Johnstone said this increase catapulted Hyde Park into the top five for the most expensive electricity among the state’s 17 electric utilities.
Customers were also eager to learn how the utility could go about addressing the $4.5 million debt. Johnstone said most of the debt seems to have been accrued through operational costs and taking on more debt to cover other expenses.
Johnstone and the trustees are already working to determine what parts of the debt can be refinanced. The solar arrays the town has also invested in, which now contribute significantly to its debt load, could potentially be offloaded.
The village might also look at some of its other assets, including the French family home. It was donated to the village in 2013 by the nine French family siblings, including Fredericka French’s husband, Ed, with the intent of seeing it become the village offices, but the small municipality was never able to secure the funds for its renovation.
Johnstone warned ratepayers that the process of determining what was prudent for Hyde Park ratepayers by the Public Utility Commissions could become a contested one.
Some in attendance at last week’s meeting wondered who to blame. Prior village managers have managed the water, wastewater and power operations, but the publicly elected, volunteer board of trustees ultimately made the decisions.
Johnstone said that, at this point in the financial analysis, he could say with a certain amount of confidence that there had been no embezzlement that contributed to the insolvency. He said it was, rather, a general mishandling of funding.

French pointed out that, prior to 2016, the village was debt-free. It was only after state-mandated upgrades to the water and wastewater system, and new investment in renewable energy, that the debt began to mount. She said she was waiting to learn more about how exactly the village found itself in financial disarray before passing full judgement, but acknowledged that everyone in a leadership position bore some fault.
“I’d say there’s plenty of blame to go around,” she said. “I don’t really have any full answers to that at this point, and I think I will once we get all the information.”
Consolidation question
Hyde Park Electric’s insolvency has raised new questions about the long-term viability of the small municipal utility.
In a report updating the Public Utility Commission on the investigation into the utility and efforts to stabilize it — filed by Hyde Park Electric and the Department for Public Service — a “potential future steps and discussions” provides the two options on the table: Hyde Park Electric returns to solvency under new leadership and continues to exist, or it “merges with or is jointly managed with another municipal entity or utilities.”
Such discussions won’t take place until well into next year at the earliest, and Hyde Park Electric could consider other neighbors like Vermont Electric Co-Op or Green Mountain Power, or another municipal utility, for partnership or consolidations. However, Johnstone’s arrival in Hyde Park emphasizes the closeness in proximity of Morrisville Water & Light as a potential partner.
Johnstone is also currently interim director at the Hardwick Electric Department and, he said, if only because managing a public utility is difficult, the town of Hardwick is considering a merger with Morrisville Water & Light.
Should it come to pass that both Hardwick and Hyde Park consolidate under Morrisville Water & Light, the utility would serve over 11,000 customers, rivaling Washington Electric Co-op in the size of its customer-base. Johnstone, though, took care to emphasize that such discussions were a long way off, and that his focus was on the crisis at hand.
Through a confluence of geography and the history of electric infrastructure in Vermont — which grew out of densely populated village centers — Lamoille County is served by ten different utilities.
Johnstone was also careful to emphasize that a possible consolidation was not his purpose for taking over administrative duties in the village in this troubled time.
“Our intention is to help neighbors and, if they want to, they can get back on their feet and find their way forward,” Johnstone said. “That’s entirely good for us. We’re doing this because we want to help other communities.”

Oct. 29. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined attorneys general and governors from 20 other states to sue the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development over a new policy that they say drastically alters the ability of state and local agencies, as well as non-profit groups, to combat homelessness.
The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in federal court in the District of Rhode Island. 
“The complaint alleges HUD violated its own regulations by not engaging in rulemaking before issuing the changes and violated the law by not receiving congressional authorization for these new conditions, many of which are directly contrary to congressionally passed statutes and HUD’s own regulations,” a statement released by Nessel’s office said. 
The policy would significantly cut the amount of money that, through the Continuum of Care program, can be used to go towards permanent housing solutions. Only 30% of a grant could be used for permanent housing, while for previous grants, that limit was nearly 90%.
The new funding notice also imposes ideological barriers, including preventing any funding from going to organizations that acknowledge the existence of transgender or nonbinary people. It also moves away from a “Housing First” model that did not require preconditions like stable income or sobriety for access to support from the program.
“The Continuum of Care grant program is the backbone of efforts to combat homelessness across Michigan and throughout the country,” Nessel said in a press release. “Restricting funding and imposing illegal conditions on these grants violates HUD’s mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities for all. If permitted to take effect, these changes will displace thousands of Michigan families.”
The changes have been widely criticized by housing advocates, who say that they will keep currently unhoused people without access to housing and will push some people who rely on support from Continuum of Care programs back into homelessness. 
Last year, Michigan received over $100 million from the Continuum of Care grant program. Nessel’s office, in a press release, estimated that the changes in this year’s updated Notice of Funding Opportunity would put 7,000 households, including around 2,000 families with children, at risk of losing their housing.
The Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness, a group of 92 homeless service providers, said that over the organization’s 35 years in existence, they had “never encountered a threat as devastating and extreme to persons in poverty” as detrimental as the new changes.. 
“Not only will this application fracture the homeless service delivery infrastructure, which has taken decades to build, but lives will be lost,” said Sarah Rennie, Senior Director of Advocacy for the Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness. “This [Continuum of Care Notice of Funding Opportunity] completely misunderstands the root causes of homelessness. Homeless rates in Michigan continue to rise, not because of a failure in the current homeless service delivery system, but because Michigan faces an affordable housing crisis.”

The True Story of Thanksgiving by Rush Limbaugh

“The story of the Pilgrims begins in the early part of the seventeenth century… The Church of England under King James I was persecuting anyone and everyone who did not recognize [the church’s] absolute civil and spiritual authority,” actually, the state.
“Those who challenged ecclesiastical authority and those who believed strongly in freedom of worship were hunted down…” This is in England in the 1600s. They “were hunted down and imprisoned, and sometimes executed for their beliefs. A group of separatists,” people who didn’t want any part of this, “first fled to Holland,” they liked wooden shoes and cheese, “and established a community.”
They were there for eleven years. “After eleven years, about forty of” these separatists who liked wooden shoes and cheese, “agreed to make a perilous journey to the New World…” They had heard about it. Some new, exciting place that hadn’t been developed. They knew they would “face hardships,” hardships like you and I don’t know — and I’m not preaching to you.
I’m just telling you, we don’t know the hardship these people endured. We can’t. We are way too advanced now. People who lived in the 1600s would not believe life today. (Snort!) Try to explain flight, jet travel. They wouldn’t understand it. They knew they would “face hardships,” but paramount importance to them was living freely and worshiping God according to the dictates of their own consciences, their own beliefs.
That’s what they were denied the freedom to do in England. “On August 1, 1620, the Mayflower set sail. It carried a total of 102 passengers, including forty” of these separatists, the Pilgrims. There were just 40 of them. They were “led by William Bradford. On the journey” across the Atlantic… You talk about something that had to be frightening and scary?
Rush Limbaugh in the Excellence in Broadcasting Studio in 2020.  See the video and the full transcirpt at The True Story of Thanksgiving – Rush H. Limbaugh III
The Mayflower was not much bigger than a 50-foot boat, and 102 people on it. “On the journey, Bradford set up an agreement, a contract” if you will, “that established just and equal laws for all [40] members of the [Pilgrim] community, irrespective of their religious beliefs.” It didn’t matter what their religious beliefs were.
These are the laws they were all agreeing to live by. “Where did the revolutionary ideas,” these laws, come from? We’re talking about the Mayflower Compact. That is what Bradford wrote. The Mayflower Compact derived “[f]rom the Bible. The Pilgrims were a people completely steeped in the lessons of the Old and New Testaments.”
They were devoutly religious people. No matter what else is said about them (and even that is denied), they were devoutly religious. “They looked to the ancient Israelites for their example. And, because of the biblical precedents set forth in Scripture, they never doubted that their experiment would work.”
They never doubted they would get to the New World. They never doubted that once they got there, they would thrive. The journey was long; it was arduous; it was dangerous. And when they finally landed, when the Pilgrims finally landed in New England in November, according to William Bradford’s detailed journal, they found a cold, barren, desolate wilderness. Imagine New England as it exists today as nothing but rocks, forest, undeveloped nature in November and getting colder.
There were no friends to greet them. There was no shelter of any kind other than hiding under a tree, there was nothing, folks. It was desolate. There were no hotels. There were no inns. There were no places to clean up. There were no houses. I mean, this was real hardship. The sacrifice that they had made for the freedom to worship was just beginning.
During that first winter — remember, they arrive in November — during that first winter, half of them, including William Bradford’s own wife, died of starvation, of sickness, exposure to the elements. Now we’re getting close to what you were taught in school. When spring finally came — and, by the way, writing that doesn’t do it justice. Spring didn’t just finally come. It was a survival. It was an act of survival that you and I cannot possibly relate to or understand.
American Special Forces can. Military people who’ve been trained can understand what the Pilgrims were — you and I can’t. We’ve never done anything like that first winter in the New World. They survived it. Spring finally came. They did meet the Indians, the Native Americans who were there, who did help them in planting corn and fishing for cod. They showed ’em where the beavers were so the beavers could be skinned for coats, other things. You animal rights people are not gonna like some of this story, but it happened.
But even at this, even with this degree of assistance from the Indians, the Native Americans, there wasn’t any prosperity yet. They had the Mayflower Compact. They had these laws they were living by, and there was no prosperity. And I wonder why. Now, this is important to understand here, folks, because this is where modern American history lessons end, with the Indians teaching the Pilgrims how to eat, how to fish, how to skin beavers, and all that.
That’s where it ends. And that’s the feel-good story. But that doesn’t even get close to the true story. You know, Thanksgiving is actually explained in some textbooks as a holiday for which the Pilgrims gave thanks to the Indians for saving their lives. It wasn’t that. That happened, but Thanksgiving was a devout expression of gratitude, the Pilgrims, to God for their survival, and everything that was a part of it.
Now, here’s the part that has been omitted. The original contract the Pilgrims entered into in Holland — they had sponsors. They didn’t have the money to do this trip on their own. They had sponsors. There were merchant sponsors in London and in Holland. And these merchant sponsors demanded that everything that the Pilgrims produced in the New World would go into a common store, a single bank, if you will. And that each member of the Pilgrim community was entitled to one share.
So everybody had an equal share of whatever was in that bank. All of the land they cleared, all of the houses they built belonged to that bank, to the community as well. And they were going to distribute it equally, because they were gonna be fair. So all of the land that they cleared and all the houses they built belonged to everybody. Belonged to the community. Belonged to the bank, belonged to the common store. Nobody owned anything. They just had an equal share in it. It was a commune.
The Pilgrims established a commune, essentially. Forerunner of the communes we saw in the sixties and seventies out in California. They even had their own organic vegetables, by the way. Yep. The Pilgrims, forerunners of organic vegetables. Of course, what else could there be? No such thing as processed anything back then.
Now, William Bradford, who had become the governor of the colony ’cause he was the leader, recognized that this wasn’t gonna work. This was costly and destructive, and it just wasn’t working. It was collectivism. It was socialism. It wasn’t working. That first winner had taken a lot of lives. The manpower was greatly reduced. So William Bradford decided to take bold action, which I will describe when we get back.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: William Bradford, the governor of the Pilgrim community, saw that none of this was working. The Mayflower Compact was not working. Giving everybody a single share of stock in the common store, in the common bank was not working. Collectivism. It was as costly and destructive to the Pilgrims as it is and has been to anybody who has ever tried it.
So Bradford decided to scrub it. He threw it out and took bold action. He assigned a plot of land to each family. Every family was given a plot of land. They could work it, manage it however they wanted to. If they just wanted to sit on it, get fat, dumb, happy, and lazy, they could. If they wanted to develop it, if they wanted to grow corn, whatever on it, they could. If they wanted to build on it, they could do that. If they wanted to turn it into a quasi-business, they could do whatever they wanted to do with it.
He turned loose the power of the capitalist marketplace. Long before Karl Marx was even born. Long before Karl Marx was a sperm cell in his father’s dreams, the Pilgrims had discovered and experimented with what could only be described as socialism, and they found that it didn’t work. Now, it wasn’t called that then. But that’s exactly what it was. Everybody was given an equal share. You know what happened? Nobody did anything. There was no incentive. Nothing worked. Nothing happened.
“What Bradford and his community found was that the most creative and industrious people had no incentive to work any harder than anyone else, unless they could utilize the power of personal motivation! But while most of the rest of the world has been experimenting with socialism for well over a hundred years — trying to refine it, perfect it, and re-invent it — the Pilgrims decided early on to scrap it permanently. What Bradford wrote about this social experiment should be in every schoolchild’s history lesson. If it were, we might prevent much needless suffering,” if the true story of Thanksgiving had been taught for years and years and years.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: So, William Bradford, after putting everybody in a common store, the Mayflower Compact… They wanted to be fair. They wanted everybody to have one common share of stock in everything that happened that the Pilgrims produced — and it bombed. It didn’t work.
There was no prosperity; there was no creativity because there was no incentive. Here’s what Bradford wrote about the failure: “‘For this community [so far as it was] was found to breed much confusion and discontent…’” They were not happy, in other words. “‘[T]his community was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.’”
In other words, nobody worked.
The way they set it up, killed and discouraged work.
There was no need.
“‘For young men that were most able and fit for labor and service’” sat around and did nothing. “‘[T]hey should spend their time and strength to work for other men’s wives and children without’” being paid for it? Why should they do that? So, they didn’t. “‘[T]hat was thought injustice.’ Why should you work for other people when you can’t work for yourself? What’s the point? Do you hear what he was saying, ladies and gentlemen?
“The Pilgrims found that people could not be expected to do their best work without incentive. So, what did Bradford’s community try next? They unharnessed the power of good old free enterprise by invoking” capitalism, “the principle of private property,” all the way back in the 1600s. It was incredible. “Every family was assigned its own plot of land,” and they could do with it whatever they wanted to do.
“‘This had very good success,’ wrote Bradford, ‘for it made all hands industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been.’” So when profit was introduced, when the opportunity to prosper was introduced, it went gangbusters. That, my friends, is the essence of the True Story of Thanksgiving. “Now, this is where it gets really good, folks, if you’re laboring under the misconception that I was, as I was taught in school.
“So they set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians” after they had enjoyed this prosperity. It was not the Indians that brought them to prosperity. It’s not said to insult anybody. The Indians assisted in their arrival undeniably. But what led to prosperity for these original settlers was the common store failed. Socialism didn’t work.
It’s when they introduced what turns out to be capitalism. They didn’t have the name for it, but when they turned loose individual incentive — keep what you produce, sell what you don’t need — it went crazy. This is not something they were taught by anybody by self-experience. It was not the Indians. None of this is said to put anybody down. Don’t misunderstand.
The Indians did a lot of things that helped them, which I’ll get to in just a second, but it was their own industriousness. “[T]hey set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians.” They sold stuff to them, and those “profits allowed them to pay off their debts to the merchants,” their sponsors in London and in Holland, and you know what?
The success of that colony after they had abandoned socialism and tried what was essentially capitalism, the word spread throughout the Old World of this massive amount of prosperity that was there for the taking in the New World. And guess what happened? The New World was flooded with new arrivals. “[T]he success and prosperity of the Plymouth settlement attracted more Europeans and began what came to be known as the ‘Great Puritan Migration.’”
And all it took was prosperity and the word spreading across the Atlantic Ocean of how there was prosperity and it was there for the taking. All you had to do was get there and give it a shot. The lesson is — The True Story of Thanksgiving is — that William Bradford and his Pilgrim community were thanking God for the blessings on their community after the first miserable winter of a documented failure brought on by their attempt at fairness and equality, which was socialism.
It didn’t work.
Only when they abandoned it did it work — and I need to say it again, because I don’t want people to misunderstand and get noses out of joint. The Native Americans, the indigenous people, the Injuns, whatever you want to call ’em, they were of considerable assistance, and they were friendly when the Pilgrims arrived. But they had little, if anything, to do with the prosperity that occurred.
Because that was the result of Bradford and the Pilgrim leadership deciding to change their structure, the Mayflower Compact. Now, Indians assisted, naturally. I can’t deny it. I mean, they taught them how to fish and this kind of thing that they didn’t know how to do, and that led them to be productive, undeniably so. But it was the Pilgrim community itself which experienced this massive prosperity.
The word of which spread all the way back to the Old World, Europe across the Atlantic Ocean.
Now, I mentioned earlier that The Federalist has a story on all this, and in it they describe much of what we did in the second book that dealt with this, the children’s book, Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims. That book goes into great detail about how the Indians did provide assistance and what kind of assistance it was, how valuable it was and how crucial it was.
In Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims, we focus on a Native American by the name of Squanto. Now, as I told you, “During the winter of 1620, only 44 out of the original 102 [Pilgrims] survived, including their first elected governor of the colony, John Carver,” and it was “an Indian named Squanto came to their rescue.” As I say, this is, as I say, explored in great detail in Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims.
“Squanto was no ordinary native. Early settlers in 1610 had captured him and sold him into slavery. A group of Catholic friars freed him and brought him to England, where he learned to speak English. In 1618, serving as an interpreter on an English ship, he was brought back to the New World.” It was Squanto — who is a famous Native American in his own right in the Pilgrim story. it was Squanto who “taught the Pilgrims how to plant and fish,” how to skin beavers. It was Squanto who “broker[ed] a peace treaty between the Pilgrims and other Indian tribes.”
There was more than one tribe of Indians. It was not copacetic. It was not friendly and at one with nature. It was not anything like the multiculturalists would have you believe. There were squabbles; there were power struggles; turf battles. It was human. The Indians, the Pilgrims, everybody was scrambling for power, for survival. Survivability was the name of the game. And it was not guaranteed.
Now, many of the Pilgrims literally believed that God had sent Squanto to save them. And they believed, the Pilgrims believed, that without Squanto they never would have survived, or thrived. And they experienced a tremendous harvest in 1621, and that’s the big gathering that is taught in the history books, the native Indians and the Pilgrims joined together for a huge feast, which is the foundational story of the Thanksgiving story that’s taught in public schools.
But, again, that is not The Real Story of Thanksgiving. That’s the textbook brand. It did happen, but it’s so much more than that. And I love taking the opportunity every year to explain the truth of, especially now given this election’s apparently, allegedly fallen out. Because even at The Federalist — this is so great that the story is spreading. “One of the most important legacies of early settlers is that they experimented with socialism in the 1620s, and it didn’t work. Private property rights and personal responsibility, two pillars of a free market economy, saved the Plymouth colony from extinction and laid the economic foundation for a free and prosperous nation that we all enjoy today.”
And that is exactly right. And that is The True Story of Thanksgiving. And that has been what should have been shared with you every Thanksgiving for the past 31 years.

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”

‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.

The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski denounced the Trump administration’s targeting of Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly on Tuesday, saying on social media that its actions are “reckless and flat-out wrong.”
Kelly, a retired astronaut and U.S. Navy officer, was one of six Democratic senators who appeared in a video directed to members of the U.S. military. In that video, they say members of the military are being subject to political pressure and should uphold the Constitution and ignore “illegal orders.”
Afterward, President Donald Trump took to social media to call for all six to be executed for treason. The FBI has begun to make inquiries about the video, and the Department of Defense have vowed to investigate. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been particularly critical of Kelly.
“Senator Kelly valiantly served our country as an aviator in the U.S. Navy before later completing four space shuttle missions as a NASA astronaut,” Murkowski said. “To accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong. The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation.”
It has become unusual for elected Republican officials to speak in defense of elected Democrats, particularly when it places them at odds with President Donald Trump, who remains popular among Republican voters, even if his approval overall is low.
Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan previously expressed concerns about the possible politicization of the military during the presidency of Democrat Joe Biden. 
Asked about the situation with Kelly, Sullivan criticized the Democratic video and the administration’s response to it. 
“The Democrats in the video have offered no explanation of what they considered to be an illegal order, sowing confusion and politicizing the ranks in a way that risks undermining military discipline, lethality and readiness,” his office said in a written statement.
The statement went on to say that “he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly” because “such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military.”
The office of Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, did not return a text message or email seeking comment.
Sullivan’s office requested that his statement be printed in full. Because it has not been published elsewhere, we think there is news value in reprinting it, so it is published below.
“Senator Sullivan strongly disagreed with many actions taken by the Pentagon under Presidents Obama and Biden — such as President Biden’s use of enlisted Marines as political props standing behind him in a very partisan speech in Philadelphia in 2022. But he would never have put out a video — like the one released by Senator Mark Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers — implying that troops should question orders from their superiors. The Democrats in the video have offered no explanation of what they considered to be an illegal order, sowing confusion and politicizing the ranks in a way that risks undermining military discipline, lethality and readiness. 
Instead of using our troops as political pawns, members of Congress should press top Pentagon officials directly on issues over which they have concerns. Senator Sullivan does this regularly in Senate Armed Services Committee hearings and in meetings and phone calls with top Pentagon leaders regardless of which party controls the White House.
While Senator Sullivan believes the message in the video was irresponsible and politically driven, he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly — who served honorably in the Navy — under the UCMJ, particularly given that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause would likely take precedence over any UCMJ provision. Such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military. After four years of Biden’s woke military, the Department of War needs to stay laser focused on lethality and war fighting.”

(Courtesy Tami Smith)Like she does every Tuesday afternoon when the bell rings at the Shepherd’s Closet in Elephant Butte, Tami Smith stepped out the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to greet a growing line of hungry people at the food pantry she runs. Then, like she also does every Tuesday, she joined some of them in prayer.
This week, ahead of Thanksgiving, she said she read from Isaiah 41:10. It was a reminder, she said, that, “There will always be trials and tribulations in life, but God will carry you through every storm.” Then she helped 138 households comprising 523 people get food for the week, she said.

That makes it the county with the highest rate of SNAP participation in New Mexico, which also is the state with the highest SNAP reliance in the United States.

The county’s high rate of SNAP reliance made the food pantry even more vital earlier this year when federal cuts and stoppages threw the program into upheaval, Smith said. The food pantry distributes at least 36,000 pounds of food a month, she said, to people who line up beginning at 7:30 a.m. and come from as far away as Alamogordo, Socorro or Las Cruces. 
“When you have food insecurity, and then you have all this going on with SNAP, people panic,” she said. “They want to make sure that they have enough food for their family. And we have multi-generational families here. It’s not uncommon to have 11, 12, 15 people in the household.”
Those people have turned to Shepherd’s Closet during a chaotic year. 
First, federal cuts to The Emergency Food Assistance Program left Roadrunner Food Bank, which supplies most of the pantry’s food, with 30 fewer truckloads, primarily of dairy products. The food pantry in Elephant Butte had to make up the difference with canned food, Smith said. 
Then, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed in July contained provisions that cut SNAP and imposed future work requirements, along with other measures that prompted longer lines at the food pantry. 
Finally, when the federal government shut down Oct. 1, Smith said she knew to expect even longer lines. She’s worked as a volunteer at the pantry for a decade, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“It was severe fear and panic during the pandemic, and we see that same stuff right now, because it’s still so uncertain,” she said. “And people, especially during the holidays, they panic because they don’t think they can get enough food.”

The food line has not shrunk even though the state stepped in to pay for SNAP itself, first with a $30 million payment that covered SNAP through the first days of November and later with a $162.5 million payment meant to cover the program through January. And the line has stayed long even after the 43-day federal government shutdown ended, Smith said. 
“As long as there’s still that fear out there, the lines are not going to go down,” she said. “It would take the government to agree all the time, which won’t ever happen.”
Amid the panic, Smith said Shepherd’s Closet will continue opening every Tuesday to give out as much food as people need without judgment.
“I don’t ask many questions, because that’s not my business,” she said. “God says, ‘Feed my people.’ That’s what I do.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3203-e1764175859222-1024x826.jpg,,,2025-11-27 08:57:25.223379

Some might leave the state to get one,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/27/mississippi-teacher-pay-raise/,Raising Mississippi teachers' pay will likely be a hot topic during the 2026 legislative session.,"Jason Reid’s day starts at 5 a.m.
He rolls out of bed, lets his dog out and drinks his first cup of coffee. After making sure his kids’ water bottles are full, Reid walks to nearby Lewisburg Elementary School. In the crisp air and dark morning, he starts a school bus, waiting for it to warm up.
Reid, a physical education teacher in DeSoto County School District, has been teaching for 17 years. But in 2019, he also started moonlighting as a bus driver to earn extra money.
This is a reality for educators in Mississippi, which has the nation’s lowest teacher pay. 
According to the National Education Association, the average teacher salary in Mississippi is $53,704. That’s $15,000 less than what the Economic Policy Institute says is needed to comfortably support a single parent, one child household in the Jackson metro area, which is $68,772. In DeSoto County, where Reid lives, that cost is even higher — $76,612 a year.
Even though some districts pay teachers more than the state minimum, without a spouse making higher pay, some educators say they have to keep second jobs and cut corners to make ends meet. 
Some promising young teachers — and even others with years of experience — are considering moving to other states where they are better compensated. 
Mississippi is up against a critical teacher shortage. Nearly 3,000 teacher jobs are vacant across the state, according to a 2024 survey conducted by the Mississippi Department of Education. Educators say the biggest contributing factor to those vacancies is low pay, according to the Mississippi Professional Educators’ annual survey.

Teacher vacancies mean bigger classrooms and less individualized time, which deeply impact student learning. Research shows that higher pay attracts quality teachers and incentivizes them to stay. 
On the heels of nationally recognized academic achievement in the state’s public schools, teachers say they deserve more. 
And legislators say they’re listening. The issue will likely be a hot topic during the 2026 legislative session. State leaders, such as Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, have indicated they’ll focus on raising teacher pay next year, and the Senate Education Committee met about the topic in October. House Speaker Jason White said this summer that his chamber will likely include all of its education policy, including school choice measures, in an omnibus bill next session.
Educators fear their salaries will get tied up in the controversial legislation.
“Teachers should not be held hostage and used as political pawns in order to gain support for another policy issue,” said Kelly Riley, executive director of Mississippi Professional Educators. “It appears to be another sign of disrespect for our educators and teaching profession as a whole.”
Legislators passed the last meaningful teacher pay raise in 2022, a historic increase of $5,140 on average per year. But teachers say that raise was almost immediately rendered null by health insurance premium increases and inflation.
And the retirement benefits that previously kept educators in the profession were changed earlier this year, when state legislators overhauled the public employee retirement system. Teachers who start after March 1, 2026, will receive fewer benefits than their peers. 
It’s a bleak outlook that young educators, such as second-year teacher Vivienne Diaz in Jackson, have to reckon with.
“I would like to stay in Mississippi, but after I finish my master’s degree, the amount of money I’d be making as a teacher …  after all these hours of work,” she said, “it’s just not worth it.”
‘A double kick to public school teachers’
Princess Thompson can smile about it now, but she remembers feeling shocked when she received her first paycheck 20 years ago. Her annual $24,000 salary translated to $1,300 a month.
“I asked my principal, ‘Is everything OK?’” said Thompson, who teaches music at an elementary school in Madison. “Me and another first-year teacher were like, ‘What happened here?’ Our principal laughed.”

Now, two decades into her career, her pay is better. But teaching has also gotten harder. Kids are entering kindergarten with learning difficulties that should have been addressed in preschool. She said that this generation of children, raised around screens, is difficult to keep engaged.
On the Gulf Coast, Carrie Bartlett’s older students are also easily distracted, and she reports more behavior issues in recent years. Without commensurate pay, it’s increasingly frustrating to deal with, she said.
Bartlett has been teaching social studies at Long Beach High School for 15 years, and her husband teaches at Long Beach Middle School. With a daughter in her sophomore year of high school and a son in college, their finances are tight.
When Bartlett and her colleagues commiserate, they echo the same sentiments about the job — they love being educators, but they wish they were getting compensated as professionals.
“I think that teaching is an important job, and it’s rewarding intrinsically,” Bartlett said. “I just wish it was more extrinsically rewarding and that the state had higher appreciation for us doing this job, educating the state’s future.” 
Despite talks about raising teacher pay next year, Bartlett doesn’t feel appreciated. Adding insult to injury are state leaders’ discussions about expanding school choice, or policies to fund education outside of public schools, she said. 
“Pay raises should continue regularly and not be attached to political footballs, which is what I fear will happen this year,” she said. “It’s a double kick to public school teachers.”
Rising health insurance costs
The worst part about being a teacher? According to Reid — and educators across the state surveyed by the teachers association — it’s the health insurance premiums. 
When the state raised teacher pay in 2022, the monthly cost for teachers to insure themselves and their families was around $700. 
Four years later, that’s up to about $900 a month, or $10,800 a year. It’s an annual increase of $2,400. For a teacher with 10 years of experience and a master’s degree, that’s more than a fifth of their salary. At the same time, deductibles have gone up.
Rising premiums are a major part of what’s driving teachers away from the sector, said Megan Boren, who leads teacher workforce policy efforts for the Southern Regional Education Board, a nonprofit focused on improving education. In October, Boren spoke to Mississippi senators about challenges facing the education system nationwide and in the South. During that presentation, she said health insurance premiums have gone down in the region, largely due to reductions in two Southern states with some of the highest premiums. 
In Mississippi and most of the region, costs keep going up.
“Typically, older and more experienced teachers are the ones who have a family to cover,” she told Mississippi Today. “When you factor in premiums for a family, those teachers’ net pay has decreased because of that significantly increased cost.”
Reid has had cancer twice. During his second round of treatment in 2022, his deductible was $13,000. He met the deductible early on, but still spent a huge chunk of money, he said. And as a teacher, there’s not an option to take paid medical leave.
“We go on vacation … we’re not living paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “But we can’t live the lifestyle a lot of neighbors would live.”
Reid’s wife also drives a school bus to supplement their income. Their kids are limited to one sport each. The family used just one car to get around for a long time. And for a year, they made do with a mostly broken washer.

It’s not what a 17-year classroom veteran deserves, he said. 
After a quarter century in the classroom, Julie Price, a third grade reading and social studies teacher in Pearl, is getting paid less than her son in his first year as a civil engineer at the Mississippi Department of Transportation. 
“I’m proud of him, and I know the job is challenging and complicated,” she said. “But that was a slap in the face.” 
Though Price is too invested in her life in Mississippi to leave, temptation lingers. In her home state of Alabama, just a few hours away, she’d be paid almost $10,000 more each year, she said.  
Price’s husband died from COVID-19 complications in January 2021. Abruptly going from two salaries to one, right as her son was headed to college, was hard — and still is, she said. 
Recently, Price had to renew her car tag, a $300 expense that she didn’t budget for. She and her son only eat out once a week. And without meeting her deductible, going to the doctor for continuing neck issues has been expensive. 
“If you don’t have some cushion in there, you’d wipe your money out,” Price said. “Then how would you live?”
To attract quality people to the profession in Mississippi, Reid said, pay raises need to be frequent and substantial.
“Politicians can’t raise pay once and take three to four years off in between election cycles because these pay raises degrade so quickly,” he said. 
“If we want our schools to be great, we’ve got to pay for that.”
Can Mississippi teachers afford to stay?

What she sees ahead makes her nervous.

Diaz, the daughter of a teacher, didn’t go in blind. She knew her pay wouldn’t reflect the hours she’d spend outside of the classroom, planning her lessons and sponsoring a club. With her free time, Diaz helps plan educational programming and teaches at her synagogue on Sundays, which brings in around $200 a month. 
“My senior year, I told my mom, ‘I’ll never be a teacher. I see how you get treated,’” she said. “It is just as difficult as I knew it was going to be.”
But she loves mentoring her students, getting to watch them bloom and being part of the process. That’s why she became a teacher, despite the challenges. 
Still, when Diaz finishes her master’s degree in teaching, it doesn’t financially make sense for her to stay, no matter how much she loves teaching. She’s looking into schools in other states or a job in Mississippi in another field.
Diaz is exactly the kind of person Mississippi leaders want to keep around — a young, smart professional who might make her home and raise her family here. A pay raise is the bare minimum state leaders could do to keep people like Diaz in Mississippi, said Boren of SREB. 
“It’s really important for state leaders to recognize that the work here to help kind of restore faith in the profession, restore those wanting to come in and stay in the profession, it’s a comprehensive approach,” Boren said. “There’s not one silver bullet. Increasing pay alone is not going to cover it. 
“That’s not always what our leaders want to hear. They want to hear what’s the solution and how to fix it now, and I sympathize with that, but the solution is a comprehensive plan and a comprehensive investment in our educators and in the profession as a whole.”
Diaz might reconsider if lawmakers pass a substantial raise, she said. But even then, she’d think twice.
“I love watching my students learn and develop and become new people,” Diaz said. “But just because I have that heart doesn’t mean I don’t deserve that good paycheck.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10104333/3X0A2628.jpg,,,2025-11-27 12:58:49.861627

Increasing pay alone is not going to cover it. 
“That’s not always what our leaders want to hear. They want to hear what’s the solution and how to fix it now, and I sympathize with that, but the solution is a comprehensive plan and a comprehensive investment in our educators and in the profession as a whole.”
Diaz might reconsider if lawmakers pass a substantial raise, she said. But even then, she’d think twice.
“I love watching my students learn and develop and become new people,” Diaz said. “But just because I have that heart doesn’t mean I don’t deserve that good paycheck.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10104333/3X0A2628.jpg,,,2025-11-27 08:57:25.223379

SB 24, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles to inform those who have lost their right to vote how to register to vote. Messages seeking comment from Coleman-Madison were left Tuesday. 
Under current law, certain people who have lost the right to vote due to a conviction can re-register once they serve their sentence and pay any fines related to the conviction. Current law does not require the Board of Pardons and Paroles to educate those people on how to get their voting status restored.

Jerome Dees, Alabama policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), said in an interview Monday that SPLC is supportive of any legislation that makes participation in democracy easier.
“The concept that restoring voting rights overall, whether that’s administrative or legislation that directly gets at restoring the right and changing eligibility, ultimately strengthens families and communities,” Dees said. 
Coleman-Madison sponsored a similar bill in the 2025 session. It was approved by the Senate, and the House Judiciary Committee, but was not considered by the full House. The 2026 bill mirrors the latest version of the 2025 bill.
According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), treason and impeachment are the only crimes not eligible for restoration of voting rights. 
“There’s an extensive list that was actually recently added to … you temporarily lose the ability to vote, but then you have the ability, after certain criteria are met, to have that right restored,” Dees said.
According to the Alabama Department of Corrections, 21,034 people are in Alabama’s prisons. The state is building a new prison in Elmore County, which is scheduled to open in October, to help reduce overcrowding.
The bill also requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles to notify the Secretary of State’s Office of who has completed the necessary steps to restore their voting rights. A message seeking comment from the Secretary of State’s Office was left Monday afternoon. 
“I certainly hope that the Secretary of State will see the benefit of efficiency in the process and making sure that individuals who do have the right to vote, and whether that’s they never lost it or it has been restored that they are given every opportunity to be able to participate in the voting process, particularly if that means the government removing hurdles and obstructions for those individuals,” Dees said. 
Dees said that most convicted of a felony never lose their right to vote, but the lack of education on registering to vote.
“There are a number of individuals who have been convicted of that first category that never lost their right to vote, but because of the lack of general public education and awareness, believed that they had lost their right to vote and just had never voted since,” Dees said.

Levitt,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/27/hudson-river-rail-tunnels/,"As Amtrak awaits the completion of the Gateway project, its crews spend every day inspecting the old tunnels it will replace.","Workers inside one of the Hudson River rail tunnels. (Courtesy of Amtrak)Every night, about 20 to 30 workers head inside the rail tunnels under the Hudson River to make sure New Jersey commuters can make it safely in and out of Manhattan.
They eyeball the decaying 115-year-old tunnels, which for more than a decade have been slated to be augmented by new tunnel projects, and make sure they are clear and passable.
Officials in both states want the old tunnels, which opened during the Taft administration, supplemented with newer tubes. While the $16 billion project to build those tunnels, sometimes called the most important infrastructure project in the nation, is a cause celebre, not much is ever said about the current tunnels and the daily cause of making sure the 450 or so trains daily servicing more than 200,000 riders can pass through them.
The failure of even one of the two tubes would be a catastrophe for the entire northeast, but especially New York and northern New Jersey.

“We are not at a critical failure point yet. We could be if we don’t keep up with our maintenance and demands, but we are not yet at that point,”  said David Albright, Amtrak’s assistant division engineer for fire and life safety.
He added: “Because we spend time in there, and we do a lot of preventative maintenance, we are in a good state of repair.”
Albright leads the team of workers who inspect the tunnels, two tubes that connect New Jersey to New York Penn Station, the nation’s busiest train transit hub, as well as the four tubes under the East River that also service NJ Transit by providing it with a connection to the Sunnyside Yards in Queens, where trains bound for the Garden State are staged. The tunnels form a critical link that ties together not only Amtrak’s northeast corridor, but also NJ Transit and the Long Island Rail Road’s commuter service. 
Amtrak calls them the North River tunnels, a vestige of the days that ended in the 17th century when the region was controlled by the Dutch. They called the Hudson the North River, and the Delaware was called the South River.
Both tunnels are decrepit and in danger of not being passable. Albright’s team maintains and potentially upgrades the performance of these tunnels while waiting out the almost-decade it will take for them to be augmented with the two new tubes, called the Gateway project. 
“When you have 115-year-old infrastructure, you are going to see failure points,” Albright said.
His job often entails going into the tunnels and looking for cracks and fissures, or evidence of decay. In addition to his regular title, Albright is co-chair of the New York Penn Station and tunnel system emergency response task force. 
It didn’t help matters that, when the region was hit in October 2012 by Hurricane Sandy, the tunnels were inundated with up to six feet of salt water. Though the water is long gone, its corrosive power is still felt 13 years later and likely to continue for years more, causing disintegration of the largely concrete tubes. 
“Overall Amtrak’s goal is to not change any train service,” he said  “They want to maintain the same level of service, the same on-time service that we currently provide. And still update our infrastructure.” 
The digging of the new tunnels is an infrastructure project that never quite fades from the news. An earlier version was shut down by then-Gov. Chris Christie in 2010, who cited potential cost overruns. And during the recent federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump said he had terminated “the project in New York,” largely believed to be a reference to Gateway and/or the 2nd Avenue subway project.
Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Gateway Development Commission, a bi-state agency that represents the interests of the two states in expediting the project, said Gateway remains on track to be completed in 2035. 
Evidence of the project may be seen on Tonnelle Avenue, where a roadway bridge in North Bergen is being built that will carry Routes 1&9 over the tracks leading to the new tunnel. To the east, work is underway on the Palisades Tunnel, preparing the site for building the first mile of new tunnel with state-of-the-art boring machines. Such a machine is scheduled to arrive there in early 2026.
Overhead bridge and utility relocations have commenced at Tonnelle, and in New York, the construction of concrete casing in the Hudson Yards train yard has begun, according to Amtrak. 
Sigmund said the project is “on scope, schedule, and budget.”
Albright said he and his team are responsible for all the maintenance in the existing tunnels except for maintaining the tracks and the electronic traction system, which you may know from outside the tunnels as the catenary wires that feed power to the trains. Those are handled by a different engineering team at Amtrak. Amtrak is responsible for maintenance along the northeast corridor route for both NJ Transit and its own trains.
Albright’s team is responsible for maintaining the “benchwalls,” which are the concrete walls of each tube. The tunnel walls are about two feet thick, and they are constructed of reinforced concrete and steel.
These tunnels are the only way for Amtrak and NJ Transit trains to get in and out of Manhattan, noted  Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams. That makes it different from elsewhere in the coast-to-coast Amtrak system. In other places, trains can be rerouted around a problem spot. 
The walls carry all the electronic components that control the signaling, Albright said. The catenary system was severely damaged by the Sandy infiltration and is in need of an overhaul. 
Abrams said the railroad has installed flood doors outside the tubes to ward off any further inundation caused by a new storm.
Permanent repairs for the existing tunnels must wait until the middle of the next decade, when the first of the new tunnels is placed into service. At that time, one of the existing tubes will be taken out of service for the year and a half it will take to fully renovate it. Then it’s the other tube’s turn.
Other entities, notably New York’s police and fire departments and North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue, also have teams that examine the tunnels, Albright said.  
Albright and his team are also responsible for keeping passable the emergency evacuation system that hopefully no one ever has to use.
“We have egress door, ventilation shafts, there are also some passages that go between the two tunnels” that at its deepest is about 90 feet from the surface of the river, he said. “That could be detrimental to some of our riding public, to have to go up those stairs in emergencies.” 
He said Amtrak’s goal is first to send in a rescue engine to push or pull a stalled train out.
The White House has not clarified Trump’s remarks from October on the Gateway project’s potential termination. And Gateway itself is not commenting on that threat.
“We have, and continue to, decline comment on the President’s remarks from October,” Sigmund said.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on Nov. 26, 2025.
The South Burlington school board and South Burlington Educators’ Association have ratified new tentative agreements for both a three-year teachers’ contract and a two-year support staff contract.
The contracts, while not yet publicly available by press deadline, will retroactively cover July 1 of this year through June 30, 2028, for teachers and through June 30, 2027, for support staff.
Teachers will receive a 4.25% raise for the first two years of the contract, with the third year increase set at whatever the inflation number is at the time, anywhere between 2-5%. Support staff will receive a 5.25% raise for the first year, and the same inflation-fixed increase for the second year.

“I think the overall story is that the board went into the negotiation very committed to holding costs down and making sustainable budgeting possible — the 4.25% and inflation being the three years of the term were the lowest cost that we could get,” School Board Chair Seamus Abshere said. “And in the last year, we were signaling an interest in returning to essentially cost-of-living adjustment based on inflation.”
Joe McNeil, the board’s attorney, noted that while the contract essentially maintains the same terms and conditions as previously in effect, most of the negotiations centered around money. And compared to past years, an agreement was come to relatively quickly.
“This really, for South Burlington, was fairly expeditious in the sense that several of the last agreements included declarations of impasse and then required mediation and fact finding,” McNeil said. “And in two instances, there were strikes.”
Noah Everitt, co-president of the South Burlington Educators’ Association, agreed that previous negotiations have often been characterized as contentious, but discussions this time didn’t fit that mold. Aside from the wage increase conversations, there weren’t any significant issues being negotiated this year, largely, Everitt said, thanks to the maturity of past contracts which had ironed out a lot of issues.
“I think any negotiation is ideally a place where both parties feel good about the resulting deal,” Everitt said. “And I think that that’s true of this one.”
He said that this time around, there were improvements made to language in the contract regarding the reduction in the force of probationary employees being placed on a “recall list.”
“That had been a challenge for folks in the past, because if you’re on probation in those first two years and different budgeting years can sometimes have some anticipated reductions that don’t end up happening because the budget passes,” Everitt said. “This would allow those folks to keep their jobs without having to reapply or start probation over.
While he didn’t consider this any sort of big win, it is ultimately better for everyone, he said.
Everitt led negotiations on the union side with a small team of teachers, while Abshere and new school board member Dan Boyer represented the board. Prior to Abshere, former board member Tim Warren had represented the board until he resigned in July amid district-wide tumult.
Beginning this spring, as the union demanded more vision and leadership around a passed budget that resulted in the reduction of nearly 15 full time equivalent positions, tensions were at an all-time high between teachers, district leadership and board members. The union ultimately engaged in multiple months of public activism and demanded that former superintendent Violet Nichols be removed from her role.
McNeil noted that anytime there is turmoil, there is concern about trust and the ability to speak candidly during negotiations for fear of creating additional fervor. But in this case, he said, when it came to negotiations, there was interest on both sides to begin the school year on a new page without letting those distractions get in the way.
Although some expressed concern that the public activism was a way for the union to get a leg up in negotiations, Everitt said that what was being discussed at the negotiating table had nothing to do with their asks from the district at that time.
“Those things were not the same,” he said. “We’ve really focused on trying to just maintain a consistent set of values that puts teachers and students first. And we think that by being consistent, a relationship can be developed between what can for teachers seem like a revolving door of board members, because they will be able to predict our behavior.”

It is important for all of America to recognize the degree to which the nation’s rogue leadership has pitted one America against the other and is tearing the nation apart.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Moats: Two Americas.","This commentary is by David Moats, of Salisbury. He is editorial page editor emeritus at the Rutland Herald, where he won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials on Vermont’s civil union law.
Two Americas were in evidence in Middlebury one Saturday in October


One America was present at Middlebury College for a football game against the team from Bates College. This is the America where higher education is a common rite of passage, where international travel is a frequent avenue of adventure and cultural enrichment, where travel on the nation’s highways occasions a feeling of liberation, where home ownership is taken for granted. It is where people stand for the national anthem and the commonly felt message is: This is America.
But there is another America, also present in Middlebury that Saturday. At the Champlain Valley Unitarian-Universalist Church, a steady stream of people arrived during the day to meet with officials from the Mexican consulate in Boston. They were migrants seeking Mexican passports, mostly young men, but also women and children. The sanctuary was full, and the mood was relaxed and friendly, but the families there were all too aware of the danger around them — the arbitrary detention and deportation that could come crashing down on them at any time. 
The visit by Mexican consular officials is an annual event meant to serve residents from Mexico. But the Latino population in Vermont consists of more than the Mexican farm workers who for years have kept Vermont’s dairy economy afloat. Ecuadorean, Guatemalan, Venezuelan, Peruvian, Honduran, Brazilian, and other immigrants work in roofing, construction and other industries, many or most of them lacking the documentation that could protect them from the ongoing immigration crackdown.
It is easy for the one America not to notice the other. But among those who have noticed are the volunteers who work to provide health care, food, transportation, education, legal representation and other support for migrants, many of whom live in isolation out on the farm.
For the consular visit, the Open Door Clinic of Middlebury had put up tables along one side of the sanctuary to provide vaccinations and health care information. The advocacy group Migrant Justice had set up its own table. The language of the day was Spanish, and numerous volunteers with Spanish language skills were pitching in to help
One of those helping was Fernanda Canales, who came to the United States with her Chilean family when she was 14 years old and who recently retired after a 39-year career in education. For the last 16 years she was principal of the Salisbury Community School in Addison County.
And yet as deeply embedded in the community as she was, she said it was only after she retired and began work helping the region’s migrant population that she came to recognize and appreciate the broad and diverse Latino community that existed in Vermont. Even for her, an immigrant herself, the migrant community had largely been out of view.
Now Canales works as dental coordinator for the Open Door Clinic and as the multilingual liaison for the Addison Central School District. When she arrived in the United States, she knew no English. “I understand the journey,” she said, and she is glad for the chance to help with the journey of the thousands of Latinos trying to set down roots in Vermont.
It is not an easy journey, and it is getting harder. Vermont is not Chicago or Los Angeles, but Migrant Justice has compiled a list of 87 people detained this year by Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement as of a month ago. Since then more have been detained, including a group of 17 recently imprisoned at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Franklin County. Detainees are often people grabbed up on their way to work. They are people without recourse, which is why Migrant Justice and the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project work to keep track of who they are and what becomes of them.
Stories continue to emerge from across the nation of violent tactics by masked agents who act with impunity, ignoring due process and seizing people at will from the streets or on the job. For comfortable America, free to come and go, to take in the football game, or enjoy a vacation in Cancun, it is becoming an act of willful blindness to ignore or excuse the barbaric conditions at hastily constructed detention camps and the lawless manner in which people are seized and taken away from their families.  
It is important for the one America to see the other — see the people, driven by their own enterprising spirit to seek opportunity north of the border and to find jobs that will help them support their families here and back home, jobs upon which the U.S. economy depends.
It is important for all of America to recognize the degree to which the nation’s rogue leadership has pitted one America against the other and is tearing the nation apart. 
It need not be that way.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets – William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels – he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag Tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.
Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals – just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Photo by Jean Beaufort)I have always been intrigued by Thanksgiving — the traditions, the meal, the idea of a holiday that is simply about being thankful.

For my family, Thanksgiving is all about the food. Some foods, like turkey and mashed potatoes, may be familiar. But there are a few twists. Since I grew up in the Caribbean, I’m allowed a Caribbean dish or two. The reliability of the menu – with a little flexibility sprinkled in – seems to unite us as a family while acknowledging our different cultural backgrounds.
Chances are you and your family have similar traditions. Filipino-American families might include pancit. Russian-American families might serve a side dish of borscht. That’s what makes Thanksgiving unique. It’s a holiday embraced by people regardless of their religion or ethnicity.
Yet despite this adaptability, there’s a core part of the meal that almost everyone embraces. How did this come to be? Although few appreciate it, advertisers have shaped the meal as much as family tradition.
A uniquely broad appeal
When Sarah Josepha Hale, the editor of Godey’s Lady’s Book, first advocated for Thanksgiving as a national holiday in 1846, she argued that it would unify the country. In our research, my colleagues and I have been able to show that Hale’s vision for the holiday has been largely fulfilled: Inclusivity of people and traditions has been Thanksgiving’s hallmark quality.
A reason for its broad appeal is that it lacks any association with an institutionalized religion. As one interviewee told us, “There is no other purpose than to sit down with your family and be thankful.” And after interviewing a range of people – from those born in the U.S. to immigrants from countries like South Africa, Australia and China – it became obvious that the principles and rituals they embraced during the holiday were universal no matter the culture: family, food and gratitude.
But as a relatively new holiday – one not tied to a religious or patriotic tradition – a shared understanding of the celebration and the meal is crucial to ensure its long-term survival.
While there might be subtle variations, the Thanksgiving meal is the lodestone of the holiday, the magnet that brings people together. Today, familiar items constitute the meal: turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, gravy, alcohol, salad, apple pie and pumpkin pie. Many of our interviewees tended to serve some version of this list.
But why these items and not others? What makes turkey, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie so special? My colleagues and I studied 99 years of Thanksgiving ads in Good Housekeeping magazine to find out.
Marketing a ritual
Starting with Thanksgiving’s early champion, Sarah Josepha Hale, the history of Thanksgiving is rooted in marketing. Marketers not only helped create many of the rituals and cultural myths associated with the Thanksgiving meal, but they also legitimized and maintained them.
Aladdin Cooking Utensils advertises its double roaster in a 1920 issue of Good Housekeeping.

Initially, the Thanksgiving turkey competed with other meats, like duck, chicken and goose, for centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table.
But by the 1920s, turkey had become the only meat advertised. Early ads would focus on how to prepare and present the perfect bird, promoting branded tools like roasters, ranges, pop-up thermometers and oven-cooking bags.
Iconic Swift’s Premium turkey ads focused on the sacredness of the meal by featuring families at prayer, giving thanks before the meal begins. The importance of the turkey to the Thanksgiving celebration dominates, helping to perpetuate the Thanksgiving turkey tradition.
Meanwhile, early ads for the Eatmor Cranberry Company positioned their whole cranberries as a perfect complement to any and all Thanksgiving meat dishes. This brand dominated until the 1930s when another brand, Ocean Spray, entered with its canned gelatin cranberry sauce.

Ads for both brands implied that cranberry sauce has been around since the first Thanksgiving dinner, which was highly unlikely. However, the brand positioning war successfully promoted cranberry sauce as the natural condiment for the Thanksgiving turkey. Ocean Spray would triumph and, to this day, promotes whole cranberries and canned gelatin.
Considered by many to be the quintessential Thanksgiving dessert, pumpkin pie also wasn’t present at the first Thanksgiving meal. (The Pilgrims lacked the butter, wheat flour and sugar to make the pastry.) Nonetheless, beginning as early as 1925, a range of brands – for example, Borden’s, Snowdrift, Mrs. Smith’s and Libby’s – have competed fiercely to connect pumpkin pie to the season, the holiday and the meal. It’s a rivalry that continues to this day.
The role of the consumer
Not every product category or brand succeeded in becoming a core part of the Thanksgiving meal.
A Welch’s ad from the 1960s implies that the first Thanksgiving meal included juice made from grapes. In 1928, Diamond marketed their walnuts as an accessory to dress up Thanksgiving dishes. Despite vociferous ad campaigns, few associate Welch’s grape juice or Diamond walnuts with Thanksgiving today.
But those early 20th-century ads for turkey clearly resonated: Today, nearly 88 percent of U.S. households have turkey on Thanksgiving, and approximately 20 percent of the turkeys consumed in any given year are consumed at Thanksgiving. This is a testament to the enduring influence of marketing on the holiday. For brands like Butterball (formerly Swift’s Premium), Thanksgiving is big business.
Whether you’re a turkey fan or not, prefer apple pie to pumpkin pie, enjoy canned gelatin over whole cranberry sauce, by celebrating Thanksgiving, you play a role as well. Marketers may have shaped many of the rituals of the holiday. But all Americans – from all backgrounds – certainly do their part to maintain them.

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
‘Days of Thanksgiving’ 
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
Harvest feast of 1621
Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
“The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth” by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets — William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels — he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.

He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity

	
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”

Washington’s proclamation was printed in newspapers throughout the country. (George Washington’s Mt. Vernon)
‘Pardon our national…transgressions’

	
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals — just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

Boxes of tissues were placed throughout the room for that very reason. 
“I think I can declare that this is definitely the best day here in our court,” Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh said at the start of the event. “Too often, what happens in a courtroom, including this one, involves sadness and tears as well as life changing decisions. But today, we replace sadness with joy, but we keep those tears and the life changing decisions for the families this morning.”
Eaton County Probate Judge Amanda Pollard presided over the adoption finalizations for two families from Eaton County.
Jackson Adams, 5, was adopted by his biological grandparents, Timothy and Lori Adams, who have served as his guardians since he was around two years old. Surrounded at the ceremony by other members of their family, they wore pins in memory of Jackson’s biological parents, who are both deceased. 
“We are so grateful that we have had such great help from the legal system and from our family,” Lori Adams said. “We’re here, and thank you.”

Milah and Autumn Woolley, ages 7 and 2, were adopted by their foster parents, Lyonel and Monalisa Woolley, alongside the Woolleys’ older son. Myla and Autumn are sisters and were adopted together at Tuesday’s ceremony, after being with the Woolleys for over two years.
“Since that day, they’ve been a part of my family,” said Lyonel Wooley. “I couldn’t go on without them being a part of my family.”
Pollard heaped praise on the Woolley family.
“I think that they exemplify, from my experience, what we should ask for in foster parents, opening their homes and loving support for kids who are in need of that support,” Pollard said, who presided over the foster case for several years.
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel said, in a speech after the adoption finalizations, that there are around 1800 children in Michigan currently in foster care with the goal of adoption.

“Days like these are such an important reminder of the love and the New Beginnings that adoption can bring to children and families across the state,” Hertel said. “It also serves as an incredibly important reminder to us about why our department and all of our partners continue to do the work that we do connecting kids to adoptive parents when we need to.”
Michigan hosts an Adoption Day ceremony each year. This year’s event, with the theme “Giving Thanks for Families,” marked the 23rd ceremony. 
“It’s a day set aside to shine a spotlight on the adoptions and celebrate the families who are finalizing their journeys today, whether it’s here in the courtrooms or across the state, we want to say congratulations to all the families today,” said Demetrius Starling, senior deputy director at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “Your decision to open your hearts and your homes is a profound act of love, kindness and compassion, hope for all of our children and we thank you for making a lasting difference in a child’s life.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_3132-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 07:58:46.541129

Mike Braun — now governor of Indiana — and U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin were among the 118th Congress’ most effective lawmakers, in an issue-specific analysis by the Center for Effective Lawmaking.
The center is a nonpartisan collaboration between the University of Virginia’s Batten School and Vanderbilt University.
Researchers there used 15 indicators of effectiveness to calculate scores for lawmakers who served from January 2023 to 2025. The metrics gauge how many bills a lawmaker sponsored, how substantial the policy proposals within were, and how far those ideas moved though the legislative process.
Then, they identified the top two performers — a Republican and Democrat — across 21 policy areas. The results were published last week.

Braun was named the most effective Senate Republican on housing policy. He got points for sponsoring two “substantive” pieces of housing-related legislation, one of which passed the Senate chamber, but didn’t become law.
Houchin was named the most effective House Republican on education matters. She sponsored one “substantive and significant” education proposal that became law, plus two “substantive” bills that died early on.
Committee chairs are often among best performers, but neither Braun nor Houchin led committees handling their respective top policy areas.
A broader analysis of the 118th Congress, released in March, identified Braun as the ninth-most effective lawmaker in the Senate, as well as the chamber’s fourth-best Republican.
He was lauded for introducing 116 bills, seven of which passed the Senate and four of which became law. Braun was also listed among first-term senators “exceeding expectations” by outperforming a benchmark.
“With Sen. Braun concluding his service in the Senate to become Governor of Indiana in January 2025, it is clear that there will be one less effective lawmaker among the more senior ranks in the Senate moving forward,” researchers wrote at the time.
All members of the 118th Congress, including the rest of Indiana’s delegation, are scored in an online database. They’re ranked by party.
Sen. Todd Young was lower than Braun despite sponsoring nearly three-dozen bills; one passed the Senate but it didn’t become law.
Rep. Larry Bucshon, who retired from the House in January, was the most effective Hoosier overall in that chamber. He was followed by Houchin and former U.S. Rep. Jim Banks, who has since won Braun’s seat in the Senate.
Former Rep. Greg Pence and current Rep. Jim Baird are next. Reps. Rudy Yakym and Victoria Spartz were near the bottom of the 228 Republicans.
Indiana’s two Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Frank Mrvan and André Carson, were also near the bottom of the 220 Democrats.
State lawmakers plan to meet in December to consider redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Those efforts will target Mrvan and Carson.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-27 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,A high-stakes Egg Bowl could be overshadowed by Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin’s future,"Robbie Faulk, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/27/egg-bowl-lane-kiffin/,The Ole Miss Rebels could secure a spot in the College Football Playoff with a win over the Mississippi State Bulldogs in Friday's Egg Bowl.,"STARKVILLE — The 124-year-old football rivalry between Ole Miss and Mississippi State has a new subplot that could very well overshadow what is a high-stakes game in its own right.
The sixth-ranked Rebels (10-1, 6-1 SEC, No. 7 CFP) could lock up a spot in the College Football Playoff with a victory Friday over the Bulldogs (5-6, 1-6) in the Egg Bowl — only to have their celebration muted if coach Lane Kiffin announces after the game that he has decided to leave the program for another suitor.
During the past two weeks, Kiffin family members have traveled from Oxford to both Gainesville, Florida, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while Ole Miss has sought to fend off efforts by Florida and LSU to lure away their coach.
Kiffin and Mississippi athletics director Keith Carter had a meeting last Friday where they reportedly discussed the coach’s future. Carter emerged from that with a public statement that Kiffin was focused on the Egg Bowl and a decision on his future would be announced by Saturday.
The sixth-year Rebels coach has offered little clarity since.
“Keith and I have a great relationship. We communicate daily on a lot of things and I love it here. It’s been amazing,” Kiffin said. “We’re in a season that’s the greatest run in the history of Ole Miss at this point, having never been at this point.
“It’s really exciting. So, I’m just living in the moment,” Kiffin continued. “And our players are, too, you know? I see their joy … about where they’re at and have so much on the line. It’s just awesome to be a part of.”
This is the second time that the rivalry game has been shadowed by Kiffin’s potential exit from Oxford.
In 2022, Kiffin was linked to an opening at Auburn. His Rebels lost to the Bulldogs at home, 24-22, and wound up 8-5, but Kiffin signed an extension with Ole Miss.
Going for gold
A trophy known as the Golden Egg has gone to the winner of this matchup since 1927 — a year after a brawl broke out in Starkville after Ole Miss fans attempted to take down the goal posts.
There has been plenty more vitriol between them since, regardless of what else was at stake for either team.

On Friday, the stakes are higher for the Rebels, but the Bulldogs have a chance to extend their season as well because one more victory would make them bowl eligible in coach Jeff Lebby’s second season.
“We have a bunch of staff members that played here and played inside this game, understand what it’s about,” Lebby said. “The more you can talk about that part of it and guys that have come before and played in between the white lines in this game, they have the ability to communicate to our guys that haven’t been here long and don’t know the history as some of the others.
“It’s great for our entire football team to understand the urgency of what’s at stake,” Lebby added. “You see the guys that are from this state and have played in this game, there’s great pride in how we do what we go do on Friday.”
Recent dominance
Ole Miss has had the better of this rivalry in recent years, winning the past two and four of the past five.
But Kiffin, who had Lebby on his Ole Miss staff earlier this decade, has been impressed by the Bulldogs’ improvement this season.

The town of Manchester authorized two nonbinding agreements at a special meeting last Friday that will both conserve a flood prone area and allow needed housing at another site.
Under one part of a memorandum of understanding, Blackacre LLC — which owns the flood prone plot on Richville Road — agreed to come to the table to formalize a deal to donate the eight-acre property proposed for a housing development to the town. A local developer Paul Carroccio, who was consulting with Blackacre LLC, had planned to construct housing on the site. 
The town also agreed to work toward a lease agreement to sell undeveloped land sandwiched between a highway and an abandoned airport to a company owned by Carroccio for the construction of housing and other mixed use development.

The proposed priority housing project highlights the tension between pressing issues faced by the state to push for more housing and plan for natural disasters.  
The project proposal unleashed a torrent of local opposition and sparked questions regarding the application of new legislation to exempt some development from the state’s land use review process.
Manchester town manager Scott Murphy said he is glad the town and developers have kickstarted the public comment period so agreements can be formalized within 90 days. After acquiring an easement to conserve the land in perpetuity, the town plans to transform the eight acres on Richville Road into a community resource for recreation and agriculture, Murphy said.
Ed Gotgart, one of the neighbors who opposed the initial site, said the change of course was a “win-win” for the town and developers. People should not live on a flood hazard overlay district, Gotgart said, but they should be able to use the land for recreation. Plus, the town seeking a conservation easement means the view of “magnificent Mount Equinox” will be preserved, he said.
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, aided Richville Road neighbors who mobilized against the initial housing proposal. While in favor of a conservation easement on the property, Smith cautioned the town against setting up any recreation structures on the land that may exacerbate flooding. 
Murphy said the town had previously sought requests for proposals to develop the undeveloped plot on Airport Road, but acknowledged that extending the water and sewer lines on the site will cost the town $4 to 5 million. Once an agreement is finalized, Carroccio plans to offer $1 million toward the town project.
Of the 60 acres on Airport Road under current town ownership, no more than seven acres will be sold to a third party. Another seven acres is currently conserved for agriculture. The remaining 46 acres could be developed by Carroccio if the parties come to a final agreement. 
In the short term, Carroccio said he plans to construct four to eight of the so-called “workforce” housing units on the Airport Road property, but he said the site could hold over 200 units, including 50 workforce housing units. 
Workforce housing is defined in the Manchester Town Plan as “reasonably priced housing” that is not subsidized, but is targeted toward individuals, families and younger people who want to afford housing in the community they work in. 
Carroccio said that Manchester does not have housing stock that is affordable for people with moderate incomes that are too high to qualify for subsidized, affordable housing projects.
Dom Penges, a neighbor who opposed the original Richville Road development proposal, said the new housing site proposal appears to be a “better one.”
“It’s a nice, beautiful, flat piece of ground close enough to town, but without any hazardous flooding issues,” Penges said “I think if they did it properly — if they come up with guidelines that they could have the developer stand by — I think it would be a great asset for the town.”

But what happens when that plan backfires and accidentally benefits the opposing party instead? Enter what politicos call the “dummymander.”
Republicans in several states, including Missouri, followed President Donald Trump’s orders to redraw congressional maps to protect the GOP’s House majority. To do it, they carved up blue seats and dispersed those Democratic voters into deep red districts, making many hue more towards pink.
Earlier this month, Democrats scored massive wins across the country — seen by many as a rebuke of the president and the prelude to a blue wave in next year’s midterms. Could that wave be large enough to turn carefully constructed GOP maps into a dummymander?
Republicans worried about that very scenario in Missouri two years ago, when state senators rejected a map that would have given the GOP seven of the state’s eight congressional seats. They feared a 7-1 map could swing to a 5-3 map if political winds shifted.
Those concerns were set aside in September when the legislature redrew the map to break up the Kansas City-based 5th District represented by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver.
So does this make Missouri a prime candidate for a dummymander?
Probably not.
The key difference between 2022, when the 7-1 map was deemed too risky, and 2025, when it was approved, is the retirement of Republican U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer. His rural St. Elizabeth home made it difficult to keep him in his district while maintaining a GOP advantage everywhere else.
Luetkemeyer’s replacement, Bob Onder, lives in the St. Louis suburbs, making a gerrymander easier.
Under the new lines, the previously Democratic 5th District would have voted for Trump by 18 percentage points last year, said Erin Covey of Cook Political Report, a national nonpartisan newsletter that analyzes election trends. And Trump would have won the new 4th District — which now includes more Democratic voters from Kansas City — by 21 percentage points.
Even the 2nd District, long targeted by Democrats, became redder under the new map. Covey said the new 2nd District would have voted for Trump by 11 points, compared to 8 points before.
She notes that the last time the U.S. saw a blue wave — in 2018 — the reddest seat Democrats flipped was in a New York district Trump won by 15 points.
Now, all this could ultimately be moot. A referendum campaign is raising millions to put the new map on the 2026 ballot, which could freeze the current districts in place until an up-or-down statewide vote.
But if the new map stands, Missouri Democrats shouldn’t be so discouraged that they don’t recruit and run strong candidates, said Kyle Kondik of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, which also provides nonpartisan political analysis at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.
“If the wave comes,” Kondik said, “you want as many surfboards in the water as possible.”
Look no further than Tennessee, where Democrats are contesting a special election for a U.S. House seat Trump carried by 22 points. Despite the district’s deep red tilt, Democrats are making a play, hoping an anti-Trump electorate is ready to rebuke the party in power.
As both parties brace for the chaos of 2026, one thing’s clear: in the game of gerrymandering, the only certainty is that the lines will always keep shifting.

(Photo courtesy of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Department of Corrections may soon have a new tool to eliminate the use of contraband cellphones among inmates following a decision from the Federal Communications Commission.
Kay Thompson, an Oklahoma Department of Corrections spokesperson, said the agency is in talks with different companies to provide technology to jam cellphone signals within state prisons.
The FCC earlier this year advanced a proposal that for the first time could allow state prisons to use cellphone jamming technology to block phone signals amid a rise in contraband phones in prisons. The federal agency announced it is taking public comments on proposed rules, a step necessary to allow the jamming technology.
Thompson said contraband cellphones are a growing problem in Oklahoma prisons.
From January to August, the agency confiscated 4,475 cellphones, she said.

Inmates use the phones to coordinate violence, harass victims and for other criminal activity, she said.
“Being able to use jamming technology is another tool to help us combat cellphones, which will negatively impact the introduction of all contraband and make our facilities safer for both staff and inmates,” said Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Justin Farris.
Cellphones are often smuggled into prison by visitors, staff or with drones. Drones drop them onto prison property, Thompson said.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond and 12 other attorneys general sent the federal agency a letter in support allowing jamming devices.
Current FCC interpretation of federal rules prohibits the use of jamming devices in prisons, his office said. A 1934 federal law allows only federal authorities the authority to block public airwaves.
“It’s time that our rules and policies catch up with the needs of 21st century technology and stop any and all criminal activity from occurring through illicit means of communication within our prison walls,” Drummond said in a press release.
Thompson said the agency does not anticipate asking lawmakers for additional funds to implement a program to jam cellphones behind prison walls because it has enough money in its technology budget. However, some other projects may need to be put on hold, she said. 
“We don’t know what the technology is going to be or even an estimated cost at this point,” Thompson said.
A past concern was that jamming devices could impact users outside of prison boundaries.
But Thompson said technology has evolved to a point where the jamming devices can be targeted and not impact those outside prisons.
She said the project would not impact staff because employees are already prohibited from bringing in cellphones. 
Thompson said the jamming technology would be rolled out starting with the maximum-security Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester and then into larger, medium-secure facilities.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The Elver Park Neighborhood Center on the far southwest side of Madison has long been a familiar and welcome source of help for Joeniece Jackson and her four children.
Her oldest, now 14, attended the center’s after-school programs from an early age, as have her other three kids. And Joeniece says she’s enjoyed volunteering as well, or bringing the children of friends who may need child care unexpectedly.
But in the last few years, the center has served another purpose as well — as a food pantry for families who need to stretch their family meal budgets.
“The food pantry has gotten us through some of our hard times,” Jackson says.
The Elver Park after-school program isn’t the only one doing double duty. Across Wisconsin, other after-school programs have added food pantry services to their offerings for families who may not be able to afford to keep their cupboards full.
“After-school programs have long been doing after-school meals and snacks for kids,” says Daniel Gage of the Wisconsin Out of School Time Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of after-school programs. Food pantry programs are a newer addition to that work. “After-school programs tend to be a place where people come together as parents are coming to pick up their kids.”
The recent federal shutdown, when federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Payments were halted Nov. 1, exacerbated the need. With the shutdown finished and SNAP funds flowing again, that has eased off, but only slightly.
The Elver Park Neighborhood Center and its after-school program are run by the Wisconsin Youth Company. The agency operates two neighborhood centers in Madison along with school-based after-school programs in Dane County and  Waukesha County.
Elver Park’s food pantry began operating during the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools were closed and, for a time, the center’s after-school programs were on hold as well, according to Takela Harper, the assistant director of centers for Wisconsin Youth Company.
Originally the center partnered with the Madison Metropolitan School District to deliver food to school district families who needed it, Harper said. When schools and after-school programs reopened, the program converted to a store-style food pantry, where families come on Tuesdays and Thursdays to pick up donations of packaged as well as fresh foods.
At Elver Park, there’s been “a consistent flow” in traffic for the last couple of years, Harper says. But that doubled in October from the previous month, with about 30 to 50 families a week coming in for assistance.
In Nekoosa, located in Wood County in North Central Wisconsin, the Nekoosa School District launched a food pantry a year ago. The city has a population of about 2,500 and the school district an enrollment of just over 1,200.
Nikki Stearns organized the Nekoosa program while serving in Americorps with the local YMCA. Her Americorps assignment had her working with elementary school-age children, and she soon learned the extent of hunger in some of those kids.
“So many of my kids are hungry,” Stearns said. “I started bringing in snacks, and other teachers started bringing in snacks for students, too.”
A 2023 United Way report on ALICE families in the community — families on the edge and vulnerable to falling into poverty — documented how pervasive families are who cannot count on regular meals or an adequate supply of food .  
“In Nekoosa, 53% of our community is either living in poverty or one paycheck away,” Stearns says.
In the Nekoosa program, families who sign up receive a box of food each month. Some are also enrolled in FoodShare — Wisconsin’s name for the state’s SNAP benefits program. When SNAP payments stopped Nov. 1, however, the food pantry’s signups shot up.
Through September and October, the Nekoosa program served 38 people — eight to 10 families, Stearns said. That jumped to more than 50 in November after SNAP benefits stopped.
“The first day when SNAP benefits weren’t uploaded to people’s [electronic benefits] cards, I think I had 35 applications come in in one day,” Stearns said.
 “Now we’re serving about 200 people.” Even with the resumption of SNAP after the end of the shutdown, the demand has not diminished significantly, she added.
The Nekoosa food pantry program had been housed with the YMCA after-school program, based at a middle school. In June, the school transferred the food pantry program to the operation of the YMCA, which moved it to share space with the Y’s child care program, where recipients pick up their monthly boxes of food.
Providing a monthly allotment of food proved to be the most practical way for the Nekoosa program to operate, Stearns said, because “I don’t always know what [food] donations we’ll get or how much funding we’ll have to support people.”
The Nekoosa program was launched as part of a Wisconsin Partnership Program grant that the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health made to the Marshfield Clinic. With the $500,000 grant, the clinic was able to fund seven projects across the state’s northern half to address food insecurity.
“When students are fed and have those basic needs met, with food as one of those basic needs, they certainly can learn and focus so much more,” says Jill Niemczyk, a health educator with the Marshfield Clinic’s Center for Community Health Advancement who has been coordinating the program.
Other projects included a food pantry expansion, a teen meal program, gardening projects and a variety of nutrition education and community engagement programs.
“Each one of our seven sites is doing something a little bit different,” Niemczyk says.
The grant is now in its second year. In the third and final year, she says, attention will turn to assisting the various recipients as they look at how to establish ongoing community support and build on what they have been doing.
Even with SNAP benefits restored with temporary legislation to fund the federal government through January, Stearns expects the need to address hunger and food insecurity to persist.
“I think a lot of people are feeling like the food crisis is addressed” because the shutdown ended, Stearns says. “But a lot of us in food security are nervous about January. There’s a pretty big need to focus on people being fed — students are going to school hungry, whether there’s FoodShare or not.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The other day I spoke with a dear friend I’ve known since I was 21. As we compared Thanksgiving plans, I described my usual traditional menu: turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, salad, cranberry relish, pie – the comforting repertoire my husband and mother insist on. I don’t have strong feelings about the menu, but I love making people happy, and I do love gravy.
My friend, though, was headed to a community “pitch-in.” Her assigned dish? Mashed potatoes. Yet, in her 80s now, her hands were hurting, and she didn’t feel up to making the smooth, whipped, traditional version. Instead, she planned to bring what she called “chunky, smashed, skin-on Yukon gold potatoes.” Just potatoes boiled and smashed with butter, salt and pepper.
“Sounds great,” I said. But she was anxious. She feared her dinner companions would want potatoes “like Grandma made,” and worse, that they’d judge her deviation from the script. She didn’t believe they would be grateful for her contribution; she feared they might be annoyed. She even asked if I’d write a poem for her to give her fellow diners to help “curb” the change.
Her worry was both touching and deeply familiar. I had just finished teaching a course on leading through disruption and change for MBA students in the Iowa State University Ivy College of Business. We spent weeks discussing how the pace of change, whether from geopolitical, technological, organizational or cultural shifts, is accelerating, and what that means for leaders. Research consistently shows that humans resist change as a survival mechanism; often, the more disruption we experience, the more we cling to the familiar. As a result, in times of turbulence, we yearn for reliable anchors: a workplace that feels predictable, technology we understand, mashed potatoes just like Grandma used to make. Consistency give us comfort, identity, and a sense of continuity when the world feels unsteady.
Yet leadership in the modern world requires helping people acknowledge that change is both inevitable and constant. Change itself is neither inherently good nor bad, but it is unstoppable. We can yell into the sky: “No more change!” – but that will not slow anything down. We can only control our own reaction to it. Instead of assuming the worst and resisting, leaders must acknowledge the change as real and cultivate adaptability, nimbleness and emotional intelligence. We must learn to communicate in an empathic and human-centric way, and to help others navigate ambiguity, see new possibilities, and even discover gratitude for what the new can bring.
Gratitude may seem like an odd companion to turbulence, but research shows it is foundational to effective leadership. In an article called, “How to Show More Gratitude at Work: Giving Thanks Makes You a Better Leader,”The Center for Creative Leadership notes that leaders who express gratitude build trust, wellbeing, and engagement in their teams. And new studies from the University of Florida reveal that when leaders reflect on gratitude received from family members, they show more empowering and supportive behaviors at work. Gratitude literally broadens our mindset, both psychologically and biochemically, making us more resilient and more connected both professionally and in our personal lives.
At the same time, gratitude must be balanced. As Harvard Business Review scholars Lan Nguyen Chaplin and Mike Chisholm note, excessive gratitude can become a trap, making people hesitant to self-advocate or voice legitimate concerns. The key is not blind positivity but “empowered gratitude,” where appreciation coexists with ambition, boundaries, and honest reflection. Leaders must model this balance: grateful for what has been and what is, yet willing to ask for what might be better.
This, too, mirrors the tension many of us feel around family traditions during the holidays. My Thanksgiving table is smaller now. Our family is dispersed and others who we shared the traditional meal with have moved or passed away. I miss the siblings, stepchildren, and friends who once filled the room and feel the ache of change. And yet, there are unexpected gifts: less rushing, fewer dishes to wash, quieter conversations, more leftovers. I loved the old traditions, but I also love the new ones emerging in their place.
Which brings me back to my friend and her “modern” potatoes. They are not the whipped clouds of childhood memory, but they carry their own warmth: creative, rustic, honest. They reflect her changing abilities, her desire to show up anyway, her willingness to contribute in a way that honors both tradition and reality. I hope her fellow diners greet her potatoes with delight rather than comparison; I hope they practice gratitude for the spirit behind the dish, not the perfection of the recipe.
Because this is the real leadership lesson, whether in organizations or around a crowded buffet table. We want the comfort of tradition, but the pace of life requires us to accept and even embrace the new. Gratitude helps us bridge the gap between what was and what is becoming. It steadies us as we adapt, and it softens us as others do the same.
So this Thanksgiving, may we savor both the familiar and the unexpected. May we honor Grandma’s recipes while welcoming chunky, smashed, Yukon-gold innovations. And may we practice the kind of gratitude that strengthens us for change: generous, grounded and open to whatever new flavors arrive on the table.



Here is the poem I wrote for my friend’s Thanksgiving:
Giving Thanks for Chunky Smashed Yukon Gold Potatoes
O beloved presence at the heart of the universe,
today I lift my spoon and my spirit
in gratitude for the humble potato,
that golden oracle of comfort.
Thank you for spuds that shape-shift with our moods:
fried with a sizzle, French fried with flair,
deep fried into celebratory crunch,
hash browned at sunrise, tater totted for joy,
cubed for soups, or layered in creamy devotion.
For baked beauties bursting with generosity,
and for the holiday mound of butter-kissed mashed potatoes
Grandma conjured with her quiet magic,
I give thanks.
But the world keeps spinning, full of surprise and reinvention.
My hands, marked by age and experience, welcome change.
So today I honor the modern potato,
the chunky, skin-on Yukon gold,
earthy and honest, tender with bits of truth.
A reminder that life is not always smooth,
but textured, real, and rooted.
Variety surrounds us, tradition gently bends,
perfection is unnecessary, and choice is abundant.
Giving thanks again and again strengthens us.
And may this humble, chunky Yukon gold remind us
that we too can evolve,
soft in some places, textured in others,
honoring where we have been
while embracing where we are going.
For in every potato and every moment
there is proof that we can rise, grow,
and remake ourselves
beautifully, bravely,
bursting with flavor,
blessed with favor.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)When Alex Adams stepped into his role leading the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in June 2024, he immediately announced a laser focus on foster care. 
Adams, nominated by President Donald Trump in March and last month confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Administration for Children and Families assistant secretary, is now taking a similar approach to his federal position. 
On Monday, the federal administration announced the launch of “A Home for Every Child,” an initiative to bring up the ratio of foster children to foster homes to 1-to-1.  
“Our Home for Every Child initiative nationally is really modeled off of what we did here in Idaho,” Adams said in an interview Wednesday in Boise.  
As the state Health and Welfare director, Adams focused on policies to improve recruitment and retention of foster families as well as to prevent children from entering the system when possible, the Idaho Press reported. While his role now is more of an “overseer,” rather than provider of foster care services, he said he wants to focus on the same goals. 
Many of his goals are outlined in a federal executive order signed Nov. 13 by Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. 
 Adams hopes to start by collecting the right data, doing away with the rest 

Around two months into the new job, Adams said he’s hoping to start the new initiative by learning exactly how many foster homes there are nationwide. 
“We don’t have good data on the number of homes nationally,” he said. “We require 200 data points from each state to be reported to us at the federal government, but homes is not one of them.” 
Adams cited the nonprofit foster family counting project from the news outlet the Imprint, showing there are about 57 foster homes per 100 youth in the system nationwide. He’s working on ensuring states are counting how many available foster homes they have. 
The administration is also in the process of evaluating how many of the required data points are necessary for states to continue to report. 
“Accountability for federal taxpayer dollars is important, but right now we’re collecting too much from states that we don’t do anything with,” he said. “… I want to start clearing away that brush so that the front-end service providers can spend more of their time and energy on things that actually benefit children, as opposed to just box checking and hoop jumping.” 
As part of the executive order, the federal agency was directed to identify and eliminate “unnecessary high-cost and low-value reporting requirements.” Adams said his agency has submitted ideas to reduce reporting requirements but couldn’t discuss them until they were approved.

 It’s up to the states to determine how to improve foster home ratio

The administration provides between $11 billion and $12 billion to state child welfare systems. The federal administration can create financial incentives and provide guidance, technical assistance and best practices, but Adams expects states to create their own plans to achieve the goal. 
His office is beginning to meet with state directors of health agencies or child welfare departments to start conversations around the goals and get their input before he launches specific directives. 
He highlighted his work in Idaho, which included policies to make it easier to find and license family members, or kin, increased recruitment through faith-based organizations, and added resources and services for foster parents. 
Idaho health official nominated to federal Health and Human Services role in Trump administration

He also focused heavily on prevention. During the 2025 legislative session, the child welfare budget included 36 new full-time employees for the prevention specialist team. Adams said at the time the majority of young people were entering the foster system because of mental health or substance abuse issues, and he wanted to focus on providing services to parents in the home to prevent their children’s removal. 
 There’s ‘right’ and ‘wrong ways’ to focus on prevention, Adams says 

Adams highlighted Idaho’s work in prevention, but said there are “wrong ways” to do it. 
In Idaho, prevention policies coincided with a court decision that limited law enforcement’s ability to remove children from homes; these factors, combined with the pandemic, led to a “perfect storm,” that seems to have resulted in increasingly severe abuse cases of children entering the foster system, foster child advocates previously told the Sun. 
Adams said the administration is also working on about seven measures for states to implement alongside their policies to improve foster child-to-home ratios, to track indicators of child safety. 
“I’ve been on the job for about six weeks at this point, but suffice it to say, child safety is our number one priority at (the Administration for Children and Families),” Adams said. “And as we lean into this and try to get a home for every child, making sure it’s done the right way, which is why it’s going to be really important the seven safety measures that we wrap around this.” 
 Idaho among first states to implement ‘predictive analytics’ in foster care

Next week, the federal administration will begin meetings about the use of predictive analytics in child welfare, Adams said. 
The tool uses technology such as AI to help determine more quickly the best placement for a foster child, and move them more quickly toward permanency, either through adoption or reunification. 
Idaho is one of the first states working to implement the tool, Adams said. 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Division of Youth Safety and Permanency Administrator Jean Fisher told the Sun in October that the state agency was in the process of training in what are called “poor prognosis indicators.” 
“They’re national indicators that would really be able to help our social workers critically think through cases where they, based on what those indicators are, might understand the case a little bit better from an earlier perspective that this case clearly has some reunification efforts that are very strong,” Fisher said.
 Adams plans to address state foster systems’ use of children’s Social Security benefits 

Adams is also gathering information about a nationwide practice of state welfare programs — including Idaho — collecting Social Security survivors’ and disability benefits entitled to foster children and using them to pay for their care. 
Idaho foster youth didn’t receive Social Security money they’re entitled to. That will soon change. 

Adams, as Idaho’s health director, issued a directive in May for the agency to halt the practice by July 1, 2026. He said Wednesday he’s now hoping to address it in his federal position. 
“It’s very difficult to see any scenario in which you can morally justify, a child whose parents died, the parent having earned a Social Security survivor’s benefit, the child being entitled to that benefit, and then the state agency saying, ‘I’ll take that,’” Adams said. 
The magnitude of the issue is hard to quantify, he said, because the money collected tends to get lumped with other federal benefits. 
“The overall pie is estimated at about $160 million, but I have states that are telling me this might be 10% to 30% of the overall pie,” he said. 
He’s begun by telling directors it’s happening, because he’s found some who were unaware. There’s not currently a specific plan to address it. 
“I think the first thing I’m trying to do is get my arms around the magnitude of this,” he said, “because once you figure out the magnitude of it, then you can calibrate actions that are responsive to that.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_6203-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 06:57:02.141584

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)LINCOLN — The 43-day federal government shutdown this year left a period of uncertainty for Nebraskans receiving food aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, including a failed special session call at the request of some state lawmakers.
Many local communities, churches and nonprofits stepped up during the longest shutdown on record. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen made clear that Nebraska would not pick up the federal bill, a difference from leaders in some other states who released emergency funds. President Donald Trump also refused to use contingency funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
“Nobody’s going to go hungry,” Pillen said at a Nov. 6 news conference.

Days later, in his monthly call-in show Nov. 10 with the Nebraska Broadcaster’s Association, Pillen confirmed: “We, the state, are not going to provide SNAP benefits, pure and simple, if the federal government doesn’t.”
The shutdown ended when Trump signed a new spending bill late Nov. 12.
Special session needed 33 supporters
A group of 15 state lawmakers — 14 Democrats and the Legislature’s one nonpartisan progressive — had tried to force a special session to make Pillen cover SNAP payments and fund Head Start preschool and nutrition programs. 
The lawmaker-sought session also pushed for general changes in state law to address the rising costs of food, household necessities and other essential goods. Only items specified in a special session call can be considered during such a session. Had it been successful, it would have been the Unicameral’s first senator-initiated special session.

But by the 5 p.m. deadline on Nov. 14, no more senators had signed on to the special session call. The letter from State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha needed at least 18 more senators to agree that a special session was warranted.
“I still think that it was important to do, to show the people of Nebraska that legislators were trying to do something to help alleviate the burden everybody is under,” said Cavanaugh, who led the special session call.
The lone Democratic lawmaker not to join the call was State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, who told the Nebraska Examiner he supported the effort but couldn’t confirm his support as he was out of the country.
‘Bad news of SNAP benefits’
Had the shutdown continued, Pillen said Nebraska would have picked up the $100,000-a-day cost for WIC, the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program that supports low-income pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding mothers, as well as qualifying infants and children up to age five.

Pillen said Nebraskans take care of each other and that he was “old and long enough in the tooth” to remember when neighbors and churches helped one another, a “better” model than government involvement. He repeatedly said Nebraska would “go back the way we used to do it years ago, before the government got involved.”
The country’s first “Food Stamp Program” began in 1939 and ended in 1943, according to USDA. A revised pilot program came in 1961, when Pillen was five years old. It became permanent in 1964.
“The bad news of SNAP benefits,” Pillen told one caller to his Nov. 10 show, was “unfortunately, you’re living more in isolation, and nobody knows you need help, and it’s hard to ask for help.”
Pillen urged the caller to reach out to churches, food banks and other Nebraskans stepping up. He said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services was “standing on top of” the situation, but that Nebraska was not the federal government.

The next caller, a staffer for the Nebraska Democratic Party, told Pillen his answer was a “cop out.” Pillen responded that when Nebraskans know someone is in need, they help.
“If you just stand there and think the government is going to solve every problem, no,” Pillen said. “That’s not a ‘cop out.’ Pun intended, thinking the government is going to feed everybody is hogwash.”
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., a Democrat, was among many local officials organizing community responses. His office launched and helped a citywide food drive with city and county officials directing available funds to nonprofits and community partners.
‘Why pay taxes anymore?’
Cavanaugh said lawmakers had “no idea” when the shutdown was going to end or what would happen with SNAP. Come Oct. 31, with slightly more clarity about how the federal government would respond, or wouldn’t, she and her colleagues decided not to wait.
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, a member of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee with Cavanaugh, said the special session call was meant to provide leadership, because Nebraskans were in need.
“We’re glad that it’s restored for folks now, and that doesn’t change the crisis that we are coming into,” Spivey said.

State law requires the Nebraska secretary of state to forward a special session request to all other lawmakers and solicit responses if the initial call is made by at least 10 lawmakers. State senators then have 10 days to join.
Cavanaugh’s group sent an identical request Nov. 3, which reset the 10-day clock. Secretary of State Bob Evnen’s office emailed and mailed the request to all other lawmakers the next day with a Nov. 14 deadline. If successful, Pillen would have needed to convene the Legislature within five days of Evnen’s confirmation.
Cavanaugh said she was “disappointed” in the lack of lawmaker responses, especially after she talked to “several” Republican colleagues who she thought would be supportive.
“I question why pay taxes anymore if our taxes are supposed to go to public good and to support our most vulnerable populations … and they’re not,” Cavanaugh said. “They’re going to corporate welfare and to the 1%.”
‘Our community stepped up’
One of those senators Cavanaugh talked to was State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who has supported food assistance programs, including an early 2024 call to force Pillen to permanently participate in a pandemic-era summer food program for low-income families. Pillen later reversed and signed up.

A SNAP-focused special session would cost money and would have come as the state continues to dig out of a budget hole, Hughes said. The Pillen-ordered session focused on property taxes in summer 2024 cost $9,529 per day. 
Hughes said a new special session likely wouldn’t have gotten fully underway until this week or later.
“Well, call me crazy, but I just really feel like this will be resolved before anything would happen special session-wise,” Hughes recalled telling Cavanaugh.
Hughes told the Examiner: “I would just be sick if we spent money on something that was not necessary.”
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, gave a similar assessment on why he didn’t join the special session call.

State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, another Republican who has worked with Hughes, progressive lawmakers and others on food assistance in the past, said he felt the shutdown was nearing an end when the call reached his mailbox. But had the shutdown continued for “months and months,” he said lawmakers would have needed to act. 
Brandt, a farmer representing a rural district in southeast Nebraska, also noted that the United States is the richest country in the world and said it’s “obscene” that anyone goes without food.
“I don’t want to see anybody go hungry,” Brandt said.
Hughes said she was confident Washington, D.C., couldn’t be shut down that long and that she was delighted by how many Nebraskans were ramping up services, increasing food donations and expanding community outreach, including in her Seward-area district.
“For this one month of delay, I feel like our community stepped up and filled the gap,” Hughes said.
‘Limited bucket of funds’
Chelsea Salifou, CEO of Omaha-based Heartland Hope Mission, said the return of SNAP benefits has not yet equated to stabilization. 
During the SNAP delay and uncertainty, many turned to food pantries but were unable to get certain necessities or baby items, so some families used dollars that would have otherwise gone toward housing and utility bills, Salifou said.
While trying to catch up, many face rent shortages and power shut-off threats. 
“There is a limited bucket of funds to help with those things,” said Salifou, whose organization provides a wide range of resources beyond groceries. 
Questions, concerns cloud Nebraska SNAP food benefits, despite judge’s order

She said the nonprofit’s Christmas gift registration list signals tough times ahead. Currently, about 8,000 kids are registered, she said, about a 30% increase over last year at this time.
“Our biggest concern right now is housing stability for these families that have gotten behind on rent because of delayed SNAP benefits,” Salifou said.
Concern is escalated by the permanent loss of SNAP and medical benefits for refugees and others due to changes resulting from President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law, which Trump and allies called “big” and “beautiful,” says Hannah Vlach of Omaha-based Restoring Dignity, which works with refugee communities.
The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that some 6,300 refugees, asylees and other Nebraska newcomers without permanent residency status are losing food aid benefits altogether.
Under the megabill approved July 4, the grocery benefits now will be limited almost exclusively to citizens and green card-carrying lawful permanent residents who also meet income guidelines.
About 150,000 Nebraskans, nearly 8% of the state’s population, currently participate in SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible.
“It’s going to be bad,” said Vlach.
Support for refugees
Vlach’s organization on Wednesday launched a “Feed a Family” campaign, asking faith communities, organizations and households to sponsor refugee families who have permanently lost public food assistance.

The effort comes on the heels of a memo from the Trump administration calling for an unprecedented review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, affecting potentially 230,000 refugees who entered the U.S. between 2021 and 2025 after going through a rigorous admissions process.
A signal of need locally, said Vlach, is illustrated by a donation she received Tuesday of this week, a $700 batch of gift cards. They were gone two minutes after she put out the word they were available, she said.
Many of the refugee families seeking assistance are large, with 10 children, she said. 
One beacon of hope, Vlach said, is that families should be getting income tax refunds back early next year, which could help sustain them for a short while.
2026 session on the horizon
Clements said the federal changes were “pretty minor” in his view and that Nebraska’s split on covering Medicaid costs with the federal government didn’t decrease, unlike last year, a major component of the latest budget hole that lawmakers filled this spring.

SNAP administrative costs will increase for Nebraska as a result of federal spending changes, but Clements said those can be absorbed into the state budget.
“I was pleased with how the federal changes were not severe to us,” Clements said. “We have enough other challenges with the budget.”
Spivey disagreed and said, “We can’t cut our way out of it.” 
She said lawmakers will need to focus on spending priorities, which she argued should include child care, housing and other social safety nets. Cavanaugh said she’s approaching her last session in 2026 with a “very heavy heart” and feels it’s been a “losing battle” to get lawmakers to “care more.”
Spivey said she hopes lawmakers leave party politics behind.
“The beauty and the history and intention of our institution is that we work across the aisle and we have conversations, even if people don’t agree,” Spivey said. “My hope is that I can continue to work hand in hand with all of my colleagues around really important issues facing Nebraskans.”

Silas Wilbur remembers fishing for trout on the Little Salmon River as a kid. His parents owned a ranch on the Little Salmon, north of New Meadows, and he used to visit frequently.  
“I used to catch a lot of trout on the river, that was really fun,” Wilbur says. “You can’t catch any trout in that stream now.”
Wilbur grew up in Weiser, and his parents ran Texas longhorn cattle on the Meadows Valley property. “That’s some of the best grass in the state,” he notes.

When his parents reached retirement age, they leased out the ranch. During the COVID years, Silas and his wife, April, made a permanent move to the family ranch in Meadows Valley.  
They’re still raising cattle on the ranch, and they also have chickens, goats and a llama named Reba. 
“We like cattle, but it’s not our first priority, honestly,” Silas Wilbur says. “As soon as we moved up there, we’ve been working on fixing up the place and doing some restoration work on the landscape.” 
The Wilburs approached the Natural Resources Conservation Service to learn about what federal assistance might be available. They also had a fortuitous visit from Wes Keller of McCall, who works in the fisheries department for the Nez Perce Tribe. In talking to Keller, they realized that the Nez Perce Tribe had a similar vision for restoring the Little Salmon River to improve riparian habitat for resident fish, steelhead and endangered salmon. 
“They used to call this area Chinook Meadows,” noted their neighbor to the north, Kurt Kroll. “I dearly love that place, I’m very grateful to have it.” 
Kroll bought his ranch property four years ago. He also has a strong interest in the restoring the property to improve the riparian area and enhance water quality in the Little Salmon River. 
Keller talked to Wendy Green, chair of the Adams Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Supervisors, about his conversations with the Wilburs and Kroll. To help improve the Little Salmon River water quality and riparian area fits the district’s mission. 
“This section of the Little Salmon is a 303 (d)-listed stream due to temperature, sediment and nutrient loads,” Green said. “We welcomed the opportunity to work with willing landowners to help improve water quality.”
 A habitat restoration project — the Idaho way

Green suggested that they could apply for a Water Quality Program for Agriculture grant from the Idaho Soil and Water Conservation Commission to install fencing along the Little Salmon to exclude cattle. 
In addition to protecting streambanks from livestock, the riparian buffer would support the Nez Perce Tribe’s effort to plant shrubs and trees to begin the restoration effort. The tribe had significant resources from a larger grant to restore fisheries in the Salmon and Clearwater river basins. But they wanted to make sure that the riparian plantings would be protected from cattle grazing. The fencing project made all of that possible.
“Our goal is to always help our local landowners find resources to accomplish conservation and restoration projects,” said Charlie Munden, a supervisor on the Adams Soil and Water Conservation District board. “We were happy to help.”
The Adams district applied for and received a $23,800 Water Quality Program for Agriculture grant to purchase 1.25 miles of fencing to begin restoration work on 385 acres of land in the Little Salmon River corridor shared by Kroll and the Wilburs. Plus, the Nez Perce Tribe owns 37 acres of land immediately to the north of those properties to tie more conservation projects together. 
The riparian fencing was installed in the late fall of 2024. The first round of riparian trees and shrubs were planted by a variety of volunteers in September 2025. 
“We’ve been really thrilled with the project so far,” said April Wilbur. “It’s been really wonderful.”
“It’s a beautiful piece of river – I can’t wait to see how things improve over time,” Kroll says.
“The end goal aligned perfectly for all of us,” added Silas Wilbur. “We all want a healthy river. It feels like a win-win-win project all the way around.”

 Background: Little Salmon River water quality issues

The Little Salmon River flows north for 45 miles from its headwaters south of New Meadows to its confluence with the main Salmon River near Riggins. The Upper Little Salmon River segment extends 12.5 miles, from Big Creek in the south downstream to Round Valley Creek. This stream segment is on the state’s list of degraded waters (§303(d) list) because it does not meet minimum standards for water temperature, bacteria and nutrients, the Adams district’s grant application noted.
“The proposed Meadows Valley Riparian Fencing Project is the necessary first phase of a comprehensive plan to reduce agricultural impacts and restore beneficial uses in the heart of the Little Salmon River segment that flows through the Meadows Valley,” Wendy Green wrote in the application. 
The Wilbur family’s property has 270 acres and 1.4 miles of Little Salmon River in the project area. Kroll has 116 acres and .6 miles of the river in the project area. With the Water Quality Program for Agriculture funding and $13,232 in landowner cost-share contributions, the landowners installed 6,573 feet of riparian fence to restore and protect 1.25 miles of the listed stream, along with significant wetlands. 
Livestock are being excluded from 132 acres on both properties. The project also features the following benefits: 

 It will meet or exceed a 42-meter riparian buffer in this reach as recommended in the Little Salmon River Total Maximum Daily Load Implementation Plan for Agriculture, 2008.
 It protects more than 15 acres of existing wetlands on the two parcels.
 It allows for future managed grazing in the riparian pastures, once shrubs have become established and streambanks have stabilized.

 What difference will the project make for water quality? 

Fencing cattle off streambanks can make a significant improvement in water quality. According to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, the fencing project will reduce sediment loads by 79 tons per year, nitrogen by 254 pounds per year, and phosphorus by 127 pounds per year.
Both landowners have met with the Natural Resources Conservation Service and begun the process of applying for EQIP federal funds in order to develop off-stream stockwater facilities, improve aging irrigation infrastructure, and refine their grazing plans.
In addition, the Nez Perce Tribe’s Watershed Division has offered expertise, labor, and plant materials to help restore riparian shrubs along the protected river reach. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, through its Idaho Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, has offered to provide equipment and staff time to assist with implementing BMPs. The Adams district has water-jet stingers available to aid in riparian planting, as well. 
“This restoration effort is going to require all hands on deck, and we have received enthusiastic support from many willing partners,” Green said in the Adams Water Quality Program for Agriculture application. 
Indeed, the tribe’s staff and volunteers from local schools, Idaho Fish and Game, the Forest Service, Alzar School in Cascade, and the University of Idaho Master Gardener program planted more than 500 trees and shrubs in the fall of 2025. Many more plantings are planned in 2026 and beyond. 
The Wilburs signed a contract with the Nez Perce Tribe that details the types of trees and shrubs that will be planted in the Little Salmon River riparian area over time. All told, more than 9,600 trees and shrubs are scheduled to be planted in the next five years. The trunks of the trees were protected with a mesh material to prevent deer from eating them. 
Plantings will include:

Thin-leaf alder 
Serviceberry
Birch
Red dogwood
Black cottonwood
Aspens
Six different species of willows 

Keller was out of the country when contacted for this story and was not available to comment. But Silas Wilbur gives him a lot of credit for pulling all of the partners together for the Little Salmon River restoration project. 
“Wes was really excited after our initial conversation, knowing that we all had a similar long-term vision for the Little Salmon River,” Wilbur said. “He worked his butt off on this project, quite frankly. We could not have done it financially without the WQPA grant and the tribe’s assistance.” 
“I’m starting to see positive changes in the river already,” he says. “I’m looking forward to catching trout in the Little Salmon once again.” 
“Things are looking good so far,” added Kroll. “I’m looking forward to seeing how things look 5 years from now. I think those plantings are going to grow up and thrive, and we should see a real positive change in the water quality of the river. Hopefully, someday, we’ll see steelhead and chinook spawning up here.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)In the summer of 2024, Arthur Barnard was invited to throw out the first pitch at a Boston Red Sox game. 
It was the first time he’d been to a professional baseball game since the 1980s, but he wasn’t there to just reconnect with America’s pastime. Barnard was among a handful of gun violence survivors and advocates invited onto the mound that day, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. 
Looking around the stadium, his first thought was of the size of the crowd. He estimated there were probably more than 40,000 people — which he noted was close to the 44,000 people who died from gun violence in America that year. 
Barnard thinks that way because his son, Arthur Strout, was one of the 18 people killed in the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston. 
Not even 24 hours after the shooting, Barnard said he knew he was going to take action. He didn’t know what it would look like, but he just started talking to people. He asked if there is a network for families affected by mass shootings, which led him to connect with a man whose daughter died in the Parkland High School shooting in Florida. 
Less than three months later, Barnard spoke at a press conference at the State House in Augusta in support of stronger gun laws. Thinking back, he said it felt like a circus with thousands of people crammed into the Hall of Flags. 
“This is not about taking guns,” Barnard said at the event, explaining to the crowd that he understands both sides of the issue. “This is about doing the right thing and finding the right politicians who are willing to do the right thing more than they’re afraid of losing their jobs.”
‘Doing the right thing’
After that first speech, Barnard said he transformed from someone who had never before read the text of a law to collecting signatures and traveling to Washington, D.C. to talk with Congress members. Through that evolution, his message stayed consistent: He wants lawmakers to pass laws that keep people safe. 
Barnard was also a strong supporter of the red flag referendum that Maine voters approved in November. His story was even featured in a campaign video. When he was out collecting signatures, Barnard said he often asked people if they would like to help with mental health and gun safety. As he sees it, the Lewiston shooting “was a mental health issue all day long.”
Maine voters opt for red flag law, expanding options for confiscating a firearm

That’s why to him a red flag law makes sense. Robert Card II, the perpetrator of the Lewiston shooting, needed mental health support and although his family sought help for him, they weren’t successful in getting it. Barnard said he considers Card a victim, too, because of his ultimate death by suicide. Had the red flag law been in place, Card’s family could have gone directly to a judge to have his firearms confiscated.
Barnard’s work volunteering for the red flag campaign and his other advocacy over the past two years culminated last week when he was recognized by the Maine Gun Safety Coalition.
Executive Director Nacole Palmer said that when she thinks of Barnard, she thinks of Atlas, the character from Greek mythology who holds the world on his shoulders. She called him “the hero of our movement.”
“His willingness to share his story so that others can be spared from having to endure that most painful loss is extraordinary,” she said. 
While Palmer was happy to recognize him publicly and tell the couple hundred people who were at the ceremony last Thursday in Portland about all the good Barnard has done, she said any award pales in comparison to the energy and passion he’s put in.
But if you ask Barnard, he said he’s just “doing the right thing.” Telling his story takes him back to those painful moments, but he also speaks up because he believes that Lewiston was an avoidable tragedy. 
Advocating beyond Maine’s borders
Although the red flag law passed, Barnard said his work is “far, far” from over. He wants his advocacy to stretch beyond the state’s boundaries to see laws passed that keep families across the country from experiencing what he has.
People, he said, need to be responsible for their guns. One of his proposals is to create a transfer of ownership document, similar to a vehicle title, that people would fill out when selling or purchasing guns.
He explained that it wouldn’t be a government registry, which many Second Amendment advocates oppose. Rather, he said it would increase accountability for who is buying and selling guns and could be helpful for police tracing weapons used in crimes. 
Palmer isn’t surprised Barnard wants to take his efforts beyond Maine and said she looks forward to continuing to work by his side.

That includes “Iryna’s Law”, a Republican-led measure that limits pretrial release options for those accused of violent crimes, ramps up scrutiny of court magistrates and attempts to jumpstart the state’s death penalty process.
State lawmakers passed the bill earlier this year after Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian woman, was killed on public transit in Charlotte. That killing sparked national headlines and drew the attention of the White House. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has called the new law a “first step to ensure what happened to her never happens again.”
Gov. Josh Stein signed the bill into law in October, praising its changes to pretrial release but calling its attempt to expedite the death penalty process “barbaric.” He also called for the General Assembly to further invest in mental health treatment.
The law requires secured bond or GPS-monitored house arrest for defendants accused of “violent offenses,” as lawmakers aim to prevent magistrates from releasing repeat offenders before trial. And court magistrates who oversee those hearings are now subject to suspension by state Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Newby.
“Iryna’s Law” also aims to streamline aspects of the death penalty and open the possibility of resuming executions.
Lethal injection remains the state’s default method of execution, but has been on pause for almost two decades amid continued legal and regulatory challenges. Under the new law, if a court finds the method to be unconstitutional, the state would be required to adopt another method. That could include the electric chair or firing squad.
Stein has said “there will be no firing squads in North Carolina during my time as governor.”
‘Public Safety Act’ creates new felonies, ramps up severity of other penalties
Another criminal justice law will also take effect Dec. 1, creating new criminal penalties and increasing the punishment for existing penalties. It also makes changes to post-conviction court motions, the release of firearms to defendants and out-of-state domestic violence orders.
The “Public Safety Act of 2025” also:

Creates new felony charges for exposing a child under 16 years old to a controlled substance.
Makes all instances of solicitation of minors by computer into more severe felonies.
Allows an out-of-state resident to pursue a protective order against another person for acts that have occurred within the state.
Creates the felony crime of “habitual domestic violence” if a person has repeated convictions of domestic violence. The new felony is a more severe violation than the defendant’s most recent violation.
Increases severity of felonies for possession and sale of fentanyl and carfentanil.
Requires defendants to file motions for relief after conviction within seven years of one of the events that led to that conviction.
Allows a sheriff to release surrendered firearms to a defendant without a court order if the defendant is not otherwise barred from having them. The sheriff must conduct a criminal history check before doing so.

Other North Carolina laws taking effect Dec. 1
More new criminal penalties: Creates a variety of new criminal penalties, including the unlawful sale and possession of embalming fluid and larceny of gift cards. Also increases punishments for other offenses, including larceny of mail and assaulting a utility or communications worker.
Online sexual exploitation: Requires online sites to establish procedures to remove pornographic images upon request. Allows the attorney general to pursue action against users or site operators who violate the law. Also requires the state registrar to maintain copies of previous birth certificates when a person requests to have their sex changed on their certificate.
(A separate, controversial section of the law, which defines “biological sex” and “male” and “female” among other terms, takes effect Jan. 1.) The law was vetoed by Stein and overridden by lawmakers.
Auditor investigations: Allows the state auditor to audit or investigate any entity that receives state or federal dollars. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Josh Stein and overridden by lawmakers.
Nondiscrimination in disaster recovery: Makes it a felony to discriminate based on political affiliation while providing disaster recovery assistance. The law was spurred by a report of a FEMA supervisor in Florida instructing workers to avoid homes with Trump flags or signs after Hurricane Milton.
Squatter removal: Allows property owners to pursue an expedited process to remove squatters.
Tinted windows: Removes window tinting from state safety inspection requirements. Drivers with tinted windows must roll down the window when a law enforcement officer approaches.
Nonprofit records disclosure: Bars public agencies from collecting or releasing unnecessary information about 501(c) nonprofit organizations’ donors, members or volunteers. It was vetoed by Stein and overridden by lawmakers.
Continuing care retirement communities: Makes a number of changes to licensure, certification and other regulations for continuing care retirement communities.

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)Days before Thanksgiving, volunteers at the Dream Center in Bismarck were busy prepping 40 turkeys for a holiday meal. 
Last year, the meal ministry served 500 Thanksgiving meals. This year, founder and executive director Jim Barnhardt anticipates more than 600 people will walk in for a sit-down dinner.
“We try to make food access very easy for people,” he said. “We see a lot of younger families and seniors who are trying to stretch their budgets. This is one way we can help.”
Communities across the state are seeing a growing need for food assistance this holiday season. 
Reasons for the increased need vary, according to community and faith leaders who are finding ways to address food insecurity. Some families and individuals are catching up financially after the federal government shutdown postponed federal food assistance payments in November. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget. 
North Dakota sends out SNAP money but effects of delay remain 

Others are challenged by the growing cost of groceries.
Still others are stressed by the need to prepare for this time of year. Colder weather means the cost of winter coats and heating bills. Christmas means gifts and more celebrations. 
It’s one reason the Dream Center will keep its food pantry open on Thanksgiving while the turkey dinner is being served. 
“We know going into the holiday season, a lot of people are trying to catch up and save money to buy some of the other things they need,” Barnhardt said. “A free meal or groceries makes a difference.”
Community Action Partnership in Minot has handed out Thanksgiving baskets for several years. This year, they distributed 30 baskets filled with a turkey and a $50 gift certificate. The priority is families the partnership has helped throughout the year.
That said, the organization could’ve handed out to more families but was limited by funding, said Willy Soderholm, executive director.
“We’re seeing more and more requests,” he said. “Over the last year or so, I’ve noticed a lot more need for food assistance. Food is expensive.”
In Fargo, Calvary United Methodist is one of several churches offering Thanksgiving meals and baskets for the holiday. Church leadership reached out to Fargo and West Fargo schools to identify families who might benefit. 
Calvary planned for 250 meals and opened registration on Nov. 3. 
By noon, all the meals were claimed and the church decided to offer an additional 50 meals.
“There’s a big need out there in the community,” said the Rev. Rey Colón, Calvary’s senior pastor. “We felt bad that we had to turn people away. Next year, we think we’ll double the amount.”
He and his staff think the government shutdown this fall drove people to sign up for a holiday meal. When registration opened in early November, the fate of SNAP benefits were uncertain. But even once federal food assistance was issued, the need for food remained.
“If you have a family of five, you might spend half of your food assistance for the month on one (Thanksgiving) meal,” he said. “It’s hard to justify that.”

When Red River United Indivisible became aware that federal food assistance could be frozen, its members decided to host community meals every Saturday in November. One week volunteers served hotdishes and desserts to anyone who came to the basement of the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Moorhead, Minnesota. 
Leftovers were packaged and distributed in downtown Fargo.
“We recognize that the price of groceries is going up and that SNAP benefits are no longer certain,” said Lyn Docter-Pinnick. “Families are struggling and a warm meal can make a difference.”
In Grand Forks, the Northlands Rescue Mission is preparing to deliver over 2,000 meals on Thanksgiving morning. Cooking started the weekend before and 25 volunteers were expected to deliver the meals to those who signed up until the day before Thanksgiving.
The fully cooked meals include turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberries, buns, a vegetable and pie.
“It’s all hands on deck,” said Elaina Wickman, interim director at the mission.  “Most of our staff volunteers on Thanksgiving. My whole family is involved. It’s quite a process.”
The mission typically distributes 60 food boxes every Tuesday and Friday to people who are food insecure, Wickman said. On the first Tuesday in November after food stamps were suspended, staff handed out over 100 food boxes – a record for the organization.
Federal food assistance has returned, but Wickman observes that people are worried.
“They don’t know what might happen in the future, so I’m seeing more people making decisions ‘just in case,’” she said.

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets — William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels — he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621. Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-Gen. Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November. It became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail.
The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led.
Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious.
Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political.
The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
‘Pardon our national…transgressions’
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws.
Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated.
This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and, of course, the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all.
Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals — just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Photo: Getty Images) Governor Josh Stein and the NC Department of Commerce last week celebrated seven new economic development projects, bringing the total number of new jobs created in North Carolina this year to nearly 33,000. But the thirst to attract more jobs to the state also brings new pressures on North Carolina’s water infrastructure.
A study released this month by the NC Chamber Foundation finds the state’s future growth may very well depend on how well the state can balance aging infrastructure, supply reliability, and uncertain funding over the long-term.

The report notes that North Carolina has more than 5,800 public water systems, including nearly 2,000 community water systems and over 3,600 wastewater systems. The systems are aging and in many cases are “financially fragile.” In rural communities, the problems are especially vexing because they can’t generate additional revenue due to the small customer base. According to the report, nearly one-third of North Carolina’s community water systems serve 100 or fewer customers, with limited resources available for maintenance.
A 2024 survey of water utilities conducted by the University of North Carolina School of Government and released this summer found that over half of the respondents (56.3%) said that their system does not engage in long-term supply or demand forecasting.
Another challenge highlighted by the chamber foundation’s report is the inconsistent data available on our water supply. The report points out that agricultural water users that withdraw one million or more gallons of water a day, and non-agricultural water users that withdraw 100,000 or more gallons of water a day, must report on their water usage annually to the Department of Environmental Quality. But agricultural withdrawals of less than one million gallons per day are not required to be reported. That data is collected through a voluntary survey.

Theresa Landewe, director and principal scientist for Intera, which conducted the analysis for the chamber, believes accurate data helps better understand the reliability of this resource.
“We need to understand what those limitations are, and really need a whole picture of all the water uses and how those impact each other,” said Landewe during a Nov. 18 webinar on the Water Infrastructure Competitiveness Report.  “Historically, we have all these small utilities, and they didn’t run into each other. They didn’t impact each other. Now with growth, everything has implications for our neighbors.”
 An aging workforce
In addition to data, the report highlights the need for more water system workers.
Roughly one-third of the national water-sector workforce will be eligible to retire within the next decade, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The report says the state can address that expected shortfall by creating new partnerships between state agencies, community colleges and professional associations to grow the next generation of operators, managers, and engineers.
“North Carolina has a great opportunity to leverage higher education in this regard,” said Jim Spangler, president of Spangler Environmental, an environmental consulting firm. “That pipeline of talent needs to be a priority for economic development success in this state.”
A key ingredient to growth
When Amgen announced it would expand its manufacturing operation in Holly Springs and invest $1 billion in Wake County, the biotech company had to be certain that it would have the water it needed now and in the future.

“Water isn’t just a utility for us, it’s an ingredient. It’s how we manufacture products for patients all across the globe,” said Dana Martinez, the head of corporate affairs for Amgen North Carolina.
“Water reliability and quality are essential from day one. Our bio-manufacturing depends on the consistent high purity availability from our municipal partners,” said Martinez. “It’s important that we have confidence that the systems can grow with us as we grow.”
Martinez said Amgen worked closely with local municipalities and the state Department of Environmental Quality early in the planning process to understand infrastructure, timelines and redundancy options.
“It’s important that we have a clear understanding of not just the current capacity, but the future expansion plans as well,” said Martinez.

Beyond industrial water use, residential water use can have a big impact on supply. Raleigh Water serves approximately 650,000 residents not only in Raleigh, but the surrounding towns of Garner, Wake Forest, Rolesville, Knightdale, Wendell and Zebulon.
And while many take safe, clean drinking water for granted, conservation remains critical. A leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons of water per day. The average shower uses five gallons of water per minute, based on Raleigh’s water usage calculator. And if you hand-wash your dishes with the water running, you use about three gallons of water per minute. Add it all together and the average North Carolinian uses between 50 and 75 gallons of water daily.
According to estimates from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the state requires over $10 billion to address drinking water infrastructure needs.
The chamber report recommends that the state establish sustainable, long-term funding mechanisms, advance regional partnerships to improve both resiliency and efficiency, and improve data collection to maintain North Carolina’s competitiveness.
“Water, in a regional sense, is like a bank account, and you can’t make decisions about what to spend and what to use if you don’t understand what’s there,” said Landewe. “You really need to have that understanding before you can say, ‘Yeah, we’re going to have this water here for the next 50 years.'”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/waterpfascancer-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-11-27 06:57:02.141584

(Getty Images)Foodborne illnesses involving raw milk exposure have increased after West Virginia legalized direct-to-consumer sales, according to information from the state Department of Health. 
Consuming raw or unpasteurized milk, which can be a health risk, has been legal in West Virginia since 2016 through herd shares, which allows people to pay a monthly fee to buy a share of a dairy herd and get a portion of the milk produced. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed House Bill 4911, which allows the direct sale of raw milk. 
According to the state Department of Health, between 2014 and 2023, West Virginia averaged about four foodborne illnesses per year among people who reported raw dairy as an exposure.  Between 2016 and 2024, the state investigated a single suspected outbreak involving raw milk. 
Since House Bill 4911 became law in June 2024, the state has had 12 foodborne illnesses where raw milk has been reported to have been an exposure, the state health department said. In the same time frame, the state has not investigated any outbreaks involving raw milk.
The illnesses reported include five cases of Campylobacteriosis, which causes diarrhea and spreads to people from animals, including cows; four cases of salmonella, a bacteria that causes diarrhea, fever and stomach pains; two cases of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or STEC, an illness that can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever, and can lead to kidney failure; and one case of Giardiasis, an illness caused by a parasite that causes stomach cramps, bloating, upset stomach and loose stools.
“Consuming raw milk can lead to serious health risks, especially for certain vulnerable populations,” Gailyn M. Markham, director of communications for the state Office of Shared Administration, wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. “Raw milk that has not been pasteurized can be a source of a foodborne illness. While good practices on farms can reduce contamination, they cannot guarantee safety from harmful bacteria.”
According to the health department, consuming saw milk was a potential risk factor for transmitting the bacteria, but other contributing factors may have been involved, so the state cannot confirm that the raw milk caused the illnesses. 
The bill legalizing direct raw milk sales had wide support from Republicans in both the state House of Delegates and the Senate during the regular legislative session last year. Then-Gov. Jim Justice allowed the bill to become law without signing it. 
The law requires that containers of raw milk be clearly labeled as “unpasteurized raw milk”, and include the name and physical address of the seller, the date of production, and a warning that consuming raw milk may increase risk of foodborne illness. Rules from the state Department of Agriculture require the milk be stored in a system or device that maintains a temperature of 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit until the exchange of sale. Any complaints of adulterated milk received by the Department of Agriculture are to be referred on to the state Department of Health. 
Beth Southern, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture, said the department has not received any reports of illnesses associated with raw milk sales. The department does not keep track of who sells raw milk or where, she said. 
Marie Krause, an associate professor in West Virginia University’s School of Agriculture and Food Systems, said it’s difficult to tell if the increase in foodborne illnesses is alarming without knowing how much raw milk was sold in the state in that time frame. She repeated the Department of Health’s point that the cases involved raw milk but may not have been caused by the raw milk. 
“Also, since there were no outbreaks linked to raw milk consumption, it means that no more than one person who consumed raw milk became ill at that time,” she wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)Groups have begun offering support or a rebuttal to the West Virginia Board of Education as they’ve asked the state’s highest court whether lawmakers have the authority to approve or reject education rules approved by the state board.
A Republican-led bill, passed earlier this year in West Virginia, gave lawmakers the ultimate authority over school board policies. It became law in April without the governor’s signature, and lawmakers behind the measure assumed it would trigger a lawsuit.
While state agencies submit rule changes to the Legislature for review, the state school board previously had autonomy to determine education policies. The West Virginia Constitution says, “The general supervision of the free schools of the State shall be vested in the West Virginia board of education which shall perform such duties as may be prescribed by law.”
House Bill 2755 requires that all legislative rules enacted by the board must first be authorized by the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability. Next, proposed rules would then be submitted to the full Legislature for review to determine adoption, rejection or possible changes. 
Three years ago, West Virginia voters rejected a similar proposal giving lawmakers the power in education. 
The state school board has challenged the legislation, filing a lawsuit that asks the state Supreme Court to determine whether lawmakers have the legal authority included in the bill.
The West Virginia Parent Teacher Association, which has more than 5,500 members in the state, submitted a brief in support of the state school board’s lawsuit, saying the legislation “would place unconstitutional limits on the board’s constitutional authority to oversee the state’s public schools and the board’s ability to make educational decisions based on the best interests of students.”
“House Bill 2755 is a hornbook example of one branch of government treading upon the constitutionally derived powers of other branches, which is an outcome of our system of checks and balances, as well as this court’s binding decisions, cannot abide,” the group wrote in the fling. 
The West Virginia PTA cited a1988 state Supreme Court decision that upheld the school board’s authority in rulemaking, saying the board has a “special standing” under the state constitution. The group said the ruling means the legislation passed this year “is void” and called on the state Supreme Court to declare the bill unconstitutional. 
The West Virginia Association of School Administrators and the West Virginia School Board Association also filed a joint brief in support of the school board.
“County superintendents, boards of education, and administrators all rely on the State [Board of Education] as the education expert to quickly and effectively implement policies to govern both the day-to-day and systemic operations,” they wrote. 
“The State [Board of Education] directs the functioning of the county boards. For example, when the State [Board of Education] issues state-wide standards, it is the job of the county to carry out those standards,” the filing continued. “Imposing legislative whims into the rulemaking process would upend the current process and remove constitutionally-granted authority from the hands of education experts.”
The Cardinal Institute, a conservative nonprofit focused on education policy, sided with the Legislature, saying the 1988 Supreme Court ruling should be overturned.
Their filing said the highest court’s ruling “infringes on the power” of the Legislature, and that the state school board should not be immune from legislative oversight and power. 
“As a part of the executive department, the Board of Education must be subject to the checks and balances of other departments,” the Cardinal Institute wrote in their filing. “The legislature has, by general law, provided a system of free schools throughout the state. But it will be noted that it is not prohibited from augmenting, and making more efficient, the general system of free schools.”
Lawmakers behind the bill said they wanted more accountability on the state’s struggling school system. 
In July, the board announced that it was planning to sue Secretary of State Kris Warner after it unanimously approved a new rule that dealt with design equipment standards for school buses. It was first approved by the state board on May 14 and put out for a 30-day public comment period.
The Secretary of State’s Office said it was obligated to reject that filing because of the newly passed law.

CEDAR RAPIDS — College and pro football teams have had a trick play called the Fumblerooski. The Kinney family invented a play I call the “Mom-arooski.”
It happened at a backyard Thanksgiving Day touch football game in my sister’s backyard in Cedar Rapids 24 years ago.
We were playing “boys vs. girls.” Of course, we boys thought we had the upper hand.
Nope. Dumb as a box of rocks.
On the girls’ opening play, Mom, who was celebrating her 79th birthday that day, crumpled to the ground upon the snap of the ball. We boys all rushed to Mom’s aid, fearing a twisted ankle or worse.
While we were all gathered around Mom, my sister handed off to my daughter Hannah, who was 9 then, and the little sweetie gleefully ran for a touchdown!
Mom was fine. My sister had dialed up a masterpiece, perfectly executed by Mom and Hannah.
I can hear deep-voiced John Facenda, narrator of NFL Films: “A play as devastatingly effective as a Jerry Kramer block on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field.”
That’s one of my happiest Thanksgiving memories. May you cherish yours and hopefully make some new ones.
Happy Thanksgiving.

In the open hatch of a truck parked close to the entrance, I see a little face, eyes wide and tearful, peaking out beneath thick blankets. 
I say hello and ask him if he is alone, yes, if he is scared, yes, if he wants to come inside, yes. He puts on a thick Spiderman poncho, and I carry him in. 
The spirited employee who is there every morning lets us come behind the check-in counter. I sit the boy down on a tall chair and take a seat next to him. She calls the police. I realize what is about to happen and warn the boy, the police are going to come, they are going to ask you questions, you are not in trouble, it’s OK to be afraid, it’s OK to ask for help, OK? His eyes are big as he glances toward the door.  
While we wait, I ask him questions: his name, his Halloween costume, his favorite trick-or-treat candy. Where is your mother? Are you hungry? The Y employee pulls a Goldfish snack bag from her own lunch when he says he likes cheese and crackers. 
He tells me his mother is in jail, and it reminds me of stories I’ve heard about the disparate sentencing for women here and how Idaho has the highest incarceration rate of women in the United States, by a lot.  
The police arrive, and they ask the boy questions; he doesn’t answer them but after they turn away he asks me where their guns are. I have trouble understanding him so he makes the signal for a gun with his pointer finger and thumb and points to their belts. 
Five EMTs arrive, all, it seems, sporting mustaches, to check for cold exposure. They are friendly, are able to get a couple answers out of him and leave without any concerns. 
Dad comes out and looks shocked but sober and calm. I can hear some of the questions the officers are asking: Where do you work? What were you thinking? Where do you park your car to sleep? It’s illegal to sleep in your car in Idaho in cities with populations over 100,000 so I gather they are building their case. 
The father says he is employed in the trades, an essential profession, and that his son goes to day care. I hear him tell the officer that he thought if his son woke up and got afraid he could just come inside. It’s a big miscalculation, born more from a lack of understanding of the socio-emotional needs of a child that age than from some intentional harm or simple neglect. 
The boy says he wants to go to his dad so we let him down from the tall chair and he gives his dad a big punch in the leg, as if to say, how dare you leave me. I say hello to the dad and goodbye to the boy and try to get some exercise before work, but I am quickly called back to the front desk to give a statement. 
The officer, a new one, asks me some basic questions. I repeat the story. She layers my answers with her own judgments, judgements I wouldn’t apply in this situation. 
Any questions for me, she asks. I ask if they are connecting the father with services. Oh we will connect him with services; he’ll be hearing from Heath and Welfare, she says in a lofty tone. 
The process is a total scene, so public, and so shameful. If I were that father, I’d find it hard to show my face there again. I myself have trouble returning the next day. 
Visceral memories of my own single mother, our houseless struggles, being left alone, terrified, and finally, the loss of her, all come flooding back. 
I have no recourse. I have no way of knowing what happened next, no way of offering the support I know he needs and that I would freely give. I am prevented from caring any further by a system that steps in instead. I am forced to walk away and encouraged to forget. 
But I cannot forget. 
We cannot forget that child’s face, not in the richest country in the world, while our government wastes money on ballrooms and bailouts, parties and private jets. Not while they rig it so the rich get richer while that little boy sleeps in the back of a truck with his mother in jail. I will never forget that father’s face, holding his son’s hand while the whole world bears down.

My father and mother were born in the 1920’s, grew up during the Depression and World War II, and November and December were not very different for them than the other 10 months of the year. Thanksgiving and Christmas days were quiet and simple. 
But not for their children: It was important to my parents to create memories for us and their grandchildren and what better way to do that than to start the holiday season with an unforgettable Thanksgiving lunch.  Food was always a big part of any special occasion that involved my   m demothe
My husband Larry’s first Thanksgiving meal as an official part of my family came in 1992. My family —  the Terrys — were East Tennessee Lincoln Republicans.  Even though he is a yellow dog Democrat, Larry had been warmly accepted by my family — or so he thought. 
Mother always started her Christmas decorating the day after Halloween. Every wall, staircase, table and corner in her home was covered with Christmas decorations and they stayed up at least until Jan. 2.  Starting at Thanksgiving, my sisters and I were expected to wear our best holiday motif sweaters and style our hair for the family pictures that would surely be taken.
Mother set the time that we would eat and on Thanksgiving morning, as soon as we arrived, we went to work. My daddy had an annual ritual of telling my sisters and me that it might be Mother’s last holiday season because she worked too hard. Then Daddy would worry which of his four daughters and their families were going to be late and whether the time of our arrival would impact the time we ate.



				My mother, a Republican, professed to like my new husband, a Democrat. But the food she served him made us all question her intentions.			


My sisters and I knew exactly what was involved in Mother’s “memory creating holiday” meal. My mother inherited her mother’s table and normally my parents had enough room around it for four to six people. But not for family gatherings! There were several heavy big wooden leaves that had to be installed to seat up to 20 people and the leaves had to be locked in to avoid accidents.  Our husbands offered to help, which we accepted for only the heavy lifting, and we had to collect chairs from all over the house and make sure they were sturdy. A chair collapsing during a big meal was funny but could be unhealthy. We then asked the men to leave so the sisters could privately share our news — or call it gossip if you must. 
The tablecloth had to hang correctly and at one time Mother’s table looked like something out of “Downton Abby” with her best china, polished sterling silver and cloth napkins. 
When it was just the two of them, Mother rarely cooked for Daddy. There was a friendly meat-and-three restaurant in their neighborhood, and eating there at least once a day —not necessarily together  —was a way for Daddy and Mother to socialize with the community and keep up with what was going on. 
This informal eatery had a catering service, and Mother decided to order her Thanksgiving meal from them. She picked up her order and put the containers of food in the trunk of her car, drove the short distance home and brought the food into her kitchen. She got up early on Thanksgiving morning to warm the food and to transfer most of it to her dishes. 
My husband, Larry Woods, was already a vegetarian when we married, and this caused much angst in our family. They thought he would starve without meat and that it would be okay to serve vegetables that had been cooked with pork, chicken or beef.  I suggested Mother add a dish of macaroni and cheese for Larry because what could go wrong?  Everyone loves macaroni and cheese. 
When we finally sat down to eat Daddy always said a few words before offering grace. Mother, in turn, always worried the food was getting cold while Daddy was praising Mother for her efforts and the Lord for our bounty. We kept our heads bowed and sometimes glanced and smiled at each other wondering how long this would go on before we could finally eat. 
Passing all the food was a production. which according to Mother — and manners expert Emily Post — was to the right. We all talked at the same time and tried not to drop the heavy serving pieces as we passed around the food. We had been raised to put a small portion of every dish on our plate, which did not apply to the vegetarian at the table. 
As we ate, I noticed the mac and cheese had a strange taste to it and that Larry was stirring and playing with his mac and cheese instead of eating it and served himself a mound of bread each time the silver breadbasket was passed. 
Finally, we cleared the table and began preparing dessert. When my sisters and I were alone in the kitchen, I asked them if they noticed anything weird about the mac and cheese, and they all said it tasted terrible. One of us asked Mother if she had tasted it. She reminded us that she did not care for mac and cheese but there could have been a problem with the kerosene she kept in her car spilling in her trunk and “just perhaps” some of that kerosene spilled onto the mac and cheese. Mother said she was not going to throw away good money spent on food just because of a little kerosene. We did not know whether to laugh hysterically or be horrified. 
The next day Larry was on “The Roundtable,” a Nashville talk radio program that featured politicos discussing current events. Live and on the air, he said that his new mother-in-law had tried to kill him at his first Thanksgiving meal because his candidate, and not hers, had just won the 1992 Presidential election. Mother was listening, she called me immediately and said to tell Larry she was going to kill him and just tell God he died. 
The mac and cheese with kerosene became part of our family history. Vegetarian dishes are always viewed with suspicion, especially during an election year, and we still do not know why the kerosene was in Mother’s trunk, but Larry took great joy for many years by sharing the story of how his mother-in-law tried to kill him that Thanksgiving Day.
