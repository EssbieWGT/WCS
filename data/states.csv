Locals call it a Crunch Berry day because Quaker – the world’s largest cereal plant – makes Cap’n Crunch’s Crunch Berries, but the aroma could also be oats roasting for Oatmeal Squares or maple-flavored instant oatmeal.
The oats fueling that sweet-smelling goodness come not from the rich Iowa soil near the plant, but from up to 1,000 miles away in Canada. For decades, the plumpest, most consistent oats came from the northern plains, but new field trials show food-grade oats can be grown in Iowa and Minnesota by farmers eager for an alternative to corn and soybeans.
Buying domestic oats would help Quaker save freight costs and avoid threatened tariffs on Canadian goods. It could also improve Midwest water quality and soil health ravaged by an endless corn/soy rotation. Expanding Midwest oat production offers economic and environmental benefits for farmers and local communities, advocates say.

But agricultural companies and commodity groups don’t have financial incentives tied to oats because oats don’t require hybrid seeds, crop insurance or as much fertilizer. These big players aren’t opposing oats, but they aren’t cheerleading either.
The lack of support has left oat growers to be their own hype machines.
“We can actually pick our varieties and our production practices to provide a better product than Canada, not only on a protein level, but on an environmental impact level,” said Landon Plagge, a Latimer farmer and oat advocate.
In May, Plagge and other oat farmers in Iowa and Minnesota loaded 100,000 bushels of their oats into a rail car bound for Quaker’s factory in Cedar Rapids. Three months later, they’re still waiting to hear what the grain giant thought of the domestic product.
Iowa is a ‘donut hole’ for oat research
Baby boomers who grew up on Iowa farms remember growing oats to feed horses and other livestock. Iowans harvested more than 6 million acres of oats a year until the 1950s, according to Matt Liebman, an emeritus Iowa State University agronomy professor.
But as Americans started eating more meat, demand increased for corn to feed the cattle, hogs and chickens. When ethanol was approved as a fuel additive in the 1970s, corn demand rose again. Now, about 45% of corn nationwide becomes ethanol.
Like kernels around a cob, industries popped up to serve King Corn. Specialty seed breeders, co-ops that sell fertilizer and consultants who tell farmers how much corn to feed their hogs all benefit from expansion of corn acres.
Still, Iowans harvested nearly 40,000 acres of oats for grain in 2022, putting it eighth in the nation behind North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, according to the Census of Agriculture. Oats harvested to feed animals and humans increased 12.6% in Iowa between 2017 and 2022.


Iowa State University, a land-grant school with a powerhouse agriculture college, once had a distinguished oat breeding program. Kenneth Frey and J. Artie Browning developed a crown rust-resistant oat cultivar they shared with farmers as certified seed in 1968, according to the Agronomy Department’s 125th Points of Pride.
But Iowa State hasn’t had an oat breeder since 2007 and doesn’t do its own oat trials. The university did partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa, a sustainable agriculture nonprofit based in Des Moines, to hold oat trials at four ISU research farms.
“Iowa is the donut hole,” Liebman said, referring to oat research in neighboring states of Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Illinois.
Liebman, who retired in 2021, understands university budgets are tight and there’s no corporate constituency clamoring for oat research.
“There’s more money to be made in selling corn and soybeans,” he said, referring to ag companies. “With oats, you don’t have to keep buying seed every year because it’s not hybrid and it’s not transgenic. It’s much less lucrative.”
He’d like to see ISU prioritize research of oats and other small grains because of the benefits to soil health and water quality.
Glen Ritchie, who started as ISU’s Agronomy Department chair in July, said he knows there is renewed interest in oats among Iowa farmers and that might affect research priorities.
“We’re always looking for opportunities to provide the best value we can to the agricultural community in Iowa,” he said. “Oats are part of the discussions we’re having on that.”

He’s seen it happen 
Martin Larsen dipped his toe into small-grains farming in 2018, planting oats on a small swath of his farm near Byron, Minnesota. He was curious. Would his combine work for oat harvest? Could he get at least 38 pounds per bushel – the minimum threshold for food-grade oats?
The answers were yes and yes.
“I ramped up from there to the point I have a full three-crop rotation on 1,400 acres,” he said.
Larsen has even invested in specialized equipment, including a header for his combine that strips the seeds from the top of the oat plant rather than running the whole stalk through the machine. This speeds harvest and keeps the stalk in place to reduce erosion.
Other farmers want to know whether Larsen is making money from oats.
“It’s always the thing we hear,” he said. “Soybeans, especially, can see an up to 10% yield bump because you’ve broken up the crop rotation.”
Glyphosate-resistant water hemp vexes every Midwest corn farmer. When the weed wants to make its move in late spring, oats already have a lush green cover and the water hemp can’t compete. That means less weed pressure during the next corn round and less pesticide he has to apply, Larsen said.
By planting red clover with the oats, the clover provides nitrogen to the soil, which feeds future corn crops with reduced fertilizer costs, he said.
“So you really start to put all this together and it’s looking like the right thing for my farm,” he said.
It’s also the right thing for protecting water quality, said Larsen, who is a conservation and feed lot technician for the Olmsted County Soil and Water Conservation District. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has asked Minnesota to develop a plan for reducing nitrate pollution to groundwater in southeastern Minnesota’s Driftless region.
Nitrate in drinking water not only can cause blue baby syndrome, but studies – including some done in Iowa – show a link between ingesting nitrate from drinking water and cancers including colorectal, thyroid, bladder and ovarian.
“We have to raise something different than corn and soybeans or raise corn and soybeans differently if we’re going to affect nitrates,” Larsen said. “We have hundreds and hundreds of data points of groundwater samples below oats compared to corn and soybeans, and it’s black and white that oats will reduce nitrates in groundwater.”
Tests of groundwater under Larsen’s oat acres show up to 60% less nitrate than under corn acres.

Farmers band together
While running a grocery store in Latimer for eight years, Anne and Landon Plagge were always thinking about what customers wanted to buy.
“We were on vacation in Europe and we saw the proliferation of oat products on the shelves there,” Landon Plagge said. “Our (U.S.) consumer patterns tend to mirror that.”
The global market for oat milk was valued at more than $2 billion in 2020 and is projected to climb through at least 2028, especially with new shelf-stable milk. Beyond oat milk, there is oat flour for people trying to avoid gluten, and oatmeal boosted with flax and chia for people trying to get more protein.
Plagge decided he wanted to grow oats for the segment of the U.S. population that wants an allergen-free, pesticide-free product. Grain Millers processes oats in St. Ansgar, near the Minnesota border, but they grind wheat and barley, too, so the oats can’t be completely free of allergens, Plagge said.
He recruited about 70 farmers, mostly from Iowa and Minnesota, to invest in Green Acres Milling, a $55 million oat-processing plant in Albert Lea, Minnesota. The plant, scheduled to open next year, eventually will process 3 million bushels of oats a year. This equates to about 60,000 acres of oats within three years, Plagge said.
“They put their own cash into making the mill a reality,” Plagge said of the investors – including Larsen – who will get a premium price for the oats they sell to Green Acres. The mill requires oat growers to use a cover crop and to grow oats as part of a rotation with other crops.
“That gives us the control of the raw materials supply coming in so we can provide a sustainably-produced oat with a cover crop for our brands and a diverse rotation for our brands,” Plagge said.

Who’s buying?
While Quaker is several generations removed from its 1870’s origin in Ravenna, Ohio, Seven Sundays founders Hannah and Brady Barnstable sold their first bag of muesli – like granola, but healthier – at a Minneapolis farmers market in 2011.
“We love oats,” Brady Barnstable said. “We think they are a huge unlock to change the agricultural landscape in the Midwest.”
Seven Sundays makes cereal and granola without dyes, artificial colors, allergens or refined sugars. They also buy only non-GMO crops grown without glyphosate. Their products, like Wildberry Protein Oats, have muscled their way onto grocery shelves, including at Midwest Costco stores.
“We’ve been invited to the Costco Midwest managers meetings in the Chicago area to give presentations on what we’re doing in our supply chain to benefit soil health,” Barnstable said. But Costco wouldn’t stock Seven Sundays just for environmental brownie points, he said. “The decisions are driven by sales. Is it resonating with their shoppers? For Seven Sundays, it is.”
Seven Sundays originally bought all its oats from Whole Grain Milling, in Welcome, Minnesota, but as they sold more muesli and cereal, Seven Sundays needed more suppliers, including some from Canada. By purchasing American oats, the company could avoid increased freight costs and skip tariff fears.
“Our goal is to source as close to home as possible for all our ingredients,” Barnstable said. “I have heard that this new mill will have the capacity to provide us and many other customers with the oats we need to fill our full demand.”

Public push for sustainable products
But what about Quaker? The company and its parent, PepsiCo Inc., did not respond to several attempts to seek comment for this story. Just like Quaker doesn’t advertise what makes that sweet smell in Cedar Rapids, the firm isn’t saying exactly what factors into their oat sourcing.
But we know price and availability of supplies are key drivers, according to PepsiCo’s 2024 Annual Report.
“Risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers,” the report stated.
Companies face pressure from consumers – particularly Millennials and Gen Z – who increasingly want to buy products that are good for people and the planet. A 2024 survey by PwC showed consumers are willing to spend almost 10% more for sustainably-sourced or produced goods.
PepsiCo and Cargill announced in July they will partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa to advance regenerative farming practices across 240,000 acres in Iowa. Farmers who sell their corn to Cargill – which produces ingredients for PepsiCo’s family of companies – will have access to advice, technical resources and incentive payments to “support their transition to regenerative practices,” the companies said in a joint news release.
Cargill and PepsiCo want to drive adoption of regenerative practices on 10 million acres by 2030, the news release said.
News like this brings equal parts frustration and hope for Larsen, the Minnesota oat farmer waiting to hear back from Quaker about the May oat shipment. “It seems like buying oats from their backyard would fit their narrative.”

(Provided by American Prairie)American Prairie announced this week it has acquired the Anchor Ranch, its second-largest land purchase to date, and it has reopened access to nearly 50,000 acres of public land in “a special area of the Breaks.”
“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure an important piece of ecologically and culturally significant land,” said American Prairie CEO Alison Fox in a statement. “But this acquisition is equally important as a way to return public access to the people so they can explore, hunt and recreate on land that’s been off limits for many years.”
American Prairie launched in 2001 with a mission to ensure 3.2 million acres of prairie are protected, including roughly half that are already part of the Charlie M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge and the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.
“But it’s important to point out that the majority of that would be — is — public land,” said American Prairie public relations manager Beth Saboe.

The new land comprises the Anchor Ranch and two additional properties in Blaine County, and it puts the total acreage American Prairie manages at 600,000, according to a news release announcing the acquisitions.
Anchor Ranch is 69 miles southwest of Havre and totals 67,960 acres, including 22,837 acres of deeded land and 45,123 of leased acres, “significantly advancing the organization’s mission of prairie ecosystem conservation,” American Prairie said.
It also opens up access to land previously tied up in a legal dispute along with Bullwhacker Road, which the Public Land Water Access Association described as “the only reasonable access” to acreage in the Breaks.
But a judge found the road was private in 2011.
In 2012, the billionaire Wilks brothers, among the largest land owners in Montana, bought the ranch. It was caught up in a controversial negotiation with the Bureau of Land Management, then put on the market again in 2022, according to a timeline from Lee Enterprises.
In its announcement about the new properties, American Prairie said a 3.8 mile section of Bullwhacker Road will be open to the public, providing access to nearly 50,000 acres of public land that have been a point of dispute and embroiled in lawsuits for years.
In a statement, Fox said the organization is proud to provide more permanent access to “this special area of the Breaks.”
“While we will take some time to develop a comprehensive public access plan for this new property, the previously private stretch of Bullwhacker Road is now officially open to the public,” Fox said.
Randy Newberg, founder of Fresh Tracks and Hunt Talk media, also praised the acquisition, especially for hunters.
“This is a win for anyone who cares about public access to our shared lands,” said Newberg in a statement provided by American Prairie. “Our audience cares deeply about the Bullwhacker Allotment as it touts exceptional habitat and opportunities to hunt. It’s an area that’s both important to protect and for the public to access.”
American Prairie has been controversial in Montana.
Some farmers and ranchers have opposed its purchases of land as detrimental to agriculture and beef production. Political leaders, including Gov. Greg Gianforte and Attorney General Austin Knudsen, have opposed grazing by bison, reintroduced there in 2020 after being gone for 120 years, according to American Prairie.
But some former critics have started coming around, Saboe said. She pointed to an online forum where hunters are active, and one poster recently said they used to be on the “Save the Cowboy” side but appreciate the public access from American Prairie — and time will tell.
American Prairie broke a visitation record in 2024 for the seventh year in a row, the news release said. It saw 6,600 overnight visitors and more than 5,000 at its National Discovery Center in Lewistown.
In 2024, 56.6% of the bookings were from Montanans, but people from every state besides five — Hawaii, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Louisiana and West Virginia — were in the books, Saboe said.
One group came from Germany, many come from Washington and California, and many also visit from the Midwest, Saboe said.
Prairie land takes a long time to restore, but American Prairie sees signs of ecological hardiness, Saboe said.
The bison herd is healthy; cameras have caught images of rarely seen animals, such as badgers; and swift foxes, reintroduced on the bordering Fort Belknap Indian Community, are migrating onto American Prairie public lands, Saboe said.
Next month, American Prairie marks its 20th year of having bison, and Saboe said it’s a big milestone. She also said the animals are doing their jobs, living their lives in a way that supports other creatures.
They graze at varying levels, giving the prairie “a bad haircut,” but one that allows a large variety of birds to nest and find protection, Saboe said. She said migrating birds can spend as much as a month on a prairie stopover in the midst of their long trips.
The bison also wallow, or roll around in the dirt, and the depressions they create often fill with water and help insects, frogs and other amphibians thrive and reproduce, Saboe said. They also offer drinking water for birds.
The news release said American Prairie acquired 1,888 deeded acres adjacent to the south side of Anchor ranch. And in a third and separate transaction in the Cow Creek basin of Blaine County, the organization acquired an additional 5,401 acres.
“This property is located in the northern portion of the Breaks and extends American Prairie’s shared fenceline with the Fort Belknap Indian Community,” the news release said.
These three acquisitions bring American Prairie’s total habitat base to 603,657 acres, which comprises 167,070 deeded acres and 436,587 leased public acres.
In the news release, American Prairie said the new properties offer important wildlife habitat for elk, deer, pronghorn and upland birds, and they provide connectivity through the Monument to the CMR and north to the Bears Paw and Little Rockies ranges.
American Prairie said it intends to share a more detailed public access plan in the future to detail recreational uses on the new deeded acres, although it will first take time to familiarize itself with the land.
On both the Anchor Ranch and the 5,401-acre property with public grazing leases, the ranching families who lease the properties will remain in place, and the land will continue to be used for agricultural production, the news release said.
“We are really pleased to have the existing lessees stay on the ground where their cattle have been grazing, and we look forward to working with these ranching families,” Fox said in a statement.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-09-06 13:57:28.740802

Transgender people incarcerated in Georgia prisons can once again receive some gender-affirming care, at least temporarily, following a judge’s order.
A federal judge ruled Thursday that a ban on using public funds for gender-affirming care in state prisons likely violates constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.
According to court documents, there are about 340 people in the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, of whom 107 were receiving hormone replacement therapy as of the end of June. The system’s inmate population is more than 50,000.
Gov. Brian Kemp, who is a Republican, signed Senate Bill 185 into law in May, putting the ban into place. Attorneys for the state argued that Georgians’ tax dollars should not be spent on the controversial procedures.
“But ‘controversy’ does not take a medical question and turn it into a policy question,” U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Calvert wrote in her opinion pausing enforcement of the law while a legal challenge against it moves forward.
“An Eighth Amendment exception for political controversy could end up swallowing the rule that inmates are entitled to a baseline of medical care bearing some relationship to the standard of care provided to the public at large. If it were otherwise, prison officials could deny inmates the COVID-19 vaccine or treat a measles outbreak with chicken soup.”
Also on Thursday, the Georgia Board of Corrections voted to approve a rule change to comply with the law, specifying that no state funds may be used for surgical, hormone or cosmetic procedures to treat gender dysphoria. It allows for people already receiving treatment to have their dosage tapered to transition off the medication.
Calvert’s ruling directs the agency to stop tapering hormone medication and resume treatments for people who were previously receiving care and to consider new requests for gender-affirming treatments without taking the new state law  into account.
Emily Early, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which challenged the state law on behalf of five transgender people incarcerated in Georgia prisons, said the judge’s decision is in line with rulings from other states and established precedent.
“We’re not carving out any sort of new standard,” she said. “The Eighth Amendment standard is that you cannot take away care from an individual when that care has been deemed medically necessary without any sort of medical judgment. And that’s exactly what the state of Georgia has done here, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and the court at the district court level has agreed with our clients’ position.”
A Department of Corrections spokesperson declined to comment citing pending litigation.
The defendants, who include Georgia Department of Corrections Commissioner Tyrone Oliver, have filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
The bill’s author, Cataula Republican state Sen. Randy Robertson, expressed confidence that the law will eventually be upheld.
“I’m very comfortable with this,” he said in a phone call. “We knew that things like this were going to happen. Anytime you pass a controversial piece of legislation, you’re going to have individuals come out and challenge it, and that’s exactly what’s supposed to happen. Every piece of legislation that we pass out of the Capitol is subject to scrutiny by men and women who wear black robes, and that’s what we pay them for, and that’s their job. So this is just part of the process. I’m very confident that once everything is hashed out in the courtrooms, that the law will go into effect and will accomplish exactly what we need to accomplish for Georgia taxpayers.”
The bill was among the most controversial of the session as it worked its way through the Capitol this year. Four Senate Democrats broke ranks with their party to support it in that chamber, and four more did not vote. In the House, nearly the entire Democratic caucus walked out when it came up for a vote, a protest of a series of bills targeting the rights of transgender Georgians.
Transgender advocates worry that policies like Georgia’s are part of a cultural backlash against increased acceptance of transgender rights.

Now, a new firm is planning to pick up where Shell left off. (State of Alaska map)Last year, one of the world’s biggest oil companies walked away from a handful of promising leases in shallow waters just off the coast of Alaska’s North Slope.
The move by Shell, which some observers attributed to pressure from the company’s climate-conscious investors, raised questions about the future of oil development in the Arctic, particularly in more expensive and technically challenging areas offshore.
Companies can drill wells more cheaply, and with less environmental opposition, in parts of the Lower 48. If a deep-pocketed player like Shell wasn’t going to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to search for oil on remote North Slope oil prospects, who would?
The answer, it now appears, is a company that’s nothing like Shell: Narwhal Exploration, a small, Texas-based firm.
Narwhal, whose officials did not respond to requests for comment, has been quietly gearing up for what industry observers describe as one of the industry’s most intriguing drilling efforts in recent years.
This winter, the company plans to sink as many as five exploration wells into state land beneath West Harrison Bay — a shallow inlet of the Beaufort Sea.
The effort targets an oil-rich geologic formation, the Nanushuk, that had been mostly disregarded by the industry until a decade ago. That’s the same oil deposit being tapped by two huge onshore oil fields already under construction: ConocoPhillips’ Willow project and Santos’ Pikka project.
The closest community to Narwhal’s leases, the Iñupiaq village of Nuiqsut, is some 30 miles south.
Narwhal’s plans signal a notable step toward development in a remote area that geologists have long thought could hold huge reserves, but that has seen little exploration. It would be the first company ever to drill in West Harrison Bay.
A discovery there could be “sizable,” said Pete Stokes, an Anchorage-based, private sector petroleum engineer and consultant who spent years evaluating oil prospects on the North Slope — including, at one point, West Harrison Bay.
“I think there’s probably something there,” said Stokes. “The question would be how big a discovery it is and whether it can be economically developed.”
Narwhal’s search for oil could cost some $150 million, according to the website of a Florida-based private equity group that’s helping the company raise money.
West Harrison Bay has garnered interest from the oil industry for more than a decade. Shell acquired its leases there in 2012, while Narwhal — whose exploration manager and chief operating officer used to work for Shell — purchased neighboring leases in 2016.
“It’s an area that we’ve been real eager to see somebody do some exploration on,” said Derek Nottingham, director of the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas.
Despite reports of favorable geologic data, including promising results from decades-old wells drilled nearby, Shell never conducted any major exploration work in West Harrison Bay. The company cited an inability to find a suitable co-owner to share some of the costs.
Narwhal told state regulators in 2022 that it had made several offers to buy Shell’s leases, or to form a drilling partnership. But the energy giant never agreed.
Narwhal officials grew impatient: During a state legislative hearing last year they publicly criticized the commissioner of the state natural resources department for being “unwilling to hold Shell accountable” for not drilling on its leases or selling them.
A few weeks after the hearing, Shell announced that it was relinquishing its leases.
In a state auction last fall, a Narwhal affiliate called EE Partners and another privately owned company, Juneau Oil and Gas, collectively spent almost $9 million buying up the remaining tracts in West Harrison Bay — including Shell’s former holdings.

Juneau Oil and Gas, which outbid EE Partners on a number of parcels, has not informed the state oil and gas division of any plans to drill wells on its leases this winter, said Sean Clifton, an agency spokesperson.
The company, which didn’t respond to a request for comment, mainly focuses on prospects in the Gulf of Mexico, according to its website. But its manager, Brad Juneau, has ties to Alaska: He helped co-found Contango Ore, which holds several mining prospects in the state and owns a stake in the large-scale Manh Choh gold mine, near the Interior town of Tok.
Even if a company made a big discovery in West Harrison Bay, the infrastructure needed to start producing oil would take years to develop, given the logistical hurdles involved with getting it to market.
The leases in the bay are on submerged lands owned by the state of Alaska, whose more flexible permitting regime could allow development to move more quickly than in nearby federally managed areas like the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, according to industry observers. Development on state land also would give Alaska a greater share of royalty payments.
Drilling in West Harrison Bay would be closer to shore and shallower than at the far offshore prospect that Shell unsuccessfully drilled in the Chukchi Sea a decade ago. Other companies have successfully developed near-shore prospects on the North Slope.
Still, West Harrison Bay is “really remote,” said Nottingham. “There are some distinct logistical challenges in exploring, developing and producing that area.”
Building an oil field there could cost more than $8 billion, according to an estimate cited by Narwhal in a 2024 filing with state regulators. That’s roughly the amount ConocoPhillips is spending to develop Willow and more than double Santos’ construction costs at Pikka.
Narwhal has so far released few details about this winter’s drilling plans to regulators or the public. In various state and federal permit applications, it has outlined plans for summer field work, including sonar studies to help determine precise drilling locations.
The Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group, raised several concerns about the impacts of oil exploration in West Harrison Bay in a June letter responding to Narwhal’s application for a permit under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act.
The project “threatens the survival of threatened and endangered ice seals, bowhead whales, and other Arctic wildlife,” the group said in that 10-page letter.
The permit, which federal regulators ultimately granted, allows Narwhal to disturb 20 bowhead whales and more than 2,000 seals.

BEAR — Caravel quarterback Matthew Rice settled under center with just under 10 minutes to
play in the third quarter, positioned slightly across midfield. Rice took the third down snap,
rolled out to his right and zipped a pass to his senior receiver Tisyn Witcher along the right
sideline.
Witcher evaded a string of defenders in his path to score the Buccaneer’s first of five touchdowns
in the second half, defeating Red Lion Christian Academy, 42-18, Friday night.
The Buccaneer’s win was their first of the season and the first for the program as the newest
member of the 3A class.
Caravel was moved up to class 3A in December as part of a football realignment that moved
eight schools to new levels. Caravel won back to back 2A state championships the prior two
seasons and were runner up in 2022 before making the jump to 3A this season.
Caravel’s offense certainly looked the part of a 3A offense scoring touchdowns on all five of its
second half offensive possessions.
Witcher scored two of the five adding a pair of touchdown receptions to his rushing touchdown
that opened the scoring in the first quarter. Senior running back Joshua Roy carried Caravel’s
other three scores through the endzone accumulating over 200 yards on the ground for the
Buccaneer offense.
Red Lion strung together a trio of touchdown drives in the second half to try and chip away at
the Caravel lead, starting with a scoring drive that consisted of a single play.
Following a Caravel touchdown, Lion’s senior quarterback Evan Budinger lined up at his own 37
yard line in the shotgun formation with two receivers on his left and a running back behind him.
Budinger faked the hand off, took a small step back and lofted the ball to junior receiver Raheem
Spencer Jr. just as he crossed the Buccaneer’s 35 yard line. The ball fell majestically into his
hands and Spencer Jr. finished the play by sprinting through the left side of the endzone scoring
the Lion’s first touchdown.
Budinger scored the final two Red Lion touchdowns in the final six minutes of fourth quarter
with a pair of short runs near the goal line. Despite their tremendous effort, the Lions remain
winless through a difficult portion of their season facing two 3A teams in Salesianum and
Caravel right at the start.
Red Lion’s next game will be at home against Delaware County Christian School located in
Pennsylvania.
Caravel’s next game is a home matchup against undefeated St. Georges Technical High School.
This will be the Buccaneer’s first in class game this season.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Picture4.png,,,2025-09-06 08:56:18.289386

Another said the decision should be left to local school districts, while a potential candidate is seeking local input on the issue.
Most school districts in South Dakota already have a policy in place that doesn’t allow cellphones in classrooms. About one-third of school districts take the further step of removing or locking away cellphones during class or school hours, based on a South Dakota Searchlight survey of superintendents and analysis of published school policies.
South Dakota’s lone U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Republican, announced three days after the publication of Searchlight’s story that, if elected governor next year, he would seek a statewide prohibition on student cellphone access during class time.
One-third of SD school districts remove or lock away student phones

“The state constitution makes it clear that kids should have quality education,” Johnson told Searchlight. “The state government setting a broad-stroke policy and then having the execution of that strategy and management done at the local level will give us the best of both worlds.”
South Dakota is one of 24 states to not implement a statewide policy or law to ban or limit cellphone use in classrooms. State lawmakers considered a statewide effort last legislative session, but held off after school administrators said they’d prefer to determine policies at the local level. The Legislature instead passed a resolution encouraging school boards to implement such policies.
According to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey, 72% of U.S. high school teachers say cellphone distraction is a major problem in the classroom. Some research suggests student performance improves after schools ban cellphones.
Other candidates weigh in
Two other announced candidates for governor said they support efforts to establish a statewide law or policy removing cellphones from classrooms.
South Dakota House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, would support a statewide policy to ensure students focus “on learning, not on distractions” and foster healthier social interactions.

Democrat Robert Arnold, a 20-year-old college student who said he plans to run for governor, said a statewide policy or law would benefit students, but added that other efforts would be more impactful on student wellbeing, including providing universal free lunch and ensuring the federal Department of Education remains intact. Arnold said Johnson should support those efforts.
“Not a peep from him about policies that will have a real impact on our people, but he’ll of course propose legislation that at least makes it look like he cares about our children’s education,” Arnold said in an emailed statement.
Aberdeen businessman and Republican Toby Doeden said phones in classrooms are “roadblocks” to education and a “breeding ground” for negative influences and distractions. But he said school boards should address the issue.
“Allowing state leaders to mandate individual policy changes at the local level would set a terrible precedent and is an obvious constitutional overreach,” Doeden said in a text message. “As governor, I would absolutely lean on our local school boards to ban cellphones from the classrooms.”

Current Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden has not announced his intention to run, but is expected to enter the race. The Rhoden administration is asking school leaders if they prefer cellphone policies that come from the local or state level, spokesperson Josie Harms said in an emailed statement.
First Lady Sandy Rhoden spent the first few months of the Rhoden administration visiting schools to talk about the consequences of using cellphones during school hours.
Students at Platte-Geddes School District, the first in the state to lock away student cellphones during the school day three years ago, said the restriction improved relationships and academics, the first lady said in a statement. The students started to spend less time on their phones outside of school, too, leading to better self-discipline.
“Our students have so much to gain, and the constant distraction impedes their ability to learn,” she said.
School administrator representative encourages local control
Rob Monson, executive director of School Administrators of South Dakota, said school administrators prefer to handle the issue themselves. He surveyed members of his organization last year, when legislators considered introducing a bill.
“I think most school districts are doing what they feel they should and what’s best for their school districts and patrons,” Monson said.
Monson added that if a bill is introduced this legislative session, his organization will likely oppose it. 
Johnson hopes the Legislature passes a bill this winter setting a statewide standard, saying it’s a “no-brainer.”
“Once you identify an approach that clearly increases educational outcomes,” Johnson said, “that’s when it’s time to come together as a state and make sure every student is able to benefit from that policy.”

“We’re looking at a framework that responds to the budget realities while also keeping student needs at the forefront,” Yazmin Carretero, the board’s government relations and policy analyst, told members in their August meeting. 
The legislative platform communicates the board’s top priorities to the Legislature and will guide the legislative committee’s advocacy efforts during the 2026 legislative session. 
State lawmakers grappled this past session with a projected budget shortfall of more than $12 billion over four years.
They largely preserved funding for K-12 education in the 2025-27 budget, even increasing funding for special education programs and removing the artificial cap on state funding for students with disabilities. 
While that investment was a historic win for special education, there were reductions in other areas for elementary and secondary schools, and colleges. 
The 2025-27 budget reduced funding for college financial aid, and pared support for numerous grant-funded offerings such the Outdoor Learning Grants program.
Lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson will write a supplemental budget during the 60-day  session that starts in January.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal said Wednesday that his biggest supplemental budget request will be for $110 million per year to address inflation impacts on schools. 
“That’s a necessary thing,” Reykdal said, adding that he will wait to make his “big requests” in the 2027 long session when a new two-year budget is written. 
Last year, Reykdal sought $350.7 million in the two-year budget to cover inflationary costs of materials and supplies. The request was partially granted, with the budget including a $213,832 inflation adjustment.  
Meanwhile, the legislative platform of the Board of Education also avoids big asks and focuses instead on safeguarding what it considers essential elements for Washington public schools. 
The platform, which will be finalized in October, will stress the importance of maintaining civil rights protections, student supports and oversight and accountability systems. 
The board will advocate for the restoration of funding for alternative and nontraditional learning models, and for additional student supports like the High School and Beyond Plan. 
“We’re moving away from really just asking for a lot of new things and instead focusing on protecting the gains that we’ve made and the progress that we’ve made … and just restoring a few things that we’ve lost,” Carretero told the board in August.
She said the legislative team is “taking a thoughtful approach in investing in what works” to meet the most urgent needs. 
“These are decisions that are not to be made lightly or easily,” she said. 
There will be some minimal budget requests: a new contract for small agency IT services and a new administrator to handle an increasing volume of public records requests. 
“We are spending a lot of time and energy on this, and we don’t have dedicated staff,” Randy Spaulding, Board of Education executive director, told the board Thursday.

It’s the latest project from Renewablade, a company in Bondurant that has found a way to use the materials and, in turn, alleviate the issue of what to do with the massive hunks of fiberglass and resin. 
Brian Meng with Renewablade said the company is finally in production after several years of research and development to figure out the best way to grind up the blades and incorporate them into the concrete.

Right now, Renewablade makes three main products: the retaining wall blocks, like those used at the Premier Credit Union project, commercial highway barriers, and larger barriers used to bunker agricultural materials. 
“We’re not going to be building any superhighways with it — yet. We’re not going to be building skyscrapers with it. But certainly non-structural, free-cast concrete, I think it’s a great situation,” Meng said.
Premier Credit Union CEO Megan Tjernagel said the decision to use the recycled-blade blocks shows how the company cares for its environment. 
“By incorporating recycled wind turbine blades into this project, we’re showing that financial institutions can lead with purpose, embrace sustainable solutions, and make investments that benefit both our members and the communities we serve,” Tjernagel said in a press release. 
Building a blade recycling program
Meng has spent his career in the recycling industry and several years ago started to notice the need for recycling the blades, which by nature must be replaced about every 20 years. 
One study estimated by 2050 there would be more than 2 million tons of retired wind turbine blades in the U.S. 
Lawsuits cropped up in Iowa and other states as officials took notice of areas where the blades were being dumped and abandoned. It turned out the parties dumping the blades had been paid to recycle them but weren’t doing so.
“There’s a lot of people that have said they were going to be able to do that,” Meng said. “We’re one of the rare companies that actually recycles them into a product.” 
Another Iowa-based company, REGEN Fiber, processes the blades into a grind that can be added to various types of concrete. A company in Boone has focused on the turbine generators and recycles rare earth materials from decommissioned wind turbines. 
Meng said Renewablade collects the blades from Iowa turbines, which are easier to transport to the company’s processing facility in Earlham, and from as far as Seattle and Maine. 
Meng said it “works well” when the decommissioned blades are close to home. For example, Renewablade recycled some of the blades that were damaged in a tornado near Greenfield in 2024. The blades can be around 200 feet long, or about the wingspan of a Boeing 747 jet, which makes transportation difficult and expensive. 
The scale also means these blades take up a lot of space in a landfill. And yet, once ground up into concrete blocks, Renewablade was able to repurpose the blades from one whole turbine in just one small parking lot wall. 
“The size reduction is a big part of it,” Meng said. 
Despite early pushback in Earlham towards the business, Meng said the company is fully operational this year with big plans to expand. Meng said the company is eying expansions into the UK and Texas. 
“Now it really is just a matter of being able to have more customers come in and want to take the products,” Meng said.

(Sirisak Boakaew/Getty Images)Ada County’s commissioners will soon decide zoning code changes that will impact the price we pay for electricity and the quality of the air we breathe. 
Because some have argued that large solar projects endanger farmland in Ada County, the commission is considering a recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission to effectively ban large-scale solar development on most land in Ada County, even if it has never been in agricultural production. That is an extreme approach that will saddle Idaho Power ratepayers with higher energy prices while increasing our reliance on more polluting energy resources.
Idaho Power’s 20-year energy plan predicts large increase in customer growth and peak energy load

We face explosive growth in electricity demand and prices. Idaho Power has already proposed a $199 million dollar rate increase to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission that will significantly increase our monthly electricity bills. To supply the future electricity we need at a price that we can afford, Idaho Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan contends that we should build 1,445 MW of new solar capacity between 2026 and 2033 … along with 700 MW of wind and 450 MW of gas generation. Their analysis argues that solar is the cheapest new energy capacity and our best energy choice. 
Unfortunately, the recommended ordinance by the Planning and Zoning Commission would subject proposed solar projects to vague, undefined standards while sharply limiting the land available to them. Doing so would effectively ban large scale solar in Ada County and hamstring Idaho Power’s efforts to supply additional electricity at reasonable cost. 
Moreover, telling landowners that they cannot lease their land to a solar developer for a 30-year period is also an assault on private property rights and a case of clear government overreach. 
The threat to farmland is not solar; the threat to farmland is rising farm production costs, uncertain commodity prices, markets roiled by trade disputes, labor shortages, and the ever-present pressure to subdivide and develop. 
Solar can help keep land in the hands of farm families since the land can be leased for energy production rather than sold for strip malls and housing developments. Solar installations can even be compatible with agricultural uses as seen in a new trend called Agrivoltaics, the practice of combining solar panel installations with agricultural land use. 
For example, some farmers in the Midwest are raising livestock or cool weather crops in pastures with solar panels to provide shade and preserve soil moisture— a new concept with the potential to achieve synergies between food and energy production. It may be that combining solar with agriculture will enhance agricultural yields, reduce water consumption, increase land use efficiency, and raise farm incomes. 
This proposed ordinance will drive Idaho energy prices even higher than they are already poised to go, and it will take what is arguably our cleanest and cheapest energy option off the table in Ada County. It would be a grave mistake for the commissioners to adopt it.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, long considered the nation’s — if not the world’s — premier public health organization, is mired in a crisis that not only threatens Americans’ health but also its very survival as a leading public health institution.
The degree of this crisis was on full display during Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Sept. 4, 2025, testimony before the U.S. Senate.
In the hearing, Kennedy openly criticized CDC professionals’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying “the people at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving.”
Kennedy’s hearing came on the heels of a contentious week in which Kennedy fired the CDC’s director, Susan Monarez, spurring 12 members of the Senate Finance Committee — including 11 Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders — to call on Kennedy to resign from his position.
At least four top CDC leaders resigned following Monarez’s ouster, citing pressure from Kennedy to depart from recommendations based on sound scientific evidence.
I am a teaching professor and public health professional. Like many of my colleagues, the disruption happening at the CDC in recent months has left me scrambling to find alternate credible sources of health information and feeling deeply concerned for the future of public health.
 
The CDC’s unraveling
These leadership shakeups come on the heels of months of targeted actions aimed at unraveling the CDC’s structure, function and leadership as it has existed for decades.
The turmoil began almost as soon as President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, when his administration enacted sweeping cuts to the CDC’s workforce that health experts broadly agree jeopardized its ability to respond to emerging health threats.
Trump used executive orders to limit CDC employees’ communication with the public and other external agencies, like the World Health Organization.
Within weeks, he ordered as much as 10% of the overall workforce to be cut.
Soon after, Kennedy — who was newly appointed by Trump — began undoing long-standing CDC institutions, like the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, replacing all 17 of its members in a move that was widely denounced by health experts.
Critics pointed to a lack of qualifications for the new committee members, with more than half never having published research on vaccinations and many having predetermined hostility toward vaccines.
In June, more than 20 authoritative organizations, including the National Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics, expressed serious concerns for the health impacts of overhauling the advisory committee.
 
How Monarez’s removal spurred the crisis

	Public health leaders had cheered the July confirmation of Monarez as the CDC’s new director, seeing her nomination as a welcome relief to those who value evidence-based practice in public health. Monarez is an accomplished scientist and career public servant.
Many viewed her as a potential voice of scientific wisdom amid untrained officials appointed by Trump, who has a track record of policies that undermine public health and science.
In her role as acting director, to which she was appointed in January, Monarez had quietly presided over the wave of cuts to the CDC workforce and other moves that drastically reshaped the agency and weakened the country’s capacity to steward the nation’s health.
Yet Monarez had “red lines” that she would not cross: She would not fire CDC leadership, and she would not endorse vaccine policies that ran contrary to scientifically supported recommendations.
According to Monarez, Kennedy asked her to do both in an Aug. 27 meeting. When she refused, he asked her to resign.
Her lawyers pushed back, arguing that only the president had the authority to remove her, stating: “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.”
Ultimately, the White House made her dismissal official later that evening.
 
An agency in turmoil

	Further exemplifying and deepening the crisis at the agency, on Aug. 8, a gunman who had expressed anger over COVID-19 vaccinations opened fire on CDC headquarters, killing a police officer.
Many health workers attributed this directly to misinformation spread by Kennedy. The shooting amplified tensions and made tangible the sense of threat under which the CDC has been operating over the tumultuous months since Trump’s second term began. One employee stated that “the CDC is crumbling.”
Public health experts, including former CDC directors, are sounding the alarm, speaking out about the precariousness of the agency’s position. Some are questioning whether the CDC can even survive.
 
A crisis of trust

	Even before the most recent shock waves, Americans said they were losing trust and confidence in CDC guidance: In April, 44% of U.S. adults polled said that they will place less trust in CDC recommendations under the new leadership. This would undoubtedly undermine the U.S. response if the country faces another public health challenge requiring a rapid, coordinated response, like COVID-19.
In addition to installing new members on the vaccine advisory committee, Kennedy abruptly changed the recommendations for flu and COVID-19 vaccines without input from the CDC or the vaccine advisory committee, and contrary to data presented by CDC scientists.
Public health professionals and advocates are now warning the public that vaccine recommendations coming from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices may not be trustworthy. They point to the lack of credibility in the review process for the new committee, the fact that members have made statements contrary to scientific evidence in the past, and failure to apply an evidence-to-recommendations framework as compromising factors. Critics of the committee even describe a lack of basic understanding of the science behind vaccines.
Health impacts are being felt in real time, with health care providers reporting confusion among parents as a result of the conflicting vaccine recommendations. Now, those who want to be vaccinated are facing barriers to access, with major retailers placing new limits on vaccine access in the face of federal pressure. This as vaccination rates were already declining, largely due to misinformation.
The end result is an environment in which the credibility of the CDC is in question because people are unsure whether recommendations made in the CDC’s name are coming from the science and scientists or from the politicians who are in charge.
 
Filling the gaps

	Reputable organizations are working to fill the void created by the CDC’s precariousness and the fact that recommendations are now being made based on political will, rather than scientific evidence.
The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Gynecology have both released recommended vaccination schedules that, for the first time, diverge from CDC recommendations.
And medical organizations are discussing strategies that include giving more weight to their recommendations than the CDC’s and creating pathways for clinicians to obtain vaccines directly from manufacturers. These measures would create workarounds to compensate for CDC leadership voids.
Some states, including California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico, are establishing their own guidance regarding vaccinations. Public health scientists and physicians are attempting to preserve data and surveillance systems that the Trump administration has been removing. But independent organizations may not be able to sustain this work without federal funding.
 
What’s at stake

	As part of its crucial work in every facet of public health, the CDC oversees larger-scale operations, both nationally and globally, that cannot simply be handed off to states or individual organizations. Some public health responses — such as to infectious diseases and foodborne illnesses — must be coordinated at the national level in order to be effective, since health risks are shared across state borders.
In a health information space that is awash with misinformation, having accurate, reliable health statistics and evidence-based guidelines is essential for public health educators like me to know what information to share and how to design effective health programs. Doctors and other clinicians rely on disease tracking to know how best to approach treating patients presenting with infections. The COVID-19 pandemic made clear the importance of laboratory science, a unified emergency response and rapid distribution of effective vaccines to the public.
One of the strengths of the American system of governance is its ability to approach challenges — including public health — in a coordinated way, having a federal level of cooperation that unifies state-level efforts.
The CDC has been the nation’s preeminent public health institution for more than eight decades as a result of its vast reach and unparalleled expertise. Right now, it’s all sitting at a precarious edge.

One has to wonder what drives people like Ron DeSantis and so-called conservatives who take every opportunity to disparage Florida’s diverse and vibrant LGBTQ community.
Why are they so insecure? What are they so afraid of?
Since he came into office, the governor has shown disdain to this maligned community, used disparaging language and, most of all, misused his political muscle in attempts to scare and bully.
Everything DeSantis does is contaminated by ideology. His actions are aimed at rendering invisible gays, queer, and trans people, plus Black and Brown people and other marginalized groups. That’s never gonna happen, but that’s not stopping him and his allies from doing everything they can to make people’s lives miserable.
Last month, DeSantis and various parts of his state apparatus, in concert with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, continued their harassment when the Florida Department of Transportation sent letters to at least 14 Florida cities, demanding that they remove rainbow and other painted crosswalks or lose millions in state and federal funding.
The issue has been simmering since a July 1 directive from Duffy, who gave U.S. governors 60 days to identify “safety improvements.”
“Roads are for safety, not political messages or artwork,” Duffy said in a statement at the time. He later elaborated: “Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks. Political banners have no place on public roads. I’m reminding recipients of @USDOT roadway funding that it’s limited to features advancing safety, and nothing else. It’s that simple.”
A spokesperson for the Florida DOT told NBC News via email that the department has a duty to “ensure the safety and consistency of public roadways and transportation systems” and therefore ensure “roadways are not utilized for social, political, or ideological interests.”
‘Political purposes’
DeSantis echoed Duffy.
“We will not allow our state roads to be commandeered for political purposes,” he said on X.
One of the most egregious consequences to come out of DeSantis’ action was the recent dead-of-night painting over of the rainbow sidewalk by Florida transportation workers at a memorial set up at what used to be the Pulse nightclub. The memorial honors the 49 people fatally shot there in 2016 in what was the largest mass shooting in the country at the time.
Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer castigated the action on social media.
“We are devastated to learn that overnight the state painted over the Pulse Memorial crosswalk on Orange Avenue,” Dyer wrote. “This crosswalk not only enhanced safety and visibility for the large number of pedestrians visiting the memorial, it also served as a visual reminder of Orlando’s commitment to honor the 49 lives taken.”
Dyer asserted that the crosswalk, installed by the state in 2017, adheres to safety standards. Brandon Wolf, one of the Pulse shooting’s survivors, described the removal as a desecration of the deceased victims’ memories.
“In the dark of night, they came to erase our show of solidarity, our declaration that we will never forget,” he wrote on X. “The cowards who feel threatened by our lives should feel lucky they didn’t have to bury the ones they love — then watch the state come & desecrate their memory.”
One weird justification transportation officials offered is that the rainbow artwork on Ocean Drive and 12th Street in Miami Beach poses a risk for drivers and pedestrians.
Statistics reflect otherwise.
According to crash data, the intersection at 12th and Ocean has had just 15 accidents since the artwork was installed in 2018 — fewer than neighboring intersections at 10th Street (37 crashes) and 13th Street (23 crashes).
Erasure
The Rev. Susan Gage, an Episcopal priest who ministers to a number of LGPTQ people and members, told me she is troubled but unsurprised by the DeSantis administration’s attempts as erasure.
“I found out about it probably the same way everybody else did. People in Orlando woke up and found out the crosswalk at Pulse was removed overnight,” she said. “Here in Tallahassee, some kids painted crosswalks that were colorful with stars, music, stuff that made it look pretty. Some of that was all done with private money including the Knight Foundation as a part of a private-public partnership with the city.”
That’s gone now, too.
Gage, like other critics, sees what DeSantis is doing as narrow-mindedness bathed in petty grievance and the desire to punish.
“I wonder, is this really the best use of public money?” she asked. “Like the tearing up of Black Lives Matter Plaza in D.C., this shows that they are going to try to erase: Blacks, queers, everything that isn’t the standard of the white male. It was all cool until Ron DeSantis said it wasn’t.”
The Rev. Terrence Taylor, who has led the Church of the Transfiguration in Miami Gardens for 15 years, said he’s at a loss to explain the DeSantis foolishness.
“It’s upsetting,” he said. “Why, with all the priorities you say you have, are you’re doing this? He’s playing to the base and there’s an appetite for it, playing to people’s fears, resurrecting things I thought was settled. Why are we on this now? What is your point other than to harass people? Why would you do this.? It has to feed a base or something. It doesn’t feed me but it feeds someone.”
‘Deeply offensive’
Those most affected aren’t taking this lying down. There have been protests across South Florida and in Orlando, where demonstrators replaced the rainbow colors in chalk while DeSantis sent minions to repaint the space and posted state troopers. Taxpayers’ money at work!
The anger is widespread and palpable.
State Sen. Shevrin Jones wrote an op-ed describing DeSantis’s actions at the Pulse nightclub as “a deeply offensive decision.”
“DeSantis’ erasure of the memorial is not merely a disregard for a physical space, but a profound desecration of sacred ground and a grievous affront to the memory of the 49 lives lost and the countless others impacted by the horrific mass shooting targeting the LGBTQ community,” he wrote.
“Erasing the rainbow crosswalk was not a neutral act of urban planning, but a calculated move that disregards the sanctity of a site forever marked by unimaginable pain and loss.”
Jones argues this serves “as chilling reminders of the ongoing struggle against those who seek to deny history and diminish the suffering of marginalized communities. It signals a deeply troubling lack of respect for the victims and survivors, as well as for the broader LGBTQ community and its allies who have found solace and strength in this sacred space.”
Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis concurred.
“It’s an attempt to try to erase the presence of anything to do with the LGBTQ community,” Trantalis said. “… It could be the gay community this year — who knows what’s going to be next year. We don’t know where they are going to keep trying to eliminate the diversity of what represents Florida.”
Gage, Trantalis, and Taylor said state politicians should be concentrating on Florida’s many more pressing priorities.
“Honestly, I wish the state would focus more on affordable insurance, homelessness, and finding affordable housing,” said Trantalis.
Orange County Democratic state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith complained the city of Orlando never had an opportunity to appeal.
“The DeSantis administration is resorting to deliberate lies to justify their indefensible, state-sponsored vandalism at the Pulse nightclub site, done without notice or consent from the City of Orlando,” Smith said. “This crosswalk was not only a tribute to those murdered in 2016, it was also an FDOT-approved installation designed to enhance pedestrian safety for the countless people who come here to pay their respects year after year.”
DeSantis didn’t enforce a rule or new law, Smith asserted.
“He invented an excuse to punish LGBTQ visibility and draw attention to himself. Nothing in Florida law requires the state to act with such callousness and cruelty. Even the first FDOT’s memo stated that they used their discretion to grant exceptions. The state cannot revoke the legal rights of municipalities to administrative appeal and review. That’s why cities and residents are fighting back,” he added.
Smith said cities “are exploring legal options against the State, and Floridians are responding back with new murals and art installations that are bigger, queerer, and more colorful than Ron ever imagined. They are sending a clear message: we will not be erased, and love always wins.

Wes Moore, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore Police Commissioner Rich Worley, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland L. Butler Jr. and Maryland Transportation Authority Police Chief Joseph Scott. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) is ordering a surge in law enforcement presence in Baltimore, following weeks of sparring with President Donald Trump (R) and his threat to deploy troops to deal with crime in the city.
Neither Moore nor Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) mentioned Trump by name Friday as they announced plans for a “renewed collaboration” between the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland State Police. But many of their remarks responded to charges by Trump, who recently called Baltimore a crime “hellhole.”
Moore said violent crime has been dropping over the last few years in Baltimore, and that the increased police resources will continue efforts to bring down violent crime even further.
“We are proud of the progress that we’ve been able to make, and we’re all very, very concerned about how much work still needs to happen,” Moore said. “If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that is one too many.”
The announcement came at a news conference outside St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, after a brief walk through the Park Heights neighborhood by officials. Despite his high-profile public feud with the president, Moore insisted that Friday’s announcement was not “inspired” by recent comments by Trump.
“Nothing we do is inspired by the president,” he said, in response to a reporters’ questions.
While it may not have been inspired by Trump, Friday’s announcement included repeated references to the president’s continued threats to deploy the National Guard to Baltimore and other large cities, as he has done in Washington, D.C. over the last month.
Moore welcomes help from FBI, other agencies, but says National Guard should stay home

Moore has repeatedly pushed back on the use of National Guard troops for crime prevention, arguing that Guard members are not trained for policing and that such a deployment would be disrespectful to them and of little benefit to residents.
“We do not need an occupation. We do not need people putting in performative and theatrical resources because they do not care about the actual results,” Moore said.
Trump, who deployed Guard members and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in June to quell immigration protests, followed up last month by sending the National Guard into Washington, D.C. The D.C. Guard members, along with Guard units from six Republican states, have been backing up local police, but have also been involved in removing homeless encampments and aiding with immigration arrests.
In recent weeks, Trump has dangled the possibility of entering other cities, like Baltimore and Chicago, that he said were “so far gone” in terms of  violent crime. The list has continued to grow, with New Orleans and Portland, Oregon, the most recent potential targets.
Moore shot back on Aug. 21 at the president’s suggestion that troops should be deployed to Baltimore, telling Trump to “keep our names out of your mouth.” Moore also invited the president Trump to come walk the streets of Baltimore to get a firsthand look at the city’s crime prevention efforts.
The back-and-forth has continued since, with Trump again disparaging Baltimore earlier this week, saying that Moore needs to “get rid of the criminals” in the city.
“These are hard-core criminals,” Trump said at a Tuesday press conference. “They’re not going to be good in 10 years, in five years, in 20 years, in two years they’re going to be criminals. They were born to be criminals.”
Scott also did not name the president in his Friday comments but clearly referenced those comments and pushed back against Trump’s threat to deploy the National Guard in Baltimore.
“We do not need troops on our streets,” Scott said. “We do need folks who want to be at the table to recognize that the people of Baltimore are humans — that our young people are not born to be criminals. They’re resources to invest in, not problems to be solved.”
Scott has a personal connection to the area where the press conference took place: He grew up in the Park Heights neighborhood, and said that he witnessed a shooting in the area growing up.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“None of us are celebrating, saying that we have solved gun violence,” Scott said, adding that the use of the Maryland State Police will help provide more government resources and allow the use of evidence-based policies targeted to a continued reduction in crime.
Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland L. Butler Jr. said with the renewed partnership, “there will be no daylight” between the state police department and the city police.
“We intend to go out and provide the services that you need to feel safe,” Butler said, “and enhance the safety you already feel.”
Baltimore City Police Commissioner Rich Worley agreed.
“Adding additional resources to our neighborhoods is one important step towards creating safer communities and improving the quality of life in our city,” he said. “We have work to do, especially in communities like park heights.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_sept5_moorescottcops-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-06 01:56:32.993791

Dozier-Williams, who says that's where Maryland needs to lead.","A former federal worker who has lost his job at the Department of Education walks out of the building with boxes of belongings in Washington, D.C. on March 28, 2025. (Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)I’m a Marylander, a former federal employee and a father raising my family here. Watching federal troops roll into Washington, D.C., on the theory that force can stand in for safety, I keep returning to a simpler truth Maryland has proven: Durable public safety rests on economic security. Caring about well-being starts with protecting work, wages and the least-advantaged Marylanders when Washington pulls back on jobs.
In June, Maryland lost an estimated 3,500 federal jobs — the largest one-month drop in nearly 30 years. Since January, the state has shed 12,700 federal positions — the most of any state. This is not to imply that laid-off public servants will commit offenses; it does mean income shocks ripple through rents, small-business cash flow, and youth opportunity — the very neighborhood conditions that drive welfare concerns.
The consequences of Washington’s job policy are arriving here first and hardest.
The exposure to such losses is structural, as roughly 229,000 Marylanders draw a federal paycheck, and federal activity pours well over $100 billion into our economy each year. When that machine slows or shifts, Main Streets from Suitland to Bethesda feel it acutely.
To his credit, Gov. Wes Moore moved to create a one-stop portal, fast-tracking state hiring and launching fairs and pipelines so displaced federal workers can land on their feet quickly. That instinct was right, though a temporary hiring freeze later paused the effort. With jobs already slipping and more losses possible, Annapolis should build a permanent jobs shock-absorber for Maryland’s labor market. An automatic stabilizer that snaps on whether the trigger is federal layoffs, AI-driven displacement, or the next sectoral shake-out.

Picture the Friday when a paycheck stops: the car note comes due, a shift gets cut at the corner shop, a teenager skips summer work to watch siblings. None of that makes headlines, but it’s where safety is won or lost.
A jobs stabilizer isn’t a campaign slogan; it’s a short bridge between one employer and the next, so families don’t fall and main streets don’t hollow. In Maryland, we know how to build bridges. Let’s build this one — quietly, quickly and on purpose so a job loss becomes a landing, not a spiral.
Consider three ways Maryland can meet this moment for displaced federal workers and the communities that depend on their paychecks:
Guarantee 60- to 90-day reemployment for displaced feds and contractors. Stand up a permanent “Feds to Maryland” program that (a) preclears skills into state and local classifications, (b) funds short, paid “bridge” upskilling sprints, and (c) offers time-limited wage insurance when workers take a lower-paid role to stay employed. This complements the administration’s earlier state-hiring push by turning a one-off response into lasting, economic development infrastructure.
Make our workforce innovation-ready. Use Maryland’s AI Subcabinet to identify occupations most exposed to automation (admin, compliance, customer support) and bolt them into registered apprenticeships and short-cycle credentials under the RAISE framework. Implement a public AI risk map by county and agency to ensure training dollars align with actual exposure. The goal isn’t to fear AI or technological innovation; it’s to ensure workers can move up the value chain and leverage it to their advantage before disruption lands.
Stabilize neighborhoods when incomes dip. Establish a Prompt Pay Guarantee and a Family Bridge. Pay small and minority-owned contractors on time, every time; help families cover a month or two of basics during a layoff; and work with community banks to keep borrowing costs down by placing a slice of state cash with community banks in the hardest-hit corridors so they can lend more cheaply. That’s economic justice in practice.
Again, federal layoffs are not a direct, one-way road to violent crimes. I’m arguing that income shocks, not ideology, turn ordinary stresses into hard choices. The evidence is clearest for property crime when unemployment rises; violence is more complex.
Baltimore’s progress shows that prevention plus opportunity tracks with safety. Which is why, if Washington retrenches while projecting force, Maryland should double down on the basics: Keep paychecks coming and cash moving so strain doesn’t become desperation.
We can’t steer Washington, but we can steady Maryland. In a state that has chosen “work, wages, and wealth” as its north star, the task now is simple and serious: Create a safety net that employs workers and deploys funds to families so shocks become transitions, not crises. Measure success by this: the least-advantaged households stay housed, small firms keep hours posted, and workers step into the next job before the last one is gone.

CVS confirmed the Nevada Board of Pharmacy issued new guidance Friday and as a result the vaccines will be made available, though they offered no timeline on when people can expect to receive them.
“Following today’s regulatory action by the Nevada Board of Pharmacy, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our pharmacies throughout the state,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday.
CVS previously announced it would not offer the updated COVID vaccine in Nevada and two other states because they only allow pharmacists to administer drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. That panel has not approved this season’s COVID vaccine and now includes vaccine skeptics appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
According to The Nevada Independent, which first reported the new guidance, the Board of Pharmacy’s position is that pharmacists are allowed to widely administer vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Nevada has a COVID vaccine access problem; legislative leader calls for state action

The Board of Pharmacy did not immediately respond to the Current Friday afternoon. The board’s website, which typically lists regulations and announcements, is currently offline because it was impacted by the recent ransomware attack on the state’s information technology.
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who on Thursday called the state to take action as soon as possible to address vaccine access, said the legislative leader plans to review the new guidance “to determine whether this is a sufficient long-term fix or whether it’s just a temporary solution and further action may be needed.”

Yet.,"Donors list the causes they supported with their Combined Federal Campaign contributions, in this 2018 file photo from Yokota Air Base in Japan. The donations come from federal workers, and support charities they choose, around the country and the world. (Photo by Senior Airman Matthew Gilmore/U.S. Air Force)Mary Helfrich said that St. Vincent de Paul of Baltimore is “grateful for every dollar that we get” to support its charitable work — which is why the federal government’s decision to put the annual Combined Federal Campaign on hold is concerning.
Like officials at a number of charities around the state, Helfrich said a pause in the CFC won’t be catastrophic for her organization. But it’s not good news either, and she said it could be particularly hard on smaller charities.
“We’re grateful for every dollar that we get, but there’s other organizations that work with all volunteers,” said Helfrich, St. Vincent de Paul’s chief advancement officer. “If they’re working with very limited resources, it [the CFC pause] will affect them … It hurts all organizations, but it’s particularly going to hurt small organizations that depend on those dollars to operate completely.”
The Combined Federal Campaign facilitates donations by federal workers around the nation to thousands of charities, through regular payroll deductions or volunteer hours. Workers choose the charity they want their money to support: In Maryland, hundreds of charities receive funding from the CFC, supporting causes that include education, health, museums, the environment and more.
The CFC solicitation period, when employees can make pledges and donations to charities, typically begins in early September. But this year, the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to pause all support to the CFC while it decides whether or not to continue the 64-year-old program.
No reason was given for the pause, and OPM said in a statement that “no final decision has been made on the program.”

The CFC has raised more than $9 billion since it was established in 1961, and more than $70 million in 2023 alone, according to the program’s website.
St. Vincent de Paul, which supports people facing poverty in Baltimore and surrounding counties, gets about $20,000 a year toward its $32 million budget, so the pause is not fatal, Helfrich said. But it does make for an “uncertain future” for some of their programs, and comes at a time when federal funding cuts, firings and forced retirements will affect the number of donors, she said.
Laura Osuri, the executive director of Homes Not Borders, described the CFC pause as a “death by 1,000 cuts,” as it comes on top of recent federal funding and grant cuts.
Homes Not Borders helps refugees and forced migrants in the Washington, D.C., area navigate life in the U.S. by assisting them with home set-ups, income opportunities and career training. The organization operates on about $800,000 per year, with about $15,000 of that coming from the CFC, Osuri said.
“I don’t think we’re going to be cutting programs or staff because of it [the CFC pause], but it’s just another burden to try and raise more funds for us,” she said. “Even though it [the CFC check] is not much, it is steady, and we know it’s coming.”
That was echoed by Elise Krikau, chief philanthropy officer at the Maryland Food Bank, who said it has seen struggles with its “diversity of funding.”
The organization recently faced cuts to its funding from two government programs: The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Local Food Purchase Agreement. Krikau said the food bank typically gets about $225,000 per year from the CFC, which she called a small part of its budget, but a large amount of money when thinking about overall funding cuts.
“This is one piece — but it’s a piece in a big puzzle,” Krikau said. “If everything gets stilted and there’s impacts from every direction, that can cumulatively impact our bottom line.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Arc Maryland, which supports people with developmental disabilities, gets a couple thousand dollars a year from the CFC, said Ande Kolp, the organization’s executive director. It’s not a large sum of money compared to the overall budget, but it is yet another source of funding that has “dried up,” she said.
Historically, The Arc Maryland has been able to rely on grants, she said, but it has recently faced struggles.
“There might have been 100 people going after the same grant before — now there’s 1,000 people going after the same grant,” Kolp said. “I think the competition has certainly grown and made it very difficult to access sources of funding we didn’t have difficulty accessing in the past.”
The organization will have to cut back on specific assistance programs, like transportation assistance and informative classes for parents on  IEPs — individualized educational plans for students — if they continue to lose funding, she said.
“There’s so much uncertainty out there, and it’s really impacting our ability to function as a business,” Kolp said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4821013-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

Elissa Slotkin on Friday laid out a national security and foreign policy vision rooted in the economic concerns of middle-class Americans, as the Democrat from Holly called for sweeping reforms to address emerging global threats and technological competition with China.
In remarks made at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City, Slotkin said her approach was forged out of the input she gathered during town halls held in Troy and Benton Harbor, where constituents linked national security to day-to-day economic stress. 
“A national security strategy worth its salt must do two things,” Slotkin said. “First, protect U.S. citizens, the homeland, and our way of life. And second, advance American prosperity. That’s it.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Slotkin said many Americans have lost confidence that the United States has a coherent foreign policy that truly advanced the nation’s priorities. 
“And they have good reason to feel uneasy,” she said. “Informed by them, I’m going to focus on the three big things that, if we get right, will define American security for the next 50 years.”
Slotkin said those three priorities included treating economic security as national security, which required leaders to be “ruthless about growing the middle class.” Secondly, she said the U.S. had to treat the tech race like it did the nuclear and space races and ensure the nation dominates in that sector. Finally, Slotkin said the government needs to rethink how it protects Americans in a rapidly changing threat landscape.

Slotkin proposed a series of policy initiatives she said were aimed at reshaping how the U.S. approaches global competition. 
Among them: creating a Cyber National Guard that would be focused on defending against digital threats, a Manhattan Project-style effort to win the AI race against China, and a Sovereign Wealth Fund that would invest in high-risk, high-reward technologies.
Slotkin warned that China has weaponized global supply chains and called for stronger domestic production of critical items.
“While some items, like Rubik’s Cubes and ladies’ razors, will never again be made in the U.S., critical items like pharmaceuticals, chips, and autos should be made, at least in part, in the U.S.,” she said. “China has weaponized these supply chains, giving them a veto on our economy that we should not accept.”
Slotkin, a former CIA analyst and Pentagon official, painted a stark picture of technological rivalry with Beijing.
“We are in a tech race with China right now,” she said. “And there’s no area more important to win than on artificial intelligence. The last time we were in a race like this, we won by setting up the Manhattan Project … We need the same level of ambition now, updated for the modern age.”
Amidst that national security focus, she also urged policies that would also improve middle-class livelihoods.
“Smart industrial policy also means prosperity for the middle class,” Slotkin said. “New manufacturing, engineering, and construction jobs. And critically, it means spreading the wealth across America, not just enriching 18 tech executives in Silicon Valley.”
Slotkin’s remarks came amid a broader debate in Washington over how to confront China’s global influence, secure domestic supply chains, and ensure U.S. leadership in critical technologies.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-124328-1024x586.png,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

Senate Joint Resolution 8201, if passed in November, would amend the state constitution to allow assets of the program, known as the WA Cares Fund, to be handled similarly to pension and retirement accounts. 
That would lead to larger returns in the long run, ensuring premiums stay low and the program is sustainable, advocates said in a call with reporters Friday.
“I think this is just a no-brainer,” said Greg Markley, secretary treasurer of the Washington State Association of Firefighters. He’s also chair of the Washington State Investment Board, whose fiduciary responsibility is to manage retirement and public fund investments. He was not representing the board Friday.
A state lawmaker opposing the ballot measure says it amounts to “gambling in the stock market” with taxpayers’ dollars.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies and private equity firms. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds and certificates of deposit that are less risky but with lower rates of returns. 
Pension and retirement accounts are exempt from that prohibition. The resolution, if approved by voters, would add the Long-Term Services and Supports Trust account to the list of exempt funds.
Voters defeated a similar measure in 2020 by a margin of 54.4% to 45.6%. 
WA Cares is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the program’s benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation.
Collections by the state began in July 2023. A person pays as long as they are working in the state. Deductions stop if they retire, become unemployed or leave the workforce, and resume if the person returns to work. As of March, $2 billion in tax collections had been banked in the program’s trust fund.
Backers say the public better understands the long-term care program than it did five years ago.
And they hope in the coming weeks to make them aware that the Washington State Investment Board has been earning 7% or more on pension funds, a  couple percentage points higher than its investments in government bonds. That difference will translate to a lot more dollars in the trust account for the program, they said.
Four state lawmakers — a Democrat and three Republicans — are leading the opposition. They’ve signed the opposition statement in the voter’s pamphlet that will be sent out statewide in October. It is online now.
They argue it would be “financial roulette” to put the money in “an unstable market.” Right now, “it’s safeguarded in secured investments like federal, state and municipal bonds which support our communities.”
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, fought the measure five years ago. He’s doing it again now.
“It’s gambling in the stock market. It’s a breach of fiduciary responsibility when you put taxpayer dollars at risk,” he said Friday. 
Hasegawa said investing in municipal bonds may earn a little less but it provides a broad public benefit by helping local governments carry out projects. “I have faith in the voters that they will make the right decision,” he said.
Gary Bruebaker, who served as the state’s chief investment officer for 19 years, said this debate “has gone on for decades, and will continue to go on. There are some people that are extremely conservative and they don’t want to take any risk at all.”
By not investing in equities, he said, you’re accepting a lower return than what that the taxpayers and the stakeholders in Washington deserve. While there is risk on a year to year basis, there’s less risk over a longer term with the state’s diversified portfolio, he said.
Approve 8201, the political committee campaigning for passage, had reported raising $220,476 as of Friday. All of it is from the Service Employees International Union 775 which represents 55,000 long-term care workers in Washington, Montana and Alaska.
There was no campaign committee raising money to oppose the measure as of Friday.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LONDON — The city council in this small Eastern Kentucky town ousted embattled Mayor Randall Weddle after an hours-long hearing at the local courthouse Friday. 
Heading into the hearing, Weddle faced nearly a dozen charges of misconduct and willful neglect of duty, but the six London City Council members ultimately agreed to remove him from office on only three of the charges. 
The council approved charges that alleged Weddle refused to publish an enacted ordinance and then delayed its timely publication, did not fill vacancies on the city’s ethics commission in a timely manner and signed a $5 million mortgage without council approval. 
Nevertheless, Weddle told reporters after the meeting he plans to appeal the removal in circuit court. He also pointed to the hundreds of citizens in the city and county who signed petitions in favor of keeping him in office as a sign that residents were against the council’s decision. London, a town of about 7,500 people, is the Laurel County seat. 
“They don’t care. They have an agenda,” Weddle said of the city council.

Weddle had previously contended that the votes were stacked against him, as the council appointed a new member to fill a vacancy earlier this week.  
After voting, the city council appointed a new London mayor — Tracie Handley. According to her social media accounts online, she is a local artist. 
Friday’s removal of Weddle is the latest in a months-long brawl between London City Council members and Weddle. City Council meetings became public spectacles as the former mayor and the council members argued back and forth about the allegations. Plus, citizens packed meeting rooms to show their support for or opposition to the mayor. 
The clashes have also spilled over onto social media. Facebook livestreams for recent city council meetings have gained hundreds of comments. Weddle has also posted Facebook statuses about city meetings, such as uploading a circus flyer for one meeting, complete with city council members’ faces superimposed on clowns. 
After a council meeting earlier this week, Weddle vowed to run for reelection in 2026 and: “We’re going to give ’em hell.”

The courthouse hearing was no quiet affair. Most of the audience members inside the room were supporters of Weddle who clapped for him whenever he entered the room and donned t-shirts that said, “I stand with Mayor Weddle.”
The audience was mostly quiet as witnesses testified but emotions erupted between council member Kelly Smith Greene and one of the witnesses, Phil Smith, her cousin and the chair of the London Tourism Commission, as she spoke near the end of the hearing during the council’s deliberations. Bailiffs removed Smith, who had earlier defended the $5 million mortgage, which had been sought to support the tourism commission. Weddle supporters cheered him on. 
“You neglected to ever communicate with council members. You came in like a bull in a china shop,” Greene said to Weddle. “You were the boss and you didn’t get our opinion.” 
Other witnesses included Weddle himself, the acting city clerk, a former city clerk, local Housing Authority workers and Chief of Police Bobby Day. Much of the testimony included questions about if Weddle acted appropriately in various situations. 
Some of the charges that fell short of the necessary unanimous approval from  council members alleged that Weddle had erroneously removed members of the London Housing Authority board and had directed the authority’s employees to not follow laws and regulations. 
While on the stand, Weddle expressed concern about another appointment to an office — this time the mayor’s office — that is typically on the ballot. At present, three of the council members have been appointed instead of being elected by citizens.
“People see the chaos in London and I think that both branches (of government) are to blame for some things and we both have to take blame for where it belongs, but one of the biggest chaoses in this city is that people’s voices are not being heard,” Weddle said. 
Former Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Joseph Lambert presided as the hearing officer for Friday’s city council meeting. 
Cameron’s office asks FBI to investigate $202K refunds from Beshear’s campaign, Kentucky Dems

Weddle also has made headlines for his political contributions in support of Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear during the 2023 race for governor. The Kentucky Lantern reported in April 2023 that Weddle’s family and associates in the reverse logistics industry had given more than $300,000 to support Beshear, including large contributions from people who had never before made a political donation. The Beshear campaign later returned $202,000 in donations that Weddle had put on his  credit card and that had been made in the names of other people, a violation of campaign finance laws.
The state Registry of Election Finance continues to investigate the donations. The registry staff earlier this year recommended that the board find Weddle unknowingly violated the law. In February, the board unanimously deferred action on that recommendation and asked the registry staff to provide additional information, including about actions of the Beshear campaign and Kentucky Democratic Party.
When Weddle’s excessive contributions came to light during the 2023 primary campaign, then-Attorney Daniel Cameron, who was a Republican candidate for governor, asked the FBI to investigate.
In Laurel County, Weddle has been criticized for his response to a local police shooting in December. London police shot and killed Doug Harless, 63, in his home while serving a warrant for stolen property at the wrong house.

The icebreakers Ji Di and Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di were traveling more than 200 miles offshore of Utqiagvik, America’s northernmost town, in what’s known as the “extended continental shelf” […]","The China-flagged research vessel JIDI operates approximately 265 miles northwest of Utqiagvik, Alaska, September 2, 2025. The Coast Guard Arctic District deployed USCGC Healy (WAGB-20) to monitor and query the vessel. (U.S. Coast Guard Courtesy Photo)The U.S. Coast Guard shadowed two Chinese research ships operating in disputed waters within the Arctic Ocean this week, the Coast Guard announced Wednesday.
The icebreakers Ji Di and Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di were traveling more than 200 miles offshore of Utqiagvik, America’s northernmost town, in what’s known as the “extended continental shelf” under the International Law of the Sea Treaty.
Ordinarily, international law restricts a nation’s fishing, oil drilling and scientific exploration to within 200 nautical miles of its coast, in what’s known as its “exclusive economic zone.” Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a nation can extend that exclusive limit if the continental shelf — a place of generally shallower water — stretches beyond 200 miles.
More than 160 countries and the European Union have ratified the Law of the Sea agreement, but the United States has not, despite the urging of members of Alaska’s congressional delegation.
The agreement says foreign vessels may pass through extended continental shelf waters, but they must have the owner’s consent in order to perform scientific studies or seafloor mapping there.
The United States claims the extended continental shelf near its shorelines and in 2023 began the international process to have its claims recognized, but the United Nations committee that regulates the agreement has not finalized the American claims, a process that could take decades because the United States is not a party to the agreement.
Meanwhile, despite the lack of international recognition, the United States has continued to claim sovereignty over the extended continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean.
In late April, the Trump administration announced that it was beginning to plan oil and gas lease sales in the disputed area. 
China, which operates more Arctic icebreakers than does the United States, has contended that the Arctic Ocean should remain open to free navigation.
This week, when the two Chinese research icebreakers crossed into the disputed area, the Coast Guard dispatched the icebreaker Healy, which was already operating in the Arctic Ocean under a different mission.
“They were pretty close to the standard 200 nautical mile EEZ boundary. They were outside of that by a few miles, which is directly over that portion that is being claimed right now … by the United States,” said Troy Bouffard, director of the Center for Arctic Security and Resilience at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
“It’s deliberate in several ways,” he said of the Chinese action. “It’s meant to get attention but not go over the line.”
He said some of China’s actions in the Arctic have been to “promote it as a global commons that belongs to everybody, and to minimize sovereign rights as much as possible. So that’s a pretty obvious reason why they would have done this at the location they did.”
Chief Petty Officer Travis Magee, assistant public affairs officer for the U.S. Coast Guard’s Arctic District, said that in cases like the ones that occurred this week, the typical response is to “monitor, and query the vessels” over the radio, frequently using a pre-prepared script.
The script he said, often goes like this:
“You are currently operating over the United States Extended Continental Shelf (ECS). Under international law, the United States has rights to conserve and manage the living and non-living natural resources of its ECS as well as to regulate marine scientific research by foreign scientists relating to its ECS. In all cases where marine scientific research is pursued on the Extended Continental Shelf, appropriate official channels must be used to obtain U.S. consent.”
The Coast Guard also flew a long-range patrol aircraft from Kodiak to shadow the two ships.
Rear Adm. Bob Little, commander of the Arctic District, said in a prepared statement that “the U.S. Coast Guard is controlling, securing and defending the northern U.S. border and maritime approaches in the Arctic to protect U.S. sovereignty, and Healy’s operations demonstrate the critical need for more Coast Guard icebreakers to achieve that.”
While the U.S. Navy frequently operates submarines in the Arctic Ocean, it does not have any icebreakers; the Coast Guard operates the federal government’s only icebreaking ships.
The recently approved Republican budget package known as the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” included billions of dollars for the Coast Guard to construct new heavy icebreakers. 
The first of those ships is expected to enter service in 2030, though some medium-weight icebreakers are being planned and could arrive sooner.
As an interim measure, the Coast Guard purchased and commissioned an icebreaking oilfield services ship, renaming it the Storis. 
At the time of the Healy’s intercept in the Arctic Ocean, the Storis was conducting training operations in the Bering Sea.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250902-G-G0200-1001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 20:57:09.221154

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. House of Representatives voted mostly along party lines Wednesday night to repeal development restrictions in large areas of Alaska, Montana and North Dakota.
The House’s vote, which must be duplicated by the Senate before becoming effective, seeks to reverse land management plans adopted in the final days of the Biden administration.
In Alaska, the Central Yukon Resource Management Plan was seen as an obstacle to the proposed 211-mile Ambler Road and the planned trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, proposed the elimination of the plan via the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal regulations under certain circumstances.
“Why is this CRA so important? Revoking Public Land Order 5150 is the first step in allowing the State of Alaska to acquire lands that are critical to two essential projects: Ambler Road and the Alaska LNG pipeline,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas and chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources.
Speaking on the House floor, Begich said he believes the Biden administration’s plan doesn’t represent a balanced approach and would restrict projects that could benefit Alaskans.
“It is federal overreach that is ensuring that Alaska’s wealth stays in the ground, unavailable to the people of one of America’s most impoverished regions,” he said of the portion of Interior Alaska affected by the order.
Doyon Inc., the regional Alaska Native corporation for Interior Alaska, wrote a letter of support for the repeal. Environmental groups and some Alaska Native tribal groups opposed it.
The Bering Sea-Interior Tribal Commission asked Congress to preserve the management plan, as did Protect the Kobuk, an organization opposing Ambler Road.
In a written statement, China Kantner of Protect the Kobuk noted that if federal lands are transferred to the state of Alaska, local hunters will lose subsistence hunting preferences because those are not allowed under the Alaska Constitution.

(Courtesy of MMI)  LINCOLN —  At least 135 Nebraska youths challenged by autism have suffered interrupted services as a result of cuts the state made in August to Medicaid reimbursement rates, according to preliminary findings of a survey by national advocates.
Mariel Fernandez of the Council of Autism Service Providers offered an early peek at the survey during an interim legislative hearing Friday to hear about possible fallout and benefits of the reductions.
Speaking to the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, Fernandez was clear that she does not oppose an adjustment.  Indeed, she said she was shocked to learn how high some of Nebraska’s treatment reimbursements had gotten relative to surrounding states.

However, Fernandez said that the council members believe the changes DHHS adopted amount to an “overcorrection” and requested that the department conduct further study to prevent negative impacts on access to care or an exacerbation of a worker shortage. 
She said she knows of a couple of service providers already exiting the state. 
Fernandez suggested the state implement an accreditation process to get rid of providers trying to “make a buck because rates are favorable.” Other speakers Friday also suggested better vetting to assist in achieving the committee’s goal: long-term sustainability and elimination of exploitative practices.
 Interim study 

The three-hour hearing at the Capitol was part of an interim study to inform lawmakers how they might help ensure the viability of the state’s Medicaid-funded Applied Behavior Analysis services. Also known as ABA, the therapy and support helps people with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental and social communication delays function better in society.
The Council of Autism Service Providers has said the Nebraska cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates range from 28% to 79%, depending on the service or therapy.
Only invited guests only spoke during Friday hearing , which was open to the public. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, the HHS committee chair who said he raised a child with an autism disorder, scheduled the hearing following concerns lawmakers fielded from families and others about the impact of the reimbursement rate changes that went into effect Aug. 1.
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. Jan. 9, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
DHHS said its review showed Nebraska had the highest reimbursement rates of any state ABA program — leading to an increase in state expenses of more than 2,000% since 2020. Five years ago, Nebraska paid about $4.6 million for ABA services. Last year, the amount soared to $85.6 million.
It was an increase HHS’s Matthew Ahern described as the fastest he’s seen in any single program. 
Medicaid-eligible youths served in Nebraska grew from about 169 in 2020 to about 1,150 three years later, DHHS has said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 31 children is affected by autism spectrum disorder, a developmental disability with challenges ranging from social communication to repetitive behaviors.
Hardin said his concerns included “middle men” organizations, which employ people who directly work with the youths, “taking a significant” chunk of the reimbursements. He alleged that some moved to or expanded in Nebraska after seeing a potential for profit-making, fueled by the Legislature’s approval in 2023 of a 17% hike for behavioral health services. 
He referred also to a “troubling absence of background checks” for “registered behavior technicians” who work directly with children. 
“Shall we say … we didn’t exactly mind the farm?” Hardin said. He later added: “How do responsible adults in the room make decisions that are wise without continuing to pay for bad acting and not face a clawback?”
 ‘Blistering’ report

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, another member of the committee, expressed concern about a possible federal clawback of funds, as has happened to a few states whose ABA programs were investigated.
Ahern, the DHHS deputy director, said the “risk is certainly there,” adding that is why the agency tightened its program.

Another speaker, Addie Angelov, CEO of the Indiana-based nonprofit Paramount Health Data Project, spoke about a “blistering” 2024 report of Indiana’s growing ABA program by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General.
The report outlined “audacious” fiscal improprieties, she said, and alleged at least $56 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments. The OIG in that case recommended Indiana refund nearly $40 million to the federal government.
A similar OIG probe of Wisconsin found that the state made at least $18.5 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments for ABA services to youths. Among the OIG’s recommendations was a $12 million refund to the federal government.
Angelov noted that Indiana’s governor established a commission this year to find ways to reduce the rising costs identified in the audit while  maintaining care. She encouraged Nebraska’s HHS legislative committee to consider changes, including holding all entities that serve students with an autism disorder to national standards of best practices, evaluation and auditing. 
She said pediatricians, insurance companies and schools must meet accreditation standards.
“Currently standalone ABA therapy providers are the only entity that does not have a checks and balances in place,” Angelov said. “Vetting these organizations that serve them should be a top priority.”
 ‘All very new’ 

Amy Nordness of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Monroe-Meyer Institute said Medicaid rate reductions won’t stop MMI from providing services to youths on the autism spectrum. 
But, she said services likely would “look different” as a result.
State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Asked by State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha to elaborate, she said it likely could mean increasing caseload size for supervisors who oversee techs that work directly with the youths.  It also could prompt more diversification of the client base at some clinics to include more non-Medicaid patients.
“What I’m hearing is there might be reduced availability to provide services to folks on Medicaid,” Fredrickson said.
Nordness said that is a possibility, adding that “this is all very new.”
She said the nonprofit MMI — which she described as one of the biggest and oldest developmental disability centers in the world — is not about turning a profit. But it needs to cover costs, she said.
“We have to find the right balance,” said Nordness. Of quality of treatment, she said: “That’s not something we’ll skimp on.”

In front of the Tetons, public land advocates support the Great American Outdoors Act that provides money for public-lands maintenance and permanently funds acquisition of parks and access.
The post Congressional panel hears call for national park funding, restoration of staff appeared first on WyoFile .","With the Tetons as a backdrop, a congressional panel heard testimony Friday in support of reauthorizing the Great American Outdoors Act, which was passed in 2020 to address $12.7 billion in backlogged maintenance on public lands.
Members of the panel, including U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, supported continued funding for the act’s Legacy Restoration Fund that expires this year. But officials need to better distribute the money and also use it to modernize infrastructure in national parks, Hageman said.
“The next iteration of GAOA should concentrate on projects that modernize our parks, enhance public access, improve infrastructure and create new outdoor recreation opportunities,” she said in front of an outdoor audience of about 100 at Grand Teton National Park’s Jenny Lake Plaza.
To date, the act has not “adequately address[ed] some of our smaller parks and the needs that they have, and it disproportionately prioritized urban cities over our rural crown jewels, such as … Grand Teton and Yellowstone national park[s],” she said.
“There’s magic in this place because of these people.” Chip Jenkins
While the committee focused on the Act’s Legacy Restoration Fund, one witness said the act’s good work could not properly continue without restoring drastic staffing cuts to the National Park Service that have occurred since President Donald Trump took office.
“I also came here to warn you that we won’t be able to continue this success without the planners, engineers, compliance officers, budget experts, landscape architects, maintenance staff, carpenters and so many more Park Service staff who make it possible for the Great American Outdoors Act to fund the work on the ground,” said Kristen Brengel, a senior vice president with the National Parks Conservation Association. “The Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent workforce since January.”
The committee should advocate for restoring Park Service staff and prohibiting further cuts, she said.
‘Magic in this place’
Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins drew applause after he choked up while testifying about the partnerships that enabled the park to undertake numerous projects that benefit visitors. Those range from construction of a modern visitors’ center to upgraded trailhead parking lots and entrance stations and preservation of more than 1,200 acres of parkland once owned by Wyoming.
“There’s magic in this place because of these people,” he said, referring to local residents, politicians and nonprofit groups who work with park staff. “I think there’s something the committee can learn about the way we work together to be stewards of this place.”
Grand Teton needs help, he said.
“Our infrastructure is not always adequate for current visitation numbers, let alone for increasing future levels,” he said. Grand Teton sorely needs to upgrade Colter Bay Village on the shores of Jackson Lake, a place that attracts up to 11,000 people a day.

Representatives pictured are Amata Radewagen, Troy Downing, Doug LaMalfa, Harriet Hageman, Chairman Bruce Westerman, Teresa Leger Fernandez (hidden) and Susie Lee. (Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
“The infrastructure is suffering from over 75 years of wear and tear, and is not meeting our visitors’ needs nor matching the beauty that is Colter Bay,” Jenkins said. “We need to make sure the toilets flush,” he said, calling for “wholesale rejuvenation” of cabins, a restaurant, marina and campground.
With GAOA modernization funds, Grand Teton also would improve pullouts near the Oxbow Bend of the Snake River, haunt of the late world-famous mother grizzly 399. The park would build a bicycle path to connect the park’s largest campground — the Gros Ventre Campground — to the valley’s bicycle trail network.
“The park welcomes close to 4 million visitors annually,” Jenkins said, “and this year, we’re on track to have our second busiest year on record.”
On a post-Labor Day Friday, 157 vehicles overflowed from the Jenny Lake parking area and parked on the sides of the highway to the south. Perhaps a similar number overflowed to the north. Eighty-eight vehicles were queued up at the Moose entrance station at noon, their drivers waiting to show passes or pay fees.
World-class plaza
Reauthorizing the Great American Outdoors Act “can sharpen” an existing partnership between the Grand Teton National Park Foundation and the park, foundation president Leslie Mattson told the panel. About $15 million in private funds augmented $6 million from the feds to upgrade the park’s spotlight draw, where the hearing took place.
Jenny Lake was once a dusty crossroads of trails and desultory log buildings, “marked by congestion and confusion,” Mattson said. “The most commonly asked questions were ‘where is the lake?’ and ‘where is the bathroom?’”
The upgrade created “a world-class, accessible visitor plaza and a sustainable network of backcountry trails that welcomes millions each year,” she said.
Drawing people to Grand Teton and Jackson Hole only to disappoint them with a shabby experience is counterproductive, said Julie Calder, chair of the Jackson Hole Travel and Tourism Board. A vice president at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, she advocated for renewal of the act.
Members of the Travel and Tourism Board often say they are in “the dreaming phase,” of visitors’ journeys, she said. “We create a lot of content to make people dream about coming here. We want to ensure that when they arrive, they get the experience that they had hoped for when they dream[ed].”
A wildlife guide who built a small business told the panel how companies like his rely on park infrastructure. Taylor Phillips started Jackson Hole EcoTour Adventures in 2008 and now has 40 employees and a payroll approaching $2 million, he said. His company is one of 70 that last year introduced more than 81,000 visitors to the park, he said.
He pointed to GAOA funds that improved the rural Moose-Wilson road as a worthy investment. Before the improvement, a 260-mile round trip to Yellowstone ended over 10 miles of jarring potholes — “not a lasting impression you want to leave with our guests.”
Brengel, the National Parks Conservation Association representative, reiterated the need for a restored park service staff nationwide.
“It takes people to run the park,” she said. The parks “won’t be protected and preserved without the dedicated staff who honor and care for them.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders (far left). (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Trump administration is moving to partially lift a blanket federal prohibition on cellphone jamming, FCC Chair Brendan Carr said Friday — a move in line with efforts led by Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton to allow the practice via legislation.
Cotton, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an afternoon press conference they are primarily interested in targeting prison inmates who use contraband cellphones to commit crimes. Carr said he’s ready to oblige via a rule change.
Federal law prohibits states or individuals from “willfully or maliciously” interfering with “licensed or authorized” radio communications — such as a cellphone.
“Over the years the FCC has authorized various different technologies to try to identify contraband cell phones and shut them down,” Carr said at the press conference. “They’ve worked in some cases, they have not worked in other cases. Other countries — and the federal government — have authority to jam within their facilities, but state and local officials have been denied that ability.
Carr said the long-standing federal ban was due to a “misreading” of law. The FCC will vote on a proposed rule at the end of the month that would change this.

“What we can do at the federal level is we authorize communications or we don’t authorize communications, and so what we’re going to do is we’re going to deauthorize the lawful use of contraband cell phones within the confines of prisons,” Carr said. “So once contraband cellphone use is not an authorized communication, then the federal law is no longer a prohibition to jamming it.”
The work-around, Griffin said, will allow prison officials to target illicit cellphone use that “kill[s] and endanger[s]” people.
“It may not be a silver bullet, it may not be the right fit for every facility, but there are certainly lots and lots of facilities around this country where this type of solution will and can make a significant difference,” Carr said.
Cellphones are typically considered contraband in state prison systems, and Arkansas officials and Carr said they are being used by violent criminals to order hits and other crimes against people on the outside. A memo addressed to Arkansas Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne provided to the Advocate by both the Department of Corrections and the attorney general’s office outlined how illicit cellphones contribute to gang violence inside and outside state prisons.
According to the memo written by Maj. Randy Shores of the division’s Office of Emergency Services, Arkansas prisons currently incarcerate 230 “Serious Threat Group leaders” who have been found with a cellphone 308 times.
“These 230 inmates are from all the known threat groups housed in the department including Bloods, Crips, Aryan Circle, White Aryan Resistance along with our largest group Gangster Disciples,” Shores wrote in the undated memo. “Further investigation led us to several incidents involving confiscated cellphones where these same inmates’ information was found … showing evidence of conducting illegal activities such as drug movement, drone activities, the movement of money and gang activities throughout not only the state of Arkansas but across the United States.”
Rand Champion, a corrections department spokesperson, confirmed that the state had observed a trend between cellphone confiscations and increased gang violence within the prisons.
A photo shown by Griffin that he said was taken at the Arkansas Department of Corrections’ Varner Unit showed dozens of cellphones, which he said had been confiscated from inmates.
Griffin said incarcerated people will have the devices smuggled to them via drone drops and that there have been numerous instances of inmates extorting Arkansans using illicit phones.
“I recall telling the story of an inmate who was contacting another inmate’s mother on the phone and saying, ‘If you don’t get us this money, we’re going to kill your son,’” Griffin said. “No credible person disputes the heinous crimes that are being committed with these cellphones.”
Cotton has been pushing legislation to allow cellphone jamming within corrections facilities and is the lead sponsor for the proposed Cellphone Jamming Reform Act. He has introduced the bill on at least two occasions, including once this past March, but it has never moved out of a Senate committee.
The proposed rule, Cotton said, will make it so that “contraband cellphones will be nothing more than dead paperweights inside our prisons.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order guiding the allocation of more than $430 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to projects that would “benefit wildlife habitat, improve water quality and provide flood protection while creating new recreational opportunities.”
“The Land and Water Conservation Fund continues to deliver on its promise to connect Americans to the outdoors while protecting the landscapes that make our nation special,” said Burgum in a statement.
But local conservation groups say the changes threaten to undermine the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2020, which contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to the development and rehabilitation of parks, conservation areas and outdoor recreation facilities across the nation.
Conservation groups said language in the order restricts the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from using the fund to acquire additional land that could be used to expand recreation and conservation. 
Those restrictions could effectively prevent the expansion of National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and National Scenic and Historic Trails administered by the BLM. 
“Nevada is approximately 86% public land, of which 67% is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. If you have enjoyed some form of outdoor recreation in Nevada, there is a good chance it was on BLM managed land. If you have camped, hiked, OHV’ed or hunted in Nevada, it was likely in or near a National Conservation Area or National Monument,” said Russell Kuhlman, executive director of the Nevada Wildlife Federation.
The order would also allow states to use the conservation fund to buy federal property, including protected federal conservation land. Those changes could open the door to land transfers that shift public land to private ownership, said the Nevada Conservation League.
“Nevadans overwhelmingly support protecting these places, and we cannot afford to roll back decades of progress in opening and protecting access to the great outdoors,” said Kristee Watson, Executive Director of the Nevada Conservation League.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund has pumped more than $175 million into acquiring and improving public land at Red Rock Canyon and Lake Tahoe, according to the Nevada Conservation League.
The order also “increased bureaucratic red tape” by requiring both state governors and local county officials to approve land acquisitions purchased using the fund, said the Nevada Wildlife Federation. 
Local conservation groups warned the restrictions could prevent new investments in the outdoor recreation economy and halt pending land deals and projects.
In 2023, Nevada’s outdoor recreation industry accounted for $8.1 billion in value-added (GDP) annually, ranking the state 10th in the nation, according to the Nevada Division of Outdoor Recreation. 
The Department of the Interior did, however, back away from earlier plans to include language that would siphon money away from conservation land purchases to pay for maintenance projects on federal property.
“Fortunately,” the order does not include one of the administration’s worst ideas, leaving out its prior proposal to divert LWCF funding for unauthorized purposes,” said Amy Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition.
Lindholm continued, “Unfortunately, Secretarial Order 3442 still does real damage.  It hinders critical conservation and public access by reviving previously rejected ideas.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Avi-Kwa-Ame-National-Monument-1024x658.jpeg,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

The change comes as insurers grapple with the costs of drugs like Ozempic, which are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1s. That drug class is one of Idaho’s fastest-growing expenses for the state insurance plan, officials say.
“Current evidence does not justify continued coverage of these medications at current usage levels and pricing,” officials wrote.
Almost 27,000 people are enrolled in Idaho’s state government health insurance plans. 
Examples of medications that won’t be covered for weight-loss in Idaho include Wegovy, Saxenda and Zepbound. The policy applies for any GLP-1 medication prescribed mainly for weight loss. But coverage will not be affected for drugs in that class that are prescribed to treat diabetes.
Earlier this year, Idaho’s health insurance premiums for state employees rose sharply, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Officials said the rise was largely driven by rising health care costs and the types of services people seek.

Like Portland, voters in those cities skew heavily toward Democratic candidates.A television report Thursday night alerted him to supposed rampant violence in Portland, he said. He also possibly alluded to weeks-long protests in the city after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. Those protests, which sometimes included clashes with police, ended in 2020.“I didn't know that was continuing to go on, but Portland is unbelievable,” he said. “The destruction of the city. Well, I'm going to look at it now, because I didn't know that was still going on. This has been going on for years. So we'll be able to stop that very easily.”Trump, without offering evidence, described the city as beset by “paid terrorists” who smokebomb stores.“And when we go there, if we go to Portland, we're going to wipe them out,” he said. “They're going to be gone, and they're going to be gone bad. They won't even stand the fight. They will not stay there. They're ruined. They've ruined that city.“What they’ve done to that city, it’s like living in hell,” he added.Another National Guard deployment comingTrump’s opining on the state of Oregon’s largest city was part of his answer to a reporter’s question about if he had chosen the next city where he would send National Guard troops.The president said he would send troops to another city and had decided which one, but was not ready to announce it.“I'm not going to say it now, but yeah, I have” decided, he said. “We're going to go into another place and straighten it out.”Trump has said the deployment to Los Angeles was meant to subdue protests over the administration’s immigration crackdown, while the troops in the District of Columbia were there to control crime, despite a 30-year-low violent crime rate in the nation’s capital.California Gov. Gavin Newsom and District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb have sued Trump over the deployments.Newsom won a decision Tuesday, with U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruling that Trump used military personnel as law enforcement in violation of an 18th-century law banning military personnel from conducting law enforcement, as well as a more fundamental principle of U.S. democracy.The administration has not responded to Schwalb’s suit, which was filed Thursday.",,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

The monument — titled the Snow Country Prison Japanese American Internment Memorial — displays the names of the 1,850 Japanese Americans who were detained on the property.
It’s named after a haiku written by Itaru Ina, who was held prisoner there from 1945 to 1946.
Before the tribal college in Bismarck existed, the property was known as the Fort Lincoln military post. It was used as a prison camp for Japanese Americans and German nationals during World War II.

Many of the Japanese Americans who were sent to Fort Lincoln were community leaders who had spoken out against their imprisonment and were pressured to renounce their citizenship. 
The effort to create a memorial on the campus was spearheaded by Itaru Ina’s daughter, Satsuki Ina, who is also a survivor of the incarceration program. She was born at Tule Lake, a detention camp in California, in 1944.
Satsuki Ina said the monument is a commitment to remember the unconstitutional detention of Japanese Americans, even when their stories went untold for decades.
“It’s an act of dissidence,” she said.
There is little public recognition about what the prisoners had suffered, speakers at the dedication noted.
“It’s a story that very few people in our own community knew very much about,” said Barbara Takei, another Japanese American activist who spoke during the dedication. “In the broader community, even fewer people know about it.”

The Revs. Ronald Kobata and Duncan Ryūken Williams led attendees in a Buddhist ritual to honor the Fort Lincoln prisoners, especially those who died during their incarceration. 
“A memorial like the Snow Country Prison Japanese American Internment Memorial helps us to feel the presence of all those who experienced wartime incarceration,” Williams said during the dedication.
Williams created a book containing the names of all 125,284 people of Japanese ancestry incarcerated in the United States during the war. The book, called the Ireichō, was part of the dedication ceremony and is on display at United Tribes Technical College Friday and Saturday.

Several speakers drew parallels between the experience of Japanese Americans during World War II and the U.S. government’s persecution of Native nations.
“In both cases, U.S. authorities exercised a paternalistic rationale justifying forced relocation as protective or necessary,” United Tribes Technical College President Russ McDonald said.
Many also compared the imprisonment of Japanese Americans to the modern-day immigration policies of President Donald Trump’s administration.
The law used to justify their incarceration during World War II — the Alien Enemies Act — is the same one the Trump administration invoked to arrest and deport Venezuelan immigrants. (An appeals court on Tuesday ruled against Trump’s use of the law, though the matter is likely to also go before the U.S. Supreme Court.)
“To me, it just shows how vulnerable we are,” Kobata said in an interview before the ceremony. “Stop repeating history. We know that the Constitution isn’t this thing that’s so dependable.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.More than 1,400 service workers across the University of Minnesota’s five campuses could strike after they rejected the university’s “last, best and final” offer on a new labor contract.
The Teamsters Local 320, the union representing cooks, groundskeepers and other service workers, urged their members to vote down the offer which they said fell far short in raising wages and protecting benefits.
“A system-wide strike remains an option as we maneuver through the next several days and talk to members,” said Brian Aldes, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 320, in a statement announcing the vote results Friday. “The ball is now in the university’s court to make this right or face a work stoppage.”
The university’s offer included $1,000 bonuses over the next two years; at least 3% wage increases in the first year and 2% in the second; and additional market adjustments ranging from 0.5% to 2% depending on the job and seniority. The proposal also included pay increases for shifts that begin early in the morning or end late at night.
The union said to avoid the strike the university must raise wages at least 3.5% a year.
The average unionized service worker makes $26.11 per hour, according to the union, which is about $11 per hour less than the median wage in Minnesota.
Federal budget cuts and rising costs have strained university budgets across the country, leading the University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents to approve the largest tuition hike in over a decade while cutting spending by 7% on academics, student services and research.
“Unlike many of our peer institutions, which are also facing financial challenges, the university has invested in our people and allocated a significant pool for salary increases for faculty and staff for the upcoming fiscal year. While we do not want a strike, we are prepared to continue vital services to our students, faculty, and staff if the Teamsters choose to strike,” Ken Horstman, vice president for human resources, said in a statement on Friday.
Service workers at the university also authorized a strike three years ago, but called it off after reaching an agreement that raised the minimum hourly wage from $15 to $20.
In announcing their intention to strike, the union boasted of its large strike fund that would allow its members — many living paycheck-to-paycheck — to forgo wages and walk the picket line in the event of a protracted strike. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters approved enhanced strike benefits for University of Minnesota members of $1,000 per week, which exceeds the weekly pay of many members, the union said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/P1116670-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-09-05 19:57:34.168804

Third District Judge Dianna Gibson tossed out Utah’s 2021 congressional map in a ruling she issued last week that determined the Utah Legislature unconstitutionally repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that sought to create an independent redistricting commission. 
Attorneys for both the Legislature and the anti-gerrymandering lawsuit’s plaintiffs agreed on the following deadlines, according to a court filing submitted Thursday: 
GOP legislative leaders begrudgingly say they’ll redraw Utah’s congressional map, as court ordered


Sept. 25: The Utah Legislature will publish its new proposed map. 
Sept. 26 to Oct. 5: Lawmakers will hold a public comment period to take input on the map.
Oct. 6: The Legislature will take a final vote on the map and submit it to the court for consideration. Plaintiffs will also have the same deadline to submit any proposed maps to the judge. 
Oct. 17: The deadline for both parties to file briefs, expert reports, and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary. 
Oct. 23 to Oct. 24: The court will hold an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. 
Oct. 28: The deadline for parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the court, if necessary. 
Nov. 10: The latest possible date for the court to select a final map, according to the lieutenant governor’s office. 

Previously, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s office had told the judge the latest a new map could be adopted would be Nov. 1, in order to give county clerks enough time to finalize precincts before candidates can begin filing in January. 
However, earlier this week during a status conference, Gibson asked if there would be any flexibility — even if it’s a matter of days — to push back her previously proposed schedule to give lawmakers more time to submit their maps. In her initial order last week, the judge proposed that deadline to be Sept. 24. 
The lieutenant governor’s attorneys said in another court filing earlier this week that they could push the Nov. 1 deadline to Nov. 10. 
Additionally, Gibson had included in her initial order the opportunity for “third parties” — in addition to the Legislature and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs — to submit proposed maps. However, in their joint court filing, attorneys for both parties said they “agree that map submissions to the Court should be limited to the existing parties in this case.” 
“Third parties have the opportunity to submit proposed maps and comments during the legislative process,” they wrote in Thursday’s filing.

Jim Pillen has requested a major federal disaster declaration for 12 counties following early August storms with hurricane-force winds that damaged a state prison.
Pillen a couple of weeks ago declared a state disaster for the severe wind and thunderstorms Aug. 8-11 in 23 counties in eastern Nebraska. The federal declaration, based on state and local damage estimates, narrows the request to severe wind and flash flooding Aug. 8-10 in 12 of those counties.

Preliminary damage estimates in the federal request exceed $39 million. The state declaration for high winds, heavy rain and flooding had estimated losses at $24 million, though a Nebraska Emergency Management Agency spokesperson said the estimate was likely to grow.
The NEMA spokesperson said that after state and local officials conducted joint preliminary damage assessments with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the state was able to substantiate federal funding eligibility for the 12 counties. Those counties are: Burt, Douglas, Fillmore, Lancaster, Nemaha, Nuckolls, Saline, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Washington and Webster.
The 11 counties covered only by the state disaster declaration are: Butler, Cass, Dodge, Gage, Harlan, Jefferson, Johnson, Otoe, Pawnee, Sarpy and York.
The August storms detailed in the federal request damaged schools, public facilities, businesses and power infrastructure, particularly hundreds of power poles, transformers and electrical lines. Fallen power lines or trees and flooding also forced road closures. One woman died in the storms, and a man was severely injured at Two Rivers State Recreation Area.
The Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln lost the roofs of two housing units, displacing 387 inmates, 137 of whom were sent to temporary housing at Omaha and Tecumseh facilities. The units are expected to be operational by late September, according to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services. 
A NEMA spokesperson had said some damage to the prison, after insurance, may be eligible under state disaster aid. If approved, federal disaster funding could cover costs associated with repairs to and replacement of public infrastructure, according to the Governor’s Office.

Vermont’s independent health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board, is considering a set of recommendations that would place tighter guardrails on expenses run rampant across the University of Vermont Health Network. The board’s staff presented the recommendations at its Wednesday meeting, a precursor to the board’s annual hospital budget decisions due Sept. 15. 
New laws passed this legislative session bolstered the care board’s ability to specifically tackle compensation for health care executives and the structure of network health operations, like UVM Health Network. Gov. Phil Scott, who signed these laws, released a statement Thursday commending the care board’s efforts to lower the overall cost of health care in the state. 
“In recent years, GMCB regulatory review has identified concerns with University of Vermont Health Network operations, and lack of alignment between executive compensation and State healthcare goals,” board chair Owen Foster told VTDigger in a statement following the hearing.  “This budget cycle GMCB’s staff has accordingly conducted a deeper dive and analysis of these issues and yesterday made recommendations to the Board.” 
Specifically, during its Wednesday presentation the care board staff illustrated the extreme income disparities between the UVM Medical Center and other hospitals owned by its parent company, the UVM Health Network. The network owns three hospitals in Vermont (UVM, Porter, and Central Vermont Medical Centers), three in New York, and a number of additional health care facilities in the region. 
UVMMC is the largest hospital in the network. Its budgeted revenue for 2026 is $2.4 billion, while Central Vermont’s is $318 million and Porter’s $142 million. 
In 2020-24, losses across the UVM Network reached $12.8 million, according to the board staff’s presentation. Still, the UVM Medical Center alone contributed more than $138 million in profit to the network during this period, the report also showed. Two of the three  New York hospitals in the network operated at a deficit. Of its proposed budgets for next fiscal year, UVMMC accounts for nearly 95% of the systemwide operating income. 
“The Health Network has made excess revenue margin here in Vermont, and the Health Network has needed to contribute those dollars to the New York Hospitals. Vermonters are paying for keeping those New York hospitals afloat,” explained Mike Fisher, the state’s health care advocate, in an interview with VTDigger after the budget hearing.
Exactly what can the board do to curb that disparity? “I’m not exactly sure,” Fisher said, but he was heartened to see the board make strides to pull hospital costs down, to be closer in line with what insurers will be able to pay them. 
To understand the hospital budgets, it’s important to understand the insurance rate review. The two are deeply interconnected. In August, as part of this review process, the Green Mountain Care Board, approved moderate premium increases for health insurers selling plans on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. These rates influence how much hospitals can bill insurers for their services. 
Insurance rate review and hospital budgets are two sides of one equation, Fisher explained. “Insurance rate review is ‘how much money do you have to spend?’ Hospital budget [review] is analogous to ‘Where are you going to spend those dollars?’” he said.
“In years past those two sides of the equation haven’t added up. The board has allowed for more spending than it raised (through insurance payments),” he added.
For the coming fiscal year, the board recommended a commercial reimbursement rate reduction of 7.3% for UVMMC, as well as reductions to net patient revenue and expenses. It also recommended rate increases for Porter and Central Vermont Medical Centers of 2.9% (down, for both, from a proposed 3%) and budget reductions commensurate with reductions in net patient revenue.
The staff recommendations came after Mike Smith, who leads an independent liaison team,  delivered a scathing letter to the UVMHN Board, UVMMC Board and Green Mountain Care Board on Aug. 29, calling out the network’s proposed budget narrative. He outlined that UVMNH’s claims that it is working to improve affordability grossly conflict with the numbers on the page. While the network put forth lower rates, it outlined increases in use and type of services that more than offset that reduction.
Because of this, commercial insurers will see a nearly $46 million increase in what they pay the UVMMC in 2026, Smith writes, despite the $76 million reduction in rates. 
Smith’s letter also raised the concern that the care board outlined, stating that the medical center “was paying more than its fair share of network costs,” especially by lending money to the network’s New York hospitals. The network has made a net $68.9 million in loans to the New York hospitals between 2015 and 2013, Smith cites, adding that UVMMC and UVMHN invested an additional $20 million as part of an affiliation agreement, population health initiatives and capital investments. 
In response to the letter, UVM Health Network spokesperson Annie Mackin wrote that the “University of Vermont Health Network worked hard to submit budgets for FY ’26 that complied with GMCB guidance, and which took into account the increasing need of our patients for health care services and the increased expenses involved in providing care. However, much work remains, and we and our partners will need to continue taking steps to improve affordability not just in this budget cycle, but in the months and years ahead. We look forward to further digging into the questions and ideas the liaison team have raised.”
Regarding the concerns about the cost burden of the network’s New York hospitals, she said, “Our health care partners in northern New York contribute real benefits to Vermonters – from the care they provide, to the positive economic impact when patients from Plattsburgh or Elizabethtown seek specialized treatment in Burlington,” adding that the two New York hospitals in the red are “making meaningful progress toward stability.”
The liaison’s letter and the care board staff both also looked critically at executive compensation in the UVM network. For 14 executive positions at the network, they budgeted an average 9% increase — nearly a $50,000 average increase from fiscal year 2025 to 2026, care board staff outlined. The liaison’s letter cited that rates of employee benefits have outpaced average cost growth in the past five years  across all three Vermont hospitals — nearly doubling at the medical center. In response, Mackin added that the health network compensates “all staff, regardless of their position, at market rates that help us recruit and retain the people we need to provide high quality care.”
Overall, expenses at the medical center have grown 9.8% annually between 2019 and 2024 — far outpacing the annual inflation rate for that same period.
“The UVMHN must focus on affordability both in its words and in its budget submissions.
Concrete steps must be taken to bring this budget and future ones in line with an agreed affordability metric that pertains to Vermont and Vermonters,” Smith wrote in the letter.
In the coming days the care board intends to deliberate and evaluate the proposed budgets and its staff recommendations, before beginning voting next week. The fiscal year for hospitals runs Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The care board must establish a budget for each hospital by Sept. 15.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana environmental group plans to file a citizen-led federal lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply for the contamination of land and waterways from recent explosions of petrochemical tanks at a Tangipahoa Parish industrial facility. 
The Louisiana Environmental Action Network, represented by the New Orleans-based Waltzer Wygul & Garside law firm, sent Smitty’s a 60-day notice to inform the company it intends to sue for violations of Clean Water Act. The federal law requires the advance notice so that the public is made aware of the legal action. 
The Aug. 22 explosion dispersed an oily residue onto neighboring homes, businesses and a nearby elementary school, and firefighting crews have battled flareups at the site for 15 days running. 
“The fire has been 98% (contained) for over a week,” Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller said in an email. “The reason for the 2% is there is still a possibility of small flare-ups as the burned building and remaining materials are manipulated to find all of the hot spots.”
Smitty’s Supply sells industrial oils and lubricants and employed over 400 people before the incident destroyed the facility. 
The cause of the explosion remains under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, whose crews continue to clean nearby contaminated land and waterways, including the Tangipahoa River that feeds into Lake Pontchartrain.  
The EPA reported Tuesday it had recovered more than 2.15 million gallons of petroleum material mixed with water. It also said contaminated materials had not reached Lake Pontchartrain.     
In a news release, LEAN executive director Marylee Orr described its lawsuit notice as a “first step designed to give the community a seat at the table, if they need it, when plans and decisions are being made to respond to the disaster.”
Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
A Clean Water Act citizen lawsuit will not allow individuals affected by the explosion to obtain any monetary damages, Orr said. Rather, it provides them access to extensive information about the accident, and they can ask the court to force Smitty’s to fully clean up the contamination. 
EPA takes over hazardous material cleanup after Tangipahoa industrial fire

The lawsuit could also result in additional environmental projects to improve the quality of the Tangipahoa River, LEAN’s news release said. 
Orr said her organizations decided to take action after hearing from Amite-area residents who are unhappy about having to do some of the clean-up work themselves. 
As of Friday, 15 days after the incident, 24-hour cleanup and firefighting operations continue, though officials reported no flareups occurred overnight, suggesting the blaze may be close to being extinguished, according to a statement from the Tangipahoa Parish Government. 
Smitty’s Supply has been previously cited for Clean Water Act violations for releasing contaminants into public drainage areas, including oil, grease, fecal coliform and carbon compounds such as methane and ethanol. The company has been fined more than $161,000 since 2021, according to the EPA’s website. 
In June, Smitty’s was non-compliant under its operating permit for exceeding limits on grease, oil and other pollutants discharged into the Tangipahoa River, according to Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records. The company had to block off the affected areas with containment boom and clean it up with vacuum trucks. 
On June 2, a resident who lives near Smitty’s called the state agency to report a strong gas smell and a loud machinery noise coming from the plant, records show. The caller said the odor filled his house as soon as he opened the door and lasted for a few days. The records indicate an LDEQ inspector traveled to the site on June 5 and again on June 17 but found nothing out of the ordinary.
When asked for comment Friday about the Smitty’s investigation, LDEQ referred questions to the EPA, which took over as the lead responding agency a day after the explosion.

That means Iowa’s 100th year of pheasant hunting could have harvest figures between 600,000 and 700,000, according to DNR Upland Wildlife Research Biologist Todd Bogenschutz. 
“Last year was a decent year for pheasant hunting,” Bogenschutz said in a press release from DNR. “2023 was a good year for pheasant hunting. This year could be excellent.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
2023 and 2024 were two of the best pheasant harvest seasons in the past two decades. Hunters bagged an estimated 460,000 roosters in 2024 and 590,000 roosters in 2023. The harvest figures were consistent with DNR’s observed population decline from 2023 to 2024. 
This year DNR staff reported 1,038 pheasant broods – 338 more than last year. 
Bogenschutz said there were fewer chicks-per-hen that survived this year, but the high number of nests “offset the drop.” 
He said the mild winter — according to the report the fourth-least-snowy winter in 138 years of records — was also helpful in preserving population this year.
“Our adult hen survival was excellent; our adult rooster survival was excellent,” Bogenschutz said in the release. “That really drove the population increase.”
DNR staff from across the state conduct the August roadside survey on more than 200 30-mile routes. Staff drive the gravel roads early in the morning and count the hens, or female pheasants, as they move their broods out of the dew. 
This year, staff observed a statewide average of 28 birds per route, which according to the press release, is the highest count since 2005. Last year’s average was about 20 per route. 
According to the report, the northern regions, central and southeast regions have the “best overall” population densities, but it said “hunters in all regions should see more birds in 2025.” 
In addition to ring-necked pheasant, DNR staff count bobwhite quail, gray partridge and cottontail rabbit while driving the gravel roads. 
The mild winter was also a benefit to these populations which all had population increases from last year. 
Quail populations more than doubled from last year, with a 123% statewide average increase. Partridge populations increased 19% statewide and rabbit populations increased 41%, according to DNR’s report. 
The report also notes the importance of acreage in the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, which gives landowners an incentive to establish and maintain perennial cover over part of their cropland. 
“The CRP has become critical for Iowa pheasant populations with the loss of small grains and hay lands to corn and soybean production,” the report said. 
CRP acres serve as habitat for the birds, and DNR records show enrollment in the program has impacted pheasant populations. 
According to the report, which cites USDA figures, the number of acres enrolled in CRP is the lowest in the program’s history. Iowa had more than 1.67 million acres enrolled as of June 2025, but 727,000 of those acres are set to expire by fall of 2027, according to the report. 
“Iowa will cease to be a major pheasant hunting state if the CRP is significantly diminished,” the report said. 
Pheasant season begins Oct. 25 and runs through Jan. 10, 2026, though those 15 and younger can start a weekend earlier during the youth season Oct. 18-19.
Last year, an estimated 77,400 hunters chased after pheasant in Iowa. That’s close to the number that partook in Iowa’s first-ever hunting season, Oct. 20-22 in 1925, when 75,000 hunters set out with a three-rooster limit for a half day of hunting.
DNR said in the release that 2025 hunters can expect a “banner year.”
Hunters can celebrate the centennial of the sport with commemorative apparel and license design available online.

((Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The New Mexico Department of Health on Friday announced residents will be able to more easily access COVID-19 vaccines at state pharmacies, following updated protocols from the state Board of Pharmacy.
Last week, DOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie issued a public health order directing the state health department to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
That order stemmed from “some pharmacies announcing they cannot administer the vaccine in New Mexico unless recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has yet to convene and act on the matter,” a news release noted.
NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source New Mexico earlier this week that many of the vaccines administered in the state are done so through its pharmacies, which are governed by a protocol established by the Pharmacy Board and others that essentially requires the pharmacies to follow the ACIP guidelines in order to have “prescriptive authority” and give vaccines. Lacking the ACIP guidelines, Smelser noted, the pharmacies’ parent companies “have determined that they require a prescription in order to get a vaccine.”
NM Board of Pharmacy expected to release new protocol for COVID-19 vaccines this week

The revised protocols, announced Friday, mean “pharmacists can prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines using state health department guidelines instead of waiting for federal recommendations,” a health department news release said.
“This action will ensure New Mexicans have access to the vaccine if they choose,” New Mexico Board of Pharmacy Executive Director and Chief Drug Inspector Cheranne McCracken said in a statement, adding the New Mexico Pharmacists Association played an important role in the protocol update. “It provides pharmacists statewide with the clarity and guidance to provide COVID-19 vaccines.”
A statement from Sid Tenneti, senior vice president of retail pharmacy CVS Health confirmed the new protocol will allow access.
“Following today’s regulatory action by the New Mexico Department of Health, CVS Pharmacy will ensure COVID-19 vaccinations are available as soon as possible at our pharmacies throughout the state,” Tenneti said in a statement. “Appointments can be scheduled online via CVS.com, through the CVS Health app, or patients can walk into our pharmacies and clinics.”
The New Mexico Department of Health recommends COVID-19 vaccination for:

Anyone 65 and older.
People ages 2–64 who are at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness.
Any New Mexico resident who wants to be vaccinated.

Read the complete guidelines here.
“We are committed to ensuring access for those who wish to be vaccinated and our collaborative work with the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy demonstrates a swift resolution to remove barriers,” DeBlassie said in a statement. “As the fall/winter respiratory virus season rapidly approaches, New Mexico cannot afford to wait for the federal government to act on this matter.”
Earlier this week, prior to the new protocols being released on Friday, several state medical systems confirmed to Source NM this week availability of the COVID-19 vaccine for patients
“At Presbyterian, we support efforts to provide vaccines to New Mexicans,” Presbyterian Healthcare Services VP and Chief Pharmacy Officer Erica Downing said in a statement. “We continue to work through state and federal requirements and expect to be able to prescribe COVID vaccines for our patients and administer COVID vaccines in our facilities.”

“CHRISTUS St. Vincent has received its first shipment of the Pfizer Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccines,” a statement provided to Source said. “The vaccines will initially be offered in our clinics and in our outpatient pharmacy to adults 65 and older, and individuals ages 5 through 64 who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19.”

“Generally speaking—If a patient asks for a COVID vaccine, we’ll provide it, assuming we have the supply,” a UNM Health spokesperson said.

According to Source’s analysis, more than half of the state’s food retailers, including 42 farmers markets, are at “high risk” of significant financial losses due to SNAP cuts.(Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source NM)More than half of New Mexico’s nearly 1,700 retailers that accept food stamps are at “high risk” of losing business or closing due to recent cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, according to a Source New Mexico review of an analysis by the Center for American Progress.
According to the latest figures from the United States Department of Agriculture, 1,687 retailers across the state accept SNAP. That includes 776 convenience stores, 101 grocery stores, 72 farmers markets and 91 supermarkets, along with other types of retailers. 
Of them, 898 are at “high risk” of facing financial difficulties, including closure, according to the Center for American Progress analysis, due to the cuts contained in a recent federal spending bill. 
The recently enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” also known as H.R.1, cut federal SNAP benefits, imposed work requirements and passed certain costs on to states. While the cuts have not yet gone into effect, New Mexico officials predict that the state’s 450,000 SNAP recipients will lose at least some benefits and 40,000 people will lose benefits entirely.
New Mexico has the highest percentage of SNAP recipients in the country. 
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) told Source New Mexico this week that the cuts to SNAP will have wide-ranging impacts on not just recipients, but also retailers and farmers, especially in rural areas. He said he knows of a couple of rural grocers that receive more than three-quarters of their income from customers who use SNAP. 
Vasquez warns Republican SNAP cuts will hit rural areas hardest

Back in May, Center for American Progress researchers sought to quantify how many retailers might be in trouble if SNAP cuts went into effect. They determined that more than 27,000 retailers nationwide were at “high risk” of losing significant revenue. 
The authors deemed a particular retailer “high risk” based on two factors: One, if it was in a county with SNAP participation rates in the top 10% of counties; and, two, whether the retailer was one of relatively few in that county. 
The New Mexico Health Care Authority does not maintain its own list of retailers that heavily rely on SNAP, according to spokesperson Marina Pina. Her office also did not immediately respond to Source’s request for comment on the Center for American Progress’ methodology.
However, authority officials recently told lawmakers that they predict retailers across the state will lose $1.3 billion in revenue as a result of the cuts.
According to the center’s data, the “high-risk” retailers lie in 18 counties, mostly in rural areas. The most “high-risk” retailers (154) operate in Doña Ana County, with 125 in San Juan County and 83 in Lea County. 
The “high risk” retailers include 445 convenience stores, 42 farmers markets and 51 grocery stores, along with 267 retailers classified as “other.”

Free.,Trump signs order to change name of Department of Defense to Department of War,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-order-change-name-department-defense-department-war,,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War.Just before Trump signed the order in the Oval Office late Friday afternoon, he and Pete Hegseth, the secretary in charge of the department, who stood next to Trump during the signing, said the renaming reflected their intention to return to a more aggressive mindset for the military.“It's restoring, as you've guided us to, Mr. President, restoring the warrior ethos,” Hegseth said. “The War Department is going to fight decisively, not endless conflicts. It's going to fight to win, not not to lose. We're going to go on offense, not just on defense. Maximum lethality, not tepid legality. Violent effect, not politically correct. We're going to raise up warriors, not just defenders.”A text of the order was not immediately available Friday.Defense Department historyThe Department of War and the Department of the Navy were Cabinet departments from the nation's founding until 1947, when Congress combined them, along with the Department of the Air Force, into a new National Military Establishment. Congress changed that name to the Defense Department two years later.Trump said Friday that renaming 76 years ago revealed a “political correctness” in the military that contributed to poorer results on the battlefield. The U.S. has not won a major war since the reorganization, he said.“We could have won every war, but we really chose to be very politically correct or wokey, and we just fight forever and then, we wouldn't lose, really, we just fight to sort of tie,” he said. “We never wanted to win wars that every one of them we would have won easily with just a couple of little changes or a couple of little edicts.”Congress to be asked to actBecause the department’s name came from an act of Congress, it’s unclear if Trump has the power to rename it with an executive order. The president said Friday he didn’t know if it would be necessary for Congress to be involved, but that he would ask lawmakers to approve the change.“I don't know, but we're going to find out,” he said when asked if Congress would codify the renaming. “But I'm not sure they have to … There's a question as to whether or not they have to, but we'll put it before Congress.”Trump added that the cost of replacing signage and other materials associated with the department would be minimal.Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chair of the Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the department who has often clashed with Trump, including on defense spending, said on social media that the name change was not meaningful without greater financial investment. “If we call it the Dept. of War, we'd better equip the military to actually prevent and win wars,” the former Senate Republican leader wrote. “Can't preserve American primacy if we're unwilling to spend substantially more on our military than Carter or Biden. ‘Peace through strength’ requires investment, not just rebranding.”",,,,2025-09-05 18:57:24.019276

New Mexico is one of eight U.S. states that offer free meals to all public school students regardless of income. (Photo courtesy of the New Mexico Public Education Department)This school year, at least half of all meals served in public schools in New Mexico must be made from scratch using whole, fresh ingredients under a new state Public Education Department rule.
But an informal survey by the department suggests that most schools are not yet meeting the rule, according to an Aug. 6 report by the Legislative Finance Committee. Moving to scratch cooking often requires schools to completely overhaul their kitchens and hire enough staff to run them, the report states.
While New Mexico started offering free school meals to all public school students in fall 2023, those meals weren’t required to meet quality standards until the rule went into effect for this school year, LFC Program Evaluator Ryan Tolman told the interim Legislative Education Study Committee on Friday.
The state allocated $20 million in capital outlay funding for upgrading schools’ outdated kitchens in 2023, but only 14.6% of that money had been spent as of April, with only 10 of 87 projects completed, the report states.
Sen. Anthony Thornton (R-Sandia Park) asked Tolman why more projects haven’t been completed yet. Tolman said a large part of the problem is figuring out a district’s or school’s specific needs.
Meal service can come either from school-based kitchens; central or shared kitchens that deliver to multiple schools; or private food-service management contractors, Tolman said. The food itself can come from large suppliers, the USDA Foods program or local companies, he said.
If a school wasn’t originally built for scratch cooking, it can be difficult to retrofit it with new equipment because there may be a need for more space or other major renovations, Public Education Assistant Secretary Gregory Frostad told the committee.

More than half of Rio Rancho Public Schools’ 15,265 students participated in the universal free lunch program in the 2024 school year, according to legislative analysts.

The rule stems from New Mexico’s 2023 expansion of free, high-quality meals to all public K-12 and charter school students regardless of their families’ income. This year, New Mexico is one of eight states with universal school meal programs, along with California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota and Vermont, the LFC report states.
The department’s survey found that 57% of schools are expanding their training for scratch cooking in response to the new law, according to the report. However, schools tell LFC staff that keeping qualified kitchen staff is a major challenge, especially in rural areas, LFC Program Evaluator Josh Chaffin told the committee.
Staffing in school kitchens dropped as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a challenge, Laura Henry-Hand, deputy director of the department’s Student Success and Wellness Bureau, told the committee.
LFC recommends the department expand technical assistance and training in scratch cooking, food safety and compliance; and develop a statewide monitoring system to track spending, food waste, local food sourcing, scratch cooking, participation rates and students’ academic and health outcomes.
In the year since the law was passed, student participation in free breakfast has risen by 8.3% and free lunch by 8.5%, the report states, especially among students from higher-income families who wouldn’t have previously qualified. The report states there were increases in 68 out of the state’s 89 school districts, including all 10 of the largest ones.
Overall spending on school food programs in the state increased from $165 million in the 2018 school year to $248 million last year, the report states. Most of that comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) program.
Almost every New Mexico school that is eligible for CEP is participating this school year because the new law requires schools to use as much federal money as possible before using state funding, according to the report.
However, the federal government’s changes to the program’s eligibility criteria could shift more costs to New Mexico, with 20 schools losing their status under the program and 60 additional schools losing the full federal reimbursement.
With those federal changes, even if participation rates stay the same, the state is facing a 4% increase in costs totaling $2 million, Henry-Hand said.
The department is asking the Legislature for $42.2 million in recurring funding for the universal school meals program in Fiscal Year 2027, the same amount that lawmakers budgeted this year, Frostad said.
However, the department is asking for $5 million in one-time funding for potential cost overruns, he said. The LFC report notes that Michigan, Colorado and Minnesota each encountered substantial gaps between their projected and actual costs in their first years offering universal school meals.

Until Thursday, ""Wyoming’s Doctor"" had been silent on the CDC’s implosion. 
The post Barrasso joins GOP critics, Democrats in pressing RFK Jr. on vaccines appeared first on WyoFile .","Until Thursday, Wyoming U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a physician and the Senate’s second-ranking Republican, had been silent on the implosion at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
When CDC Director Susan Monarez was fired last week — less than a month after President Donald Trump had appointed her to lead the agency — and several CDC leaders subsequently resigned in protest, Barrasso remained mum. 
Meanwhile, Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, also a physician and chair of the Senate’s health committee, quickly called for “oversight” of the  “high-profile departures.”
Then on Thursday, Barrasso joined the fray when the Senate’s Finance Committee grilled Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on his leadership and approach to vaccine policy. 
“Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines,” Barrasso said. 
“Since then, I’ve grown deeply concerned.”
The comment was notable, as Barrasso has, up until now, avoided criticizing Trump administration appointees and policies.
During a 24-year career as an orthopedic surgeon, Barrasso came to be known as “Wyoming’s Doctor,” often making guest appearances on one of Casper’s local TV news stations. And he’s offered his medical perspectives since becoming a senator, including advocating for use of COVID vaccines in 2020.
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday, Monarez said Kennedy pressured her to resign or “face termination” after she refused to comply with “troubling directives” from Kennedy. That included rubber stamping recommendations of a “vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,” Monarez wrote.
After Kennedy built his reputation and fortune advocating against vaccines, he reassured lawmakers during his confirmation hearings that he would not limit access to vaccines. 
Barrasso backed him at the time. At Thursday’s hearing, Barrasso backed vaccines. 
“Over the last 50 years, vaccines are estimated to have saved 154 million lives worldwide,” Barrasso said. “I support vaccines. I’m a doctor. Vaccines work.”
Barrasso also said the National Institute of Health’s questioning of the use of mRNA vaccines, a national measles outbreak and the loss of leadership at the CDC is eroding public trust. 
“Americans don’t know who to rely on,” Barrasso said. 
He also noted that later this month the CDC’s revamped vaccine panel will meet to discuss childhood recommendations.
“Parents and physicians depend upon this guidance to make decisions and to keep kids safe,” Barrasso said, adding that he’s concerned “safe, proven vaccines, like measles, like Hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy, and that would put Americans at risk and reverse decades of progress.”
Barrasso’s newfound criticism of a Trump appointee did little to impress the Wyoming Democratic Party, which released a statement Friday calling on the congressman to “shove it.”
“John Barrasso is craven, but he’s not stupid,” the party said in a statement. “After all, he is a doctor. He knew exactly who and what he was voting to confirm — he just values his political career more than the lives of his constituents.”
The three-hour-long hearing often grew combative, even boiling over at times into a shouting match between Kennedy and Democratic lawmakers. 
Kennedy told New Hampshire Democrat Sen. Maggie Hassan she was “just making stuff up,” accused Monarez of being a liar, defended his tenure and showed no sign of slowing down on his makeover of the country’s top health agency. 
“We are the sickest country in the world. That’s why we have to fire people at CDC. They did not do their job. This was their job to keep us healthy,” Kennedy said. “And I need to fire some of those people to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
While pointed in their questions, GOP lawmakers stopped short of asking for Kennedy’s resignation. 
Following the hearing, Barrasso was asked by reporters twice if he supports Kennedy, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
“I support the president,” Barrasso responded.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Students across Minnesota walked out of classes Friday to demand greater gun control following the mass shooting at Annunciation Church in south Minneapolis that left two students dead and 21 other people injured.
The walkouts were part of a national demonstration coordinated by Students Demand Action, which formed after the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.
Rayah Tolles, a sophomore at Saint Paul Conservatory for Performing Arts, marched with dozens of her classmates to the Capitol for a rally calling for bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines.
“Sometimes I don’t even want to go to school because I’m afraid of what might happen,” Tolles said.
At Great River School in St. Paul, more than a hundred students filed out of class and into the parking lot carrying signs reading “Protect kids not guns” and “The scariest thing in school should be my grades not guns.”
Bella Carls-Rehovsky, a senior at Great River, said fear drove her to organize the demonstration with her fellow students after learning about the Annunciation shooting.
“Because coming to school every day with the risk of a shooting hanging over our heads is detrimental to everything,” Carls-Rehovsky said.

Carls-Rehovsky said she’s been participating in demonstrations and lobbying efforts for gun control since she was 10 years old, when her cousin died by gunfire. Firearms are now the leading cause of death for children and teens in the United States.
The student walk-outs add to the pressure on Minnesota lawmakers from gun control supporters, city leaders and the parents of victims of the Annunciation shooting to strengthen the state’s gun laws.
Gov. Tim Walz said earlier this week that he will call lawmakers back to St. Paul for a special session to consider gun control legislation including bans on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines. But the chances of such legislation passing seem dim in a closely divided Legislature.
Walz said he would release a package of policy proposals but has yet to do so.
House Republicans released a list of proposals on Thursday should there be a special session, but none involve guns. They include increased funding for school security and mental health treatment as well as reversing the state’s ban on youth conversion therapy, which aims to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
In 2023 and 2024, the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a red flag law, which allows judges to confiscate firearms from people deemed dangerous to themselves or others, and a universal background check requirement. The Legislature also banned bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic guns to fire more rapidly like machine guns, and increased penalties for straw purchasers, or people who buy guns for someone who is prohibited from owning them.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MG_0479-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Individuals can upload their state-issued ID or driver's license to an Apple Wallet (left) or Google Wallet (right). The state of Montana has taken the next step in allowing technologically savvy residents to simplify their wallets — not only can you pay with a single tap, you can also verify your identity. 
Montana’s Motor Vehicle Division announced on Aug. 19 it was beginning to roll out Montana Mobile IDs, allowing Montanans with iPhones, Android devices and Apple watches to securely carry a state-issued ID or driver’s license on the device. Just over a dozen other states have adopted mobile ID technology. 
Columbia Falls Rep. Braxton Mitchell, one of the legislature’s youngest representatives, sponsored House Bill 519 in 2023 to authorize the use of digital driver’s licenses for drivers, to begin Sept. 1, 2025. 
“As a Gen Z lawmaker, I sponsored this bill to give Montanans the option to add their driver’s license to their digital wallet. Digital IDs are extremely secure, encrypted, and harder to fake than a traditional plastic ID,” Mitchell said in a statement. “This is a commonsense step to modernize services by adding IDs to the same place where you can already store your credit cards, insurance cards, flight tickets, and concert tickets, making life more convenient for those who choose to use it.”
Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, speaks on the House floor on Feb. 3, 2025. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)
Mitchell further bolstered the program during the most recent session with legislation that allows businesses to use digital IDs to verify an individual’s age for restricted sales such as alcohol and tobacco, or in gambling establishments. The new law also clarified that businesses cannot store data from an ID, or sell or transfer it to a third party. 
Mitchell told the Daily Montanan in a phone interview that while it’s taken two years for the MVD to get the program up and running, the uptake has been quick, and he’s heard positive feedback from constituents. 
“The first couple of days, they told me they had about 500 people enrolled, and I know they’re into the thousands now, if not the tens of thousands,” Mitchell said on Thursday. “It seems like it’s been a pretty good response without much media outreach about it.”
Representatives from MVD did not respond to requests for comment on the rollout or how many Montanans had verified their digital ID. 
“We have spent the last three years modernizing MVD and improving operating efficiencies and customer service,” MVD Administrator Laurie Bakri said in a press release. “Now that we have overhauled the basics, we are excited to embark on an era of innovation, starting with Montana Mobile IDs and the Montana Mobile ID Verifier for Android and iOS mobile devices.”
 Supporting businesses, ensuring privacy



How to add a Montana mobile ID 

Open your digital wallet (Apple or Google) and Add a new ID. 
Follow the prompts, which include scanning the hard copy of your ID or license.
Montana MVD will only receive the information it needs to approve or deny the request. 
For information on how to add and use an ID in Apple Wallet, including more information about security and privacy, click here.
For information on how to add and use a mobile ID on an Android mobile device click here.



Using the digital ID allows Montanans to provide age verification to participating businesses without sharing additional information such as names or addresses. They can also be used for online verification. 
While the process is in place for any individual to add a mobile ID to their mobile wallets, the uptake on the business side might take more time before becoming widespread. 
The state also launched its own verification app as a tool for businesses to accept mobile IDs and verify an individual’s age as 18+ or 21+, but there isn’t a requirement for businesses to utilize it. 
“The division has guided the alcohol and cannabis industries through our website, in-person meetings over the past few months, and direct push notifications to those who have signed up to receive updates from the department,” Cannabis & Alcohol Regulation Division Administrator Kristan Barbour told the Daily Montanan. 
Barbour said in the first few days of the roll out, the division had not received any feedback from businesses about the program. 
Establishments that sell age-restricted items, such as alcohol, can use the Montana Mobile ID Verifier app, or other approved electronic readers, but the decision to accept mobile IDs is on a business-by-business basis, so Montanans might not be able to use them at their local brewery or grocery store yet. 
The Montana Gambling Control Division also endorsed the state’s companion verification app for any gambling establishments.
“It’s secure and easy to use, which will make it a great addition to the services establishments already offer their customers,” Gambling Control Division Administrator Alex Sterhan said in a press release.
The Motor Vehicle Division said that Montanans should still carry a hard-copy of their ID or driver’s license with them for verification purposes, as adoption of the technology continues growing. 
The Montana Highway Patrol anticipates having the ability to verify mobile IDs before the end of the year, according to a press release, but representatives with MHP did not respond to questions from the Daily Montanan about a timeline for adoption. 
Mitchell said he and other colleagues in the Legislature who focus on digital privacy have continued to look at how to ensure Montanan’s are secure when using this new technology. 
One additional bill passed in 2025, Senate Bill 124, sponsored by Sen. Ken Bogner, R-Miles City, clarifies that if an individual hands a law enforcement officer their phone as their identification, that does not mean they consent to having their device searched. 
Bogner said in a press statement that digital IDs are a great tool for individuals worried about losing their physical ID. 
“If you are worried about losing your license or having it stolen and winding up in the wrong hands, this is for you,” Bogner said. “This gives Montanans the option to securely carry their encrypted ID on their devices, protecting personal information and limiting data exposure through lost or stolen physical credentials.”
 Montana to ‘set the tone for other states’

As mobile IDs become more widespread nationwide, the federal government is also transitioning various agencies to be able to utilize the technology. 
The TSA has announced it accepts digital IDs issued from 16 states and Puerto Rico, including Montana Mobile IDs in a Google or Apple wallet.
In Montana, mobile IDs can be used at the state’s largest airports — Billings, Bozeman, Glacier Park, Great Falls, Helena, and Missoula — but TSA states all passengers should also carry an acceptable physical ID.
Mitchell told the Daily Montanan that over the last week, he’s heard from businesses and individuals across the state curious how the program will work, but that “the vast majority is very excited about it.”
“You can’t fake this ID. You can’t use a screen shot. It’s a live, encoded verification process,” Mitchell said, pointing out that it could be particularly beneficial in college towns to verify the ages of younger adults. 
He added that he expects Montana to continue to be a leader on modernizing its code and integrating new technology. 
“We’re one of the first states to do the whole process of rolling this out,” Mitchell said. “I think we’re definitely going to set the tone for other states to follow.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-12.17.44 PM-1024x488.png,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Burlington’s police union and the mayor signed a three-year contract this week expected to help address longstanding hiring and retention issues and make the city’s police department a more attractive place to work.
“I think we secured some benefits that are incredibly important, both for recruitment and retention,” said Joseph Corrow, president of the Burlington Police Officers’ Association.
The 76-page contract signed Wednesday increases the base salary over a 15-step salary scale that ranges from $88,400 to $114,979. It adds retention bonuses after 5, 10, 15 and 20 years of service and stipends for full time police officers who are on call.
It also increases benefits like life insurance, pensionable overtime, and allows up to eight years of pension buy-in for lateral hires.
These are big wins, Corrow said, because it will allow certified officers from other police departments to transfer more easily to Burlington, allow a portion of their overtime pay to go toward their pensions, and be able to buy back years in the pension system instead of having to start from scratch. For lateral hires, officers would be able to come into the department at the stepped salary depending on their years of experience.
Union members called it a strong contract that will help rebuild morale and staffing in the department, Corrow said.
“I am encouraged by the agreement, as it signals strong support for policing in Burlington and provides the salary and benefits package necessary to retain and recruit the best,” Interim Chief of Police Shawn Burke said in an emailed statement.
The department currently has 61 officers and eight vacancies, he said.
Policing Burlington is “both complex and demanding,” said Burke, who stepped in to fill the post vacated by Jon Murad in March. Murad led the department for five years and recently became the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections.
An internal anonymous survey of rank-and-file officers conducted by the police union last summer showed a department struggling with both recruitment and retention issues, with 75% of officers surveyed calling morale “poor” or “terrible.”
This contract aims to fix some of those issues and positions Burlington as one of the most competitive police departments statewide, Corrow said. 
“It makes us stand out at the top,” he said.
The contract comes a week after the City Council passed measures pertaining to City Hall Park amid continued debate about public safety enforcement downtown. 
Contract negotiations ended in July and the terms were agreed upon and unanimously approved last month by the Burlington City Council.
The mayor and members of the council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

,California,2025-09-05 21:36:08+00:00,CalMatters,A California city tried to ban homeless shelters. It’s giving up after Newsom’s lawsuit,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/09/nowalk-newsom-homeless-shelter/,Norwalk backed down from its ban on homeless shelters after Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Southern California city. A Los Angeles judge must approve the settlement.,"In summary
Norwalk backed down from its ban on homeless shelters after Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Southern California city. A Los Angeles judge must approve the settlement.


In a win for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, a newly inked courtroom deal would force the Southern California city of Norwalk to reverse its citywide ban on homeless shelters.
The legal settlement marks the end of a year-long battle between the governor and the city in Los Angeles County. If a judge in Los Angeles Superior Court approves the deal, Norwalk also will have to put $250,000 toward the development of new affordable housing in the city.
The fight started when Norwalk approved a ban on emergency shelters, supportive housing and several businesses that predominantly serve low-income residents, such asg liquor stores, discount stores, laundromats and payday loan establishments. In response, Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta sued the city in November. 
Newsom today called the city’s refusal to support housing for its homeless residents “inexcusable.”
“No community should turn its back on its residents in need – especially while there are people in your community sleeping on the streets,” he said in a statement. “No city is exempt from doing their part to solve the homelessness crisis.”
A spokesperson for Norwalk did not provide a comment on the lawsuit by CalMatters’ deadline. 
In a memo to council members last year, city staff wrote that shelters and homeless housing could have “detrimental effects” on the community, potentially causing “over proliferation,” noise and economic impacts, and harming property maintenance and security. Then-Mayor Margarita Rios previously told CalMatters the city passed the moratorium after frustrations mounted over a state-funded Project Roomkey hotel that housed homeless residents during the pandemic. 
The ban also blocked Los Angeles County’s plans to turn a hotel in Norwalk into homeless housing.
Newsom’s administration has made a recent effort to ramp up enforcement against cities it says are not doing their share to combat the state’s affordable housing crisis. Last year, the administration settled a lawsuit against Elk Grove in Sacramento County over the city’s denial of a housing project and got a court order forcing Huntington Beach in Orange County to follow state housing law. Newsom launched a Housing Accountability Unit in 2021 to hold cities to goals mandated in state housing plans.
“If any city or county wants to test our resolve, today’s settlement is your answer,” Bonta said in a statement about the Norwalk case. “All of us have a legal and moral responsibility to help — not hurt — those struggling to keep a roof over their heads or lacking housing altogether.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425-Redistricting-Rally-TS-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in Kansas' congressional delegation, objects to altering boundaries so GOP is more likely to beat her in 2026.","U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas shown here in Abilene in 2023, is opposed to the Kansas Legislature complying with President Donald Trump's request to redraw the state's four U.S. House districts to make it easier for a Republican candidate to win her seat in Congress in the 2026 election. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids objected Friday to being targeted by Republicans eager to adopt a new congressional map for Kansas that divided Johnson County and further gerrymandered the state’s four districts.
A special session of the Kansas Legislature to consider changes advocated by President Donald Trump could follow the playbook used in Texas and Missouri. In both states, the GOP has moved to undermine Democratic strongholds to bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House. In response, California and other states have expressed interest in altering district boundaries to favor Democrats.
“Politicians are once again focused on political games to benefit themselves and their extreme agenda, not hardworking Kansans,” Davids said. “Voters should pick their representatives, not the other way around, and this unprecedented step would only further polarize this country and harm our democracy.”
Davids was elected to the 3rd District seat in 2018 and earned reelection three times. Ahead of the 2022 election, the Legislature removed the northern half of Wyandotte County from her district and added a cluster of rural counties to improve the odds for Republican candidates. For the second time, Davids defeated GOP nominee Amanda Adkins while increasing her margin of victory over the 2020 result.
“I ran for Congress to serve the people of Kansas, and if this moves forward, every option will remain on the table to make sure Kansans’ voices are heard,” Davids said.
Trump urged states to manipulate congressional boundaries ahead of the 2026 midterm in an attempt to pad the thin GOP majority in the U.S. House.
In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill designed to create five additional right-leaning districts at the expense of Democrats. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is spearheading a plan to place five GOP districts in hands of Democrats. A map under review by Missouri lawmakers would shift a Kansas City area district to the right.
A comparable effort by legislative leaders in Kansas to weaken Davids’ prospects of winning in 2026 would likely involve undercutting the electoral influence of Johnson County voters. Splitting the county between two congressional districts and blending those areas with large contingents of Republicans would make it more difficult for Davids to prevail.
Johnson County has recently favored Democrats, including Davids and Gov. Laura Kelly. In 2022, Kelly won reelection with 49.5% of the statewide vote, but benefitted from a 59% margin in Johnson County. Secretary of state candidate Jeanna Repass and attorney general candidate Chris Mann, both Democrats, carried Johnson County in 2022, but lost those races when the statewide vote was tallied.
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said gerrymandering had been a reality in politics throughout his life.
“Most of the blue states are gerrymandered to the point that … I don’t know what else they could do to change the ratio,” he said. “The Democrats have always led in this gerrymandering.”
 
The GOP quest in ’26
Former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor in 2026, said the Legislature ought to promptly redraw congressional boundaries to favor Republicans. It would demonstrate the state’s political support for Trump, he said.
“National Democrats have gerrymandered Congress to make it more liberal than the real America,” Colyer said. “Kansas needs to lead the way in restoring sanity to our federal government.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who is among more than a half dozen GOP candidates for governor, said a special session devoted to redistricting the state’s congressional districts was under discussion.

“I am actively engaged in the battle for the heart and soul of America, helping the president to Make America Great Again,” he said.
Three years ago, there was an effort by Masterson and other legislators to hold Johnson County together as a community of interest as Kansas last overhauled congressional maps based on 2020 Census data.
He said the obligation was to divide the state’s population into four equal quadrants. That was done, he said, ahead of the 2022 election in a way that maintained Johnson County as the core of the 3rd District.
“We don’t draw the maps on voters,” Masterson said at that time. “We draw the map on residents.”
Masterson also issued a statement that said the Legislature’s mapping resulted in “compact and contiguous districts,” and it “preserves existing district cores and groups together communities of interest.”
In 2022, Kelly vetoed the congressional map adopted by the Legislature because she disagreed with moving half of Wyandotte County out of Davids’ district. The Legislature voted to override her. Lawsuits were filed to prevent implementation of the new congressional map as plaintiffs argued racial gerrymandering was illegal.
A district court judge agreed with the plaintiffs, but the Kansas Supreme Court reversed the lower court and affirmed the constitutionality of the new congressional map.




 ‘Pandering to extremists’

House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, said interest among Republican candidates for governor to subvert the will of Kansas voters through redistricting was about landing Trump’s endorsement.
“The push for congressional redistricting is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to gain Trump’s favor and advance personal political ambitions,” Woodard said. “With so many Republican candidates now vying for governor, it’s clear that the race has become a contest to win Donald Trump’s endorsement.”
He said supporters of redistricting in Kansas were “pandering to extremists in Washington, D.C.”
In Kansas, Republicans hold supermajorities over Democrats in the House and Senate. Redrawn maps targeting Davids would likely be vetoed by Kelly. The question would be whether GOP leadership in the House and Senate could control their partisan advantage to deliver two-thirds majorities to override the governor again.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes of Lenexa said Kansas traditionally reapportioned state and federal districts on a 10-year cycle. She said it was wrong to diverge from that principled process.
“When those in power, regardless of which side of the aisle they are on, use their position of power to silence others and only increase their own power, we all lose,” Sykes said.
Sykes said GOP changes to Kansas’ congressional map could mean the votes of thousands of people no longer had an influence on the outcome of U.S. House races.
“There is no wonder why so many Americans have lost faith in their government,” she said. “They lose faith when politicians use the power of an office to take power away from where it belongs — in the hands of the people.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sharice-Davids-in-abilene-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Memorial Blood Centers reported a 44% increase in blood donations in the week following the Aug. 27 mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church which left two children dead and 21 others injured.
Memorial Blood Centers, which services several local hospitals, provided over 250 units of blood platelets and plasma to Children’s Minnesota, M Health Fairview, Hennepin Healthcare, and North Memorial Health for treating victims from the Annunciation shooting and other shootings last week, according to spokesperson Corey Bianchi-Rossi.
Blood donations at this point may not go to the victims directly, but a constant supply of donations helps prepare for any future tragedies, as well as provide for the routine need for blood transfusions in surgeries or illnesses, the spokesperson said.
“The reason we were able to supply the hospitals that needed the blood to help their patients, the victims, is because of the people who donated the week prior,” Bianchi-Rossi said.
Before the Annunciation shooting, blood donation organizations had declared a “blood emergency”, when the state’s blood supply dropped to below a two-day inventory — far below the ideal seven-day inventory. A lower supply of blood is to be expected in the summer months, when accidents increase and regular donors might be traveling. As of Tuesday, the blood supply is back up to a four-day inventory, Bianchi-Rossi said, and will likely trend upward in the coming days.
Memorial Blood Centers has seen more than a 400% increase in appointments made since the shooting. Last week, that resulted in an additional 931 transfusable units over the average weekly donation of 2100 units. On Wednesday, spots were nearly filled at a blood drive held at Annunciation Church, which normally hosts a blood drive four times a year.
A larger than usual portion of the donations came from first-timer donors. Typically during this time of year, only 11% of donations are made by first-time donors, compared to 24% since the day of the Annunciation shooting.
The American Red Cross, which also has local blood donation centers, was not asked by the city or hospitals to provide blood in response to the shootings, said spokesperson Nate Russell.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250903_0068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

Free.,"Federal judge blocks Noem from ending temporary  protections for Venezuelans, Haitians",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-blocks-noem-ending-temporary-protections-venezuelans-haitians,,"WASHINGTON — A San Francisco federal court Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary protections for hundreds of thousands of nationals from Venezuela and Haiti.The decision from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California comes as the Department of Homeland Security Friday filed a notice ending Temporary Protected Status by Nov. 7 for a group of 250,000 Venezuelans who were granted deportation protections in 2021 by President Donald Trump. Chen found that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision to undo extended protections for Venezuelans was baseless and preordained for the “purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela’s TPS.”“DHS began drafting the decision to vacate within days after President Trump began his second administration,” Chen said. “There is no indication that the Secretary or DHS consulted any other government agencies or conducted an internal evaluation as part of this process.” Chen said Noem’s decision to end TPS for Haiti “was not materially different from that carried out for Venezuela.” DHS to appealIn a statement to States Newsroom, a DHS spokesperson said the agency will appeal the decision.""While this order delays justice, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,” the spokesperson said.Former President Joe Biden granted TPS holders from Venezuela protections until October 2026 and protections until February 2026 for holders from Haiti. In Friday’s decision, the judge said decisions on TPS have been carefully considered in the past. “For 35 years, the TPS statute has been faithfully executed by presidential administrations from both parties, affording relief based on the best available information obtained by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) in consultation with the State Department and other agencies, a process that involves careful study and analysis. Until now,” Chen said. TPS is granted when a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to, for reasons such as violence, political instability or extreme natural disasters. The Trump administration has moved to end that status, which protects immigrants from deportation and grants work permits, as it aims to limit legal pathways in its immigration crackdown. Trump tried to end TPS for Haiti during his first term, but was blocked by the courts.“This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,” said Chen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.900,000 people with legal protectionsMore than 600,000 Venezuelans have TPS after arriving in the United States in 2021 and 2023. More than 300,000 Haitians have TPS, which was granted after a catastrophic earthquake in 2010.Chen said that while the Supreme Court in May allowed the Trump administration to continue with removing protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, he argued the justices did not make a decision on the merits of the case.“The Supreme Court’s order did not bar this Court from adjudicating the case on the merits and entering a final judgement issuing relief under… the (Administrative Procedure Act),” Chen wrote. An appeals court last week ruled in a separate but related case regarding TPS for Venezuelans that deemed the Trump administration likely acted unlawfully in ending the protected status for those immigrants.",,,,2025-09-05 17:57:27.028013

“We may need to ask policy committees to review existing programs to see if there are any that can be scaled back or may no longer be the priority they once were,” the House Appropriations Committee's bipartisan leaders wrote.

Leaders of Vermont’s House Appropriations Committee have warned colleagues that next year’s state budget-building process could be among the most difficult in recent memory — potentially forcing some existing programs onto the chopping block — as lawmakers grapple with sweeping federal funding cuts in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law.
“We expect the upcoming state budget cycle to present a number of challenges that most of us have not experienced as legislators before due to uncertainty in the economic forecast and changes in the federal budget,” wrote Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, and Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, in a memo to the full House last month. Scheu is the committee’s chair; Harrison is its vice chair.
Moreover, the leaders of the powerful budget-writing panel wrote, “We may need to ask policy committees to review existing programs to see if there are any that can be scaled back or may no longer be the priority they once were.”
The House’s “policy committees” focus on specific areas of law, such as education, health care or transportation. The Appropriations Committee, which oversees state spending, and the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax policy, are known as the chamber’s two “money committees.”
The memo, which was shared with VTDigger, was part of an email House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, sent to all 150 House members on Aug. 11. Krowinski’s email included a handful of other summertime updates for her colleagues, who adjourned their 2025 session in mid-June and are slated to come back to the Statehouse for the 2026 session in January. 
Harrison described the intent of his and Scheu’s message during a panel of top Vermont Republican leaders Thursday night in Ludlow. 
“One, the message was, don’t think of new ways to spend the money, even though there are a lot of them,” he said. “And two, we need you to start thinking about, what are the programs that we have that may have been a good idea and served a good purpose 20 years ago, but maybe aren’t as important today as something else — like health care.”
Citing projections economists shared with legislative leaders and Gov. Phil Scott in late July, Scheu and Harrison wrote that state revenues are expected to increase by about $61 million during the state’s 2027 fiscal year. That’s the time period, running from July 2026 to June 2027, for which lawmakers will be creating a new state budget starting in January. 
While that revenue upgrade is good news, Scheu and Harrison wrote, it won’t be enough to cover projected increases in salaries and benefits for state employees and “a myriad of other fixed costs,” they wrote, meaning “we can probably expect some adjustments to programs and services” to make up the difference. 
The economists also cautioned that their projections could need to be revisited because of uncertainty over the impacts of both the GOP-led federal spending package and Trump’s tariffs. 
“Don’t get comfortable,” Tom Kavet, one of the state’s economists, said in July. 
It’s unlikely, however, that the full Legislature will need to meet again this year to respond to losses in federal funding, Scheu and Harrison wrote. That’s because many of the changes included in Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” do not take effect until 2026, or later, the legislators said. That includes certain cuts to Medicaid and access to federal nutritional assistance, among others. 
Lawmakers added several measures into the state budget bill for the current fiscal year, which they approved in May, that would trigger a special legislative session if federal funding cuts reached certain thresholds. But those thresholds are unlikely to be hit just yet, according to Scheu and Harrison.
Before legislators start work on the state budget next year, they will first get a proposed spending plan from the Scott administration. In an email Friday, Scott’s press secretary, Amanda Wheeler, said the administration was still too early in its budget development process to say whether any existing state programs might see significant cuts.
“We’ll review all funding impacts and deliver a balanced budget to the Legislature in January,” she said.

Youngblut’s appearance Friday afternoon was the first court hearing since prosecutors filed upgraded charges last month against the former Seattle resident, which carry the possibility of the death penalty.

BURLINGTON — Teresa Youngblut pleaded not guilty Friday to federal criminal charges that could carry the death penalty in the fatal shooting of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont. 
The hearing in federal court in Burlington was the first since prosecutors obtained an indictment with upgraded charges last month and filed notice that they will seek Youngblut’s execution, if convicted, of the capital crimes.  
Youngblut, a 21-year-old former Seattle resident, had initially been charged earlier this year with federal firearms and assault charges in connection with a traffic stop that led to the fatal shooting of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland on Interstate 91 in Coventry on the afternoon of Jan. 20. 
The latest indictment charges Youngblut with murdering Maland’s and assaulting two other agents with a deadly weapon. 
Youngblut remains held without bail following Friday’s hearing.
Prosecutors alleged in charging documents that after the traffic stop on I-91, Youngblut exited the Toyota Prius that had been pulled over and opened fire, resulting in a shootout with law enforcement. 
Maland, 44, of Newport, was killed in the exchange of gunfire, court documents stated, as was Felix Bauckholt, a German national and a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving.
Youngblut and Bauckholt had been linked to a loosely connected group of people known as the Zizians, whose members have been tied to at least six other homicides across the country, including a landlord in California and a couple in Pennsylvania.  
Federal capital charges were being considered by prosecutors in Youngblut’s case for some time, with U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi signaling shortly after taking office in February that she would be pushing for the charges as well.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his inauguration day Jan. 20 — the same day as Maland’s fatal shooting — lifting a moratorium on the federal death penalty that had been put in place during the Biden administration.
Bondi, in a later directive to federal prosecutors across the country, specifically cited Maland’s death as a case where capital charges would be warranted.
Vermont has not carried out an execution since 1954 and the state no longer has the death penalty, but Youngblut was charged in federal court, where capital punishment remains an option.

Hunger Mountain Co-op in Montpelier has purchased the neighboring property of rK Miles, a lumberyard that was damaged in a 2023 fire, as part of an expansion plan.  
The co-op purchased the 1.6-acre property for $487,500, according to a press release. Co-op leaders plan to use the lot to expand its capacity for parking, storage and other operational needs. 
“This purchase is a key part of our long-term vision to deepen the Co-op’s values of health, sustainability, and cooperation,” general manager Mary Mullally said in the press release. “Back in 2012, we anticipated a need for more parking and retail space. This agreement allows us to explore those options while continuing to serve our vibrant community.” 
The co-op sits along Stone Cutters Way, a one-way street parallel to the Winooski River. Its customer parking lot is located on the northwest side of the building, while the new purchase adjoins the co-op building to the southeast. 
The exterior of an 8,000-square foot building on the former rK Miles property still has fire damage that will need to be addressed before it can be used for storage, Mullally said in a phone interview. The property will allow the co-op to buy in larger quantities, and it should also be “relatively easy” to set up staff parking on the site as an initial goal, she said. 
But the press release and website for the project seem to anticipate concerns from members. In its “frequently asked questions” section, the co-op addressed the timing of the purchase with the recent ratification of a union contract with UE 255, the union that represents co-op employees. 
According to the website, the timing was a coincidence, and the purchase should not affect salaries because money used for the purchase is from reserve funds rather than the operating budget. The union did not respond to a request for comment before publication time. 
The FAQs also addressed why the purchase negotiation was not shared with members. It was instead left to a smaller council vote. 
“We began exploring the possibility seriously in the fall of 2024, after the property’s owner expressed interest in selling,” the co-op wrote on the website. “At that point, we followed standard fiduciary and governance practices by conducting due diligence in private. This included reviewing financial terms, legal considerations, environmental assessments, and potential risks.”
Mullally said the co-op published the FAQ section to “provide as much information as possible.” So far, the feedback received has been “extremely positive,” she said. 
The co-op has its annual meeting planned for Sept. 13. Members are welcome to bring their questions about the future of the property to the meeting, Mullally said. 
In the long term, the co-op has floated ideas for the property: Expanded retail space, community gardens, housing. But the co-op may need further assessments to determine if environmental remediation is needed, it wrote on the website. The co-op is also creating a flood risk management plan. 
Mullally said it has been “a long process,” but she’s happy it’s come to completion. 
“I’m so excited about what this means to the co-op’s future,” she said.

Advocates want CT to do the same.","Connected elected officials and disability rights organizations this week called on Gov. Ned Lamont to take action on the state’s vaccine eligibility guidelines amid uncertainty over federal vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership.
Over the past week, some states have made early moves to take control of vaccine guidance.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey this week directed the state Department of Public Health to authorize pharmacists to administer the new COVID vaccine to anyone 5 years of age or older, despite recent changes to eligibility from the FDA. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Friday issued a similar directive. 
In late August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved new COVID-19 vaccines for the fall, but only for people 65 and older and those who are at high-risk for severe disease. Previously, the vaccines were available to anyone 6 months or older. The move was significant because federal vaccine guidelines determine both the availability of vaccines and coverage by insurers.
Attorneys with Disability Rights CT and the CT Council on Developmental Disabilities sent a letter to Lamont on Friday requesting that he issue state guidance with broader eligibility standards. 
“We urge you to follow the lead of Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey and adopt and publicize a broader standard eliminating the need to prove such a condition and requiring all insurance plans to continue to cover vaccinations outside of the [Centers for Disease Control] guidelines,” the attorneys stated in the letter. They also noted that the Association of Massachusetts Health Plans had agreed to continue providing coverage for the shots.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Lamont, said the state “will be preparing what we must to ensure no one’s health is jeopardized in Connecticut.” However, the statement did not address the request from the disabilities rights organizations or the current availability of vaccines for those younger than 65 without underlying health conditions. 
As of Friday morning, the availability of vaccines in Connecticut was still in flux. 
Western state governors are working regionally to issue public health guidance. On Wednesday, a handful of governors announced the creation of the West Coast Health Alliance “to uphold scientific integrity in public health as Trump destroys CDC’s credibility,” according to a statement from Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. Oregon, Washington and Hawaii are also part of the coalition.
In a statement issued the following day, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, and Senate President Pro Tempore Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, called on northeastern states to follow suit, while acknowledging that some level of coordination is already happening. 
“The West Coast Health Alliance also comes amid reports that Connecticut was one of eight states to send public health officials to a recent meeting about forming their own regional alliance. Such an effort would allow states to make health recommendations and guidance directly to the public. Sens. Looney and Duff encouraged Connecticut officials to pursue these partnerships,” the statement read.
Brittany Schaefer, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Public Health, confirmed that Commissioner Manisha Juthani and other staff attended a regional meeting of public health officials last month that allowed the states to share strategies “at a time of federal health restructuring and cuts.”
“CT has regularly collaborated with neighboring states as public health challenges extend beyond state lines and those conversations have ramped up in recent months following recent federal health changes,” Schaefer said when asked about the statement from Senators Duff and Looney.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25247536418606-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The four detainees who escaped an immigrant jail in Newark earlier this summer have been caught and now face up to a year imprisonment and $100,000 fines each, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for New Jersey announced Friday.
The last of the escapees, Andres Felipe Pineda Mogollon, 25, of Colombia, appeared in federal court on Aug. 18, the office announced.
Mogollon, along with Franklin Norberto Bautista Reyes, 20, of Honduras; Joan Sebastian Castaneda Lozada, 18, of Colombia; and Joel Enrrique Sandoval-Lopez, 22, of Honduras, escaped Delaney Hall in Newark on June 12 by busting through a second-story aluminum wall, dropping mattresses through the opening to soften their landing, and hurdling jail fences by using bed sheets to cover the barbed wire.
The four were apprehended within a week of their escape — Mogollon in Los Angeles on July 17, and the other three in New Jersey on June 15 and 16, according to the office.
The 1,100-bed immigrant jail — the first to open under President Donald Trump’s second term — is owned and operated by the private prison company Geo Group under a 15-year contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
It has drawn protests since it opened in May, with New Jersey’s two senators saying the escape proved the facility is in “shoddy” shape and should be evacuated.
It was also the site of a May 9 scuffle between visiting politicians and jail security that fueled complaints that acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is using her position to attack political foes. During that fracas, officers arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Habba later secured an indictment of Rep. LaMonica McIver, after accusing her of assaulting officers outside the jail. Baraka and McIver are Democrats.
Baraka’s charges were quickly dropped, while McIver’s case remains ongoing.

SPRINGFIELD — The 36-year-old man who was shot to death by police last month appears to have gotten caught up in an operation that was targeting another man for arrest, according to people who were at the address when the shooting occurred.
Police claim that, on the evening of Aug. 21, James Crary was in a vehicle when he allegedly “accelerated toward officers” who were “outside their vehicles” during a police response at 78 Valley St. Officers then opened fire, striking Crary multiple times. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Vermont State Police said in a press release.
The circumstances of Crary’s death are now under investigation by the Vermont State Police, which was not involved in the “underlying operation” that led to the shooting. The two police officers who fired their weapons — Springfield police officer Vincent Franchi and Windsor County Sheriff’s deputy Bryan Jalava — have been placed on paid leave and are cooperating with the investigation, according to police.
In interviews, people who said they were present at the time of the shooting described the aftermath.
“The police said, ‘We weren’t even here for James Crary,’” said Khristal Blanchard, a resident at 78 Valley St., who witnessed part of the incident.
According to Blanchard, police told her they had come to apprehend a suspect in a “hostage and kidnapping situation” earlier that day in Springfield.
Springfield police and Windsor sheriff deputies — officials have not disclosed how many — responded to the Valley Street address shortly before 9:30 p.m. on Aug. 21 “as part of an open investigation,” Vermont State Police said in the release. When they arrived, “they encountered a man” — later identified as Crary — “in a vehicle outside the home.”
Police then opened fire at Crary. The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington conducted an autopsy and concluded Crary died from “gunshot wounds to the head,” according to Vermont State Police.
Investigators are reviewing cruiser and body cam video footage of the incident, including “third party” video of the incident, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman.
Springfield Police Chief Jeffrey Burnham referred questions about the police operation and shooting to state police.

Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer said his department’s deputies were at 78 Valley St. that evening to “help Springfield arrest a suspect on a pretty serious charge.” 
Following the shooting, police apprehended the suspect, who was inside the house, and charged him with assaulting and robbing $300 from a Springfield man whom police say held against his will at a nearby apartment, according to court documents. 
‘I didn’t even know the cops were here’
Crary most recently had been living in Newport, New Hampshire, and authorities have not said why he was in Springfield the night of the shooting. People who were at the address that evening said Crary had come to check up on a female friend who was there.
“It was a pop-in visit,” said Randi Sargent, who was among a group watching a movie in the garage space when Crary had appeared at the door.
He stayed for a little while and “had just said goodbye and left,” Sargent said. Shortly afterward she heard four gunshots.
“I thought it was someone shooting at the house,” she said.
Blanchard said she briefly chatted with Crary in the driveway and then went back up to her room on the second floor of the house.
“I didn’t even know the cops were here,” Blanchard said.
When she got to her room, she heard gunshots and looked outside the window over the driveway.
“I saw James’ head go down and hit the steering wheel,” Blanchard said. “The car started to roll back and was smoking.”
She said she started to scream, and two people with her in the room pulled her away from the window.
Both Sargent and Blanchard said they heard a total of four shots.

Sargent pointed out bullet holes in the wall of the converted garage used as a lounge space that she said came from the police gunfire.
Several people were sitting on the sofa watching the movie when bullets pierced the wall, which barely missed her boyfriend sitting at the end, Sargent said. When they heard the shots, one in the group shut the door to the room.
“We laid on the floor over here and we barricaded the door until (the police) told us to open it,” Sargent said.
Blanchard said after the shooting she heard police yelling to “come down with your hands up” and the people upstairs — including the intended suspect — all came down.
Blanchard said she remonstrated the officers over the shooting: “What was this all about? Like, are you serious? Was this really called for?”
Blanchard said one of the officers responded: “This was not what we meant to happen. We’re so sorry for your loss. We weren’t here for (Crary).” 
Crary’s body lay covered in the driveway for more than 12 hours before it was taken to the medical examiner’s office in Burlington, according to people at the house.
Shooting victim leaves behind a daughter
Kristin Crary said her brother grew up alternating between his mother’s in Claremont and at their father’s in Canaan. He attended Mascoma Valley High School and often had jobs waxing and stripping floors.
Julie Morse, who knew Crary when they grew up together in Claremont and had been his friend for 20 years, said he “would never purposefully been out to hurt anybody ever.”
Morse said Crary liked buffing the floors of Hannaford and Market Basket on the overnight shift because “he could be left alone independently.”
Crary left behind a 10-year-old daughter who “meant a lot to him,” Morse said.
The day after the shooting occurred, Morse went to 78 Valley St. to talk with neighbors and people there about how events had unfolded. She said she suspects that Crary was trying to pull out of the driveway when he became “startled” by the large police contingent that had come to arrest Hewitt.
“James was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” she said.

The organization’s annual free dental clinic opens at 6 a.m., but people will line up early, waiting to receive cleanings, procedures and other services the volunteer clinicians and aids can provide.
This year, University of Iowa dental faculty and students will join Iowa Mission of Mercy (IMOM) volunteers to provide free dental care to anyone in need during the two-day clinic, which is coming to Coralville for the first time.
Brendan Young, a University of Iowa associate professor of dentistry and director of behavioral science who has volunteered with IMOM for four years, said he met one woman who said she relies on the annual clinic, which stops in a different area of Iowa each year, for all of her oral health care.
“I think the lines sort of indicate there is a real need, and people are really grateful for the opportunity to get that need met,” Young said. “And so, coming in, they’re in a pretty good mood, and certainly when they leave, there’s a great deal of relief and a great deal of gratitude.”

The 100-bed clinic will open at 6 a.m. on Sept. 19 and 20 at Hyatt Regency Coralville Hotel and Conference Center, according to a news release from Iowa Mission of Mercy, and will remain open each day until the clinic reaches capacity.
IMOM has been operating the free clinic since 2008, according to its website, and has served more than 18,000 patients. UI Clinical Associate Professor of Oral Pathology, Radiology, and Medicine Carrie McKnight said she’s volunteered with IMOM for nearly 10 years, and each clinic provides approximately $1 million in services for patients.
In Coralville, however, McKnight said she expects to surpass that number.
Anyone, regardless of their age, insurance, income or where they call home, is welcome to come by the clinic for oral health care, including cleaning, fillings, root canals, exams and more, McKnight said. Participants will also receive information and materials to address dental needs at home.
When it comes to dental care, Young said people can experience a variety of barriers to getting their needs met. A primary block is the cost of care, he said, but fear and shame can keep folks from visiting a dentist consistently, or at all. People often are afraid of pain, of needing their teeth pulled and of having visible dental issues like missing teeth or bleeding gums which are stigmatized in the U.S.
Young said oral health can even impact someone’s relationships, employability and other areas of life.

“People feel really self conscious about their teeth, and going to see a dentist when you’ve got poor oral health — it can really serve as a barrier,” Young said. “And so we make a real effort at IMOM to be super nonjudgmental. Come as you are — we will meet you where you are.”
Young said a lot of work goes into organizing the clinics, from finding the right space, to setting up equipment and ensuring the infrastructure is there to support it. In addition to dental clinicians and students volunteering to help run the event, he said other volunteers help with things like onsite child care and more. Local plumbers will even donate their time to install temporary water lines and ensure they run properly.
McKnight said a “contingent” of dental students are always on board to work the clinic, but this year there was an outpouring of support from students, faculty and community dentists. UI dental students get to work with real patients at the university during their education as well, she said, and showing them their ability to help those in need is a “key component” of their education.
While a more dour mood might be expected at a dental clinic, Young said participants are generally happy to have the resource available and grateful to receive expert care.
McKnight said the clinic can’t solve all of the problems some patients have, and staff often have to cut off the line when they reach capacity, but Young said many people leave the clinic in less pain than when they came in.
“There is a lot of gratitude for what we do,” McKnight said. “So it certainly fills our cup to be able to help them.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Well before he canceled and skipped meetings with the state’s top school board in recent weeks, state Superintendent Ryan Walters has been chronically absent from multiple state boards where he holds a seat, including one he’s supposed to lead.
Public meeting records show poor attendance from Walters, particularly this year, on various governing boards whose votes impact K-12 school funding, vocational learning centers, higher education and other state government matters.
This year, Walters has attended only one meeting of the state Board of Career and Technology Education despite being its chair, Oklahoma Voice found through an analysis of meeting minutes. He skipped the CareerTech board’s six other meetings in 2025, including three that took place in a room adjacent to his office at the Oklahoma State Department of Education. 
Oklahoma CareerTech Director Brent Haken, a non-voting member of the board, has led the meetings in Walters’ place. In 2024, Walters attended six meetings and missed four, and in 2023, he attended seven and was absent for four, meeting minutes show.
Haken said Walters’ presence, or lack thereof, has had no impact on the board and the CareerTech agency, which oversee vocational education centers across the state.
“Actually I enjoy the lack of attention so that we can get work done for the state of Oklahoma,” he said.

Walters also leads the Oklahoma State Board of Education, whose meetings have become a circus of protests, political conflict and media attention during his tenure in office.
After a month of heightened tensions with board members, Walters abruptly canceled the board’s regular Aug. 28 meeting with little explanation. It was the board’s second canceled meeting of 2025, the first happening after the Education Department posted an agenda too late to comply with the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act.
The August meeting cancellation prompted the board to take the extraordinary action of scheduling its own special meeting on Wednesday.
Walters did not attend. In his absence, the present board members voted to hire an attorney and started the process to find a new board secretary.
In a statement through a spokesperson, Walters declined to explain why he missed so many meetings of his various state boards. He also did not answer whether expects future state Board of Education meetings to convene as scheduled or whether he might miss more. 
“My focus has been, and will continue to be, on reforming Oklahoma’s education system to put families and students first,” he said in the statement. “We’ve implemented bold reforms across the state to raise academic outcomes, empower parents, and ensure taxpayer dollars are being used wisely in the classroom.”
Wednesday was far from the only state board meeting this year where Walters was marked absent.
He hasn’t shown up for a single board meeting in 2025 for the Commissioners of the Land Office, a board that oversees state-owned school lands and assets that benefit public education funding.

Gov. Kevin Stitt, Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell, State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd and Agriculture Secretary Blayne Arthur also sit on the board and regularly attend its meetings at the state Capitol, records show.
Walters also skipped the only two meetings the state Board of Equalization has held this year in February and June, according to the State Auditor and Inspector’s Office, which keeps the board’s meeting records. The board meets four times a year to review and certify tax revenue that funds all of state government. 
Walters has missed four of the board’s meetings since he took office in January 2023, according to the board minutes.
Meeting records show Walters’ predecessor, former state Superintendent Joy Hofmeister, was a regular attendee of CareerTech, Commissioners of the Land Office and state Board of Equalization meetings in 2022, a year she was running for governor while in her final year of statewide office. 
Hofmeister also frequently attended the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority’s meetings until 2022, when she appeared only once. 
Walters attended no OETA meetings in 2023 and 2024, records indicate. Meeting minutes from 2025 aren’t available on OETA’s website, and a request for them wasn’t immediately returned.
He’s never shown up for a meeting of his assigned higher education board, either.
Under state law, whoever is elected state superintendent automatically has a seat on the board of regents for the Regional University System of Oklahoma. The RUSO regents govern six public universities, the largest being the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond.
Public records show Walters has never been marked present for a RUSO board meeting since he took office.
Hofmeister didn’t attend any RUSO meetings in 2022, either, but she attended one to two meetings each year over the three years prior, according to meeting minutes.
Chris Van Denhende served on the RUSO board from 2021 until February, when the governor appointed him to the state Board of Education.

He said Walters’ absence had no effect on the university system’s board or operations. A state superintendent’s attendance, though, could have given the regents an opportunity to question why so few Oklahoma high school students graduate ready for college-level academics.
“I find the bigger story is why our elected officials take so little interest in their responsibility,” Van Denhende said. “That said, we may be better off if they don’t attend at all. I’m so frustrated with the politics that go on.”
Van Denhende and three other Board of Education members leaned on Oklahoma City constitutional attorney Bob Burke and various state government officials to schedule and carry out their special meeting Wednesday. 
Burke, a historian and former state commerce secretary, said he hopes Walters will make a concerted effort to attend all future state Board of Education meetings. 
It’s important that he shows up for his other state boards too, Burke said, or that he chooses a designee to attend in his place, as state law allows.

Walters has chosen a designee for only two boards, the Statewide Charter School Board and the State Textbook Committee. His proxies on both boards have maintained regular attendance, meeting minutes show.
The multitude of boards that keep state government running are often made up of mostly unelected appointees.
That’s why it matters that elected officials show up, Burke said. If they don’t, the voters of Oklahoma don’t have their chosen representative present.
The state Board of Education is a prime example. Of its seven members, Walters is the only one whose name appears on a voting ballot. The governor appoints the rest.
“What the people lose is the vision of the (state) founders in holding all of our government accountable to the people,” Burke said.

(Courtesy of Lake Area Technical College)Leaders of the state’s technical college system plan to ask legislators for $11 million in one-time funds for renovation and building projects at two eastern South Dakota campuses.
Presidents from Lake Area Tech in Watertown and Southeast Tech in Sioux Falls shared their visions with the Board of Technical Education on Thursday during an online meeting. Executive Director Nick Wendell said the “timing feels appropriate” to pursue one-time state funding for the projects.
“I think, in both cases, they check some important boxes as we think about our strategic priorities and growing graduate capacity in the system between now and the middle part of the next decade,” Wendell said.
Technical college board endorses $49 million state budget request

Wendell will meet with Gov. Larry Rhoden and the Bureau of Finance and Management next week to discuss the one-time requests and board-approved $49 million ask in ongoing funding.
The board did not formally endorse or approve the one-time request, but Wendell said at the end of the meeting he sensed a “spirit of support” from members.
While state revenue projections for ongoing funding are tight, Wendell told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting that his organization typically enters legislative sessions “assuming there would be some one-time funding for targeted projects.”
“We’re following the same ongoing revenue projections everyone else is, including the funding that might be challenging to come by,” Wendell said. “But if there are opportunities for one-time funds, we wanted to identify some of those targeted projects we think would be great priorities to invest in.”
Lake Area Tech student center renovation
Lake Area Tech plans to renovate 14,000 square feet of its student center to centralize its services, including counseling, testing and adult education learning centers. The adult learning center is currently in a building that is “beyond its useful life,” President Tiffany Sanderson told board members, and is expected to be replaced by a new public safety training center in the coming years.
The student center renovation would cost $4 million. Lake Area Tech would cover $1 million and ask the state for $3 million.
Sanderson said state funding for the project will spur industry partners to invest in academic changes and other parts of the college’s master plan.
“The total plan over the next 10 years is about $100 million in investment, so this is just 4% of that total project,” Sanderson said. “But it’s a really critical 4% to build early momentum.”
Wendell told board members that to increase graduate numbers in the technical education system, colleges such as Lake Area will have to recruit more non-traditional students.
“In many cases, those are students that will need access to student services to find success on our campuses,” Wendell said. “And as a board, we’ve sort of been committed to this notion that we don’t just want to recruit and enroll a broader swath of students, but we want to ensure that they have access to the tools they need to be successful.”
Southeast Tech plans new building and expansion
Southeast Tech plans to build a new center for advanced manufacturing, which would rehouse its advanced manufacturing programs in maintenance technology and mechanical engineering and add 34,000 square feet of lab and classroom space. President Cory Clasemann said the school also plans to expand and renovate its welding space, adding 12,000 square feet for a welding lab and shared fabrication space with the advanced manufacturing programs.
The college’s construction, HVAC, mechanical engineering, plumbing and welding programs are all at capacity with a waiting list for enrollment. Advanced manufacturing, Clasemann said, is a priority because it accounts for one out of 10 jobs in South Dakota and is expected to grow its workforce by 6% through 2032 in the state.
“This is really the linchpin of several other pieces,” Clasemann said.

The project will cost $24 million overall. About $16 million will be spent on the advanced manufacturing building and $7 million on the welding lab expansion, with about $1 million in design fees.
The school has raised $1.5 million in private funding with plans to fundraise another $8 million. The Board of Technical Education plans to request $8 million from the state. The school secured $6.5 million through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the project, which are funds that must be spent by 2031.
“We’re mindful of federal spending at the moment, so we’d rather spend them sooner rather than later,” Clasemann said. “We are aware that, just with recissions going on, that they could go away.”
The project will double enrollment capacity for the school’s mechanical engineering program and increase its maintenance technology capacity by 50%. The increase in capacity will free up space for other program expansions.
Clasemann said the technical college needs “a couple more million dollars” to move forward with the advanced manufacturing building, which can begin without funding for the welding expansion and renovation.

Act 72 applies to all grades K-12 and requires an appropriately trained education professional to provide remediation. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dorrine Dorfman and Charlene Webster: Following up on Vermont’s Act 72.","This commentary is by Charlene Webster, of Arlington, and Dorinne Dorfman, of Plainfield. Charlene has taught grades 3-6, special education and structured literacy in southwestern Vermont over her 40-year career. Dorinne teaches reading to grades 5-8 at Barre Town Middle and Elementary School, and has served as principal of Leland and Gray Union High School in Townshend and Champlain Elementary School in Burlington.
It’s never too early to start reading instruction and intervention in our schools. The best time for students to obtain strong foundational reading skills is between prekindergarten and the second grade. During a child’s pre-K through kindergarten years, deficits in language, alphabetics and phonemic awareness that may develop are small. 
Effective intervention, especially at this early stage, can close these gaps. Unlike other developmental milestones (such as walking and talking), reading rarely develops without direct instruction. Consensus research has shown that literacy gaps in the earliest grades predict reading problems later. The longer schools wait to remediate, the greater the reading failure gap, the harder to correct and the less likely students will ever become proficient readers.
In the past, American schools have chosen to “wait and see” by giving students more time to develop reading skills. This approach has been renamed “wait to fail” because rarely did gaps close without evidence-aligned intervention. 
Vermont passed legislation in 2024, Act 139, which abandoned this approach. Parents/guardians can pay careful attention to see how their schools are providing effective intervention beginning at the youngest grades. 
Parents/guardians will know effective remediation is being delivered when they see their children’s growth by receiving detailed progress-monitoring assessments and hearing their children sound out new words and read aloud with fluency and accuracy. 
In fact, when students as early as pre-K and kindergarten demonstrate poor skills on these predictive assessments, schools should provide intervention right away to close existing gaps before these students fail to make reading progress. 
These assessments include:

The names and sounds of all letters in the alphabet
Rapid Automatized Naming, which are skills in retrieving the names of letters, numbers and objects accurately and automatically.
Oral language skills: speech articulation, vocabulary, grammar, understanding longer sentences, attention and following directions.

Act 139 requires all students in grades K-3 be assessed and receive classroom instruction in the five components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Assessments must be valid and reliable, and administered following the test’s technical specifications at least once a year. 
Schools must notify the parents/guardians of students found significantly below proficient. Some schools have chosen to report all their students’ progress on the five reading components. Parents may always request results from these screenings.
Although Act 139 has put an end to misguided instructional approaches that have harmed student reading, thousands of Vermont students today continue to struggle to learn to read and write. 
For this reason, Act 72 — which was formerly called H.480 and was passed in June 2025 — requires public and approved independent schools to provide effective intervention to students significantly below proficiency in reading or whose poor reading skills impede school progress. 
Act 72 applies to all grades K-12 and requires an appropriately trained education professional to provide remediation. Schools must notify, support and share information with parents/guardians of students found significantly below proficient. 
Carrying out Vermont’s reading laws provides every student the opportunity to learn to read well and succeed in school and adulthood.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)Plans to move forward with consolidating some local boards of Early Childhood Iowa were discussed at the ECI State Board Meeting Friday, though some members of the public brought up concerns about the loss of local control.
Consolidating the Early Childhood Iowa system came up earlier this year, when Gov. Kim Reynolds proposed legislation that would have shifted existing ECI funding, and federal Child Care and Development Fund Wrap Around Child Care funds, to create a new $16 million “continuum of care” competitive grant program for preschool and child care centers that offer full-day care for children.
The legislation ultimately did not pass in the 2025 legislative session, as multiple care providers and child care advocates brought up concerns that the measure would take 42% of current ECI funds, and serve a more limited group of child care providers. They also spoke in opposition to the potential regionalization of the ECI system, as Reynolds proposed aligning the boards that govern the program with the state’s Behavioral Health Services System regions.

This change would have consolidated the current 34 ECI area boards, which oversee funding for local initiatives and services for pre-kindergarten children, into seven boards.
Though this restructuring was not approved by the legislature, ECI state board members brought up the subject again at their Friday meeting. Some members of the board said having 34 local boards has made it difficult to gather data, manage contracts and perform oversight functions.
Emily Westergaard, the ECI state board chair, said that the discussion on restructuring was part of a larger conversation as the board weighs competing priorities while “recognizing that resources are finite and the needs are complex and interconnected.”
“This process calls for us to carefully consider data, diverse perspectives and potential trade offs, as well as have an understanding of how choices in one area may affect outcomes in another,” Westergaard said. “By approaching these decisions with transparency, fairness and a commitment to the greater good, I hope we can strengthen the Early Childhood Iowa network and make a lasting impact for our kids.”
But several advocates for local ECI boards, as well as other parties, asked for more time and deliberation on restructuring, and said the current structure does not have enough problems to justify the substantial changes.
Iowa Sens. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, and Mike Zimmer, D-Clinton, sent a letter to the state board Thursday asking the members to “exercise their autonomous oversight authority to cautiously consider any attempt to radically restructure ECI service areas.”
“We have seen no evidence that the current Early Childhood Iowa system is failing Iowans,” Winckler said in a statement. “Any attempt to massively overhaul the existing system without thoughtful, internal analysis could threaten the consistent local service on which our communities have come to rely.”
Kevin Grieme, the Health Director of the Siouxland District Health Department, cautioned ECI leaders to make sure the redistricting changes would be beneficial when considering the needs of different communities being served. He said the restructuring of public health boards brought up new concerns in terms of distributing funding or reaching agreements.
“When funding is given to us, we rightfully take a look at it and say, ‘what are our needs, (how do) we prioritize those?’ And I’m not sure you can reach that same sort of consensus and agreement and efficiencies related to that if your territory is too large,” Grieme said.
Grieme said “it’s going to be difficult to keep that local connection” if realignment means the districts move to mirror behavioral health districts.
“One of the things I strongly encourage you is to take the time and consideration and receive (feedback) from the local level to be able to basically justify whatever realignment configuration you develop,” Grieme said.
Unity Stevens, who led one of the work groups looking at restructuring, said it is important to note the new proposed ECI local boards structure “is not a mirror image of the behavioral health districts.”
“Those (behavioral health) districts were organized under a central provider of oversight with district advisory councils — ECI has historically been defined by a citizen-led forward structure, and that remains the intent going forward,” Stevens said.
She added that the new system, if changes are approved, would be “similar to our current setup, but it’s being shaped into a more streamlined structure.”
The next state board meeting is scheduled for Nov. 7, but members discussed the possibility of an earlier special meeting to discuss the restructuring.

All of that junk and most of the sediment that washed into the lake have been removed, he said, now that the state’s $1 million cleanup is complete.

Following the June 2024 flood, surveys by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state officials estimated there was more than 20,000 cubic yards of sediment and debris in the lake.
The state awarded a contract to Three Oaks Construction of North Sioux City after a competitive bidding process. Work began on May 15 and concluded on the Aug. 1 deadline. That’s according to Game, Fish and Parks fisheries staffer Kip Rounds, who gave the department’s oversight commission a status update during a meeting Thursday in Rapid City. 
Crews used both land-based and barge-mounted excavators. The project was funded by the South Dakota Department of Public Safety’s emergency and disaster budget. 
The McCook Lake Association plans to pump water from the Missouri River next spring to return the lake to recreational levels. At that time, North Sioux City will reopen its public boat ramp at the lake, and the Department of Game, Fish and Parks will lift the no-wake restriction that has been in place since the flood.
What happened?
Three days of rain June 20-22, 2024, in southeast South Dakota surpassed 17 inches in some locations. Local and state authorities implemented a half-century-old diversion plan to handle record-high water that was flowing down the Big Sioux River toward Sioux City. They built a temporary levee across Interstate 29 that tied in with permanent levees to divert water into McCook Lake.
The water was supposed to flow through the 270-acre oxbow lake and drain toward the nearby Missouri River. Instead, it overwhelmed the lake and inundated many of the homes around it.
More than 100 homes near the lake were damaged, and 20 were destroyed. Many residents said the flood surge came suddenly, after they’d received little to no warning.
McCook Lake’s north shore neighborhood is still working to return the area to its pre-flood look, with some damaged homes, property and infrastructure remaining unrepaired.

(Photo by S. Shepard/Getty Images)North Carolina will receive more than $1 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to improve forestland, the agency announced this week.
The money is just a portion of the $8 million the USDA is spending on five projects across the country aimed at decreasing wildfire risk, protecting water quality and strengthening forest health, according to the federal agency.
In North Carolina, $1,022,106 will go toward the Uwharries to Sandhills, Phase 2 project, covering Montgomery, Moore, Randolph, Richmond and Stanly counties. It will be used to restore and improve about 18,000 acres in the Uwharrie National Forest through prescribed fire and silvicultural treatments, according to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).
Wildfires are a growing concern in North Carolina, agriculture commissioner Steve Troxler said earlier this year while asking lawmakers for more funding to tackle the issue.
The risks from wildfires are “expected to get worse, not better” throughout the year, Troxler said in April, according to WRAL.
The $8 million investment across the U.S. is the latest portion of the Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership Program, which is a collaboration between NRCS and Forest Service, to build public-private boundaries, according to the agency. The funding for new projects follows $32 million given to 24 existing 3-year-old Joint Chiefs’ projects.
“Wildfires have no boundaries, and neither should our prevention work,” USDA Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a press release, announcing the funding. “We need everyone at the table to deliver the kind of active management that will return our forests to health and productivity.”
Other projects receiving funding are in Alabama, Montana and Oregon, and a joint project in Colorado and Wyoming.
“Providing technical and financial assistance to private forest landowners is key to supporting locally led conservation, especially in the wildland-urban interface,” NRCS Chief Aubrey Bettencourt said in the release. This allows us to address multiple challenges in one project, such as reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire, protecting clean water, and improving wildlife habitat.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Uwharrie-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

(Photo by Jay Biggerstaff/Getty Images)The LSU Board of Supervisors voted Friday to dramatically increase the salaries of two top members of its athletics department while the rest of campus faces new austerity measures. 
The board unanimously voted to increase LSU baseball coach Jay Johnson’s salary from $1.67 million to $3.05 million, following his program’s second national championship in the three years he’s been in charge. His pay will increase by $100,000 annually through the end of his contract in 2032. 
Board members also unanimously approved the contract of Julie Cromer, LSU’s new executive deputy athletics director and chief operating officer. Her annual compensation package increases the university’s spending for the position more than $150,000 a year. 
The pay increases were awarded as every other department on campus began returning 2% of the budgets they were allocated July 1 back to the university. The recoupment is in response to President Donald Trump’s slashing of federal research funding, which has dramatically impacted higher education finances nationwide. 
LSU had previously announced its athletics department would not be subject to the new money-saving measures. 
During difficult budget times in the recent past, LSU’s athletics department has provided money to the university. 
After Gov. Bobby Jindal made drastic cuts in the state budget, LSU athletics began making annual transfers to the school. It received tens of millions of dollars from its sports programs from 2012-19, spanning Gov. John Bel Edwards’ first term, until athletics director Scott Woodward ended the practice shortly after he took the job. 
Woodward declined to take questions Friday from reporters after the board meeting. 
Increasing athletics spending while academic departments tighten their belts has the potential to increase friction between the two. In a new survey, professors in Louisiana and across the South lamented the outsized focus on collegiate sports as higher education institutions struggle with shrinking budgets, loss of research funding and political attacks. 
LSU Board chairman Scott Ballard said tension between athletics and academics has always been there and always will. College sports bring value to the university from a marketing perspective, he said. 
“God knows I don’t create the market in athletics,” Ballard said. “If I did, these salaries would be far lower, but I can’t do anything about it.”
LSU Board vice chairman Lee Mallett pushed back on Deputy Athletics Director Lori Williams as she presented Johnson’s new contract, raising concerns about the financial impact of buying out poor-performing coaches. 
It is now industry standard that coaching contracts include a buyout clause, which require universities to pay out some or all of a coach’s promised compensation if they are fired without cause. Poor performance on the field is typically not considered a valid reason for a school to waive the buyout clause of a coach’s contract. 
LSU agreed to pay former head football coach Ed Orgeron $17 million when he was fired in 2021, though major donors are believed to have helped the athletics department cover the buyout. However, the university is legally on the hook for tens of millions of dollars in buyouts across all of its coaching contracts. 
Johnson’s buyout is 90% of his base and supplemental salary. 
Mallett said he doesn’t agree with the practice and LSU should be first to “break the mold.” 
Williams said without buyout clauses, LSU would not be able to attract top coaching talent. 
“We have to play the game with the rules that we’re given,” board members James Williams said.
Johnson is now the highest-paid college baseball coach in the country, surpassing Tony Vitello at the University of Tennessee at $3 million, according to The Advocate. 
The increase also edges Johnson closer to LSU women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey, who will make $3.35 million this upcoming season as part of her record-setting contract. 
LSU football coach Brian Kelly is the program’s highest-paid employee at approximately $9.9 million a year in total compensation. His current buyout figure exceeds $60 million.  
Cromer will receive a base salary of $400,000 with additional funding from the Tiger Athletic Foundation. For the first two years of her contract, her supplemental pay will be $110,000. For the second two years, the supplement increases to $130,000, and she can also earn incentives of up to $166,200 for the first two years and up to $168,600 for the second two years. 
LSU’s pay package for Cromer is substantially higher than what it paid former deputy executive AD Keli Zinn, who left LSU to become athletics director at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Zinn’s contract at LSU provided her with a $425,000 salary and up to $90,000 in incentives.
Paying Cromer, formerly Ohio University’s athletics director, above market rate for the position might have been necessary to lure her to a position with a lower title, industry observers have speculated.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Is a party switch by a Bergen County Democrat a sign of doom for Dems in this year’s race for governor, or a desperate push by the Republican candidate to project bipartisan bona fides?
That’s the question from Thursday night, when Jack Ciattarelli, the GOP former assemblyman hoping to seize the governor’s mansion back from Democrats, touted an endorsement from Garfield Mayor Everett E. Garnto Jr., a Democrat who said he is changing his party registration to Republican and backing Ciattarelli over Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill.

New Jersey under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy is broken, Garnto told reporters Thursday.
“Over the last seven and a half years, the policies that Murphy has put out, it’s ruining the state,” he said. “Mr. Ciattarelli is the guy to turn it around.”
Garfield, sandwiched between Routes 21 and 46 in southern Bergen County and home to about 6,300 registered voters, is not a purple city. After going for Republican George H.W. Bush over Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 campaign for the White House, it voted for the Democrat in every subsequent presidential race — until 2024, when it voted for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by about 1,000 votes. In governor’s races, Garfield voters also tend to stick with Democrats. In 2013, when Republican Gov. Chris Christie won statewide in a landslide over Democrat Barbara Buono, Christie’s margin of victory in Garfield was only about 100 votes. This is a Dem stronghold, one where Sherrill shouldn’t have to worry about a local Democrat campaigning against her.
Still, Garnto is no typical Democrat. Voter registration records indicate he was a Republican as recently as 2016, when he cast a ballot in that year’s GOP primary (when, of course, Trump ran his first campaign for the White House). He was a Democrat by 2020, though he does not appear to have participated in the June 2020 presidential primary.
A social media post from Garfield Mayor Everett Garnto showing off Trump-branded socks.
And he’s made no secret of his love for Trump. He posted on social media about going to Trump’s inauguration earlier this year, and in August 2023 he shared a close-up of Trump 2020 socks with the caption, “2024” followed by nine exclamation points. He told reporters on Thursday that he voted for Trump in November.
I asked Garnto about his back-and-forth party switches and he said local politics is what made him flip from Republican to Democrat years ago. Democrats dominate in Bergen County, and that’s the party with the money and the machine muscle.
“In 2016 is when I first ran for the board of education and people in Garfield basically said, ‘Hey, listen, you should join the Democratic Party.’ I was unaffiliated at that time, and I just did, and since then, I’ve voted for Democrats, Republicans,” he said.
Garfield’s local elections are nonpartisan, so Garnto’s political affiliation is largely irrelevant for his own campaigns. But merely the news that Ciattarelli has picked up an endorsement from a Democratic elected official in prized territory like Bergen County is good for Republicans, according to Dan Cassino, a pollster and government and politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
“Any Republican running statewide in New Jersey has to make themselves acceptable to moderate Democrats and independents, and pointing out support from Democrats is an easy way to do that. Chris Christie was very interested in getting Democratic endorsements for much the same reason. Saying that the Mayor of Garfield is on your side doesn’t help much, but saying that even Democrats in the state are backing the Republican does help,” Cassino told me.
Some Democrats may laugh at this idea, and cite public polling not just of the governor’s race but also of Trump’s job approval here in New Jersey. But my guess is they also would have laughed last October if someone told them Trump was going to win Passaic County.
To find out more about Garnto, I talked to someone who works with him and was once mayor of Garfield himself: Garfield Councilman Richard Rigoglioso, who goes by Richie Riggs. Rigoglioso, a Democrat, told me he respects Garnto’s decision to switch parties, but he hadn’t thought of the mayor as a Democrat.
“He’s more independent than Democrat,” Rigoglioso said.
Rigoglioso said he thinks Garfield swinging to Trump in 2024 was an aberration, the result of the last-minute switch at the top of the Dem ticket and not an indication that the town is lurching rightward.
“Is Ciattarelli going to win Garfield? Garfield’s still a blue city. It just happened to be that Trump was the better candidate that day. I don’t think our mayor is going to sway that pendulum one way or the other,” he said.

The state’s college governing board which oversees and selects the historically Black university’s leaders said Wednesday that the firm will help identify and recruit candidates for the search process. The news comes three weeks after officials made public plans to launch a search committee, where all 12 trustee members will serve. 
Marcus Thompson resigned as university president in May, the third person to depart from that post in seven years. The state’s college governing board did not explain why he or his two predecessors left the post nor has it shared with the public details about its next steps for picking a permanent leader for the school. 
Alumni and supporters of the historically Black university have raised questions to the board about its opaque process, calling for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.  
The IHL board’s formal request for proposals can be viewed on its website. The deadline for submission is Sept. 12. 
In 2023, IHL hired Academic Search, an executive headhunting firm, for $115,000 after Thomas Hudson, Thompson’s predecessor, resigned. The board also paid the firm $85,000 for the Delta State search. 
The initial contract with Academic Search for Delta State was $130,000, but it was amended after the board cut the search short and chose Daniel Ennis. The board also used the firm for University of Southern Mississippi search.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)The Washington State Department of Health has issued a standing order for the COVID-19 vaccine, making it easier for Washington residents to get vaccinated.
The standing order, announced Friday, allows most Washington residents to go directly to a pharmacy or clinic and receive the COVID-19 vaccine without an individual prescription. 
“The barriers to COVID-19 vaccination are complex, and the standing order is just one part of the solution,” State Health Officer Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett said in a written statement. “We want to ensure all Washington residents have access to the protection these vaccines provide based on the best available science.”
His action comes after the state along with Oregon and California formed the West Coast Health Alliance earlier this week. Hawaii joined Thursday.
The alliance is a direct response to concerns that recent federal actions have undermined the independence of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and politicized the use of science in ways that will harm public health.
Alliance members will establish a process to provide evidence-based unified recommendations to their residents regarding who should receive immunizations and help ensure the public has access to credible information for confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy. 
“Washington State will not compromise when it comes to our values: science drives our public health policy,” said Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham. “Our commitment is to the health and safety of our communities, protecting lives through prevention, and not yielding to unsubstantiated theories that dismiss decades of proven public health practice.”
After Washington joined the alliance, the Department of Health reaffirmed its guidance that everyone 6 months and older, including pregnant people, should stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. 
This recommendation aligns with guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
“COVID-19 vaccines are well-researched, well-tested, and have saved millions of lives around the world,” Kwan-Gett said. 
Washington’s standing order comes after the Food and Drug Administration last month approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the fall and, under the recommendation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., only recommended the vaccine to those over 65 and people with existing health problems. 
That approach severely limits access to COVID shots across the country. 
In Washington, the vaccine remains covered by most private insurers, Apple Health, and Washington’s Adult Vaccine and Childhood Vaccine programs. 
While some health care providers have already received this season’s COVID-19 vaccine, other providers are still waiting to receive supplies of the updated vaccine, which may limit appointments.
Supply through the Childhood and Adult Vaccine programs are not available yet, and may not be available until late September or October, according to the Department of Health. 
In its announcement Friday, the department urged residents to remain “patient but vigilant” in staying up to date on vaccinations.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/covid-vaccine-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

This story was originally published in the Current. 
The raid on the Hyundai electric vehicle plant was part of a lengthy investigation into the unlawful hiring of illegal aliens at the site that Gov. Brian Kemp and local officials had promised would create thousands of jobs for Georgians, federal officials said Friday.
Operation Low Voltage resulted in more than 475 people detained — more than 300 of whom were Koreans — while federal agents used a criminal search warrant to gather evidence at the battery plant that is a joint venture of Hyundai and LG, two of South Korea’s largest companies.
Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia and Alabama, said the raid was the largest single site enforcement operation ever carried out by the Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement division.
Schrank told reporters that while some of the detained workers illegally crossed the U.S. border, others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working at the $7.6 billion site where Hyundai Motor Group and an interconnected group of suppliers are building vehicles.
Hyundai broke ground at the site two years ago after Georgia promised billions of dollars in tax credits and tax abatements if the world’s largest carmaker met its goals of creating more than 8,000 jobs at an average salary of approximately $58,000.
As of March, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, the legal entity that operates the site, reported that it had 1,200 people currently employed, not counting Koreans, and was operating one shift at the plant. At that time, the battery facility was not operational and remains under construction.
Federal officials said the majority of workers detained this week have been sent to Folkston, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency’s detention center in Charlton County.

The governor’s office responded to the raid by saying that state agencies remain committed to the rule of law. “All companies operating within the state must follow the laws of Georgia and our nation,” said spokesman Carter Chapman.
There was no immediate comment from Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr.
In addition to the large number of Korean nationals, those detained included people from Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela, according to Migrant Equity Southeast, a migrant worker advocacy group in Coastal Georgia.
The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation.
“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.
Thursday’s operation was more complex than other ICE enforcement actions that have occurred since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year.
The raid involved 10 federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigation unit, according to Margaret Heap, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia.
“This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks, and put them on buses,” Schrank said. “This has been a multi-month criminal investigation where we have developed evidence and conducted interviews, gathered documents and presented that evidence to the court in order to obtain a judicial search warrant.”
Neither Heap nor Shranck identified which court had issued the warrant. They also did not indicate if or when Bryan County authorities or those from neighboring counties, or company officials were notified about the operation.

Casados is the third secretary in the last six years to oversee New Mexico’s child welfare department, which has faced increased scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates, who say the department has failed to address housing of children in offices and issues of child maltreatment in custody which has lead to rising costs of settlements. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez in April announced an investigation into a 16-year old foster child’s suicide.
New Mexico child welfare systems haven’t improved in last half year, arbiter finds

Casados was formally appointed to the position in January 2024, after serving as the interim secretary starting in May 2023, when retired state Supreme Court justice Barbara Vigil stepped down.
The governor’s announcement highlighted Casados’ “complete transformation of the agency,” noting she had launched a public transparency dashboard; conducted rapid hire events; and ended the practice of the agency using Social Security benefits belonging to children in care.
“I am deeply grateful for the opportunity I’ve had to work alongside families across New Mexico during my tenure at CYFD,” Casados said. “The dedicated employees at CYFD do their challenging and important work with compassion and heart, and I hope they are given every opportunity to show what they are capable of accomplishing in the months and years ahead. While there is always more work to do, I am confident that the foundation we have built will continue to serve New Mexico’s children and families well into the future.”
A CYFD spokesperson did not immediately return Source NM request to speak with Casados.
The latest change in leadership at the agency also comes amid the creation of a new oversight agency.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham thanked Casados for her work as a secretary and chief operating officer in the governor’s office prior to that, calling her a “trusted partner and valued leader,” in a statement.
“She stepped up to help manage our pandemic response and helped create the Early Childhood Education and Care Department. It’s fitting that she took on one of the toughest jobs in state government at CYFD in the last phase of her career in public service,” Lujan Grisham said.  “I am forever grateful to Teresa for hard work and dedication to the people of New Mexico. I wish her all the best in her retirement.”
The governor has designated CYFD Deputy Secretary Valerie Sandoval to lead the department.
The governors’ office did not immediately respond to a Source NM inquiry on when Casados gave notice of her retirement.

State Sen. Nicole Tobiassen (R-Albuquerque) told Source NM in a phone call Friday that Casados’ departure “was long overdue,” and called for Lujan Grisham to put finding a replacement secretary on the agenda for the Oct. 1 special session instead of appointing a successor. 
“This is an emergency situation,” Tobiassen said. “We’re asking her to do the right thing and allow us to put together an immediately qualified commission that goes out and finds the replacement.”
Tobiassen said she was working to put forward legislation to remove the secretary’s position from the governor’s office and establish an independent hiring commission with experts who can “hire the best person, not just for child welfare, but budget-wise,” as well. 
Several pieces of similar legislation introduced in the session earlier this year failed to make it to the governor’s desk. 
Casados previously served as deputy secretary of the Department of Workforce Solutions under former Governor Bill Richardson, and also worked in his office.

The Cobblestone Farm community, which rents single-family homes, duplexes and triplexes for $373 to $753 per month, is one of the latest projects aimed at addressing the affordable housing crisis in a region of Arkansas where the population has rapidly expanded, boosting housing costs. 
Addressing housing affordability is a key priority for the region because the median home price in Northwest Arkansas has grown 240% over the last six or seven years, said Brad Sikorski, president and CEO of the Excellerate Foundation, one of the partners in the Cobblestone Farm project.
“It’s a huge challenge that we face as a community, and we need more projects like this,” Sikorski said.
In addition to the Cobblestone Farm community, the Excellerate Foundation, is working on an affordable housing development for Bentonville School District employees and a new housing project in Rogers.

The Cobblestone Farm community, which opened to renters earlier this year and is already at capacity, is the result of partnerships between multiple organizations, including Strategic Realty, which is led by Van Buren Republican state Sen. Jim Petty, and New Heights Church, which owns the land and is renting it for $1 per year for 99 years. 
The Fayetteville City Council annexed and rezoned 30 acres for the project in 2020, and officials broke ground in 2022, according to the Fayetteville Flyer. 
“We hope [this] will be a long-term, life-changing investment in affordable housing here in Fayetteville,” Petty said. 
The Arkansas Development Finance Authority provided more than 90% of resources used to finance the nearly $21 million project by accessing the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program and the National Housing Trust Fund, ADFA Director of Tax Credits John Blackwell said. 
The Fayetteville development was also supported by an $850,000 Affordable Housing Program grant awarded by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas through Arvest Bank for construction costs, according to a press release. 
A 2019 report brought Northwest Arkansas’ affordable housing issue into focus. A new study released in May that builds on that report found that housing priority needs identified five years ago — a lack of regional housing policies, need for diverse housing options, limited choices for low-income households and weak links between housing and transportation — remain “even more acute.”
Groups throughout the community have started tackling the issue through various strategies, including the creation of a workforce housing center that announced the creation of a 77-unit mixed-income apartment project in downtown Springdale in 2023. More recently, the University of Arkansas celebrated the dedication of a new timber-focused facility last week where students can work on affordable housing solutions.
‘Water, sewer building a hot subject around here,’ Northwest Arkansas consultant says

Efforts to construct more housing to meet the demands of the region’s growing population have been stymied in some cities due to a lack of wastewater infrastructure. The state appears to be taking steps to address that issue with the governor’s announcement last week of a comprehensive water reclamation study to inform the state’s water plan and guide future wastewater infrastructure projects in Northwest Arkansas. 
Meanwhile, discussions around the housing issue are expected to continue between lawmakers and the public. On Thursday, state and Northwest Arkansas elected officials discussed ways to address housing costs during a housing conference in Cave Springs, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. Petty attended the summit and told the Advocate Friday that all meetings like that are productive, but it’s just the beginning because “there’s a lot of work to be done.” 
During the 2025 legislative session, Petty introduced a bill focused on the housing crisis that has since been sent to interim study. Officials won’t be able to spend their way out of this problem and instead will have to consider a combination of tactics, such as reforming building and zoning policies and providing better education on the topic, Petty said.
“There’s just a lot of things that need to happen, and I think the more we talk about it and the more that we do it in a way that is collaborative and we put our own personal preferences and our own egos out of the way, the sooner that we can get to solving the real problems,” he said. 
In another effort to keep the conversation going, the Northwest Arkansas Council announced Thursday an eight-day series of community meetings and events seeking input on the region’s growth. The Growing Home NWA Roadshow kicks off Sept. 17 in Centerton. A full schedule is available here.

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Supreme Court)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court on Friday said a lawsuit from a La Vista mother whose son went missing from his elementary school in 2021 can proceed, at least for now.
Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Stephanie Stacy said a Sarpy County District Court judge prematurely dismissed a 2021 case from Tammi Larsen. Larsen alleges Papillion-La Vista Community Schools and three school employees were negligent in caring for her then-11-year-old son Ryan, who went missing in May 2021 and has not been seen since.
Larsen alleges the district’s negligent supervision of Ryan led to his disappearance. Ryan had a history of leaving or attempting to leave school and had been diagnosed with autism, Tourette’s Disorder and absence seizures.
Ryan had left school three times in the months before his May 17, 2021, disappearance. He was on an individualized education plan that was regularly updated and modified.
Attorney Justin Pritchett for the Larsen family said in a statement: “The Nebraska Supreme Court made the right and just decision today. The Larsen family will continue to seek answers to hold the school district accountable to obtain justice for Ryan.”
Papillon-La Vista and its attorneys did not immediately respond to requests Friday for comment.
Court documents say school officials allegedly left Ryan unsupervised, and three unnamed school employees watched as Ryan walked out of school on May 17, 2021, never to return.
“School district staff did not attempt to prevent Ryan from leaving the school grounds and made no immediate attempts to retrieve him and return him to school,” the opinion states.
Larsen alleges that the inaction inflicted emotional distress on her. Given district knowledge of Ryan’s age, disability and history of elopement, court documents state, “it was reckless, outrageous and intolerable to leave him alone and to permit him to leave the school building unattended,” which likely resulted in Ryan’s death or serious physical harm.
Sarpy County District Judge George Thompson dismissed Larsen’s case in May 2024, stating the school district couldn’t be sued under “sovereign immunity” protections, the concept that a government can’t be sued unless its immunity is waived or unless the law expressly allows such a lawsuit.
Thompson said Larsen’s allegation of negligent supervision was not allowed due to exemptions for “due care” or the “discretionary function” of government. As a result, the emotional distress claim was barred, too. The district court also said Larsen couldn’t allege “sufficient facts” to show she was “a seriously injured victim.”
But Stacy said it was too soon to make those determinations without at least letting the case proceed a little longer and determining whether there was “any plausible path” to proceed.
The lower court determined that the complaint’s reference to Ryan’s IEP concerned “legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic and political policy.” So, it was a “matter of circumstances and choice” for the district to leave Ryan alone. It said the district’s supervision decisions were a matter of implementing Ryan’s IEP.
The Nebraska Supreme Court said Larsen’s complaint alleged no facts about Ryan’s IEP, nor did it even include it in the court file, and officials knew Ryan “had a propensity to wander off the school grounds if left alone.”
Stacy wrote that determining the applicability of the exemptions “must await a more developed factual record.”
In 2023, Larsen also filed a case seeking to declare Ryan legally deceased. Under state law, a missing person can be presumed dead after five years, “unless there is sufficient evidence” otherwise. A judge said Larsen had not met that burden.
Stacy cautioned that Larsen’s case is not built around whether Ryan is deceased and wrote that it is plausible Ryan has suffered a serious injury. Stacy wrote that it is reasonable that Larsen “suffered emotional distress that was medically diagnosable and so severe no reasonable person should be expected to endure it.”
The case will return to Sarpy County District Court and continue.

The students walked out during their study period to bring attention to the prevalence of school shootings in America. A number of student speakers took time to share their message in the stadium, speaking against deadly gun violence and calling for policies to strengthen gun safety in schools. Students returned to class by the start of their third period.
“Although the school division does not assist with the organization of events such as this, our staff does take steps to monitor students to ensure they remain safe at all times. While we always want students to remain in class, we acknowledge their right to speak up for their beliefs and appreciate the peaceful and respectful manner in which they did so,”  Hermitage High School principal Michael Jackson said in a statement.
The event, created by the advocacy group Students Demand Action, spurred walkouts in schools across the country. A map on the group’s website showed students in 27 schools in the commonwealth registered to officially participate in the protest, spanning Northern Virginia, the Richmond region and Hampton Roads. One school in Blacksburg was slated to have students participate.
Current students have been called the “school shooting generation,” according to Students Demand Action. Many schools across the nation have only been back in session for a couple weeks but there’s already been a mass shooting at a catholic school in Minneapolis, which claimed the lives of two children and injured dozens more in late August.
 In 2023, Virginia was rocked by a deadly shooting at Huguenot High School’s graduation ceremony in downtown Richmond, where 18-year-old graduate Shawn Jackson and his father were killed and several were wounded. Lawmakers and civil rights groups have since called for more resources to prevent gun violence in Virginia schools.
Students Demand Action advocates against policies they feel would lead to dangerous access to guns. They also push for more gun safety laws and protocols passed in state legislatures.

Greg Stanton, one of the co-sponsors. “This bill gives FEMA independence and tools it needs to respond to disaster.”Republican Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Eric Burlison of Missouri and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania voted against reporting the bill to the House floor. Their offices didn’t respond to requests for comment asking why they opposed the legislation.

The 207-page measure, formally called the Fixing Emergency Management for Americans (FEMA) Act of 2025, would remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security and make it a Cabinet-level agency.The legislation would create one application for federal natural disaster assistance from FEMA, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration. It would also give local and state governments more flexibility in deciding which types of emergency housing best meet the needs of their residents following different natural disasters. Republicans and Democrats on the committee praised the various changes the measure would make during a two-hour markup that offered an increasingly rare example of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Donations from charities and FEMANorth Carolina Republican Rep. David Rouzer and California Democratic Rep. Laura Friedman both spoke in support of a provision reversing a policy that they said penalized people who received assistance from charities following a natural disaster. “Too many families who accept a donation from a charity or take an SBA loan to keep the lights on find out later that accepting those essential resources prevents them from receiving other assistance later for which they otherwise would be eligible,” Rouzer said. “This bill makes clear that SBA loans and private charitable donations are not considered duplicative for FEMA individual assistance.”Friedman said she was shocked to learn that FEMA counted charitable donations against disaster survivors following the Los Angeles wildfiresThat led her to introduce the Don't Penalize Victims Act with Mississippi Republican Rep. Mike Ezell, which was rolled into the FEMA overhaul bill. “I want to thank all the members of this committee, and particularly Chair (Sam) Graves and ranking member (Rick) Larsen, for their understanding of the importance of this measure to victims, who were seeing the charity that their churches, that their friends are raising for them be counted as income and deducted from the amount they were getting from FEMA,” Friedman said. Oregon Democratic Rep. Val Hoyle spoke in support of making FEMA a Cabinet-level department, saying that it’s been bogged down in the Department of Homeland Security since just after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “After being folded into the Department of Homeland Security, it became buried in layers of bureaucracy,” Hoyle said. “DHS's sprawling mission — cybersecurity, counterterrorism, immigration enforcement, transportation security and more — has left FEMA less able to act with the speed and agility disaster-stricken communities need.”Hoyle said the legislation restoring FEMA’s “independence will help insulate disaster relief from” the types of “political pressures” that exist throughout the Homeland Security Department.Permitting reformDespite the broadly bipartisan support for the legislation within the committee, it will likely undergo some changes in the weeks and months ahead. House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and ranking member Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who both sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, raised concerns with elements in the FEMA overhaul bill during the markup. Westerman said he voted for the bill but expected the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s leadership to work with him to address concerns over ""permitting reform issues"" that fall under his panel’s jurisdiction. “There is one provision on the Endangered Species Act that we have concerns with actually being executable the way it's written,” Westerman said. “Again, that's something that's fixable, and we look forward to working with you as we move forward on the bill.”Huffman said he had concerns about how the FEMA overhaul bill addresses “environmental review statutes,” which fall under the Natural Resources Committee’s purview. “I, of course, share the goal of cutting red tape. We want disaster-stricken families to be able to rebuild faster. There are ways to do that that also ensure that recovery is durable, resilient and sustainable. That we rebuild once. These are things that (the National Environmental Policy Act) helps to ensure. So I look forward to continuing to work with the committee on this as the bill advances. This is a problem that can be fixed, and I hope it will,” Huffman said. Potomac River water Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members offered just two amendments to the bill — one adopted by voice vote and one withdrawn. Indiana Democratic Rep. André Carson received broad support for his amendment to require FEMA to inform members of Congress about grants within their districts, a practice he said has changed during the Trump administration. “We should not need to mandate transparency and accountability, but if FEMA fails to provide this information, my amendment codifies the traditional notifications to Congress,” Carson said. Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, offered and then withdrew an amendment that would have required FEMA “to submit to Congress a plan to supply emergency drinking water to the nation’s capital region during any period the Potomac River becomes unusable.”Offering and then withdrawing an amendment is a common way for members to highlight issues without forcing a vote. Norton said the Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for the city’s water supply, only has sufficient reserves for one day should something happen. “If the Potomac River becomes unusable, which could happen at any moment whether through manmade or natural events, it would pose a significant risk to the residents of the nation’s capital, the operations of the federal government, national security and the region’s economy,” Norton said. Congress has partially funded a study to identify a backup drinking water supply and additional water storage facilities. But, Norton said, “any solution is years away.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-05 15:58:29.370020

In a letter sent Thursday, a West Virginia official informed Horne LLP that her department’s proposed ban on the company would be “permanently withdrawn.”
The proposed ban, sent on July 22 and previously reported by NC Newsline, had cited a settlement Horne made with the federal government months earlier. Prosecutors had alleged that the Mississippi-based company created fictitious applicant information and failed fraudulent invoices during a disaster recovery program; Horne denied any wrongdoing and settled for $1.2 million.
Samantha Willis, who leads the state’s contracting agency, wrote to Horne officials that “having reviewed your response” to the proposed ban and “giving consideration to the facts and circumstances” of the situation, she would withdraw it.
In her original letter, Willis wrote that Horne had demonstrated a “‘wanton indifference’ to the interests of the public.” Horne “strongly disagreed” with the letter, and later sent a formal response.
“Today, we received confirmation that the proposed debarment notice from West Virginia has been permanently withdrawn,” Horne CEO and managing partner Rusty Butcher said in a statement to NC Newsline on Thursday evening. “While the initial notice was unexpected, we’ve remained transparent throughout and consistently demonstrated that no wrongdoing occurred.
“We’re pleased with the resolution and value our collaboration with the State of West Virginia,” Butcher added. “Our focus remains on making a positive impact in communities recovering from disaster — and doing so as the premier firm in the field.”
A spokesperson for Horne, Meg Annison, said the company cited “procedural concerns and a lack of substantiated legal grounds” in its response. The company did not provide a copy of its full response to West Virginia upon request by NC Newsline.

At a Sept. 4, 2025, hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced heated questions from numerous senators about his vaccine policies, including his stance on COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA vaccine technology generally.
Although Kennedy agreed that Operation Warp Speed, President Donald Trump’s signature initiative to produce COVID-19 vaccines in nine months, was a tremendous achievement, he also maintained that COVID-19 vaccines cause widespread and serious harm, including death, particularly in young people – a claim for which there is no evidence.
Some especially pointed questions came from Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who provided the final vote needed for Kennedy’s confirmation in February 2025 after Kennedy promised him that he would not change the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s process for recommending vaccines. Cassidy pointed out that with the limitations and confusion caused by the CDC’s new rules around COVID-19 vaccines, “I would say effectively we are denying people vaccines.” To which Kennedy replied, “Well, you’re wrong.”
At the hearing, Kennedy stood by his decision to cut US$500 million in HHS funding for 22 research contracts on mRNA vaccine technology. HHS has said it will instead pour these funds into research on a traditional approach to designing vaccines that was first used more than 200 years ago. With such vaccines, called whole-virus vaccines, a person’s immune system is presented with the whole virus, often in weakened or inactivated form. This switcheroo has puzzled many scientists.
A few days before the hearing, on Sept. 1, Trump demanded that pharmaceutical companies prove that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work, saying that the CDC was “being ripped apart over this question.” It was his first public acknowledgment of the chaos roiling the CDC amid the firing of its director, Susan Monarez, and subsequent resignations of four high-level agency officials.
Meanwhile, public health experts and HHS staffers are calling for Kennedy to be fired, and several senators at the hearing echoed that call.
As a vaccinologist who has studied and developed vaccines for over 35 years, I see that the science behind mRNA vaccine technology is being widely misstated. This incorrect information is shaping long-term health policy in the U.S. – which makes it urgent to correct the record.
Are mRNA vaccines less safe than whole-virus vaccines?
HHS defended its cancellation of mRNA vaccine research based, in part, on a nonpeer-reviewed compilation of selected publications called the COVID-19 mRNA “vaccine” harms research collection. This document lists about 750 articles claimed to describe harms caused by mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. However, the vast majority of these articles aren’t about vaccines but about the harms of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. And notably absent from it is the huge body of data showing mRNA vaccines actually prevent these harms.
Spike proteins on SARS-COV-2 can cause tissue damage – and although mRNA vaccines produce them in small amounts, they prevent the virus from replicating to produce them in large amounts.(Source: https://www.scientificanimations.com/wiki-images/, CC BY-SA)
For example, the document being used to justify RFK Jr.’s claims about mRNA vaccines highlights 375 studies reporting that the virus’s spike protein alone, which is produced when the virus replicates, can cause excessive inflammation and tissue damage. This is true. But the document marshals this evidence to support the claim that mRNA vaccines, which are designed to produce spike proteins, cause the same harm – which is not accurate.
While viral replication results in uncontrolled production of a large amounts of the protein, the way it’s produced by the mRNA vaccine is very different. The vaccine produces a small, controlled amount of spike protein inside a few cells – just enough to induce an immune response without causing damage. And by blocking the virus’s replication, it reduces the amount of spike protein in circulation, actually having the opposite effect.
What about side effects like myocarditis?
Early reports flagged a type of heart swelling called myocarditis as a rare side effect of the mRNA vaccine, particularly for young men ages 18 to 25 after a booster dose. A 2024 review identified about 20 cases out of 1 million people who received the vaccine. However, that same study found that unvaccinated people had an elevenfold higher risk of getting myocarditis after a COVID-19 infection than vaccinated people.
What’s more, another 2024 study showed that people who developed myocarditis after vaccination had fewer complications than those who developed the condition after getting infected with COVID-19.
Do mRNA vaccines make the SARS-CoV-2 virus resistant?
Another claim from the compilation of supposed mRNA vaccine harms that was cited as a reason for cutting funding for mRNA technology is that mRNA vaccines cause mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus that make them resistant or less susceptible to the vaccine.
When a virus replicates in its host, it produces millions of copies of its genetic material. Mutations are copying errors that occur naturally during the replication process. These acquired mutations produce new variants, which is why both the COVID-19 mRNA and the whole-virus flu vaccine get updated annually – to keep up with natural changes in the virus.
Slowing down viral replication decreases the rate at which a virus can acquire new mutations. Since both mRNA and whole-virus vaccines stop or slow the virus from replicating, both types of vaccines help reduce the emergence of resistant viruses.
Viruses can mutate to escape from antibodies, but the mRNA vaccines are not causing the emergence of more virulent strains, likely for at least two reasons. First, mRNA vaccines induce immune responses that can attack the virus at multiple spots, so it would have to come up with many mutations at once to escape the vaccine’s defenses. Second, even if the virus could acquire all these mutations, they would likely weaken it, making it unable to cause or even transmit disease.
mRNA vaccines versus new SARS-CoV-2 variants
Kennedy, in announcing cuts to mRNA vaccine research on Aug. 5, 2025, claimed that mRNA vaccines don’t work against respiratory viruses and that HHS was moving toward “safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.”
Both whole-virus vaccines and mRNA vaccines protected against COVID-19 and prevented hospitalization and death for millions of people worldwide between 2020 and 2024, but there’s clear evidence that the mRNA-based vaccines provided significantly better protection than whole-virus vaccines. And for COVID-19, mRNA vaccines are more effective against new variants, which emerge as viruses mutate, than whole-virus vaccines.


 mRNA vaccines’ superpower is that they can be updated and manufactured very quickly, unlike traditional whole-virus vaccines.

The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines started with exceptionally high efficacy, exceeding 94%. When the SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants emerged in the spring and fall of 2021, mRNA vaccines became less effective in preventing infections. However, they remained highly effective in preventing severe illness, whereas in unvaccinated people the rates of severe illness and hospitalization remained high.
This is because mRNA vaccines induce the immune system to make both antibodies and specialized immune cells called T cells. These elements can recognize multiple parts of the virus, including ones that don’t change, enabling significant protection against new variants.
What’s more, the mRNA vaccines have a superpower that no other type of vaccine can currently match: They can be quickly updated and manufactured within two to three months. To develop a whole-virus vaccine, researchers must first spend months isolating and propagating the virus. Conversely, making an mRNA vaccine requires just sequencing the virus’s genetic code – a process that today takes just hours.
If a new pandemic began today, mRNA vaccines are currently the only type of vaccine that could be developed quickly enough to disrupt its spread.
The future of mRNA vaccine technologies
Thirty years ago, when scientists first started developing mRNA vaccine technology, they recognized its potential to overcome major limitations of whole-virus vaccines – namely, slow production time and more limited ability to protect from new viral variants. Today, mRNA vaccines are also being developed to prevent or treat diseases including HIV and cancer, as well as autoimmune and genetic diseases.
Of course, this technology can be further improved. New mRNA vaccine technologies are aimed, among other things, at making mRNA vaccines easier to store to allow for faster distribution and reduce their short-term side effects, eliminate the rare risk of myocarditis and more quickly block a respiratory infection.
The National Institutes of Health is funneling money away from new mRNA technologies toward a single project developing universal vaccines based on traditional whole-virus vaccine technology. Universal vaccines are urgently needed to provide broader protection against ever-changing respiratory viruses, such as influenza, that are major pandemic threats.
A 2022 study in mice and ferrets showed that a universal flu vaccine NIH plans to support has promise. However, multiple studies of potential universal flu vaccines based on mRNA technology show even more potential. Such vaccines could induce broader immunity than whole-virus vaccines by eliciting antibody and T-cell responses that target an even wider range of flu viruses.
It’s hard to square those benefits with the fact that HHS and NIH have named the planned new universal vaccine platform “Generation Gold Standard,” insisting that it represents a new standard in science and transparency. The effort seems more akin to eliminating all e-bike technology and telling everyone who seeks one to get by with a single brand of a 10-speed bike: Getting to the intended destination may still be possible, but it will be slower and harder.
And in the case of abandoning mRNA vaccine research, it may lead to lives needlessly lost, whether due to potential medicines untapped or to pandemic unpreparedness.

Jason Prokop of Lincoln testifies before the Business and Labor Committee about an interim study he introduced examining the internNE program. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A state-funded internship program that was slashed this year to balance Nebraska’s budget still has  a push behind it as a means of keeping young talent in the state. 
Earlier this year, State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln filed an interim study to consider the internNE program’s impact on brain drain in Nebraska. The study led to a public hearing Friday before the Nebraska Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee. 
Prokop, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, is keenly aware of Nebraska’s ongoing financial constraints but said maintaining internNE would come with returns on investment that would help the state in the long run.

He and five other invited testifiers largely argued that every student who chooses to stay in Nebraska through the program increases revenues that will eventually come back to the state. 
“Every dollar we spend helping a student launch their career here multiplies through workforce retention, stronger businesses and stronger communities,” said one testifier Levi Thiele, career services director for University of Nebraska at Omaha. 
InternNE originated under former Gov. Dave Heineman, but was boosted in 2022 through a $20 million investment approved by the Legislature. Since then, Prokop said the program has aided more than 1,500 internships and distributed more than $8 million in grants. 
The roughly $11 million left in the program was reappropriated this year to help fill a fluctuating budget deficit that at one point grew as high as $432 million. It was part of more than $218 million in various transfers into the state’s general fund during fiscal year 2025-26. 
These budget struggles are likely to continue, as the state is once again facing a projected deficit of around $95 million. That figure is likely to increase over the coming months, due to the impacts from the federal budget reconciliation bill and economic factors. 
Even Prokop said it was too early to say if refunding internNE would be possible when lawmakers return for their 60-day session in 2026. 
“I want to see it funded, but I’m also a realist,” Prokop said. 
Nebraska has long struggled with a labor shortage, exacerbated by a trend of young people leaving the state after finishing their education. Prokop said between 2010-2020, Nebraska on average lost about 6,000 residents per year, with a particularly high amount of them being college-educated young people. 
“Nebraska faces a looming demographic cliff,” said another testifier Tyler White, political science professor at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. “We see it already in declining school enrollments, and soon we will feel it more acutely in our workforce.” 
There is evidence that internNE helped slow Nebraska’s brain drain, Prokop said. Citing data from UNO’s School of Public Affairs, he said 2022 — the same year the state boosted funding for the program — saw fewer young people leave Nebraska compared to neighboring years. 
Prokop also cited data from the Nebraska Statewide Workforce & Educational Reporting System claiming that paid internships create at least a 50% probability of talent retention. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who chairs the Business and Labor Committee, questioned how many students who have participated in internNE choose to remain in Nebraska because of the program. She argued that the program doesn’t have as much benefit for students already planning to stay. 
Prokop wasn’t able to provide hard data to prove internNE keeps students in the state. However, Thiele said, she witnessed firsthand multiple students making that choice because of their internships. 
Kauth also asked whether it should be the business’ responsibility to fund their own internship programs and not the state’s. 
“I’m just wondering at what point profitable companies are asking taxpayers … to pay for their staff and pay for their growth and development,” Kauth said. 
Prokop countered that participating businesses must match some of the reimbursements they receive through the program. He also noted that internNE doesn’t fund interns’ compensation, but instead helps interns overcome other barriers to work, including housing and travel. 
Dawson Brunswick, president of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce and another testifier, said short-term housing for interns is effectively nonexistent in his area. It reached a point where the chamber itself funded two short-term housing complexes for interns in response to the demand for labor. 
Kauth then wondered if this approach may give students a false sense of what housing and travel costs would be once their internship ended. But White argued that interns often are paid fairly low wages, and if they secure a full-time position afterwards that would help make up the shifting costs. 
“I really feel like students today are struggling more with money than they have before,” White said. “And so if we can do things to lower those costs for them, I think you’re going to find that it can be that little hand-up that puts them on the pathway to (success).”
Prokop said internNE isn’t a “cure all” for Nebraska’s workforce challenges. He said he favors an “all-of-the-above approach” that would incorporate the program with several other initiatives to retain talent, including dual enrollment and apprenticeships. 
He also noted that many other states offer similar programs to internNE and argued that Nebraska must remain competitive if officials don’t want the problem to worsen. 
“If we aren’t recruiting them, we’ll lose them,” said another testifier Dan Curran, executive director of UNO’s Nebraska Business Development Center.

Scientists say the rise is tied to greenhouse gas emissions.,"Yes.


According to the World Meteorological Organization and NOAA, every year from 2015 to 2024 ranked among the 10 warmest years on record, making the past decade the hottest in the last roughly 175 years. In fact, WMO confirmed in January that 2024 was the hottest year ever recorded, beating the record set just one year prior.
Global temperatures in 2024 were about 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the 20th-century average. For 14 straight months, through July 2024, the world set new monthly heat records. Both land and ocean temperatures hit all-time highs, and ocean waters stored more heat than ever before.
Scientists say this ongoing rise is tied to greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere. The world is now dangerously close to passing the 1.5 degree Celsius global average temperature limit set in the Paris Agreement, a key target for avoiding the worst climate impacts.

In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order Friday morning to authorize pharmacists to provide the shot to anyone who desires it for the next 30 days, which can be renewed.
“When they said that they are not going to be requiring COVID shots and other vaccinations for our families, I said, ‘No, here in New York we will make parents have the option.’ If you want your child to have a COVID shot, it should be available to you and it should be covered by insurance,” Hochul said during a news conference Friday morning, where she signed the order.
“So what I’m doing now is signing an executive order, because extreme times call for extreme measures. And this is the power I have to use in the interim until we are able to have the legislature get back in January and pass legislation that mandates this.”
As Florida plans to end all vaccine mandates, Western states form vaccine alliance

Previous FDA policy recommended that COVID-19 vaccine booster shots be made available to anyone 6 months or older regardless of their health status. But in August, the federal agency announced restrictions for the new shot.
The FDA limited access to the vaccines to people who are 65 and older and to younger people with at least one underlying health condition, such as asthma or obesity, that would put them at risk of developing a severe illness without a booster shot. Children are eligible only if a medical provider is consulted. Additionally, the Pfizer vaccine, one of the three that were approved, will no longer be available for any child under 5.
“The American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media platform X on Aug. 27.
Other states are also taking measures to ensure more people can get access to the vaccines.
On Thursday, Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey ordered health insurers in the state to continue covering the vaccine. The state also issued an order to allow pharmacies to continue providing shots to residents above the age of 5.
Massachusetts is “leading efforts to create a public health collaboration with states in New England and across the Northeast committed to safeguarding public health as the federal government backs away from its responsibilities,” the governor’s office said in a release.
This week, the State Board of Pharmacy in Pennsylvania held a special meeting to vote to bypass federal vaccine recommendations and allow pharmacists to continue administering COVID-19 vaccines.
“Health care decisions should be up to individuals — not the federal government and certainly not RFK Jr. My Administration will continue to protect health care access for all Pennsylvanians,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said.
Colorado and New Mexico took similar steps this week, with state officials signing public health orders asking state agencies to take steps necessary to require insurers to cover the vaccines and instructing pharmacists to provide the shots without a doctor’s note.

“Just because you can doesn’t mean you should,” Cox said on Thursday during a National Press Club event in Washington, D.C. “As the Republican Party in Utah, not listening to people, that’s why this has gotten them so fired up. Because they did run an initiative and they felt like they’re being ignored.”

Cox spoke alongside Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, discussing issues like bipartisanship, the deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities and declining trust in government institutions. 
The governor’s comments on Utah’s redistricting case came toward the end of the hour-long discussion — and on the heels of a major political shakeup in Utah. 
Last week, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson ruled the Utah Legislature violated the state constitution in 2021 when it overturned a voter-approved ballot initiative that created an independent redistricting commission meant to prevent partisan gerrymandering. 
A judge has ruled Utah’s congressional map unconstitutional. What now?

Known as Proposition 4, lawmakers repealed and replaced it with a new law in 2021, turning the commission into an advisory body — the legislature then decided to adopt its own congressional map, ignoring the commission’s recommendations. Several groups then sued the legislature and were handed a victory on Aug. 25. 
Now, following Gibson’s ruling, the Utah Legislature must publish new maps that adhere to the guidelines outlined in the ballot initiative. 
“I do disagree in this case, this is a really tough one,” Cox said. “Democrats in our state desperately want a district, even though Republicans outnumber them three to one in the state. The only way to get a Democratic district in the state is to gerrymander.” 
Still, Cox had a warning for politicians of all stripes. 
“There is nothing in the history of our country that makes people angrier and makes them lose trust than when they feel like the government is not being responsive to them,” Cox said.

The event also came in the wake of controversial redistricting decisions in other states. Texas Republicans recently approved new congressional maps despite not yet reaching the 10-year mark that coincides with the U.S. Census, when redistricting typically occurs. The move has been widely condemned by Democrats as an attempt to give the GOP extra seats in the U.S. House, and prompted California politicians to try and redraw their own maps to favor Democrats in order to offset Texas. 
It’s yet another reason for voters to lose faith in government, Cox said. 
“I share the concerns of my colleague, Gov. Moore, I hate gerrymandering, and I especially hate doing it twice in 10 years,” Cox said. “That’s the only thing worse than doing it every 10 years. And so there has to be a better way.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250821_GovPressConf_1005_re-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 14:57:34.776119

State Rep. Eric Bell, a Jonesboro Democrat who served in the U.S. Navy, criticized Kemp’s decision in a phone interview Friday and described it as a threat to American freedom and a return to feudalism.
Rep. Eric Bell. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“This isn’t the America that I was promised in social studies. This isn’t the America that I bought into as a veteran who defended this country. I’m all out of thoughts and prayers. Time for action.” Bell said, calling for people to stay united and vigilant against authoritarianism.
After Trump said that he may deploy troops to New Orleans, Bell said it’s “only a matter of time” before troops are deployed in Atlanta.
D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb sued the Trump administration Thursday over the ongoing presence of National Guard troops in Washington, arguing the deployment amounts to a military occupation and violates the district’s right to self-rule.
According to the state department of defense, up to 16 support staff from the Georgia Guard were sent this week to Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling to serve as medical, physician assistant and military police support staff. A larger deployment of 300 Georgia Guard soldiers is scheduled to mobilize in mid-September, but the timing is subject to change.
The Georgia Guard is joining more than 2,200 National Guard members from seven other states to provide support to D.C. law enforcement. Louisiana, South Dakota, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi and South Carolina have sent troops to the nation’s capital. 
The troops, who may be armed, will have a visible presence in the city, with their specific duties determined by the needs of their law enforcement partners, according to a press release.
Kemp’s office stated that there are more than 14,000 soldiers in the Georgia National Guard and that the deployment “will not impact its ability to support the state in the event of an emergency,” but Bell said the Georgia’s National Guard should instead focus on local issues, such as helping those affected by recent storms and ensuring school safety rather than being deployed elsewhere.
“I think our National Guard needs to come home and to protect and not intimidate our students as they go to school, as they are witnesses to massacres across the nation, in the state, by right-leaning, conservative, typically MAGA-supporting individuals.

The Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus filed a writ Thursday with the 19th Judicial District Court that alleges Murrill is not upholding her constitutional duty to defend laws the legislature passes. She is instead arguing against the constitutionality of the congressional district map lawmakers approved last year in order to advance Republican political interests, according to the filing. 
The lawmakers ask the court to force Murrill to either resume defending the map or take no position. 
After previously defending the map, Murrill effectively switched sides and joined the white voters who challenged the constitutionality of the map once their case was scheduled for new arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“For purely political purposes, to assist efforts by the National Republican Party to maintain control of Congress in the 2026 mid-term elections, Attorney General Murrill has now flipped her position in the Supreme Court … and now on behalf of the State of Louisiana asserts [the map] is unconstitutional,” the Black Caucus’ petition reads. 
At issue is a new congressional map the Legislature adopted last year that includes two majority Black districts, including a new one that stretches from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, slashing across the center of the state. The map is currently before the Supreme Court in the case Callais v. Louisiana, in which the white plaintiffs argue race determined the boundaries of the new 6th Congressional District.

Officials from the state’s largest food banks said earlier this month that charities and other programs will have less food to feed longer lines of hungry people, especially with 40,000 New Mexicans expected to lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the new Congressional spending bill.
Vasquez warns Republican SNAP cuts will hit rural areas hardest

Rural programs will take a particularly big hit, employees from the Farmington-based nonprofit Economic Council on Helping Others Inc., said.
Nicknamed ECHO Inc., the group offers rental assistance and help with bills; operates a preschool; supplies back-to-school supplies for low-income families and feeds more than 7,000 households in Northeastern New Mexico through its food bank.
ECHO Inc. Associate Director Paula Gerthing said the food bank is the organization’s largest program, distributing nearly 2 million pounds of food in the last year for families. That includes 10,000 meals for kids and about 4,000 seniors.
Tami Jenkins, who directs the food bank, told lawmakers federal cuts earlier this spring amounted to just over $88,000, requiring the food bank to scramble to meet demand.
“That is 15,000 meals that we’ve had to somehow come up with and supplement what was expected to be there,” Jenkins said.
ECHO Inc. will lose 100% funding in fiscal year 2026 from a 90-year-old U.S. Department of Agriculture program used to purchase surplus eggs, milk and meat. In total, the end of the program will axe about $551,000 for ECHO Inc., amounting to a gap of 450,000 pounds of food.
Jenkins said that’s about seven months of food that will be lost.
“Once again, we’re gonna have to do fundraising and whatnot in order to fulfill that 450,000 pounds of food that we’re gonna miss,” she told lawmakers.
Additionally, the Trump Administration canceled $2.8 million in USDA funds for the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, a “very popular” program that helps farmers deliver regional produce to food banks, schools and senior centers, New Mexico Department of Agriculture Marketing and Development Director Jason New said.
New Mexico Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) requested Thursday’s speakers share their challenges with lawmakers during the upcoming special legislative session in October, with the hope of addressing the program losses sooner than next year’s regular session
“We know our food banks have been hit extremely hard,” Romero said. “I want to be sure that cuts to both NMDA and the recent federal legislation and discussion of some of the budget issues and those implications are considered for the special session going in.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-05 17:45:42+00:00,Mississippi Today,PSC moves toward placing Holly Springs utility  into receivership,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/05/psc-moves-toward-placing-holly-springs-utility-into-receivership/,The Mississippi PSC voted unanimously to ask a chancery judge to place the troubled Holly Springs Utility Department into the hands of a third party.,"NEW ALBANY — After five hours in a courtroom where attendees struggled to find standing room, the Mississippi Public Service Commission voted to petition a judge to put the Holly Springs Utility Department into a receivership.
The PSC held the hearing Thursday about a half hour drive west from Holly Springs in New Albany, known as “The Fair and Friendly City.” Throughout the proceedings, members of the PSC, its consultants and Holly Springs officials emphasized there was no precedent for what was going on.

The city of Holly Springs has provided electricity through a contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority since 1935. It serves about 12,000 customers, most of whom live outside the city limits. While current and past city officials say the utility’s issues are a result of financial negligence over many years, the service failures hit a boiling point during a 2023 ice storm where customers saw outages that lasted roughly two weeks as well as power surges that broke their appliances.
Those living in the service area say those issues still occur periodically, in addition to infrequent and inaccurate billing.
“I moved to Marshall County in 2020 as a place for retirement for my husband and I, and it’s been a nightmare for five years,” customer Monica Wright told the PSC at Thursday’s hearing. “We’ve replaced every electronic device we own, every appliance, our well pump and our septic pumps. It has financially broke us.
“We’re living on prayers and promises, and we need your help today.”

Another customer, Roscoe Sitgger of Michigan City, said he recently received a series of monthly bills between $500 and $600. 
Following a scathing July report by Silverpoint Consulting that found Holly Springs is “incapable” of running the utility, the three-member PSC voted unanimously on Thursday to determine the city isn’t providing “reasonably adequate service” to its customers. That language comes from a 2024 state bill that gave the commission authority to investigate the utility. 
The bill gives a pathway for temporarily removing the utility’s control from the city, allowing the PSC to petition a chancery judge to place the department into the hands of a third party. The PSC voted unanimously to do just that.

Thursday’s hearing gave the commission its first chance to direct official questions at Holly Springs representatives. Newly elected Mayor Charles Terry, utility General Manager Wayne Jones and City Attorney John Keith Perry fielded an array of criticism from the PSC. In his rebuttal, Perry suggested that any solution  — whether a receivership or selling the utility — would take time to implement, and requested 24 months for the city to make incremental improvements. Audience members shouted, “No!” as Perry spoke.
“We are in a crisis now,” responded Northern District Public Service Commissioner Chris Brown. “To try to turn the corner in incremental steps is going to be almost impossible.”

It’s unclear how much it would cost to fix the department’s long list of ailments. In 2023, TVPPA — a nonprofit that represents TVA’s local partners — estimated Holly Springs needs over $10 million just to restore its rights-of-way, and as much as $15 million to fix its substations. The department owes another $10 million in debt to TVA as well as its contractors, Brown said. 
“The city is holding back the growth of the county,” said Republican Sen. Neil Whaley of Potts Camp, who passionately criticized the Holly Springs officials sitting a few feet away. “You’ve got to do better, you’ve got to realize you’re holding these people hostage, and it’s not right and it’s not fair… They are being represented by people who do not care about them as long as the bill is paid.”
In determining next steps, Silverpoint Principal Stephanie Vavro told the PSC it may be hard to find someone willing to serve as receiver for the utility department, make significant investments and then hand the keys back to the city. The 2024 bill, Vavro said, doesn’t limit options to a receivership, and alternatives could include condemning the utility or finding a nearby utility to buy the service area.

Answering questions from Central District Public Service Commissioner De’Keither Stamps, Vavro said it’s unclear how much the department is worth, adding an engineer’s study would be needed to come up with a number. 
Terry, who reminded the PSC he’s only been Holly Springs’ mayor for just over 60 days, said there’s no way the city can afford the repair costs on its own. The city’s median income is about $47,000, roughly $8,000 less than the state’s as a whole.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04140235/3X0A7131.jpg,,,2025-09-05 13:57:51.528589

The ACLU of New Mexico alleges a DACA recipient is being held there “indefinitely.” (Photo by Santana Ochoa / Source NM)A 28-year-old father of four with longstanding legal deportation protections is being held in New Mexico’s largest immigration detention center without cause, according to a lawsuit filed recently in New Mexico federal court.
Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira has lived in the United States for most of his life and received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection, according to lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and Singleton Schreiber LLP, a private national firm with a New Mexico presence working with the ACLU. 
DACA is a status conferred through a 2012 federal law that affords immigrants who were brought to the United States as children protection from being deported for renewable two-year periods. 
Gamez Lira is a father of four and married to a United States citizen. According to the lawsuit, as well as surveillance video obtained by news outlet ElPasoYa, masked federal immigrant agents arrested him in his driveway in Horizon City, Texas, on Aug. 13 with two of his children in the car. The arrest resulted in a dislocated shoulder, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday names Homeland Security Kristi Noem and US Attorney General Pam Bondi, along with other federal officials and Dora Castro, the Otero County Processing Center warden. No defendant has yet responded in court. 
Earlier this summer, a spokesperson for DHS told NPR that DACA recipients “are not automatically protected from deportations” and that they should leave the United States voluntarily. 
Gamez Lira is being held at the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico, a facility that houses the majority of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees held in New Mexico. The ACLU alleges he faces “indefinite detention” at the facility, according to the news release. 
“Paulo has worked hard to build a dignified and meaningful life in the United States. He is a committed father of U.S. citizen children, and this is the only home he has ever known,” said ACLU-NM Senior Staff Attorney Becca Sheff in a statement. “It’s unconscionable for the government to hold Paulo indefinitely in an ICE detention center known for dangerous and degrading conditions, especially since his status as a DACA recipient protects him from being deported.”  
Emails provide new details on how NM lawmakers’ ICE lockup visit went off the rails

The lawyers filed a similar petition on behalf of Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago, another 28-year-old DACA recipient, who has been held in detention in West Texas for more than a month, according to the news release. The petitions allege the detainees are being held in violation of their constitutional rights to due process, along with other violations. 
A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on both cases.
The detention center where Gamez Lira is held has an average daily population of about 850 ICE detainees, according to the latest figures. A group of mostly Republican lawmakers visited the facility recently, part of an effort to push their Democratic colleagues and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham not to ban ICE detention facilities in New Mexico. 
The governor’s spokesperson told Source on Thursday evening in an email that potential legislation banning ICE detention facilities will not be on the agenda for a special session she scheduled for Oct. 1. However, it is among other topics that could be on the agenda for the 30-day session beginning early next year, according to the spokesperson.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSCF3975-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 13:57:51.528589

(Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator)The LSU Board of Supervisors has limited its power to influence faculty and staff hiring decisions after quietly giving themselves the ability last year. 
The board last year expanded its own bylaws to require its chair be made aware of “any search committees for new hires” and allows — but does not require — the chair to appoint members to the committees. The bylaws do not limit the chair’s number of appointees or require they have any specific qualifications. 
Search committees are used for nearly every faculty hire, as well as for deans, department chairs and administrators. Taken to its extreme, the new rule could allow the chair to stack any search committee and steer it to a preferred outcome. 
The board chair is hand-selected by the governor. After backlash from LSU faculty and staff, who raised concerns the new rules could introduce political influence to the hiring process, the board adopted rules that limit the scope of the new bylaws. 
The chair will still be made aware of all searches, but the new language limits the board’s ability to influence searches to high-level administrators, such as the president, chancellor, vice presidents and deans.

The company had already been investigating that possibility.","In summary
Federal prosecutors say faulty Edison equipment sparked the January wildfire that burned 8,000 acres. The company had already been investigating that possibility. 




The U.S. Department of Justice this week sued Southern California Edison, alleging the utility’s equipment caused the deadly Eaton Fire that swept through Los Angeles County in January. An official cause of the fire has not yet been released.
Its civil lawsuit is seeking reimbursement for the costs of containing the fire and rehabilitating 8,000 burned acres of Angeles National Forest. 
“SCE knew about the potential danger posed by the high wind event and the risks posed by power and transmission lines but failed to take action to prevent it from igniting a fire,” the lawsuit said.
Putting out the fire, the department said in the lawsuit, cost more than $40 million, and the damage will require substantial effort to rehabilitate.
As support for its claim that the fire was caused by utility equipment, the Justice Department cited public statements made by Pedro Pizarro, CEO of the utility’s parent company, including a January statement where Pizarro said that without more evidence, “we believe that SCE equipment could have been associated with the ignition.”
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Los Angeles County Fire Department are still investigating the official cause of the fire. But Edison has said its transmission lines at Eaton Canyon had an increase in electrical current when the fire began and that one idle line may have been reenergized. The Los Angeles Times reported that the utility changed its policy on how such structures are grounded after the fire. Before, grounding procedures were decided by engineers on a case by case basis; after, they were laid out based on the type of equipment and the material the equipment is made of. 
The Justice Department also filed a second lawsuit against the company over the 2022 Fairview fire, similarly asserting Southern California Edison was responsible. 
“We’re reviewing these lawsuits and we’ll respond through the appropriate legal channels,” Southern California Edison spokesperson Kathleen Dunleavy said. “Edison continues our work to reduce the likelihood of SCE’s equipment from starting a wildfire.”
The federal lawsuit comes weeks after Southern California Edison announced a voluntary program that will allow those affected by the fire to submit a claim for a more expedient payout in an effort to curb lawsuits, according to its website, many of which have already been filed against the utility. Victims of the fire saw this as a way to short larger payouts.
“The Justice Department’s lawsuits demonstrate Southern California Edison’s willingness to endanger California families through an unconscionable pattern of negligence,” Kiley Grombacher, co-founder of the California Fire Victims Law Center. “The pattern has cost lives, destroyed homes, and left entire communities contaminated",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/010825_Eaton-Power-Lines_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 13:57:51.528589

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s employment agency is spending $13 million for an online tool meant to act as “the world’s most knowledgeable guidance counselor” for high schoolers in the state.
The Department of Employment and Workforce will use the funds — $10.3 million in one-time money and $2.8 million in new annual dollars — to hire an outside contractor to build and maintain what the agency is calling an “Education and Workforce Portal.”

The tool is mandated by legislation passed in May 2023 that reshuffled oversight of the state’s workforce development efforts. The measure, spearheaded by state House Speaker Murrell Smith, moved workforce-related duties from the state’s economic development agency to the agency that aids unemployed workers.
The Sumter Republican’s office says, once the portal is operational, “South Carolinians will have a one-stop resource that connects education, training, and workforce needs in a way we’ve never had before.”
The online portal will have two main parts:

A section for K-12 schools and colleges to compare the curriculum they teach to what skills companies say they need workers to have
And a section for students and job seekers with information on in-demand occupations

What exactly that will look like remains to be seen. But the Department of Employment and Workforce has been testing out ideas on its Find Your Future website, said agency spokeswoman Mary Kate Olivas.
According to Smith’s office, the speaker envisions a place where students and their parents can log in and see exactly how much a certain college degree or certificate will cost, how long it will take to complete the degree, financial aid options to help pay for it, a list of job opportunities available in the area where they want to live and the salaries they can expect to make after graduation.
“Together, these tools help families make smarter decisions, help businesses find skilled workers, and keep more of our talent right here at home,” a statement from the speaker’s office read.
Here’s how many are graduating from SC colleges with in-demand degrees. It’s not enough.

“We must align educational offerings with employment opportunities, otherwise we’re wasting money and setting students up for failure by training them for jobs that don’t exist,” the statement continues. “This tool makes sure families see which programs actually lead to good jobs, and it helps schools adjust curricula to meet real employer needs.”
At the heart of the legislation passed two years ago is a push to increase the state’s labor force participation rate, which lags behind much of the nation.
South Carolina’s rate was 58.6% in July, compared to a national rate of 62.2%.
Labor force participation is the percentage of the population, age 16 and older, that is either working or actively seeking work. Because the calculation does not figure for those people who are retired, South Carolina’s heavy retiree population tends to hold down the state’s rate.
When only considering those people of prime employment age — age 25 to 54 — South Carolina’s rate is 81.1%, according to the latest available data. That’s 2.5 percentage points below the U.S. average.
Meanwhile, more South Carolinians are working now than ever before as the state’s population continues to grow. As of July, nearly 2.5 million people were estimated to be employed in the Palmetto State, according to state Employment and Workforce Executive Director William Floyd. That’s nearly 5,000 more people working compared to the month prior.
Still, more than 70,000 job openings are posted to the agency’s online database.

Among those openings are:

A senior software engineer with three years experience to work for an investment management company in Fort Mill, making $123,000 to $133,000 a year.
There’s a medical robotics company in Augusta seeking to hire a technician who can fix and train medical professionals on its robots, with a $85,000 annual salary.
A bank in Lexington is looking for a recruiter to work in its HR department, making $28,000 to $42,000 a year.
A Myrtle Beach engineering firm needs an electrical engineer and is offering a salary of $100,000 to $114,500.
An engineering firm in Greenville is offering $49,000 to $79,000 for a geologist.
A Charleston insurance company is looking for a salesperson, with a salary of $49,000 to $74,000 annually.

The Department of Employment and Workforce website also has data that could be useful to companies considering a South Carolina location, including the percentage of students from each high school who enrolled in college the fall following graduation and what those students chose to major in. 
Nearly 60% of all South Carolina public high school seniors went on to college after graduation between 2015 and 2022, although there were differences based on location. In Fort Mill, for instance, 78% went to college, while in Jasper County it was less than 33%.
The most popular area of study was healthcare, with more than 5,300 students seeking degrees in that field. Almost 5,000 students sought business degrees. About 2,000 went into education.
According to the speaker’s office, having all this information in one place rather than scattered among different agencies is what makes the proposed portal useful. But the portal alone isn’t enough to boost the state’s workforce.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Homelessness among Florida families rose by 28% in the last three years, a report from the University of Florida found. 
The 2025 Rental Market Study conducted by UF Shimberg Center for Housing Studies found that rent for multifamily units in Florida rose by 39% between 2019 and 2023, as 1 million households entered the state. 
“Florida’s strong population growth has collided with limited housing supply, pushing rents beyond what many families can afford,” said Anne Ray, manager of the Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse at the Shimberg Center.
According to the report, an estimated 904,000 renting households earn less than 60% of the median income and pay more than 40% of their income on housing.
“Florida’s not any different than most places and we saw the extreme rise in rents going back to the pandemic days and things have remained high as production pretty much came to a grinding halt for that period of time,” Florida Housing Coalition CEO Ashon Nesbitt told the Phoenix.
The state added more than 240,000 multifamily units between 2019 and 2023 while median rents rose by almost $500 per month, or 39%, from $1,238 to $1,719, the report found. 
Renting households include at least one employed adult in 79% of units. In households occupied by their owners, 67% are working.

“We’re still not producing as quickly as the need is overall,” Nesbitt said, adding that there’s a “great need” for rental options for people making below 80% of the median income. 
“Financially, it’s difficult to produce units at that level, and so with the lack of units affordable at that level, the overall lack of supplies, we have high rent costs, and the reduction in that supply is relating to that growth in those that are now becoming homeless,” Nesbitt said. 
The study found the largest inflow of residents to the state stretched from St. Johns County to Lee County.
Homelessness on the rise
The report, using Department of Housing and Urban Development and Florida Department of Education data, estimates 29,848 individuals in Florida are homeless, 6,049 of whom are unaccompanied youth.
The report estimates that 41,847 families are doubled up with others or staying in hotels and motels. 
The 2025 homelessness numbers represent a 14% increase for individuals and 28% increase for families since the 2022 report.

Nesbitt said that “down the line” there will be more supply as projects drawing on trust funds, the Live Local Act, land-use tools, and property tax exemptions are built. 
“When the units that are being produced aren’t necessarily matching where the greatest need is, that’s why we have this growing gap,” Nesbit said. 
As conversations ramp up about eliminating property taxes, Nesbitt said he expects people to consider how it will affect low- to-moderate-income homeowners and how it can be done equitably, based on income and other factors.  
“Many of the folks that are experiencing that instability are part of our workforce. Most of the folks that this [report] calls out, these are folks that are working jobs and working many of the jobs that power our state’s economy,” Nesbitt said. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that voters will be able to decide whether they want to pay property taxes or not during the 2026 election. He said his office is researching how it can be done.
“The demand for affordable housing is not new to most households in Florida. As inflation and cost of living continue to increase, the cost of housing and other necessary basic needs of individuals continue to be a financial challenge,” Florida TaxWatch CEO Dominic Calabro said in an update about the Live Local Act. 
The Live Local Act was a 2023 measure that gave tax breaks to developers creating multifamily residential properties for people making around or below the median income.
TaxWatch recommended the Legislature create tax credits for building homes affordable for “middle income” families, credits to adapt historic properties, and a low-income housing tax credit for rental properties to augment federal credits. 
The Florida Policy Institute advocated for restoration, too. 
“It is typically cheaper to rehabilitate a unit or building than to construct one from scratch. Including rehabilitation and improvement costs in the tax exemptions would increase and maintain the supply of affordable housing, and support climate resilience, respectively,” FPI said in a report released during the last legislative session.
A bill, SB 184, that would have required local governments to create local rules allowing accessory dwelling units, or granny flats, died this session.

(Photo courtesy of Golden campaign)A group of bipartisan representatives, including U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, introduced a bill late Thursday to extend health insurance subsidies through 2026. 
The legislation had been in the works prior but was announced the same day that Gov. Janet Mills asked Maine’s congressional delegation to extend the tax credit to insulate thousands of Mainers from steep increases in health insurance premiums next year.
Golden, a Democrat, is a co-sponsor of the Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act, introduced by Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, which would extend the credit by one year, past the 2026 midterms.
While not likely to be passed as a standalone measure, supporters are hoping that the backing of some moderate Republicans could increase the likelihood of the proposal being included in a potential continuing resolution to avoid a looming government shutdown. 
The enhanced premium tax credit, which is scheduled to expire at the end of the year, lowers the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. In Maine, about 61,000 people are enrolled through the state marketplace, CoverME.gov.
Mills calls on Congress to extend tax credit to help Mainers afford health insurance

The credit was established by the Affordable Care Act and then expanded twice, during the COVID-19 pandemic under the American Rescue Plan Act and then through the Inflation Reduction Act. Those laws were championed by Democrats with no Republican support. 
“Letting the ACA Enhanced Premium Tax Credits expire would raise costs on Maine families. That’s simply not an option,” Golden said in a statement Friday.
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson of Louisiana didn’t reject the idea of an extension, providing his first in-depth comments on the issue to Punchbowl News on Thursday. 
“I don’t think the policy is great,” Johnson said. “I don’t think we should be subsidizing high-income earners. It was a Covid-era issue, and so that’d be a big thing for the Republican Party to continue or advance that. At the same time, we don’t want anyone to be adversely affected by that.”
Thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117% if the tax credits are not extended, Mills warned in her letter to Maine’s congressional delegation. 
Superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance Robert Carey attributed next year’s increased premium costs to the instability of federal policies, including the expiring credits and the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Other factors include the growing costs of medical services and prescription drugs.

Last year, the Michigan Department of Attorney General brought several charges against Bright Spark Strategies co-founder Heather Lombardini, following an investigation into an alleged dark money scheme in which two nonprofits – Michigan! My Michigan! and Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility – funneled $2.6 million into the Unlock Michigan campaign, which aimed to repeal the emergency powers Gov. Gretchen Whitmer utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lombardini faces three misdemeanor charges and a felony for allegedly failing to file campaign finance disclosures while acting as both the treasurer for Michigan! My Michigan! and president of Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility. She is alleged to have encouraged wealthy business people and political funds tied to large businesses to donate to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility with the intention of moving that money to support Unlock Michigan’s signature gathering efforts.
Lombardini was one of two individuals charged as a result of the investigation, with the other, Sandy Baxter, accepting a plea deal from the attorney general’s office, which led to a sentence of three months of reporting probation, 20 hours of community service and a $2,500 fine.
Attorney General Dana Nessel announced charges related to Unlock Michigan, Feb. 21, 2024 | Anna Liz Nichols
Lombardini’s case is ongoing, with a pretrial conference scheduled for Sept. 17 in Lansing’s 30th District Court. 
Despite her pending criminal charges, Lombardini and her consulting firm remain a force in assisting political groups with fundraising and financial compliance matters.
Lombardini is listed as the sponsorship contact for the Michigan Republican Party’s upcoming leadership conference on Mackinac Island, and received praise from MIGOP Ethnic Vice Chairman Michael Farage for assisting with the party’s Kentucky Derby fundraiser. 
Neither Lombardini nor the party responded to a request for comment. 
According to campaign finance records, Lombardini serves as the treasurer on candidate committees for several elected officials in the state including state Rep. Curt VanderWall (R-Ludington), Nancy Jenkins-Arno (R-Clayton) Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), Ken Borton (R-Gaylord) and University of Michigan Regent Sarah Hubbard.

She also previously served as a consultant on former State Rep. Andrew Fink’s (R-Adams Township) 2024 campaign for Michigan Supreme Court.
VanderWall, Jenkins-Arno, Hoadley, Borton and Hubbard did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Lombardini.
Lombardini also serves as the treasurer for several political action committees including funds tied to Michigan officeholders, including the VanderWall Majority Fund, Borton Leadership, McBroom for Michigan, Gina Majority Fund and Neyer Leadership Fund, linked to VanderWall, Borton, Sen. Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan), and Reps. Gina Johnsen (R-Odessa Township) and Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd).
While Neyer and Johnsen did not respond to a request for comment, McBroom offered his support for Lombardini calling her “one of the hardest working and most competent fundraisers in Lansing.”
“She has worked very hard for me and countless others to help us follow ridiculously convoluted and confusing campaign finance and non-profit laws. This case is not the first time our current [Secretary of State] has twisted those laws into new pretzels in order to harass her political opponents or help her friends,” McBroom said in an email. “It’s been transparent from the start the true target is not even Heather but former Republican leaders. Until a court says I can’t, I will proudly keep utilizing Heather’s good counsel and exceptional help.”
Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake), April 20, 2022 | Laina G. Stebbins
Former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) held ties to both Michigan! My Michigan! and Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, however he did not hold titles in either organization. Under these circumstances, Nessel told reporters while announcing the charges that the current laws didn’t warrant any charges against Shirkey.
The complaint which launched the investigation was brought by Robert LaBrant, an attorney and longtime former Republican government affairs strategist and consultant, and Mark Brewer, a campaign finance and election attorney at Goodman Acker who previously served as chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.
While Bright Spark Strategies is widely utilized by GOP candidates and causes, Lombardini has also been tapped by candidates and committees where she is not serving as the treasurer including candidate committees for Sen. Mark Huizenga (R-Walker) and Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen) and the Hauck Majority Fund, tied to State Sen. Roger Hauck (R-Mount Pleasant). 
Campaign finance records show Huizenga’s candidate committee paid Lombardini $95.20 for campaign travel and expenses for printing a sponsor board for a fundraising event on April 17. 
Roth’s candidate committee and the Hauck Majority Fund also reimbursed Lombardini for campaign mileage for events held earlier this year.
Huizenga, Hauck and Roth did not respond to a request for comment. 
Neil Thanedar, executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, said it’s the responsibility of candidates to make sure the individuals they hire to help run their PACs and other committees are doing so ethically. 
“If the people who are doing the work to remain in compliance aren’t compliant themselves, that’s a big issue, right?” Thanedar said. 
Tommy Kubitschek, a spokesperson for the Michigan Democratic Party slammed Republicans for working with Lombardini in light of the charges filed against her. 
“Republicans at every level have made it clear that they are more than willing to work with criminals and will always put their own interests ahead of Michiganders. Any Republicans still working with Lombardini should find themselves a new fundraiser,” Kubitschek said in a statement.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump administration investigates Medicaid spending on immigrants in Democratic states,Associated Press and Angela Hart | KFF Health News,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/blue-state-medicaid-investigation-immigrants/,"Federal officials have sent letters to state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington.","The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn’t any waste, fraud or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press. While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services, such as prescription drugs and specialty care.
The federal agency told the states it is reviewing claims as part of its commitment to maintain Medicaid’s fiscal integrity. California is the biggest target after the state self-reported overcharging the federal government for health care services delivered to immigrants without legal status, determined to be at least $500 million, spurring the threat of a lawsuit.
“If CMS determines that California is using federal money to pay for or subsidize healthcare for individuals without a satisfactory immigration status for which federal funding is prohibited by law,” according to a letter dated March 18, “CMS will diligently pursue all available enforcement strategies, including, consistent with applicable law, reductions in federal financial participation and possible referrals to the Attorney General of the United States for possible lawsuit against California.”
The investigations come as the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress slashed taxpayer spending on immigrant health care through cuts in President Donald Trump’s spending-and-tax law passed this summer. The administration is also pushing people living in the U.S. illegally off Medicaid rolls. Health policy experts say these moves could hamper care and leave safety net hospitals, clinics and other providers financially vulnerable. Some Democratic-led states — California, Illinois and Minnesota — have already had to end or slim down their Medicaid programs for immigrants due to ballooning costs. Colorado is also considering cuts due to cost overruns.
At the same time, 20 states are pushing back on Trump’s immigration crackdown by suing the administration for handing over Medicaid data on millions of enrollees to deportation officials. A federal judge temporarily halted the move. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, who led that challenge, says the Trump administration is launching a political attack on states that embrace immigrants in Medicaid programs.
“The whole idea that there’s waste, fraud and abuse is contrived,” Bonta said. “It’s manufactured. It’s invented. It’s a catchall phrase that they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda.”
Trump administration targets immigrants
Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.
Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country illegally.
The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.
Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”
“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states. The oversight is intended to “ensure federal funds are reserved for legally eligible individuals, not for political experiments that violate the law,” she said.
Health policy researchers and economists say providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants for preventive services and treatment of chronic health conditions staves off more costly care for patients down the road. It also tamps down insurance premium increases and the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals and clinics.
Francisco Silva, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association, said the Trump administration is threatening to drive up health care costs and make it more difficult to access care.
“The impact is emergency rooms would get so crowded that ambulances have to be diverted away and people in a real emergency can’t get into the hospital, and public health threats like disease outbreaks,” Silva said.
California has taken a health-care-for-all approach, providing coverage to 1.6 million immigrants without legal status. The expansion, which was rolled out from 2016 to 2024, is estimated to cost $12.4 billion this year. Of that, $1.3 billion is paid by the federal government for emergency and pregnancy-related care.
As California rolled out its expansion, the state erroneously billed the federal government for care provided to immigrants without legal status — details that have not previously been reported and that former state officials shared with KFF Health News and the AP. The state improperly billed for services such as mental health and addiction services, prescription drugs and dental care.
Jacey Cooper, who served as California’s Medicaid director from 2020 to 2023, said she discovered the error and reported it to federal regulators. Cooper said the state had been working to pay back at least $500 million identified by the federal government.
“Once I identified the problem, I thought it was really important to report it and we did,” Cooper said. “We take waste, fraud and abuse very seriously.”
It’s not clear whether that money has been repaid. The state’s Medicaid agency says it does not know how CMS calculated the overpayments or “what is included in that amount, what time period it covers, and if or when it was collected,” said spokesperson Tony Cava.
California has an enormously complicated Medicaid program: It serves the largest population in the nation — nearly 15 million people — with a budget of nearly $200 billion this fiscal year.
Matt Salo, a national Medicaid expert, said these types of mistakes happen in states throughout the country because the program is rife with overlapping federal and state rules. Salo and other policy analysts agreed that states have the authority to administer their Medicaid programs as they see fit and root out misuse of federal funds.
And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Trump administration’s actions “persecute a minority that’s unpopular with the powers that be.”
“The Trump administration cannot maintain that this effort has anything to do with maintaining the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program,” Cannon said. “There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.”
Immigrants’ Medicaid under attack
National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.
The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.
“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”
States under review say they are following the law.
“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.
Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.
Emails show Illinois officials met with CMS and sought an extension to share its data. CMS denied that request and federal regulators told the state that its funding could be withheld.
“Thousands of Illinois residents rely on these programs to lawfully seek critical health care without fear of deportation,” said Melissa Kula, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, noting that any federal cut would be “impossible” for the state to backfill.

Jeff Landry delivers his address to state lawmakers on opening day of the regular legislative session, Monday, March 11, 2024, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (John Ballance/The Advocate, Pool)The Louisiana Board of Ethics on Friday dropped formal charges against Gov. Jeff Landry for failing to disclose flights he took on a political donor’s private plane while he was attorney general. 

Instead, Landry agreed to admit publicly to six instances in which he failed to disclose roundtrip travel he took on political donors’ private planes and helicopters as attorney general. The board also fined the governor $900, though Landry could have faced tens of thousands of dollars of fines for failing to disclose the complementary travel. (Read the consent opinion below)
The Illuminator has reached out to the governor’s office for comment.
In a separate but related decision, the board also told Landry that he must report when and where he accepts free travel and lodging as governor, though his attorneys had suggested it shouldn’t be a requirement.
As attorney general, Landry accepted flights to and from Hawaii in June 2021 from Station Aviation, a company owned by retired oil and gas businessman Greg Mosing. Landry traveled to the Attorney General Alliance conference, where he was a featured speaker, at the Grand Wailea Maui, a luxury beachfront resort.

The ethics board used the Hawaii flights as the basis of the charges they filed against Landry in 2023 and dropped this week. Until Friday, it wasn’t publicly known that the ethics board and Landry were in discussions about disclosing five other flights on aircraft that had been provided by donors. 
Lawyers for Landry had sought an advisory opinion from the ethics board as to whether he must report any complimentary travel and lodging he accepts as governor. Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies, who represented Landry before the ethics board, suggested Landry shouldn’t have to fill out the required forms because he is the “head of the agency” who obviously approves his own travel.
State ethics administrator David Bordelon said he has provided guidance to the governor and other state agency heads to clarify instructions on the forms. 
Louisiana’s ethics code prohibits elected officials and state employees from accepting anything of value as a gift if the giver has “substantial economic interests” over which the public employee has influence. The forms are required to verify there is no conflict of interest when an official accepts a gift.  
The decision to drop the charges against Landry was made in conjunction with the new guidance on travel disclosure forms, Bordelon told board members. It ends more than two years of deliberations with Landry’s attorneys since the charges were filed.
There’s additional significance in Friday’s decision as it comes from an ethics board that now consists of members the governor and Republican-led legislature have appointed directly. They voted last year to expand the board from 11 to 15 members, which allowed Landry and lawmakers to seat seven new members. Previously, the governor and legislators had to pick ethics board members from a list of recommendations leaders of private Louisiana universities submitted.

Esto es lo que debe saber.,"Traducción por Jorge Alatrista, Identidad Latina Multimedia.

Read this story in English.
Los niños de Connecticut ya han vuelto a la escuela y a primera vista, el gobierno estatal está realizando una inversión sin precedentes en su educación este año.
Sin embargo, si bien la subvención de Costos Compartidos para la Educación (ECS), la fórmula que representa la principal asistencia operativa del estado para los distritos escolares locales, destinará casi $2.5 mil millones a los distritos locales este año fiscal, más del 10% del Fondo General, los críticos afirman que el programa ha ido a la zaga de la inflación durante años, lo que ha agravado las enormes disparidades en la financiación escolar entre las comunidades ricas y pobres.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre un problema que ha desconcertado a legisladores, gobernadores y tribunales durante décadas.
¿Cómo funciona la fórmula ECS?
Si bien nunca ha logrado la paridad en la financiación escolar, la fórmula ECS está diseñada para acercar a Connecticut a la igualdad.
Y comienza con un nivel básico, asumiendo que educar a un estudiante en Connecticut cuesta aproximadamente $11,525.
A partir de ahí, la fórmula ajusta el gasto por alumno en función de la cantidad de estudiantes que un distrito atiende provenientes de hogares de bajos ingresos. Se centra especialmente en los alumnos que pueden recibir comidas gratuitas o a precio reducido o que hablan inglés como segundo idioma.
También considera la riqueza de una ciudad o pueblo de dos maneras: el valor de sus propiedades imponibles y los ingresos de sus residentes.
Con la esperanza de fomentar la cooperación y el ahorro por eficiencia, el estado también ofrece una bonificación a los pueblos que envían estudiantes a distritos escolares regionales.
¿Ha tenido siempre el estado la fórmula ECS?
Históricamente, Connecticut dejó que las ciudades y pueblos dependieran principalmente de los contribuyentes locales para financiar la educación primaria y secundaria. Y si bien el estado desarrolló algunas de las comunidades más ricas y algunas de las más pobres del país, su enfoque en la financiación escolar se mantuvo inalterado.
Sin embargo, la Corte Suprema de Connecticut, en su fallo histórico de 1977 en el caso Horton contra Meskill, determinó que un sistema de financiación disfuncional violaba el derecho a la educación garantizado en la Constitución estatal. Sin embargo, los jueces también concluyeron que crear un enfoque más equitativo era tarea de la legislatura.
Anticipándose a este fallo, la legislatura había actuado en 1975 para crear el primer sistema ponderado de subvenciones estatales, la fórmula de Base Imponible Garantizada (GTB). Este sistema se modificó para convertirse en el sistema de Costos Compartidos de Educación en 1988, cuando los legisladores fusionaron este programa con un esfuerzo continuo por aumentar los salarios de los docentes en todo el estado.
Ni la legislación de la GTB ni la del ECS garantizan que todos los distritos gocen de la misma financiación, mediante una combinación de fondos provenientes de impuestos locales sobre la propiedad y el aumento de las subvenciones estatales. Y Connecticut nunca ha logrado tal paridad.
¿Qué factores han afectado a la fórmula del ECS?
La deuda de pensiones de Connecticut a menudo ha obstaculizado la financiación equitativa de la educación.
Los gobernadores y las legislaturas desde finales de la década de 1930, no ahorraron lo suficiente para estas prestaciones, lo que dejó al estado con una deuda de miles de millones de dólares. Para la década de 1990, las contribuciones obligatorias a las pensiones comenzaron a aumentar significativamente, absorbiendo recursos que podrían haberse destinado a la educación y otros programas.
Esto no se estabilizó hasta 2017, cuando las autoridades comenzaron a refinanciar la deuda de pensiones, extendiendo los planes de pago y traspasando parte de la deuda a las futuras generaciones de contribuyentes.
Los legisladores tomaron otras dos medidas clave ese mismo año: crear nuevos límites presupuestarios para aumentar los superávits, que se utilizarían para pagar la deuda de pensiones aún más rápido; y ordenar un plan plurianual para reforzar el ECS.
Pero las pensiones recibieron una porción mucho mayor del pastel presupuestario.
Desde 2017, los superávits han promediado más de 1,800 millones de dólares al año. El programa ECS ha aumentado unos 450 millones de dólares con respecto a hace ocho años, y los críticos afirman que el crecimiento es demasiado modesto para compensar décadas de estancamiento en la financiación.
¿Ha seguido la fórmula del ECS el ritmo de la inflación?
No.
El Proyecto de Financiamiento Escolar y Estatal, un grupo de políticas educativas con sede en Connecticut, estima que el sistema ECS distribuiría $99 millones adicionales este año fiscal si solo el nivel básico se ajustara para reflejar la inflación.
La Conferencia de Municipios de Connecticut (CCM) lanzó una campaña publicitaria en marzo atacando al Gobernador Ned Lamont, un gran defensor de los programas de ahorro existentes. La CCM estima que las subvenciones del ECS, ajustadas a la inflación, han disminuido en más de $400 millones desde que Lamont asumió el cargo en 2019.
“Se les pide a los líderes locales que hagan más con menos, y los líderes estatales deben ser honestos sobre los desafíos que enfrentan nuestras comunidades”, declaró Joe DeLong, director ejecutivo y CEO de la CCM. “Es hora de soluciones reales que proporcionen financiación estable, predecible y suficiente para nuestras ciudades y pueblos, no solo temas de debate político”.
Lamont replicó que ha intentado aumentar la ayuda a la educación y al gobierno general para los municipios, mientras que al mismo tiempo reduce decenas de miles de millones de dólares en deuda de pensiones que heredó.
“Mis presupuestos priorizaron importantes inversiones en ayuda municipal porque esa financiación va más allá de garantizar que nuestras ciudades únicas sean lugares increíbles para vivir, sino porque apoya la educación de nuestros hijos y les brinda la mejor oportunidad desde el comienzo de su vida”, declaró Lamont en marzo.
¿Qué es la ‘exención de responsabilidad’ y cómo afecta al ECS?
Y mientras los funcionarios estatales intentan equilibrar la ayuda municipal y las obligaciones de pensiones, un tercer problema también oscurece el futuro del programa ECS.
¿Tendrá Connecticut que empezar a recortar las becas educativas de algunas comunidades para aumentar las de otras?
Durante décadas, legisladores y gobernadores se han resistido en gran medida a esta opción, incluso si la fórmula del ECS exigía que un distrito sufriera un recorte debido a su gran riqueza, la disminución de la matrícula estudiantil o una combinación de factores.
Este enfoque de “exención de responsabilidad” — garantizar que ningún distrito recibiera menos fondos estatales en el año que el anterior — se puso a prueba la primavera pasada.
Lamont recomendó que los legisladores mantuvieran la fórmula adoptada, aumentando el programa en más de $80 millones en 2025-26, pero permitiendo que más de 80 comunidades recibieran menos fondos y, en conjunto, perdieran poco menos de $10 millones.
Sin embargo, la Senadora Estatal Cathy Osten, Demócrata por Sprague y copresidenta del Comité de Asignaciones, pidió a los legisladores que mantuvieran la “exención de responsabilidad” por ahora, argumentando que la fórmula del ECS es defectuosa y, de lo contrario, perjudicaría a muchos pueblos rurales pobres de su distrito en el condado de New London.
Muchas comunidades rurales pobres, caracterizadas por un alto desempleo, un alto número de casos de asistencia pública y tasas de impuestos locales sobre la propiedad, tienen una población estudiantil en declive. Sin embargo, señaló Osten, la mayoría son de tamaño mediano a grande geográficamente. Esto significa que, incluso si sus escuelas pierden algunos estudiantes, no pueden reducir costos fácilmente fusionando clases o cerrando escuelas.
“Eso significa que esas comunidades no cuentan”, dijo Osten.
Los legisladores finalmente optaron por salvar a esos más de 80 distritos de los recortes del ECS durante otros dos años fiscales, pero se espera que reanuden pronto el debate sobre la “exención de responsabilidad”.

,DC,2025-09-05 15:43:51+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump campaigned on closing the Education Department. Reality is more difficult.,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-campaigned-closing-education-department-reality-more-difficult,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s aim to shutter the Education Department faces steep hurdles in Congress, where Republicans’ legislative efforts to abolish the agency remain stalled and appropriators have rejected many of his proposed cuts to education spending.After campaigning last year on a pledge to shut down the department, Trump came into office promising to follow through, and made some preliminary moves.He said he wanted Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “put herself out of a job” and signed a sweeping executive order in March calling on her to facilitate the closure of the Education Department to the extent she is permitted to by law.He won a key victory in the U.S. Supreme Court in July that temporarily cleared the way for the administration to move ahead with mass layoffs at the agency, a plan to dramatically downsize the department outlined in that March executive order and his directive to transfer certain services to other agencies. Court documents show that the department is planning to bring back more than 260 Office for Civil Rights staff affected by those sweeping layoffs stemming from a separate legal challenge against the administration’s actions earlier this year. But after a dizzying array of cuts and changes in the months since Trump took office looking to dismantle the agency, the GOP-controlled Congress — the only body that can abolish the 45-year-old department it created — is throwing up roadblocks to elimination.Bills stalledFor starters, the handful of GOP bills in Congress to close down the department face a difficult path in the Senate, which requires at least 60 senators to advance most legislation. Republicans hold just 53 Senate seats. In the House, at least four Republicans — Thomas Massie of Kentucky, David Rouzer of North Carolina, Barry Moore of Alabama and Nathaniel Moran of Texas — have introduced bills this year to eliminate the department. Those bills were referred to the House Committee on Education and Workforce, which has not voted on any of them. In a brief interview at the Capitol on Sept. 3, the committee’s chair, Michigan Republican Tim Walberg, said he still intended to eventually dismantle the agency, but had not committed to any particular bill.“Our intentions are to ultimately dissolve the Department of Education — we know we have to do that in a way that makes sense and so, we’ll take a look at all bills,” Walberg told States Newsroom. “I can’t say whether they will all come up or not, but we know that, working with the secretary of Education, we’re going to right-size it, and some things we’ll eliminate, other things we’ll shift, as we’ve done already, over to the Department of Labor to take on some workforce areas,” the Michigan Republican said. The chair acknowledged that there would not be enough votes in the Senate to abolish the agency. “So what we can do that seems right for our students, for our parents and for our teachers, we’ll do,” Walberg said. GOP efforts to dismantle the department are also underway in the Senate. Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, alongside Sens. Jim Banks of Indiana and Tim Sheehy of Montana, reintroduced a measure in April to abolish the agency. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul also reintroduced a bill in March with Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Bernie Moreno of Ohio to shutter the department. The measure is a companion bill to Massie’s legislation. A spokesperson for Sen. Bill Cassidy, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said the Louisiana Republican is “working with the administration and colleagues on how Congress can best codify the President’s reforms into law,” in a statement to States Newsroom.The spokesperson noted that “President Trump and Republicans are committed to returning education authority to local communities best equipped to meet the needs of students and families.” Senate rebuffs Trump spending cutsThe administration’s attempts to dramatically scale back funding for the department in fiscal 2026 have not been met with much enthusiasm by appropriators in the Senate. The House and Senate Appropriations committees share jurisdiction over the bill to fund the department for the coming fiscal year. The Senate committee advanced a bipartisan bill in July, which largely rejects Trump’s proposed cuts to education spending and his attempt to dismantle the department. The bill tightens requirements for the department to have the necessary staffing levels to fulfill its statutory responsibilities and prevents the agency from transferring certain programs to other federal agencies. The legislation also allocates $79 billion in discretionary funding for the coming fiscal year, roughly the same as the current level, which could be seen as a slap in the face to the administration’s budget request that called for $12 billion in spending cuts at the agency. House includes deep cuts but keeps Pell spendingMeanwhile, the House Appropriations subcommittee dealing with education spending advanced its spending proposal for the agency on Sept. 2, sending the bill to the broader panel. The bill aligns much more with the administration’s spending cut priorities and education agenda, calling for $67 billion in discretionary funding at the department.Part of the bill also reduces funding for Title I grants — which support school districts with high percentages of students who come from low-income families — by $5.2 billion, according to a summary from committee Republicans. The majority notes that “despite outsized investment, America’s public schools continue to fail children and families.”But spending proposals in both the House and Senate reject the administration’s request to significantly reduce the maximum award for the Pell Grant, a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college. Instead, each proposal maintains the maximum award at $7,395. House and Senate appropriators have several steps to go before they can even reach the negotiating phase on the bill — which also includes spending on other agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services — and get it closer to becoming law.It’s possible there might not even be a final agreement for months as lawmakers struggle to come to an overall agreement on how much to spend in the coming fiscal year, but the Senate’s bipartisan plan might give that chamber more of an advantage if those negotiations take place.",,,,2025-09-05 11:59:47.259514
,California,2025-09-05 15:36:54+00:00,CalMatters,Breakthrough on California housing could put taller buildings in single-family neighborhoods,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/09/california-housing-near-transit/,A powerful California construction union is no longer fighting a bill that would ease barriers to the construction of tall apartment buildings near train and bus stations.,"In summary
A powerful California construction union is no longer fighting a bill that would ease barriers to the construction of tall apartment buildings near train and bus stations.


A controversial housing bill that would pave the way for more apartment buildings near major bus stops and train and subway stations across urban California is one step closer to becoming law after its author struck a last-minute deal with a long-time political foe, one of the state’s most powerful labor groups. 
The State Building and Construction Trades Council, which represents union construction workers, agreed to drop its opposition to Senate Bill 79 in exchange for an amendment that would require some of the projects that make use of the bill to hire union workers. 
The bill, authored by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, would be one of the largest state-imposed housing densification efforts in recent memory. On residential and commercial lots within a walkable half-mile of well-trafficked public transit stops, developers would be allowed to build taller and denser housing — as high as six stories. That would apply in neighborhoods where local regulations restrict new development to single-family homes. 
Wiener and backers of the bill argue that the state needs to turbo-charge housing construction to bring down the cost of living in California and that local zoning restrictions are among the barriers to that necessary building boom.
“This is exactly where we should be building more housing, right by our highest quality transit,” Wiener said.
Since Wiener rolled out the bill in March it has become a magnet of controversy. SB 79 only squeaked out of the Senate, clearing the opposition of two powerful Democratic committee chairs on its way, who largely objected to the fact that the bill did not include larger affordable housing requirements. The trades’ decision to withdraw from the fight significantly boosts the bill’s chances of becoming law.
“You hear from legislators all the time trying to be on the same side as the housing folks and the same side of labor — they don’t like when those sides are split,” said Louis Mirante, a lobbyist with the Bay Area Council, a business group that is backing the bill. “The trades removing their opposition is always helpful when you’re trying to pass a housing bill. That’s pretty cut and dry.”
Backed by “Yes in my backyard” activists, economic development boosters and public transit advocates, the bill has been fiercely opposed by neighborhood preservation groups, critics of market-rate development and a long list of local governments — including most recently, Los Angeles — who argue that the bill tramples on local prerogatives over what gets built and where.
Throughout that legislative gauntlet, the Trades Council have also been opposed. Not anymore.
“My hope is that this can be the beginning of shifting the dynamic where we’re all locking arms,” said Wiener. “We all want more housing. We all want more construction workers to be part of the middle class and not in poverty.”
Wiener, California YIMBY founder Brian Hanlon and Trades Council president Chris Hannan announced a deal on Friday morning. 
Under the terms of the deal, projects over 85-feet tall would be required to hire “skilled and trained” workers — effectively a hire-union requirement — if the developer receives a sufficient number of bids. Projects built on transit agency-owned land would likewise need to meet that requirement or enter into a direct contract with labor unions.
Over the last decade, the trades council has developed a reputation as a particularly well-organized and unyielding opponent of bills that ease restrictions on residential construction unless they also include broad minimum pay levels or union hiring requirements. The amendments announced today represent a step back from that all-or-nothing position. Most projects over 85 feet, for example, use concrete and steel frame construction, which require a higher skilled labor force that is often unionized anyway. 
This isn’t the first time this year that the trades have been willing to take less than a full victory in exchange for dropping their opposition to a bill. When the Legislature was debating a proposal to exempt most new urban multifamily housing from the state’s premier environmental protection law, the trades accepted a concession that provided wage and hiring requirements for a small subset of projects.
The fact that California YIMBY and the trades council were in direct communication Could itself represent a notable political shift in the way that housing bills are negotiated in the capitol.
“Chris (Hannan) and I really have been spending a lot of time on this bill to the point where, quite frankly, some members of my coalition thought I was chasing at windmills,” said Hanlon of California YIMBY. “This bill here represents not just a deal on the specific language of SB 79, but it’s also a commitment from me and Chris to work together in the coming years to pass legislation to create more homebuilding opportunities in California.”
SB 79 still needs to be voted on by the entire Assembly and then once again by the Senate before the end-of-session Sept. 12 legislative deadline. If Gov. Gavin Newsom then signs it, it would be a particular feat for Wiener, who has tried and failed to pass similar legislation twice before. 
“The bill is not guaranteed to pass, but we have more momentum today than we did yesterday,” said Wiener.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/052423-Santa-Monica-Construction-ZS-CM-21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 11:59:47.259514
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 15:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The gender gap in math widened in the pandemic,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/gender-gap-stem-pandemic/,Efforts to close the gender gap in STEM education are gaining momentum after setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Crowded around a workshop table, four girls at de Zavala Middle School in Irving, Texas, puzzled over a Lego machine they had built. As they flashed a purple card in front of a light sensor, nothing happened.
The teacher at the Dallas-area school had emphasized that in the building process, there is no such thing as mistakes. Only iterations. So the girls dug back into the box of blocks and pulled out an orange card. They held it over the sensor and the machine kicked into motion.
“Oh! Oh, it reacts differently to different colors,” said sixth grader Sofia Cruz.
In de Zavala’s first year as a choice school focused on science, technology, engineering and math, the school recruited a sixth grade class that’s half girls. School leaders are hoping the girls will stick with STEM fields. In de Zavala’s higher grades — whose students joined before it was a STEM school — some elective STEM classes have just one girl enrolled.
Efforts to close the gap between boys and girls in STEM classes are picking up after losing steam nationwide during the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools have extensive work ahead to make up for the ground girls lost, in both interest and performance.
In the years leading up to the pandemic, the gender gap nearly closed. But within a few years, girls lost all the ground they had gained in math test scores over the previous decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. While boys’ scores also suffered during COVID, they have recovered faster than girls, widening the gender gap.
As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed — and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.
Old practices and biases likely reemerged during the pandemic, said Michelle Stie, a vice president at the National Math and Science Initiative.
“Let’s just call it what it is,” Stie said. “When society is disrupted, you fall back into bad patterns.”
The pandemic upended progress toward closing the gender gap
In most school districts in the 2008-2009 school year, boys had higher average math scores on standardized tests than girls, according to AP’s analysis, which looked at scores across 15 years in over 5,000 school districts. It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.
A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.
Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.
A separate study by NWEA, an education research company, found gaps between boys and girls in science and math on national assessments went from being practically non-existent in 2019 to favoring boys around 2022.
Studies have indicated girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, plus more caretaking burdens than boys, but the dip in academic performance did not appear outside STEM. Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.
“It wasn’t something like COVID happened and girls just fell apart,” said Megan Kuhfeld, one of the authors of the NWEA study.
Initiatives to boost girls’ confidence in STEM lost traction
In the years leading up to the pandemic, teaching practices shifted to deemphasize speed, competition and rote memorization. Through new curriculum standards, schools moved toward research-backed methods that emphasized how to think flexibly to solve problems and how to tackle numeric problems conceptually.
Educators also promoted participation in STEM subjects and programs that boosted girls’ confidence, including extracurriculars that emphasized hands-on learning and connected abstract concepts to real-life applications.
When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City. Girls were significantly more engaged after the district moved some of its introductory hands-on STEM curriculum to the lower grade levels and balanced classes by gender, he said.
When schools closed for the pandemic, the district had to focus on making remote learning work. When in-person classes resumed, some of the teachers had left, and new ones had to be trained in the curriculum, Rodrequez said.
“Whenever there’s crisis, we go back to what we knew,” Rodrequez said.
Bias against girls in STEM persists
Despite shifts in societal perceptions, a bias against girls persists in science and math subjects, according to teachers, administrators and advocates. It becomes a message girls can internalize about their own abilities, they say, even at a very young age.
In his third grade classroom in Washington, D.C., teacher Raphael Bonhomme starts the year with an exercise where students break down what makes up their identity. Rarely do the girls describe themselves as good at math. Already, some say they are “not a math person.”
“I’m like, you’re 8 years old,” he said. “What are you talking about, ‘I’m not a math person?’”
Girls also may have been more sensitive to changes in instructional methods spurred by the pandemic, said Janine Remillard, a math education professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Research has found girls tend to prefer learning things that are connected to real-life examples, while boys generally do better in a competitive environment.
“What teachers told me during COVID is the first thing to go were all of these sense-making processes,” she said.
A school district renews its commitment
At de Zavala Middle School in Irving, the STEM program is part of a push that aims to build curiosity, resilience and problem-solving across subjects.
Coming out of the pandemic, Irving schools had to make a renewed investment in training for teachers, said Erin O’Connor, a STEM and innovation specialist there.
The district last year also piloted a new science curriculum from Lego Education. The lesson involving the machine at de Zavala, for example, had students learn about kinetic energy. Fifth graders learned about genetics by building dinosaurs and their offspring with Lego blocks, identifying shared traits.
“It is just rebuilding the culture of, we want to build critical thinkers and problem solvers,” O’Connor said.
Teacher Tenisha Willis recently led second graders at Irving’s Townley Elementary School through building a machine that would push blocks into a container. She knelt next to three girls who were struggling.
They tried to add a plank to the wheeled body of the machine, but the blocks didn’t move enough. One girl grew frustrated, but Willis was patient. She asked what else they could try, whether they could flip some parts around. The girls ran the machine again. This time, it worked.
“Sometimes we can’t give up,” Willis said. “Sometimes we already have a solution. We just have to adjust it a little bit.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25234138668131-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 16:57:26.565921

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)In a win for unions, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a lawsuit this week challenging Minnesota’s ban on mandatory anti-union meetings.
The ban, which passed as part of a sweeping pro-labor agenda in 2023, was long sought by union leaders who argue captive audience meetings give employers an unfair advantage in organizing campaigns.
“All working people should have the freedom to choose whether to form a union at their workplace without interference or intimidation from their employer,” said Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham in a statement celebrating Wednesday’s ruling.
Two non-union contractor associations — the Minnesota Chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors and the National Federation of Independent Business — and Laketown Electric Corporation challenged the ban, arguing in a lawsuit filed in federal court  last year that it violates employers’ First Amendment right to free speech and contradicted the National Labor Relations Act.
The state hadn’t tried to enforce the ban, but the contractors argued the law created a “chilling effect “that prevented them from exercising their constitutional rights. In the lawsuit, Laketown Electric said it was one of the fastest growing companies in Minnesota, and “is frequently targeted by union organizing efforts, creating the need to communicate lawfully with its employees on this important topic.”
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Department of Labor and Industry Commissioner Nicole Blissenbach, named as defendants in the suit, moved to dismiss the lawsuit arguing they didn’t have sufficient connection to the ban to be sued over it.
The law largely leaves enforcement to employees, who have the power to sue their bosses if they are forced to attend captive audience meetings. Blissenbach and Ellison said they never threatened to enforce the ban and had no “present intention” to.
Gov. Tim Walz was later added as a defendant after he told a packed ballroom at the North America’s Building Trades Unions conference that, “Those captive, anti-union meetings … You go to jail now if you do that in Minnesota because you can’t intimidate people.”
No one can be jailed for violating the ban, and asked about the comment, Walz’s spokeswoman replied he “was just emphasizing a point about a law we passed.”
A Minnesota district court judge allowed the lawsuit to proceed in part based on that statement, finding that it contradicted Ellison’s statement that he had no intent to enforce the ban.
In a 2-1 ruling, Appeals Court Judges Jonathan Kobes and Ralph Erickson ruled that Ellison, Blissenbach and Walz were not sufficiently connected to enforcement action to bring a lawsuit because Blissenbach and Walz cannot enforce the ban and Ellison had no intention to.
Ellison called the ruling a “win for working people” in a statement reminding employees that they have the right to refuse to attend anti-union meetings.
Minnesota Chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors President Adam Hanson said he is disappointed in the ruling and considering an appeal.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P1229848-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 11:59:47.259514

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Fresh off a court victory ordering the “Alligator Alcatraz” migrant detention center to remain open, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that Baker County’s “Deportation Depot” is in operation.
“Deportation Depot,” a DeSantis-coined moniker, occupies the old Baker County Correctional Facility north of Gainesville. The center can hold up to 2,000 people and opened Tuesday, the governor’s office confirmed to The Florida Phoenix.
It’s “receiving” migrants as of Friday.
“We’re not only doing Alligator Alcatraz, we’ve now opened the Deportation Depot up in Northeast Florida, and we’re working on opening a Panhandle Pokey in northwest Florida,” DeSantis said Thursday night on FOX News.
The announcement came hours after a federal appeals court sided with DeSantis by pausing a lower judge’s order that would have dismantled the Everglades facility and blocked it from receiving more migrants by September’s end.
The 2-to-1 decision by the Atlanta-based court was a massive victory for DeSantis and top GOP leaders, who had touted the first-in-the-nation center as a powerful buttress in President Donald Trump’s sweeping anti-undocumented immigration agenda.
DeSantis first announced plans for “Deportation Depot” in mid-August, a month and half after the Everglades facility hosted Trump and other top federal authorities for a grand opening event.
The new center’s opening comes weeks after The Associated Press first reported that Alligator Alcatraz, located firmly within the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve, was nearly empty. Molly Best, a spokesperson for the governor, said that added migrant facilities in different Florida regions facilitates quicker deportations.
The “Panhandle Pokey” is a third center planned by the state government in western Florida. DeSantis has yet to select a location or timeframe for it’s opening.
“You know, you’re in the Panhandle sending to Alligator Alcatraz, that’s a long way. Even sending to the Deportation Depot in North Florida, that could be three to five hours depending on where you are in the Panhandle,” DeSantis said at a press conference earlier this week.

Throughout my career in the Marine Corps, logistics has always underpinned every operation — from training exercises to overseas combat tours to planning for future conflicts. Weapons, material, fuel and other supplies that our troops rely upon are delivered across thousands of miles of ocean, principally by ship.
I can assure you, the 70-ton M1A1 tanks I commanded in Fallujah in 2007-08 did not arrive by cargo plane. These vital war supplies, along with troop transport, are delivered by the U.S. Merchant Marine.
Not to be confused with the Marine Corps of which I served, the Merchant Marine is composed of civilian mariners and both commercial and federal-owned ships. In peacetime, the Merchant Marine carries domestic and international cargo. During conflict, the mariners become a critical component of the military logistics system. Unfortunately, the Merchant Marine is facing mounting challenges that threaten its ability to fulfill this role.
Maritime commerce plays an essential role in the global economy and the economic security of the United States.
Compared to China, our principal maritime competitor, the U.S. Merchant Marine fleet is smaller and is rapidly aging beyond its service limits. Compounding this issue is a dwindling number of shipyards, a shrinking shipbuilding workforce and a significant shortfall of qualified civilian mariners. This erosion poses a direct threat to the readiness and resilience of our defense and commercial supply chains.

The University of Southern Mississippi, however, is uniquely positioned to help address this challenge. With a strong affiliation with the maritime industry, the proximity of its Gulf Coast campus to naval bases, and the state’s only ocean engineering program, USM could take a transformative step by establishing the Mississippi Maritime Academy.
Civilian mariners are vital to the nation’s sealift capacity, which ensures the rapid transportation of military and humanitarian supplies during crises. The Merchant Marine also supports global commerce, with roughly 90% of world trade moving by sea. However, the U.S. pool of licensed mariners is aging, with many nearing retirements, and the recruitment pipeline is not keeping pace.
The Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the Department of Defense have repeatedly warned of this national security risk.
In response, MARAD published its “Mariner Workforce Strategic Plan” in 2023 (revised in 2025) and has designated 32 Centers of Excellence for Domestic Maritime Workforce Training and Education to help prepare students for various roles in the maritime industry. Notably, two of the inaugural centers are Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College and Hinds Community College — evidence that Mississippi is already contributing to maritime workforce development.
Currently, new merchant marine officers are sourced through the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, as well as six state maritime academies in Texas, California, Michigan, Maine, Massachusetts and New York. These state academies receive limited federal assistance through the Navy-sponsored Strategic Sealift Midshipman Program (SSMP), as well as training vessels to support their unique licensing and curriculum requirements. Similar to the traditional Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), the SSMP is tailored to develop a cadre of officers to operate merchant ships as naval auxiliaries and are commissioned as Strategic Sealift Officers in the Navy Reserve.
Yet even these combined efforts are not enough to meet the nation’s mariner needs. This poses a risk not only to the commercial sector, but to the Merchant Marine role as a military logistics reserve in conflict.
USM’s Gulf Coast campus offers a compelling solution. Its marine and ocean engineering programs provide a technical foundation that aligns perfectly with the needs of the maritime industry. Additionally, its proximity to key Gulf Coast naval installations, such as Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport and Naval Air Station Pensacola, presents opportunities for collaboration with the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard.
Furthermore, the Gulf Coast region supports a robust maritime industry, including shipbuilding, port operations and offshore energy. According to the Mississippi Development Authority, the maritime industries represent 22% of the local workforce in Mississippi’s coastal counties. Collaborations with these industries could enhance practical training opportunities for midshipmen.
This proposal is not without historical precedent. During World War II, the Merchant Marine Cadet Corps trained thousands of mariners at Pass Christian, Mississippi. The Pass Christian Cadet School, home of the Gulf Coast Cadet Corps, made a pivotal contribution to the Allied forces’ sealift capacity during the war. However, it was shuttered in 1950.
Reviving that legacy at USM by designating the Gulf Coast campus as the Mississippi Maritime Academy would honor Mississippi’s past while answering a strategic need.
Establishing a state maritime academy at USM would require coordination among the university, industry partners, state legislators and MARAD.
The Maritime Academy Act of 1958 outlines federal support eligibility, including requirements like mandatory Coast Guard licensing exams before graduation and accepting at least 10% out-of-state students. The governor may also request the assignment of Navy, Coast Guard or Maritime Service personnel as instructors and request access to a training vessel.
USM has the location, expertise and industry partnerships to lead the way. By leveraging these existing strengths, it can help secure America’s maritime future, strengthen its regional economy and contribute meaningfully to national defense.
Now is the time to act.

When hospitals close, communities reel. Even in well-covered Massachusetts, some regions of the state still struggle to access its nation-leading health care. And after decades of hospital consolidation, the system is staring down federal changes likely to make the hard job of providing care for underserved communities even more challenging.
The post Red li[...]","FROM THE CENTER of downtown Boston, getting to a hospital or health center can be as straightforward as walking a few blocks in any direction. Within 30 minutes of drive time from Tufts Medical Center, there are 23 other acute care hospitals, according to state data.  
In more far-flung regions of the state, a long drive or a patchwork of transit modes can stand between someone in need of health care and the place best able to provide it. Within 30 minutes of Berkshire Medical Center, the midsized nonprofit community hospital in Pittsfield across the commonwealth from Boston, there are no other acute care hospitals. Same for Cape Cod Hospital.  
While most health care analyses rank Massachusetts at the pinnacle of state health system performance – consistently sitting among the states with the best health care coverage and access, highest childhood vaccination rates, highest health insurance coverage, lowest infant mortality, and fewest premature avoidable deaths – geographic barriers persist. And the looming promise of Medicaid cuts – plus an already overburdened system in regions like southeastern Massachusetts, where staffing shortages and higher rates of uninsurance are exacerbating health care costs – casts a pall over the comparatively sunny overall health stats. 
“We know that patients face many barriers to accessing care, and geographic distance is one of those barriers,” said Amie Shei, president and CEO of the Worcester-based Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts. “It’s not simply the number of miles from point A to point B along a straight line, it’s the particular options this person has access to.” (Shei is on the board of MassINC, CommonWealth Beacon’s publisher.) 
The state has several ways to measure and identify geographically vulnerable medial areas. One measure tracked by the Department of Public Health is health workforces shortages, which is often a measure of geographic vulnerability because people in areas with fewer doctors and health resources have fewer care options within a reasonable distance. Five Massachusetts regions are federally designated as geographic areas with a shortage of providers: Dukes County, a combined stretch of Hampden and Hampshire counties, Nantucket County, the North Quabbin region of Franklin and Worcester counties, and the Southern Berkshires. 
Similarly, the state has 46 “medically underserved areas” – geographic areas and with a lack of access to primary care services – almost all of which have held the designation for around three decades and are scattered across the state from Berkshire to Dukes counties in rural and urban centers.  
Travel and geography alone are not the main driver of access issues, but in a cost- and staff-strained health care environment, it’s a part of “all of the above” calculation that explains why Massachusetts residents sometimes go without care. 
Even if the direct financial hurdle to medical care can be cleared, someone may need to have family or friends who can give them a ride, or have public transit that’s reliable and can get the person near enough to their care facility in time, or secure child care while half a day is spent traveling to and from appointments. 
“All of this takes mental energy,” noted Shei. “It takes access to technology and being able to navigate a complex system. The more barriers you layer on, the more likely it is that someone may delay or forego care.”  
In the 1960s, Massachusetts boasted well over 100 hospitals, scattered around the state but still centered in Eastern Massachusetts. Through closures and consolidations, the number plummeted to just 65 acute hospitals in 2023, according to state data. While a few hospitals have re-opened since 2023, the Steward Health Care bankruptcy crisis revealed serious cracks in the system and led directly to community hospital closures in Boston and Ayer. 
Since the 1990s, the economic landscape of health care has experienced “rapid and continual change,” Cheryl Damberg, director of the RAND Center of Excellence on Health System Performance, testified before Congress in 2023. “Consolidation in the health care market is endemic and is happening in all parts of the health care delivery system. Across the United States, health care markets are dominated by a few large players, and the footprints of these players continue to expand.”  
Following a wave of consolidation in the early- and mid-1990s, there were 1,573 hospital mergers from 1998 to 2017 and another 428 hospital and health system mergers announced from 2018 to 2023, according to KFF research. The share of community hospitals that are part of a larger health system also increased from 53 percent in 2005 to 68 percent in 2022. 
“Hospitals are not interchangeable parts in a health care machine,” Boston University health care analysts Alan Sager and Deborah Socolar warned in 2002, advocating for saving the Deaconess-Waltham Hospital, which closed the next year. “They have deep ties to doctors, programs, patients, and communities.” 
In other words, when a hospital closes, it creates a chain reaction in the community. Nearby residents will need to find alternative health care providers. Experts like Sager and Socolar warn that ambulance travel time will increase, and emergency room and inpatient crowding will worsen at surviving hospitals. The more closures, the more strain. 
For those who can afford coverage and want to access it, geography can be a hurdle. Acute health care facilities remain tightly centered around the Greater Boston hub. This is, of course, the most populous region of the state, served by dense webs of public transit, and is home to dozens of hospitals, clinics, and educational institutions – the heart of the state’s famed meds and eds economy.  
Meanwhile, Southeastern Massachusetts and the Cape and Islands report some of the highest levels of uninsurance in the state, have fewer available ICU beds and acute care centers, and are afflicted by a clinician shortage more pronounced than the state as a whole. 
“Health care access issues are multifaceted, and residents in the Commonwealth can face compounding effects from challenges accessing their care on top of the known financial barriers to affording care,” said Health Policy Commission Executive Director David Seltz. “This leaves lower-income and rural families particularly vulnerable to delaying or foregoing needed care.” 
In its most recent report on access, released last June, the Center for Health Information & Analysis (CHIA) found that 41 percent of Massachusetts residents surveyed reported difficulty accessing care in 2023. The most common issue was an inability to get an appointment with a doctor’s office or clinic as soon as needed (25.6 percent), followed by issues getting appointments withs specialists (23.3 percent), the doctors’ office or clinic not accepting new patients (19.1 percent) or their insurance type (12.6 percent), and being unable to get an appointment due to transportation issues (4.4 percent). 
But the transit issues became much more pronounced as income levels drop and mobility or health issues worsen. More than one in 10 residents reported transportation-related difficulties if they had a family income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line ($44,367 for a family of four in 2025) or if they reported being in fair or poor health or having activity limitations. 
In its 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment, Baystate Franklin Medical Center, Franklin County’s only acute care hospital, identified “access to transportation arose as an overwhelming need” in the communities served by the facility. The 107-bed, not-for-profit hospital serves the most rural county in the state. Though the county’s regional transit authority covers the largest service area of the state’s RTAs – some 1,121 square miles – the medical center noted that bus routes do not reach the smaller towns and traveling by bus outside of the area requires transferring between regional transit authorities. (For the 118 residents of the tiny town of Monroe in the northwest corner of Franklin County, for example, the closest hospital for the past decade was Baystate Franklin Medical Center, only accessible by an hour-long car ride.) 
“Those without a car said they sometimes find they simply cannot get where they need to go when they need to get there or find themselves with long waits for the next bus to take them home,” the report stated. “The lack of transportation exacerbates inequities, as people miss out on education, work, and help in places they cannot reach without a car.” 
 A June 2024 presentation from the Health Policy Commission reviewing health access reports over the past 15 years noted similar findings. Residents of more rural regions faced physical barriers, such as available and affordable public transportation, to accessing needed substance use disorder treatment as instances of substance abuse spiked across the state. 
According to the commission’s research, commercially-insured residents living in the lowest-income areas of the state were much more likely to have no primary care visits than those living in higher income parts of the state, with the disparity especially pronounced among children. While geographic access to care may not be the only factor explaining this finding, the commission noted, it is likely an important contributor. 

Even as Gov. Maura Healey touted recent state health rankings from the Commonwealth Fund, which released its 2025 nationwide scorecard in June, the governor took note of the federal challenges that are looming. 
“Massachusetts is yet again the best state in the nation for health care,” she said in a statement at the time. Despite significant progress, “we know there is still more work to be done, especially as President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ are trying to take away health care from hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents. We’re going to continue our work to make sure everyone can access high-quality, affordable health care, and speak out against attempts to take us backwards.” 
Overall Rankings for 2025 Scorecard on State Health System Performance from The Commonwealth Fund report.
Despite the rosy outlook provided by think tank rankings – and before the cuts to Medicaid were threatening to exacerbate the gulf between the haves and have nots – digging below the surface of the state-level stats shows a Commonwealth in which residents face very different health care realities. 
Take, for example, the ratios of direct patient care physicians. In 2023, Massachusetts had 442 direct patient care physicians, who are usually paid directly for services rather than through insurance, per 100,000 residents, ranking first nationally compared to the national average of 278.0. But the spread by county was immense. Suffolk County, which includes most of Greater Boston’s many health institutions, boasts 1,277.4 direct patient care physicians per 100,000 residents, but several counties drop below the national rate. That includes Essex County with 219.2, Plymouth County with 173, Bristol County with 147.2, Franklin County with 143.6, to a low of 89.7 in Nantucket County. Similar gaps exist in primary care physician ratios. 
Although some regions have fewer health facilities available, the ratio of physicians remains above the national average even with significant geographic spread because the county population itself is lower.  
Measuring only by physicians per person or drive distance to a hospital, though a useful baseline, can miss the difficult realities of accessing care in very remote areas, forcing locals and their representatives into years-long fights for better care closer to home. 
This was the case for the North Adams area, perched in the northwest corner of the state in the far reaches of the 130,000-resident Berkshire County. After its regional hospital abruptly closed in 2014, the closure not only cut off residents from nearby health care. The Berkshire Eagle reported about 530 people lost their jobs in a matter of days. 
A long bureaucratic process stood in the way of the facility opening as a critical access hospital, which would make it eligible to get federal Medicaid and Medicare funding. It was technically too close to the Pittsfield hospital 40 minutes away by car and to the hospital in Bennington, Vermont, which is about 30 minutes away by car but 2 hours and 45 minutes by public transit.  
Since the site closed, locals and US. Rep Richard Neal advocated for about a decade for the federal classification that would bring care back to the areas. Neal said he finally was able to change the classification language because the mountainous area depends on a single lane highway, experiences difficult weather in the winter, and deeply needed a full-service critical access hospital. 
“Most of the stories, overwhelmingly, across America, are about hospital closures,” he said at the re-opening in 2024. “America’s got a real challenge with rural health care. Today we celebrate this opening against all odds; this return is for all of you in Berkshire County.” 

Though the loss of an entire hospital leaves a visible service dent in an area, contractions in specialized care areas also push patients to travel longer distances for services like maternity care or mental health supports. 
Since 2014, 11 hospitals in Massachusetts have closed or filed to close their maternity services, according to Health Policy Commission data, and two birth centers in Beverly and Holyoke have closed. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s policy center reported in 2024 that New England nursing home closures have outpaced the rest of the country since 2010, with Massachusetts losing almost 10,000 nursing homes beds by 2023.  
The loss of facilities often sparks furor from the surrounding communities, with mixed results. State officials opted not to save two former Steward Health properties – Nashoba Valley Medical Center and Carney Hospital – despite forceful objection. 
Attempted state budget belt tightening put the Pappas Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Canton, which serves disabled children, on the chopping block and would have redirected services and children. Though outcry halted the move for at least the next fiscal year, the facility’s long-term financial health is far from secure. 
But community hospitals and state officials alike are bracing for an increasingly grim financial picture after the 2026 midterms. 
In July, Congress passed and the president signed a sweeping tax and spend bill that cuts about $1 trillion of federal health spending over a decade, reversing efforts during prior Democratic administration to expand access through more robust Medicaid programming and the Affordable Care Act. 
Up to 203,000 more Massachusetts residents could be left without insurance because of the bill, according to a new Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation report, putting even more financial pressure on the institutions providing care. 
 On an episode of The Codcast in August, Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial Health, painted a grim financial picture. Unless efforts are made to roll back or adjust the proposed cuts, the tax bill could create a hole of more than $100 million for the system that would then have to be made up by program cuts or finding a way to increase revenue, Dickson said. 
“We’ll be greatly impacted by this,” he said. “How badly? Will they kick the can down the road? We don’t know? … We’re just doing everything we can to stay true to who we are, to shore up the organization as best we can today where we have an operating loss, such that we’ll be more prepared for what happens” next fiscal year. 
The week after that podcast, UMass Memorial announced more service cuts through its affiliate Community Healthlink, which provides mental health, substance abuse, and homelessness services anchored in Worcester. The Fitchburg adult mental health service BUDD, or Builds Understanding and Develops Direction, program will permanently close on October 23. 
In a statement, UMass Memorial Health said Community Healthlink “has spent the past several months assessing operations across its programs to support the organization’s long-term viability,” but the program “has struggled to maintain a consistent client census due to its specialized nature and closed referral system.” 
Baystate Health, the largest health care system in Western Massachusetts, runs some of the only major hospitals in more rural counties like Franklin. Its chief financial officer told The Boston Globe in July that, on top of recent staff cuts and significant financial loss, the medial group expects an annual loss of $30 to $50 million based on their analysis of the tax bill. 
Michael Curry, the president and CEO of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, said the tax bill creates a dire conundrum for the state’s health care system.

“It would be unsustainable without the federal partnership, the federal funds,” he told CommonWealth Beacon in May. “So, you cut programs, right? You might cut benefits, right?” Just because a person is pushed off Medicaid, he said, doesn’t mean the state is off the hook for costs, which only gets more expensive the more emergency services are used in place of regular care. 
Losing out on immediately and easily accessible health care facilities leaves gaps in essential care coverage. Geographic access issues also increase the odds that a patient would opt for an emergency room visit rather than seeking primary care. 
“Limited access to primary care can lead to potentially avoidable [emergency] and inpatient hospital use and associated higher spending, as well as worse patient outcomes, especially for patients managing chronic conditions,” the Health Policy Commission noted in January. “Patients with distance, transportation, or language barriers to accessing primary care are also more likely to use the [emergency department] for non-emergent conditions.” 
While Massachusetts rates among the top states for access and affordability – a combined category – in the Commonwealth Fund report, it ranks 35th in avoidable hospital use and cost. This measures factors including avoidable emergency room visits, preventable hospitalizations, employer-sponsored insurance and Medicare spending per patient, and primary care spending as a share of total health care spending. 
Some resources could, in theory, be accessible without needing to travel long distances from rural areas. 
Telehealth services expanded dramatically during the Covid-19 pandemic. Two thirds of behavioral health care visit were over telehealth in 2022, the Health Policy Commission found, but a 2023 report found that more could be done to increase access for more rural and vulnerable populations.  
Patients living in small town or rural areas were 8.3 percentage points less likely to use telehealth compared to urban residents, according to the report, and patients living in communities with better internet access were 5.5 percentage points more likely to be telehealth users. 
For those who must travel for appointments, or would simply prefer in-person care, high cost is the most obvious impediment. But hidden costs are still expensive – in effort, in time, in delayed recovery, in system strain. 
“Beyond system-wide obstacles like long wait times for appointments, difficulties or delays in receiving approvals for needed care, and increasing out-of-pocket costs and medical debt, even once an appointment is made, many patients struggle with barriers to accessing that care,” said Selz of the Health Policy Commission. “Individuals who cannot take time off during a workday or secure childcare for an appointment struggle to find providers who are available outside of regular business hours. Transportation – either trying to utilize public transportation or relying on support networks to get to appointments – can pose a real geographic challenge.” 
“These difficulties compound and make it harder for people to access the care they need,” he said, “deepening existing health disparities.”

The privately owned Vermont firm was founded in 2017, and has since emerged as a global leader in aerospace engineering, backed by contracts with UPS and the U.S. Department of Defense, among others. The company opened a 188,500-square-foot production facility in South Burlington in 2023, and also runs a battery testing site in St. Albans.
If the deal is approved, the new influx of capital will bring BETA’s total funding to nearly $1.5 billion. 
The equity investment from GE Aerospace will also give the legacy corporation the right to appoint a new director to BETA’s board.

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia’s highest court will take on a legal battle over the state’s school vaccination requirements, but it denied a request by state school officials that it do so quickly. 
The state Supreme Court on Thursday set a deadline of Dec. 12 for the West Virginia Board of Education to prepare its appeal of a Raleigh County judge’s July ruling against it. That ruling was in regards to a lawsuit brought by three Raleigh County families over the board’s refusal to accept religious exemptions to the state’s mandatory school vaccine requirements. 
Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble in July granted a preliminary injunction in the case that allows students in the case to attend class with a religious exemption to the vaccination requirements. 
The school board had filed notice of appeal and asked the high court to both expedite a review of the appeal and temporarily halt the proceedings in the lower court. 
In the scheduling order Thursday, the court denied both motions. Justices also set a deadline of Jan. 26 for the plaintiffs in the case to respond to the board’s appeal. The board will then have until Feb. 16, 2026 to write a reply, if necessary. 
After the Feb. 16 reply brief deadline, the court writes, the appeal will be ready for review. 
The Raleigh lawsuit is one case in a legal battle over religious freedom and the state’s strict school vaccination requirements. Every state requires school students to be vaccinated against a number of infectious diseases including polio, chicken pox and measles. Florida officials announced this week plans to eliminate its vaccine mandates. 
West Virginia has been one of only five states that have not allowed students to opt out of the shots because of their religious or philosophical objections to them. 
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his second day in office requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. His order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act. He argues that the religious freedom law, when read alongside the vaccination law, calls for the religious exemptions. 
Morrisey has not rescinded that executive order, even though the state Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have established those religious exemptions in state code. 
Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble has scheduled a two-day hearing next week on a  permanent injunction in the lawsuit, which he recently consolidated with a lawsuit brought against the state health department by two parents of immunocompromised students over its issuance of religious exemptions. Plaintiffs in that case are represented by the ACLU of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
The hearing is set for Sept. 10 and 11 at the Raleigh County Judicial Center. During that hearing, the judge has said he wants to consider issues that include whether the state’s vaccination law is constitutional without religious exemptions and the authority of Morrisey’s executive order.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden’s new draft legislation addresses many of the details of a proposed $650 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in Sioux Falls, but doesn’t address at least three areas of concern raised by lawmakers ahead of the Sept. 23 special session where they’ll consider the bill.
Those concerns were raised in the seven months since the collapse of an earlier, more expensive rural Lincoln County prison proposition during the regular legislative session:

The bill calls for competitive bidding on the project’s subcontracts, but would not seek bids for a new construction manager at-risk.
Neither the legislation nor Rhoden’s recently launched “Frequently Asked Questions” webpage contains a full accounting of millions of dollars already spent on the Lincoln County plan.
Questions remain about potential one-time construction-related costs and ongoing costs, such as road improvements at the prison site and the operational budget for a newer, larger facility.

Some see need for more bids
Lawmakers raised questions about the first issue during meetings of the state’s Project Prison Reset task force.
The governor convened that group in the aftermath of the February legislative vote that halted a plan to build an $825 million, 1,500-bed prison on a controversial site in rural Lincoln County.

The task force voted in July to back a plan for a 1,500-bed facility on undeveloped land in northeastern Sioux Falls. Its members also voted to cap the price of that prison at $650 million.
During the group’s final meeting in July, some members asked how many offers the state had when it first asked for a construction manager at-risk for the earlier, Lincoln County proposal. The answer was one — a bid from partners JE Dunn of Kansas City and Henry Carlson Construction of Sioux Falls.
House Speaker Pro Tempore Rep. Karla Lems, R-Canton, told South Dakota Searchlight she still has questions on why the state wouldn’t consider seeking bids for construction managers.
The specter of a Nebraska prison, being built for $313 million near Lincoln, was also an issue raised by the task force. The Rhoden administration, on its FAQ page, says the two facilities are too different for an apples-to-apples comparison.
Lems said Tuesday that lawmakers like her who weren’t on the task force need to know more about that.
“There’s just still so many questions that are swirling, whether it’s the cost, how they’re doing this in Nebraska, how come we only have one bid,” Lems said.
Sunk costs
Sen. Mike Rohl, R-Aberdeen, wasn’t on the task force, either, but said the state clearly needs a replacement for the oldest parts of the 144-year-old state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
That doesn’t mean he’s satisfied with what he knows just yet. Lawmakers voted to let the Department of Corrections use up to $60 million to prepare the Lincoln County site back in 2024. By the time they voted against further funding for the project in February, about $50 million of that money had been spent or obligated.
Prison leader quits as prison vote looms

The prison FAQ page says the state was able to get back a share of that money by reusing design elements in its updated, lower-cost Sioux Falls prison design, but the page still says that an accounting of total sunk costs “will be available in early September but will be less than the amount spent at the site.”
Rhoden’s office did not offer an update when asked by South Dakota Searchlight on Thursday.
His administration entered into a purchase agreement with the owners of a plot of land on Benson Road in Sioux Falls, near the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society, for the new prison.
The state would pay $12 million for the land. It would also transfer its Lincoln County land, for which it estimated a $4.5 million agricultural value, to the private landowners who are selling the Sioux Falls site to the state. When the state transferred the Lincoln County land to Department of Corrections control from the Office of School and Public lands back in 2023, it was appraised at around $8 million.
Rohl wants to know why the value changed, why the state didn’t consider putting the land up for purchase by other South Dakotans, and exactly how much cash went into the site the state would hand off in a swap.
“We obviously spent some money on it, and they can’t tell me how much,” Rohl said. “But since we spent money on it, now we’re listing it as worth $4.5 million as part of a trade? There’s something wrong there. I think that’s my biggest holdup at the moment.”
Roads, ongoing costs
During the legislative session, lawmakers pressed corrections officials on the cost to upgrade roads around the Lincoln County site, and to operate the facility once it was built.
The answers put the cost of building higher than the $825 guaranteed maximum price for construction, and became a sticking point prior to that plan’s rejection.
The FAQ page says “more staff will be needed” for the new prison, but that closing parts of the penitentiary will offset some costs.
“The request for this increase will be debated and accomplished through the normal legislative budget process closer to 2029 when the facility would open. We will have more details at that time,” the page says.
Assistant House Majority Leader Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, said this week that questions like that are important. Overweg said he doesn’t see the need to rush into a vote, given that the Legislature will return for its regular session in four months.
“I know we need a new prison. I really like the new location. I just want to make sure that we have a firm price,” Overweg said.
Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms told South Dakota Searchlight on Thursday afternoon that lawmakers’ questions “will be answered in the coming days when the full plan is released.”

The state Department of Public Health on Thursday updated its vaccine administration policy, enabling pharmacists to administer vaccines and emergency medications. The maneuver promotes the availability and distribution of vaccines in Massachusetts beyond those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
The post Healey puts Mass. on its own vaccine pa[...]","AFTER MONTHS OF state public health officials vowing to protect vaccine access amid drastic federal changes, Gov. Maura Healey on Thursday announced state measures designed to break ties with federal immunization policies, ensure the availability of COVID-19 booster shots at retail pharmacies, mandate insurance coverage of vaccines and establish a regional public health collaborative.
“Under the Trump administration, the CDC has been hijacked by people like Robert Kennedy – people who don’t believe in science and people who don’t believe in science-based health care,” Healey said at a press conference, surrounded by state health care and industry leaders and lawmakers focused on health policy.
“As a result, the government is failing its responsibility to Americans, including Bay Staters,” Healey added. “So we’re here to say: This is not going to happen in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, we will not let Donald Trump or Robert Kennedy get in the way of patients, and the care, and the treatments and the medication that they want and need.”
Department of Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said Massachusetts and health officials across the Northeast will issue guidance later this month surrounding the 2025-2026 flu season. 
DPH on Thursday updated its vaccine administration policy, enabling pharmacists to administer vaccines and emergency medications that have been approved by Goldstein. The maneuver promotes the availability and distribution of vaccines in Massachusetts beyond those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
“The DPH Commissioner may decide to make recommendations for vaccine use in populations or recommend usage schedules that are not listed in the original, FDA-approved or authorized product information,” the policy states. “Under these circumstances, qualified pharmacy personnel may administer those vaccines in accordance with the most current DPH Commissioner recommendations, even if the recommendations differ from the manufacturer’s FDA-approved or authorized labeling.”
The revised policy comes as Massachusetts also looks to extricate itself from recommendations made by the CDC’s revamped federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Healey in July filed legislation that would disentangle state vaccine policies from that panel, enabling Goldstein to establish “routine childhood immunizations” for all residents younger than 19 years old. Healey also incorporated a similar provision into a spending bill filed in August that remains before a House committee. 
The Division of Insurance and DPH issued a bulletin Wednesday requiring insurers to cover vaccines that are “recommended by DPH and not rely solely on CDC recommendations,” the Healey administration said. The bulletin applies to respiratory virus vaccines — including for COVID, flu and RSV — plus routine childhood shots, such as for measles, chickenpox and Hepatitis B.
Healey pointed out no other state has taken a similar approach yet.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans support the insurance directive, administration officials said.
“As Massachusetts takes steps to empower the Department of Public Health to set independent vaccine standards, MAHP member plans remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring coverage of evidence-based care,” MAHP CEO Lora Pellegrini said in a statement. “MAHP and our member plans stand ready to work with the Healey Administration, providers, and public health leaders to ensure that every Massachusetts resident has access to the immunizations they need to stay healthy.”
MassHealth and the Group Insurance Commission are taking similar measures to provide vaccine coverage, Healey said. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy, who’s long voiced skepticism about vaccines, this summer fired all ACIP members and installed new appointees. The panel is slated to hold its next meeting on Sept. 18-19, with votes expected on COVID vaccines.
Kennedy in May announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID shots for healthy pregnant women and children.
“While we hope that their process will utilize a thorough review of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, DPH is prepared to move quickly to provide clear communication, reduce confusion and maintain access to these vital protections,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein said he will have “final say” over state-level guidance. The state will also vet policies through the Massachusetts Vaccine Purchasing Advisory Council, national professional societies and regional public health partners, he said.
Healey, asked about potential federal pushback to Massachusetts charting its own vaccine path, told reporters, “I have an obligation to take care of and look after the well-being and the public health of people in Massachusetts.”
“And I will continue to uphold my responsibility and my constitutional duty,” she added.
The FDA last week approved COVID shots but restricted their availability among healthy children and young adults, the AP reported. The FDA also revoked the emergency authorization for Pfizer’s shot to children under 5 years old. Shots were previously available to all individuals six months and older, regardless of health conditions, according to NPR.
In light of the FDA changes, CVS last week said the pharmacy chain could not administer COVID vaccine shots in Massachusetts, Nevada and Mexico, even to individuals with prescriptions, “due to the current regulatory environment,” according to CBS News. Walgreens was also limiting access to the shots.
In a countermeasure, DPH has issued a standing order that will allow pharmacists to administer COVID booster shots to Bay Staters over age 5. The Board of Registration in Pharmacy posted the standing order Wednesday, outlining the various types of COVID shots that can be administered to individuals ages 12 and older, as well as to children ages 5 to 11.
Healey said CVS and Walgreens will start scheduling COVID vaccination appointments on Friday. Children under age five can receive COVID vaccines from their pediatricians, the administration said.
Goldstein, pressed on who is eligible to receive COVID boosters at those pharmacies, noted the state has yet to release guidance for the upcoming flu season.
“We still have our active recommendations for 2024-2025, and those recommendations say that anyone six months and older is eligible for a COVID vaccine,” Goldstein said. “We recommend, if someone wants to get it right now, they look to those eligibility criteria.”
Among adults ages 19 and older in Massachusetts, roughly 80 percent of COVID vaccines were administered in pharmacies during the 2024-2025 flu season, according to DPH.
Massachusetts is also spearheading an initiative to establish a public health collaborative with states in New England and the Northeast. The collaborative will develop “evidenced-based” recommendations for vaccines, disease surveillance, emergency preparedness and supporting state public health labs, Healey’s office said. 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson launched the West Coast Alliance on Wednesday, aimed at coordinating regional public health guidance. The group, citing “recent federal actions that have undermined the independence of the CDC and raised concerns about the politicization of science,” will start off by focusing on immunization policy.
“The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science. California, Oregon and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk,” the governors said in a joint statement.
Florida on Wednesday announced plans to end all vaccine mandates, including for students. Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo said at a press conference that each vaccine mandate “is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” according to CNN.
Healey called Florida’s action “crazy.”
“I think Ron DeSantis is putting politics over public health,” Healey said. “I think a lot of people are going to think twice about going to Florida. I don’t think measles was a souvenir that you were looking to return with after a trip to Disney World.”
Vaccine policy turbulence at the federal level has been compounded by escalating hesitancy and skepticism, leading to a lower uptake in immunizations.
New poll results Thursday from Massachusetts Families for Vaccines show that 70 percent of registered voters support bills from Rep. Andy Vargas and Sen. Ed Kennedy (H 2544 / S 1557) that would eliminate the religious carveout for immunizations required in public, private and charter K-12 schools. The proposals had a hearing in early June.
The vast majority of respondents also said they believe childhood immunizations are safe and effective, according to the poll conducted by Beacon Research.
“To protect our classrooms, our families, and our most vulnerable residents from preventable diseases, it is important that we remove the religious exemption loophole,” Vargas said in a statement. “We would be catching up to neighboring states and even the Texas Catholic schools, which no longer recognize religious exemptions.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Elizabeth Hardy is resigning as the state’s foster care ombudsman, a job created by the Legislature to investigate ongoing issues with children, families and workers in West Virginia’s overwhelmed child welfare system.
A spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey confirmed Thursday evening that Hardy is leaving the role and said she will become a commissioner at the Bureau for Behavioral Health.
Hardy, a former foster parent, has served as ombudsman a little more than a year and was the second person to hold the position. Lawmakers created the foster care ombudsman role in 2019 in an effort to bolster accountability in the troubled foster care system that has struggled with high Child Protective Services case loads, a lack of safe homes for children and accountability.
Along with investigating complaints from foster parents and children, the ombudsman was tasked with advocating for the rights of children and families. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed a bill clarifying that the foster care ombudsman would work impartially under the state’s Office of Inspector General. There had been concerns that the role wasn’t able to work independently without interference from foster care officials.
Last November, Hardy told lawmakers that since its inception in 2019, the office of the foster care ombudsman had received more than 3,000 complaints.
“Compared to the state fiscal year of 2024 we have received almost an additional 700 complaints, which is a 171% increase,” Hardy said. “This data trend shows our office’s relevance as a value by the substantial increase in the number of complaints over time.”
She added that part of her work included enforcing the state’s Foster Kinship Parent Bill of Rights and the Foster Child Bill of Rights.
Hardy replaced the state’s first foster care ombudsman Pamela Woodman-Kaehler, whose initial report in 2021 detailed how fear of retaliation and communication problems were pervasive in the foster care system and extended to families caring for foster children. 
The bill creating the position only required that the ombudsman submit reports through 2023. Woodman-Kaehler stepped down in May 2024.
There are a little more than 6,000 children in West Virginia foster care, and the state continues to lead the nation in the rate of children coming into care.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A document submitted by the Alaska Division of Elections to the U.S. Department of Justice in response to a nationwide data request names 70 possible noncitizens who voted or attempted to vote in state or local Alaska elections since 2015.
Among the 70 people are 10 American Samoans from Whittier who now face state criminal charges related to their voting. American Samoans are not considered U.S. citizens by the state, and civil charges against an 11th individual  are now being considered by the Alaska Court of Appeals.
Noncitizen voting remains extraordinarily rare, nationwide figures show, and Carol Beecher, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, said there is no evidence that noncitizen voting changed the result of last year’s elections here.
Ahead of last year’s elections, Donald Trump and other Republican politicians said they believed large numbers of non-U.S. citizens would seek to vote and influence the result of elections. 
Since becoming president, Trump has asked Congress to impose citizenship checks on all potential voters. His Department of Justice has asked all 50 states for copies of their voter lists in order to create a national government database. 
Alaska turned over its voter list and other documents to the U.S. Department of Justice last month.
In response to a public records request filed by the Alaska Beacon, the Alaska Division of Elections provided copies of documents it delivered to federal authorities.
Most of the documents, including a copy of the state’s official voter list, were already public. The voter list, for example, is available for purchase from any state elections office and doesn’t include sensitive information beyond a voter’s name, how often they’ve voted, and where they live.
The state’s inactive voter list — showing people whose voter registrations have been flagged for review and possible removal — is also a public record, but it isn’t commonly circulated. Inactive voters can’t cast a ballot without additional ID checks.


WHERE’S THE LIST?
Ordinarily, the Alaska Beacon publishes copies of the documents it obtains via public records requests, but in this case, we’re not publishing the list.
The inactive voter list contains the names and addresses of tens of thousands of Alaskans who have committed no wrongdoing, and we believe the potential harm outweighs the benefit of publishing it.
The list may become available from other sources or news outlets, but because people may be listed as “noncitizens” due to paperwork errors or other innocent mistakes, and because we aren’t able to verify the citizenship of all 541 people, we’re not publishing it. 


The inactive voter list provided to the DOJ and to the Beacon is from August. It includes 541 people whose voter records were tagged “NC” for non-citizen.
But it’s not clear whether these Alaskans are noncitizens or were on the list because of mistakes.
Carol Beecher, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, said some people may have been erroneously labeled, so it isn’t correct to say that there were 541 noncitizens registered to vote. 
“As we get more information, things change. So what I’m telling you today on a number may change tomorrow because of new information that we got,” Beecher said in an extended interview on Wednesday.
Stephen Kirch, the division’s spokesperson, said by email that “the DOE cannot say with any degree of certainty whether the current number of NC-coded entries is ‘abnormal’ or ‘unusual’ in a historical context. This is because the number is a moving target and not a static one; it is not tracked.”
The inactive voter list shows only people whose records have been flagged for additional attention and isn’t confirmation that they are not citizens. It may include people who filled out paperwork incorrectly or registered to vote shortly before becoming a citizen. 
“It’s really hard to say whether this particular number (541) is a problem, because there’s so many questions behind even that particular number,” said Mara Kimmel, a former immigration attorney who now works as executive director of the Alaska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
That total also might miss noncitizens who are on the active voter list but haven’t yet been identified.

Beecher said she considers the “NC” tag to be “kind of like a file drawer. You put things into that file based on the status when you put it in there. But that could change.”
Kimmel said that the issue is “never as easy as it seems or as it would be framed. … Noncitizens voting has become a real political hot-button issue.”
In her experience, “there’s so much confusion and misinformation that is born out of a benign desire to participate in your new home.”
In Alaska, residents can register to vote by contacting the Alaska Division of Elections. Residents are also asked if they want to register when they update their driver’s license, get a new driver’s license, and apply for the annual Permanent Fund dividend.
As Beecher explained, if someone attests that they’re not a citizen through one method but says they are a citizen via a different method, that gets the attention of authorities.
“When we have gone in there and looked and contacted them, we have found that usually it was a mistake,” she said.
In other cases, particularly with the state’s “motor-voter” program, the mistake might come from a typo or someone’s misunderstanding of the rules, particularly if they don’t speak fluent English, as might be the case with new immigrants.
The Division of Elections doesn’t have investigative powers, which means voting officials rely on an applicant’s sworn oath about their citizenship. There’s no automatic double-checking, and it’s federally unconstitutional for the division to ask for proof of citizenship.
Judges have thrown out a Kansas law that required voters to verify citizenship, and the U.S. Supreme Court has only partially allowed a different Arizona law.
“All we get is the affirmation, and however frustrating that can be for everyone out there to say, ‘Well, why can’t you make sure?’ Well, we are not given that authority. So essentially, the division takes people at their word is really what it comes down to,” Beecher said.
If someone’s registration is flagged by a complaint or because of a discrepancy in the records, the division forwards the case to the Alaska Department of Law for investigation.
“We provide them with documents if they request that, as pursuant to an investigation, but if not, we may never hear from them,” Beecher said of the investigation.
In 2023, the division flagged the registration of Tupe Smith, a Whittier resident, after she ran for and won a seat on the local school board.
Smith was born in American Samoa, an island territory in the South Pacific. Its residents are U.S. nationals — having some of the same legal rights as other Americans — but aren’t citizens.
During the subsequent investigation, Alaska State Troopers learned of 10 other American Samoans who had voted in Alaska. The state charged them with civil crimes in April, and this week, they were indicted. 
All 10 are labeled noncitizens on the inactive voter list supplied to the Beacon and Department of Justice. They, and another 60 other people, are shown as having voted or attempted to vote at least once during the past 10 years.
It isn’t clear whether all of those ballots were actually counted. Many are labeled as “questioned,” meaning that they were subject to additional ID verification. Beecher said “it’s possible” that some were counted but that she didn’t have numbers.
She believes “very few” noncitizens have voted.
“I’m speaking very anecdotally, because I don’t have those kinds of numbers for you, but our sense is that it’s very small. And I think the underlying reason for that is because there is no nefarious intent out there to try to sway an election. It’s people who either — and this is my personal opinion — they’re confused about the rules or somehow ended up marking something that they didn’t understand,” Beecher said.
Alaska had 605,302 registered voters on Aug. 3, according to Division of Election statistics.
If the noncitizen-tagged voters on the inactive list had still been active, they would have represented just 0.09% of Alaska voters.
Last year, 340,981 Alaskans voted in the state’s November general election. The division’s inactive list shows six noncitizens either voted or attempted to vote in that election.
In Michigan, officials announced in April that they had found 16 credible cases of noncitizen voting out of about 5.7 million votes cast overall, or one per every 360,000 votes.
Nationally, noncitizen voting remains exceptionally rare.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and a supporter of election reform legislation in Alaska, noted that the rate of noncitizen voting in Alaska is likely well below the rate at which legitimate voters are being disqualified because of problems with the state’s absentee voting system.
“Any time you have people who are voting that shouldn’t be voting, that’s cause for concern,” Wielechowski said in an interview Wednesday. 
“But at the same time, we’ve got hundreds of people that we know of, actually thousands of people who were disenfranchised,” he said, referring to the state’s regular practice of disqualifying absentee ballots because of submittal errors.
“In rural Alaska, we had 10% or 15% of the population in rural Alaska that was disenfranchised a couple of years ago, legitimate voters who were disenfranchised because of a bureaucratic technicality that’s not even checked. So I think there’s bigger problems,” Wielechowski said. 
In 2023, Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, proposed legislation that would have required the Division of Elections to cross-check the state’s voter rolls with a national citizenship database. 
“I always like to presume innocence, but we have to put the safeguards in place, and by having the division use those databases as a check and balance, I think that’s a very simple way to make sure that we’re crossing our T’s and dotting I’s,” Vance said Wednesday.
She noted that current Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, won his 2006 primary election via a coin toss that followed a tied election. 
“When you look at how slim some of our elections are, how tight races can be, these numbers matter,” she said.
The Alaska Senate stripped out Vance’s citizenship provision and passed a revised bill, but the Republican-led House failed by a single vote to take up the legislation on the last day of the regular session in 2024. The bill died at the end of the session, and lawmakers started anew this spring. 
In recent years, the Alaska Department of Law has requested funding for a part-time elections investigator. The Legislature has not approved that request. 
“We shouldn’t have anyone voting in our elections on any level who shouldn’t be,” Vance said. 
“This is important and significant because we want to make sure that we protect the sovereignty of every individual’s vote,” she said.

The August jobs increase was the lowest for that month since 2010 in the aftermath of the Great Recession. June’s decrease was the first jobs loss since a December 2020 COVID-19 surge shuttered restaurants and hotels.
States begin to see job losses from Trump’s cuts, housing and spending slowdowns

A recent Stateline analysis showed that Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by recent hiring slowdowns, based on surveys and layoff reports, while California and Texas appeared to continue job gains.
Job openings fell to a 10-month low in July, according to a separate government report issued Sept. 3, and there were more unemployed people than jobs available for the first time since 2021.
Last month’s revisions to the jobs report enraged President Donald Trump when they first appeared Aug. 1. The revisions showed the nation had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, Erika McEntarfer. He offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report entirely. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post at the time that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”

(Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kim Barnes scoured 52 years of contacts in his Rolodex to find buyers for 1.7 million bushels of last year’s grain sorghum crop after a cut in federal programs and international trade left the market in chaos.
This month, 1 million bushels of sorghum, commonly called milo, are leaving the Pawnee County Co-Op in Larned by rail, but those sales of last year’s product are taking a bite out of this year’s upcoming crop sales, said Barnes, the co-op’s chief financial officer. 
Like many in agriculture, Barnes is worried about milo sales and how Kansas farmers will earn profits in diminished markets amid increasing costs to farm.
Along with tariffs and trade wars, the Trump administration cut the U.S. Agency for International Development program that distributed food abroad. The move eliminated one market for Kansas grains.
At 70 years old, Barnes has a solid grasp on the history of agriculture, and while he remembers tough times, what’s happening right now stands out.
“If we go back to 2016, wheat was $2.88 a bushel. Corn was $2.82 a bushel, and soybeans were $8.90 a bushel, and milo was $4.32 a hundredweight,” Barnes said. “Then you jump into 2022. Wheat was $8.48 at the end of the year. Milo was $12.82 a hundredweight. Corn was $7.88 a bushel and soybeans were $14.94.”
Today, the picture is grim. Barnes said wheat sits at $4.22 per bushel, milo is $5.71 a hundredweight, corn is $3.90 per bushel and soybeans are $9.34 per bushel.
Prices are low at a time when Kansas farmers are having an excellent crop after a summer of good weather, said Andy Hineman, vice president of the Kansas Grain Sorghum Producers Association and a fifth-generation farmer in Dighton.
“It’s going to be a tremendous crop for much of the sorghum growing area,” he said. “The prediction on production this year is 9.9 million metric tons (in the United States). Normally, we’ve been around 10 million.”
Kansas farmers produce about half of the crop, Hineman said.
 
International trade
Typically, about 60% of the milo crop is exported, with 90% of the exports going to China, according to a sorghum association spokesman. But almost all of the China market has been lost. 
“There’s a lot of work being done on improving domestic use of milo and improving additional markets,” Hineman said. “In the past, a lot of our milo exports have gone to China, and so not having them as a trade partner right now is definitely a challenge that I think we’re all concerned about.”
Mexico and India are markets for potential milo sales, he said. In addition, options are available domestically, and Hineman noted a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration study is looking at milo for human consumption.
“Historically, it’s been more of a feed crop and ethanol crop, but there are some smaller mills that do produce milo flour and sorghum food,” Hineman said. “But it’s the first time the FDA is getting behind it and doing a study, so that’s really exciting to see.” 
Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, agreed that new markets must be found. 
“If China is shutting the door on us, we’ve got to find an opening somewhere,” he said. “That, to me, right now speaks to India.”
Gregg Ibendahl, associate professor in agricultural economics at Kansas State University, said it’s difficult to predict where future markets might be but that tariffs and shifting global trade may upend the United States’ international role. 
“South America is becoming, technology wise, probably almost as good as we are when it comes to growing a lot of crops,” he said. “It wouldn’t surprise me if South America really would become the low-cost leader in producing grain. Are we going to still be the primary supplier? Are we going to be a secondary supplier?”
At this stage, it’s difficult to tell how tariffs will affect the country’s position, he said.
Barnes is working to make connections to make sure the next milo crop out of the fields won’t be stored for long. He’s traveling to San Antonio soon to participate in a commodity conference where he’ll be able to sit down with international buyers. 
He went to a pet food forum in Kansas City recently, something he’d never attended before but that he believed might offer grain sales. 
“I was taught to dream and taught to look for the silver lining, and so that’s where I’m at today,” he said. “It’s been a challenge, but a good challenge. In other words, we’re not waiting for the world to come to us. We’re out beating the bush, trying to make the sales and not waiting for somebody else to come to our door. We’re out marketing ourselves.”
 
Local impacts
When farm income drops, it not only jeopardizes farm operations but the entire community, Barnes said.
Local businesses struggle when agricultural income and spending drop. 
Barnes said the co-op pays $3.8 million in property tax, more than $34 million in labor and that studies have shown every dollar generated in agriculture is multiplied seven times in the local community.
Levendofsky said he spoke to a banker who was only making agricultural loans secured by land, something the long-time farmer said he doesn’t remember happening before. 
Kevin Swayne, president and CEO at High Plains Farm Credit, said his company isn’t taking those kinds of steps. 
“Obviously there’s some more challenging times, rising input costs and lower commodity prices, which is tightening up margins and putting pressure on a lot of operations, especially in Kansas,” he said. “That’s always going to understandably raise concerns about access to credit and financial support.”
Each bank sets its own lending underwriting standards and risk profiles, Swayne said. 
“We keep a list of those loans that get denied and are delinquent even, and so far our delinquencies have stayed very manageable and are not spiking yet. It’s my understanding in the industry that you’re starting to see some of that,” Swayne said. 
High Plains’ philosophy is to partner with customers, and Swayne said they work with farmers to develop a plan that includes commodity price assumptions and government payments, as well as whether they use crop insurance to manage risk.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-908450064-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 09:57:48.921917

The federal mega-bill that cut social welfare programs will potentially undo Medicaid expansion in the state, and it could leave North Carolina with a big bill for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Additionally, the state Department of Health and Human Services is set to make cuts to provider’s Medicaid payments because it says the state legislature has not provided enough money to maintain the status quo in the health insurance program.
“There’s a lot happening all at once,” Jonathan Kappler, chief of staff and deputy secretary for external affairs at the state Department of Health and Human Services told the task force. 
SNAP helps about 1.4 million North Carolinians pay for food. The federal government used to pay all the benefit costs, but the bill President Donald Trump signed into law in July requires states to pick up a share of the expenses based on their payment error rates. That part of the law kicks in in a few years.
The federal government will continue to pay the entire cost for states with error rates below 6%.
Jonathan KapplerDeputy Secretary for External Affairs and Chief of Staff (Photo: NCDHHS)
North Carolina’s error rate in 2024 was 10.21%, according to the USDA. States with error rates over 10% will pay 15% of benefit costs. The bill for North Carolina would come to $420 million, Kappler said. The cost calculations will be based on state error rates in  2025 or 2026. 
Beginning next year, the federal government will no longer split SNAP administrative costs with the states 50-50, but will pay 25%.
County workers determine eligibility, and DHHS is working with counties to drive down the error rate, Kappler said. 
County workers also have to monitor revised work requirements for adults using SNAP and, in 2027, new work requirements for people ensured under Medicaid expansion.  
“There’s a lot of additional pressure on counties,” Kappler said. 
Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett), a task force member, brought up the concerns of grocers who worry about SNAP benefit reductions leading to reduced sales. 
“I’ve met with the folks from Food Lion and some of the other grocery stores, and it’s a significant amount of money, and they’re concerned about it,” he said. SNAP payments amount to 18% of some stores total sales. 
Medicaid changes
The federal law caps the provider tax North Carolina uses to pay the non-federal cost of Medicaid expansion. The federal government pays 90% of expansion costs, while the provider taxes pay 10%. 
New costs for Medicaid expansion administration will outpace funding, “and that would end Medicaid expansion in North Carolina,” Kappler said. Discussions about how to pay for the increased administrative costs have begun, he said. 
Sen. Jim Burgin (Photo: NCGA)
More than 675,000 North Carolinians are enrolled in expanded Medicaid, according to DHHS.
The federal law will result in North Carolina losing about $50 billion over 10 years, Kappler said. Most of that will show up as reduced payments to hospitals. Rural hospitals will be hit hard.
The federal law included a $50 billion rural health fund. Half the money will be distributed evenly among the states with approved applications. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will decide where the other $25 billion will go. 
The $50 billion in federal money adds up to about one-third of the estimated loss of Medicaid funds in rural areas, KFF reported.
The stopgap budget the legislature passed in July had $319 million less than DHHS asked for to maintain the status quo in the Medicaid program. In response, DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai outlined provider rate cuts scheduled to start Oct. 1.
Burgin said legislators are going to try to make sure provider rates aren’t cut. 
“We’re planning on coming back and working on it,” he said. 
Kappler said “productive discussions” about the Medicaid shortfall are ongoing, and there’s a way to avoid cuts now,  if not for the entire fiscal year.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/snapphoto_0-1024x7681756298817-1.jpg,,,2025-09-05 09:57:48.921917

John Muir once wrote “everything is refreshed” by a summer storm in the Sierra Nevada. But then, as now, the lightning strikes that come with them pose a perennial wildfire risk.
Fires raging in the Sierra foothills have burned nearly 14,000 acres, prompted evacuations and destroyed the historic Gold Rush town of Chinese Camp. Lightning ignited these fires — an occurrence that a new study says will likely happen more often in California, reports CalMatters’ Rachel Becker. 
From Tuesday to Wednesday, dry thunderstorms rolled across the Central Valley and the Bay Area. Though exactly how many lightning strikes hit California during that 31-hour period is unclear, an expert at the National Lightning Safety Council estimated that 11,000 bolts of electricity struck the ground.
During that same time period at least 45 new fires ignited, said Cal Fire battalion chief David Acuña.

Acuña: “We can’t collectively say they’re all lightning fires, but we can say that there were a large number of lightning strikes and a large number of fires.”

As hotter, drier conditions become more common due to climate change, researchers found that lightning is more likely to strike when dry lands are at risk for igniting. From 2030 to 2060, some Western states could see as many as 12 more days of lightning striking the ground per year — with parts of northeast California and the eastern Sierra potentially seeing an increase as well.

Dmitri Kalashnikov, the study’s lead author: “You get this very hazardous situation in terms of fire risk, where you have lighting that hits the dry vegetation. You’ll get an ignition, but then there’s no downpours to extinguish the flame — so that fire can grow.”

After CalMatters story, DMV makes it easier to get your money

For years, the California Department of Motor Vehicles made millions from selling towed cars without giving the owners much of a chance to claim the money. But that’s changing now, after CalMatters published an investigation on the practice earlier this year. Find out what the DMV is doing from CalMatters’ Byrhonda Lyons.



Sluggish science scores

Science test scores for K-12 California schools remained relatively stagnant following the 2016 launch of a new science curriculum — raising concern among some education experts who say that science should be prioritized more, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Three years after Next Generation Science Standards rolled out, California assessed students in science for the first time, with only 30% of students meeting the standard on the state exam in 2019. Last year it was only 30.7%. Wide gaps in test scores also exist among groups of students, particularly among low-income and Black students. 
There are a few reasons for this: Carrying out the curriculum was especially hard through remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic because the curriculum required hands-on projects. When in-person learning returned, schools also focused their recovery efforts on literacy, math and attendance.

Speaking of pandemic-era learning: Carolyn also reports on the settlement reached Wednesday between a group of families and Los Angeles Unified, which will affect about 250,000 students. In 2020, the families joined a class-action lawsuit to sue the district, alleging that it wasn’t doing enough to ensure students were getting a quality education during the pandemic. The settlement requires the district to offer various academic support, including one-on-one tutoring through 2028. Read more here.



CA prison cells reach scorching temps

With temperatures in some California prisons rising to 95 degrees each summer, and climate change driving temperatures to even higher levels, state prison officials are rolling out a $38 million pilot program to cool some prison cells, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
After mounting pressure from activists, lawmakers and judges, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation plans to conduct a test of cooling systems and new insulation at three of the department’s 31 prisons. The pilot, which the Legislature approved this year, will run over the next four years and results are expected by 2029.
But critics say the pilot doesn’t go far enough. It will only affect parts of facilities that house about 8,000 of California’s 91,000 inmates, and no further concrete action is required afterwards.

Richard Cowan
Richard Cowan is the former chairperson of the Historic State Capitol Commission.


For more than half a decade, advocates of the state Capitol have sounded the alarm about the $1.1 billion Capitol annex project. This venture is a textbook example of how not to run a public works project. 
All Californians will be affected by its rampant secrecy, nondisclosure agreements, massive cost overruns and the decimation of our treasured Capitol Park. Experts and appointed officials tasked with protecting the historic Capitol building have strongly argued for cost-effective, transparent alternatives that preserve the Capitol’s historic integrity and public access. But every concern was ignored.
For instance, the new Capitol annex will be wider, longer and taller than the historic building it replaces, despite commitments to follow the Secretary of the Interior guidelines for historic properties. The annex’s glass exterior will clash with the original white plaster Capitol, visually overpowering the 1860s landmark. 
How did we get here?
In 2018, when the Capitol annex project was expected to cost $500-$750 million, I resigned as chairperson of the Historic State Capitol Commission. I was objecting to documents being withheld, details being hidden and stakeholders — especially the public  — being excluded.
Now, hard-hitting exposés, alongside growing bipartisan concerns about open government, show that public conversation is finally catching up. Even the news media has been stonewalled when requesting information about the project’s contracts, costs and access plans.
Californians deserve to know how their money is being spent. Assemblymember Joe Patterson’s push for Assembly Bill 1370, which would prohibit lawmakers from signing nondisclosure agreements while conducting public business, is a step in the right direction.  Hopefully this leads to lifting all NDAs related to this project, allowing citizens to ask questions.
But concerns remain about the Capitol’s most iconic public space: the west steps. For generations, this plaza has been the literal and symbolic stage for civic engagement, where countless Californians from all walks of life have gathered to be heard. 
Despite verbal claims that plans for a partially above-ground visitor center have been dropped, current designs still call for digging up the west steps, lawn and plaza. Officials have refused to provide written guarantees these spaces will be protected.
In fact, the Legislature in June quietly passed a budget trailer bill to avoid providing a written guarantee to preserve the west plaza. It was the second time in three years  they changed state law to advance the project with a last-minute trailer bill. It shows a disturbing pattern of backdoor tactics to sidestep public accountability. 
The recent rollback of the California Environmental Quality Act is another nail in the coffin of public review. By fast-tracking politically favored projects and sidelining environmental and historic preservation oversight, the state’s CEQA reforms further erode transparency and deny Californians a voice in decisions reshaping public spaces.
The annex project has unfolded under a veil of secrecy unprecedented in state history. California needs a full, independent audit — one that digs deeper than surface-level accounting — to examine the contracts, scope, budget decisions and financial dealings behind this billion-dollar boondoggle.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders should direct the State Auditor to launch that review and pass legislation that permanently protects the west steps and plaza as a place for public assembly. 
Perhaps now, with more eyes on it and more lawmakers speaking out, there’s a chance to change the annex project’s course.  It’s not too late to restore trust, but doing so will take more than statements and symbolic gestures.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/042825-Capitol-Annex-FG-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

The California DMV is now allowing vehicle owners to see if the state owes them money for sales of their towed cars.


For years, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has been keeping profits from the sales of towed cars, without giving the owners much of a chance to claim money that’s rightfully theirs. 
That’s changing, thanks to a CalMatters investigation. 
The state DMV is now offering a lookup tool on its website, allowing people to see if the DMV owes them money from what’s known as a lien sale. The tool is nearly identical to the one CalMatters created for our story in March.


Did your towed car get sold for a profit? Look up your license plate or vehicle ID number in our interactive database at calmatters.org


By law, towing companies, storage yards and car repair shops can sell your car to recoup their costs if you do not pick up your vehicle. It’s known as a lien sale. 
For poor Californians, the tows and compounding fees are often a trap. Police can tow your car for things like expired registration, but you might not be able to get it back if you can’t renew your registration because you have unpaid fees and fines from things like traffic and parking tickets. 
Lien sales have to be approved by the DMV, and any money leftover is supposed to go to the agency. Typically, lien sales end in debt. However, CalMatters found that the DMV collected more than $8 million from nearly 5,300 cars sold at auction between 2016 through the fall of 2024. 
Owners are entitled to that surplus, and have up to three years to claim it. But the agency does not notify owners of the refunds.
When our first story ran, the agency said that it wasn’t required to notify people of their refunds, and there was no mention of how people could claim their lien sale refunds. Now, in addition to the lookup tool, there’s a list of frequently asked questions and instructions on exactly how to claim refunds. 
The DMV also said it had sent more than $5,000 to a family after admitting it erroneously denied the refund request of Stephen McAllister, who was featured in the CalMatters investigation.
“I wouldn’t have known anything about this money without a call from you,” he said. “I think there’s a lot of people in this same situation, and that money means a lot to them.”
His sister, Joan McAllister’s, vehicle racked up $1,113 in parking tickets in San Francisco in 2022 while she was hospitalized. Stephen said someone found her “wandering the streets.”
Eventually, the vehicle was towed and accumulated over $8,300 in storage fees.
Stephen tried to intervene, but he didn’t have the legal authority. By the time he was appointed as her conservator, the towing yard had sold her car, he said.
McAllister requested a refund from the DMV shortly after our story ran. A few months later, the department denied his request. He reached out to CalMatters, and I contacted the DMV. Agency spokesperson Ronald Ongtoaboc apologized and said the denial was an “error.” 
The DMV sent the check to her estate. McAllister, the administrator of the estate, said he recently received the refund.
“I felt like they brushed me off, and that they’re doing it to a lot of people,” he said.
When asked what he would do with the money, McAllister said he planned to donate it to CalMatters. 
“I think you guys do really good work,” he said. “I think you could make far better use of that money than I could.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021825_Bruffys-Tow_JWH_CM_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

But test scores remain low,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/09/science-california/,"Nearly a decade after California revamped its K-12 science curriculum, two-thirds of students failed to meet the statewide standard.","In summary
Nearly a decade after California revamped its K-12 science curriculum, two-thirds of students failed to meet the statewide standard.


A decade ago, California schools introduced a new K-12 science curriculum that was hands-on, interactive and designed to prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century. 
But since the state started testing students on the new Next Generation Science Standards in 2019, the first time ever California assessed students in science, test scores have barely budged, with stark gaps among some groups of students.
“In large part, science has not been viewed as a priority. It’s been moved to the back burner,” said Jessica Sawko, education director at the research and advocacy organization Children Now, and former head of the state’s association of science teachers. “But science needs to be a priority. How will we prepare our kids to make sense of the world around them?”
In 2019, three years after most schools began teaching the new science curriculum, only 30% of students met the standard on the state exam. Last year, the number had inched up to only 30.7%.
Wide gaps exist among student groups. Among students whose parents graduated from college, 42% met the standard, compared to 17% of those whose parents never went beyond high school. Fewer than than 21% of low-income students met the standard. Only 15% of Black students met the standard, compared to 61% of Asian students.

Delays and obstacles
There’s a few reasons for the stagnant scores, experts said. Pandemic school closures set achievement back significantly for all subjects, but it especially affected science because so much of the new science curriculum centers on hands-on projects, which were nearly impossible to conduct over Zoom.
And after the pandemic, schools focused their recovery efforts on literacy, math and attendance, the most glaring challenges as students returned to in-person learning. Chronic absenteeism, for example, soared from 10% pre-pandemic to 30% in 2022. 
Another reason for the low science scores is accountability, Sawko and others said. For the first few years of the new science test, the scores were not posted on the state’s Dashboard — the primary means of publicizing students’ academic performance. The rationale is that the test was new and the state was still working out the kinks.
Last year, the results were posted at the bottom of the Dashboard in an area marked “informational purposes.” Unlike the other features of the dashboard, such as math and English language arts scores, science was not color coded to indicate the performance level of individual schools or student groups. The science results were solid gray.
When the new scores are released this fall, science will be color-coded on the Dashboard, but science still falls short of full accountability, advocates said. Low-performing schools won’t be singled out by the state for extra assistance, although that might change next year.

Another obstacle has been teacher training. After California adopted the new standards, it didn’t invest any money in professional development until 2023. For many years, districts used their own funds or found private grants to pay for teacher training, but by fall 2020 at least 30%-40% of teachers had received no training in the new standards, according to a survey by the California Association of Science Educators. Teachers at low-income and rural schools received the least training.
In 2023 the state allotted $85 million to improve math, science and computer science education, but only about $1.5 million went to train teachers in science. The rest went to train teachers in math and computer science – which also recently got new standards – and to host family STEM nights and other activities. The money went to county offices of education to distribute locally. 
The grant expires in 2027, and it’s crucial that the state continue that investment, said Shari Staub, co-leader of the California Math, Science and Computer Science Partnership.
“We are daily faced with public health challenges, climate challenges, equity challenges — all the things a scientifically literate population should be able to address, not just for California but for the world,” Staub said. “If we’re not investing in science, we are not preparing students for the world they are entering.”
Three-dimensional learning
The Next Generation Science Standards were created in 2011 by an education nonprofit called Achieve, with help from 26 states and dozens of science education experts. The idea was to make science more engaging and “three-dimensional,” as the authors put it, by combining concepts from multiple scientific disciplines so students could discover patterns and systems. Students would gain critical thinking skills and a solid understanding of scientific concepts, largely by doing hands-on projects rather than listening to lectures.
Many school districts in California have embraced the new standards and seen scores improve. In fact, California public schools — particularly those in tech hubs — have some of the top science programs in the country. California students routinely win the National Science Bowl, Science Olympiad and other national competitions. 
For the most part, those districts invested their own funds early in the rollout to train their teachers. And they have strong support from parents, financial and otherwise. That amounts to PTA funds that teachers can use to pay for science field trips or extra help in the classroom, plenty of parent volunteers and an overall expectation that science education is a priority. 
None of the top-performing schools were Title I low-income schools, but they weren’t all homogenous affluent schools, either. Some had 25% or more low-income students, large percentages of English learners and diverse student populations. They might have PTA support, but they don’t receive much extra money from the state because they don’t have large numbers of high-needs students.

La Cañada Unified near Pasadena, for example, received only $13,700 per student last year from the state, about $5,000 less than the state average. But more than 77% of students met or exceeded the science standards last year, some of the highest scores in the state. 
Each elementary school in the district has a science lab and an aide to assist with science projects. A summer camp called “STEM-nauts” pairs older students with younger ones for science-themed games and experiments. The high school offers five Advanced Placement science classes and a host of science-related extracurricular activities, including an astronomy club, neuroscience club and chemistry club. Students can do internships at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is a quarter-mile from the high school.
“In our district, the science kids are the cool kids,” said James Cartnal, assistant superintendent. “Science is part of the culture here. We work intentionally and very hard to make it that way.”
‘Think like scientists’
At Lawson Middle School in Cupertino, science is nearly everyone’s favorite subject. The science classrooms are boisterous places with students conducting experiments and trying to figure out solutions. The shelves are well stocked with beakers, scales and microscopes. Colorful tapestries of the periodic table hang from the ceiling. Anime renditions of the elements — including xenon, helium, germanium, cadmium — adorn the walls.
One recent afternoon, students in Emily Adams’ eighth grade science class did a lesson on measurements. Adams started by asking them why accurate measurements are important. Their answers: so astronauts know how much fuel is left in their rocketship; so truck drivers know if their vehicle will fit under an overpass; and so doctors know how much medicine they’re giving a patient.
Then they worked in groups to measure various objects, using an infrared thermometer, an electronic scale and other tools.
“This class is fun. I like all the labs, figuring out how things work in the real world,” said student Neil Dhaman. “P.E. is my favorite class, but this is second.”

Adams said the class was typical, in that she spends about 10 minutes explaining a few main concepts and the students spend the rest of the class on projects related to the concepts. “I want them to focus on skills and critical thinking, not just regurgitate facts,” Adams said. “I want them to think like scientists.”
Cupertino is in the heart of Silicon Valley, home to the Apple computer headquarters and dozens of tech start-ups. Google and Facebook are a few miles away. Despite the lure of six-figure salaries in Silicon Valley, Cupertino Union School District has very little turnover among science teachers, a key reason the science scores are so high, said Marie Crawford, the district’s director of instructional leadership and intervention. 
“The teachers know each other, work together, help each other out,” Crawford said. “It makes a big difference.”
Like La Cañada, Cupertino Union School District does not receive a lot of money from the state. Last year, the state provided $16,400 per student, far below the state average.
In teacher Maryhien Pham’s class, eighth grader Aanya Dhar and her classmates demonstrated how to find the mass of a marble by dropping it into a cylinder of water, and weighing the cylinder before and after. The answer: 3 milliliters. 
“I might want to be a scientist when I grow up,” Dhar said. “I like learning about new things, experimenting, getting to know how things work.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/082625_ScienceClass_FM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)Amid turmoil within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and changes to COVID vaccine recommendations, one state legislative leader is calling on Nevada to take action.
The call comes after reports local public health agencies do not have the updated covid vaccine and private retail pharmacies in Nevada cannot administer it until further federal action is taken.
Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, a Democrat, on Thursday announced she has instructed legislative staff “to explore statutory and regulatory options to address this crisis.”
The options “could be considered at the first possible opportunity,” she added.
At CDC, worries mount that agency has taken anti-science turn

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week began recommending COVID boosters only for people 65 or older and others at high risk of complications. Meanwhile, the CDC has stopped recommending the vaccine for children and pregnant women.
Prior to these changes, COVID vaccines and boosters were more widely available and recommended for anyone 6 months and up.
CVS, the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chain, told the New York Times and other media outlets that it will not offer the updated COVID-19 vaccine at all in Nevada, Massachusetts and New Mexico. The company told KTNV it’s because of a state law limiting what vaccines pharmacists can administer to those approved by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The ACIP has not yet weighed in on the newest formulation, which like the flu shot is updated every year.
In 13 other states, CVS is offering the vaccine but requiring prescriptions.
Cannizzaro criticized President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for showing “reckless disregard for Nevadans’ health and well-being by baselessly changing the eligibility requirements for new COVID vaccines and making it nearly impossible for many Nevadans to receive them.”
The Nevada’s Public Employees Benefits Program on Thursday told members that a vaccine clinic scheduled for Friday would not have the COVID vaccine available. PEBP provides insurance for more than 71,000 people, including current and former public sector employees and their families.
The Southern Nevada Health District and Northern Nevada Public Health this week confirmed they do not have the updated COVID-19 vaccine.

 


				Northern Nevada Public Health on Thursday announced that Washoe County is experiencing “a concerning rise” in Pertussis, better known as whooping cough or the 100-day cough.
Eighteen confirmed or probable cases have been reported this year, as of late August, according to the release.
“Respiratory illness season doesn’t officially begin until October, yet we’ve already seen three times as many whooping cough cases this year as we did in all of last year,” said Dr. Chad Kingsley, the district health officer for NNPH.
Pertussis is preventable via widely available vaccinations that have been recommended by medical professionals for adolescents and adults since 2006 and since 1997 for children younger than 7.			




NNPH in a press release said it is “awaiting guidance” from the CDC’s ACIP “to determine a path forward in providing the updated COVID-19 vaccine.” The district anticipates the vaccine will be available “at the end of September or early October.”
The ACIP is scheduled to meet again on Sept. 18 and 19.
SNHD in its release said it “is preparing” to begin offering the updated COVID vaccine and will announce when it is available in its clinics. No time frame was given.
On Wednesday, SNHD announced it had the previous season’s COVID-19 vaccine available for eligible Nevadans who want it. The following day, the district walked back that offer, announcing in a release it had “received updated guidance” and would not be offering the previous formulation.
Dr. Cassius Lockett, the district health officer for SNHD, said in a statement that the health district “remains committed to providing COVID-19 vaccines to everyone who is eligible, including adults ages 65 and older and people with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for severe illness.”
SNHD noted that the updated vaccine can be provided before the CDC’s ACIP meets but cautioned that “people should be aware that insurance coverage may change once the committee issues its final recommendations.”
Kennedy over the summer gutted the ACIP, which for decades has made the vaccine recommendations followed by states. New members appointed by Kennedy include vaccine skeptics.
California, Oregon and Washington on Wednesday announced a public health alliance to coordinate their own vaccine recommendations.
The West Coast states — all led by Democratic governors — formed a similar alliance at the onset of the covid pandemic in 2020. That alliance also included Nevada, which was at the time led by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak.
(Meanwhile, Florida’s surgeon general this week stood alongside Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and announced the state would move to end all vaccine mandates for schoolchildren.)
Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican who ousted Sisolak in 2022, has called vaccines “positive” but said he is largely anti-mandate, saying it’s up to individuals to decide what is best for themselves and their children.
The Current has reached out to the governor for comment.
It’s unclear what, if anything, the Nevada State Legislature can do without the governor’s approval. Democrats control both chambers of the Legislature but not by the supermajorities required to overturn gubernatorial vetoes.
In Massachusetts — one of the other two states where CVS said it could not provide COVID vaccines — Democratic Gov. Maura Healey and state regulators have already taken action, including issuing an order allowing pharmacy workers to vaccinate.
The New Mexico Department of Health also issued a new health order instructing its Board of Pharmacy “to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.” Like Massachusetts, New Mexico is also headed by a Democrat, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
The Nevada State Legislature is not scheduled to meet until 2027 but Lombardo and Cannizzaro have both acknowledged that conversations about the prospect of a special session are happening behind the scenes.
Lombardo has said a special session might include his bills that failed to pass during the regular session earlier this year. He has also said that a proposed massive expansion of the film tax credit program is still on the table.

5 Calls, a website and app that finds users’ representatives and senators in Congress and provides them with a phone number and a script to discuss some of the hottest issues on Capitol Hill, is now expanding to include members of the Utah statehouse in partnership with Elevate PAC.
On the list of federal issues, platform users in the state may now notice items with a red banner, marking state-wide issues. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
One is titled “Investigate the Senate President’s Abuse of Power,” referring to reports of Utah Senate President Stuart Adams initiating legislation that later helped a family member reach a plea deal in a criminal case. Another one reads “Respect the Court, Respect the Voters: Don’t Appeal Utah’s Fair Maps Ruling,” about the legal fight happening in the state over congressional maps. 
“Utah’s a really interesting state for us, actually. It has really consistently, at the federal level, been in the top three states in terms of calls made to Congress per capita,” Nick O’Neill, technical director of 5 Calls said. 
For privacy reasons the organization doesn’t collect information about constituents who make calls via the platform. But, O’Neill imagines, one of the reasons Utahns are so engaged is because Republican lawmakers in the state “could sort of stand on their own, have an opinion of their own, and that’s a really interesting and unique feature in today’s political landscape.”
There’s no concrete information on users’ demographics in the state. The only existing data about engagement in Utah is on the volume of calls and the most popular issues among users.
In Utah, constituents reported over 2,280 calls in the last seven days, counting national hot buttons. The No. 1 issue recorded in the platform was a demand to release the Epstein case files. The second, was a call to impeach Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“Our community has been asking for state-level tools for years. Utah was the clear choice to launch, not just because people here are already using 5 Calls at such high levels, but because there is so much potential to shape the state’s future,” Rebecca Kaufman, executive director of 5 Calls, said in a statement.



Let us know what you think...


 


During the first couple of weeks of featuring local issues, Utahns have registered over 620 calls for state concerns, O’Neill said. The experience has also been different with state lawmakers, as many personally answer their phone calls, as opposed to delegating calls to a staffer.
In the partnership, Elevate PAC will bring on-the-ground perspective and explainers to help select issues that matter the most to Utahns, said Jackie Morgan, senior partner of the group. The goal, she said, is to see more contact between legislators and their constituents to inform decisions with more perspectives from their districts.
“We see so often in Utah, state lawmakers don’t listen to their constituents. We see committee hearings that are full of hundreds of people, and then the votes go exactly how we’d expect them to go,” Morgan said about the Utah Legislature’s Republican supermajority. 
And overall, Morgan said, the platform represents an opportunity for people in the state who may feel powerless to take political action, even without having lobbyists on payroll. 
“Instead of doomscrolling and getting frustrated and feeling powerless, you can actually do something about it,” she said. “We have had so many people reach out to us and say that they’ve contacted their representatives, and they’ve been shocked because their representative has just actually answered the phone.”
Most issues listed on the platform are progressive-leaning, O’Neill acknowledged. However, he emphasized 5 Calls is non-partisan and selects issues that are popular among the public regardless of political affiliation.
The platform has been testing the new system in other red states, like Texas, which just wrapped up a special legislative session that changed electoral boundaries, and Ohio, where lawmakers have to redraw congressional maps before the end of the year.
“We have been prioritizing important issues in states where they’ve come up. And I think it’s just happened that there have been a number of Republican legislature-controlled states that have started moving towards these sort of intentional gerrymanders,” O’Neill said, “which is what has come up as we’ve been able to have the technology to support this.”

The executive committee approved Azar's proposed benefit changes, which will be brought to the full board for a voter later this month.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)In the face of rising insurance rates, Alabama will have to consider allocating more money to the state employees’ health insurance program while altering state workers’ benefits, the State Employees’ Insurance Board leader said during a meeting Wednesday.
Stephanie Azar, CEO of the board, told members of the executive committee that without increased state support or benefit changes, the SEIB would gradually go into debt over the next three years.
“The board has known for some time that there would be difficult decisions coming due to the health care inflation and the issues we may face,” Azar said. “I will say that any changes or any decisions that will be made should not occur at one time, or even in one year, but will require the board to remain open to the pathway over the next several years to ensure the plan remains financially strong while maintaining excellent benefits for the members.”
Azar also recommended the board authorize a withdrawal from the Retirees’ Trust Fund to address funding shortfalls in the coming months. Withdrawals are limited to 10% of the trust’s fair market value on the last day of the previous fiscal year, Azar said, which was $304.7 million. She recommended pulling the maximum amount allowed, $30.4 million.
“I think that is not a good practice to pull from the trust, but I think that this board is going to have to pull from the trust,” Alabama Finance Director Bill Poole said.
Azar said the last time money was taken from the trust was in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, also to address funding shortfalls. She also recommended that the board withdraw 5% of the trust at the end of FY26 if needed.
Although the $30.4 million will help, Azar said the $30.4 million will only pay for about three weeks of expenses. 
“This was enlightening to me when I heard this, but SEIB spends a little over $10 million in a week,” Azar said.
The executive committee approved benefit changes to bring before the full board for a vote, including:

Major medical calendar year deductible (from $300 to $350)
Inpatient hospital stays (from $250 to $300 deductible, and from $25 to $50 copay)
Emergency room visits (from no copay to $250 copay excluding accidents and $300 copay including accidents)
Specialist and ER physician visits (from $35 copay to $40) 

Azar said the changes would save SEIB up to $6.2 million per year.
Connie Grier, an elected active employee representative, convinced the executive committee to reduce Azar’s initial recommendation for an increased specialist copay of $50 down to $40.
“I feel like $50 for a specialist is going to discourage some people from going to a specialist,” Grier said. “There are a whole lot of specialists. I think people are actually seeing more specialists now than what we used to 10 years ago.”
Azar said that benefit change was the biggest driver of savings in its original form at about $3.7 million per year. 
“It is still a very rich benefit program, even with benefit changes,” Azar said.
She also recommended increasing the per member per month rate from $1,025 to $1,175 for full-time employees, which the board will request from the Legislature when the 2026 legislative session begins in January. Azar said about 30% of the coverage is paid for by the state, $6% is from the employer, and 28% falls to the employee. The final funding decision will lay with legislators. 
Earlier Wednesday, the Public Education Employees Health Insurance Plan board approved a rate increase request.
“The point is: health care costs are going up everywhere,” Poole said.
Faye Nelson, who chairs SEIB, said she would support the changes the board sought, but that there would have to be changes to premiums.
“The reality is, it’s going to be more of a cost to our employees either now or later,” Nelson said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0420-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

(Photo by Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)Washoe County Commission Chair Alexis Hill says if she’s elected governor of Nevada she’ll put an end to tax giveaways to billionaires such as Elon Musk. Washoe County, she noted, lacks the infrastructure to support Musk’s factories. 
“We know from the Governor’s Office of Economic Development that these do not pencil,” Hill, a Democrat, said Thursday at her gubernatorial campaign announcement in Las Vegas. “The juice isn’t worth the squeeze.” 
Attorney General Aaron Ford, also a Democrat, declared his candidacy in late July for the state’s top spot, and announced Thursday he’s raised more than $1.1 million since.   
Ford, who served as senate majority leader before his election as AG, voted in 2014 to approve a $1.3 billion tax incentive package for Musk’s Gigafactory in Storey County and in 2016 for $750 million in public funding for Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. 
Hill praised Ford, who she said “has committed his life to state service.” She said she’s running because she doesn’t think “the change that we need is actually happening. And so I’m not scared because the establishment has supported AG Ford.” 
The difference between herself and Ford is “I’m not afraid to tell you what I think. …  I believe in fighting Trump, but it’s more than just filing lawsuits against Trump,” she said, referring to Ford’s filings, in tandem with Democratic attorneys general from other states, against Trump’s initiatives such as ending birthright citizenship. 
“I’m more of a policy wonk than a bomb thrower,” said Hill, a Reno native who is serving her second term on the commission. 
Hill is largely unknown in Southern Nevada and acknowledges she is learning the issues, which she says appear to be similar to those in Washoe, “just bigger.” 
As local governments struggle to provide basic services, Hill says now is the time to start the process of tweaking the state’s property tax cap, which limits increases to 3% for a primary residence and 8% for a commercial property. 
Efforts to make even minor adjustments to the cap have failed. 
“I actually think that a lot of lawmakers want to see this happen and need someone to lead the charge,” she said.
Hill acknowledges her experience is confined to local government, where she worked as a planner before running for the commission. 
“I have been told that it is not my time to run for office and that I need to wait my turn,” Hill said, adding she considers her lack of service in state government to be an asset. “I am closer to the people. I am a fed-up mom. I know Nevada can be better.”
In addition to ending tax giveaways to the wealthy, Hill promised to: 

tax corporate investments as assets;
reset property tax upon sale “to ensure people are paying their fair share when they come into our community;”
impose temporary caps on rent;
ensure companies that employ electric vehicles and pay no gas tax, such as Amazon and Tesla, contribute to road construction and maintenance; and, 
get the unhoused the help they need. “The federal funding is not going to be coming to us anymore,” she said.  

Hill characterized Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s $100 million housing initiative, which is intended to subsidize market rate housing for homebuyers earning up to 150% of area median income, as a “drop in the bucket for the real construction costs that it takes to build housing.” 
By capturing tax revenue lost to “folks who are taking advantage of tax controls in our state,” governments can do more at the local and state levels. 
Hill says she supports Sen. Jacky Rosen’s plan to release federal land for housing in Northern Nevada because it conserved sensitive lands. She says she “believes in infill,” which she considers critical to achieving the density required to make mass transit work. 
She says she’s campaigned on a platform of workforce housing, but has taken heat from some residents of Lake Tahoe’s Incline Village and Crystal Bay communities, who say her support for greater density, on the commission and as a member of the Tahoe Regional Planning Authority, is exacerbating water quality issues, supplanting affordable housing with luxury development, and increasing the threat of an evacuation disaster in the event of a wildfire. 
Some Tahoe residents say they are considering filing a lawsuit against Washoe County, which last week adopted housing amendments approved by TRPA.
“I don’t even know if these code amendments will get as much housing as we need,” Hill said. “But it’s a start, and I don’t want to just sit around and do nothing.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AF5AC6F7-0C74-46A3-978D-3F0DBF0F1ECC-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

Let’s take a look.
Ole Miss at Kentucky, 2:30 p.m. 
The 2024 Ole Miss season likely always will be remembered for what might have been. And what might have been was this: The Rebels, led by first-round NFL draft pick Jaxson Dart, should have played in the first 12-team College Football Playoffs. They were talented enough with a school record eight players taken in the NFL’s seven-round draft. That was more than the likes of Notre Dame, Clemson, Penn State, SMU, Boise State and Indiana — all teams that made the playoffs. That was also more than traditional powerhouses such as Alabama, LSU, Michigan, Florida, Southern Cal and Miami.

Rick Cleveland
Of course, Ole Miss did not make the playoffs, and the 2025 Rebels on Saturday will face probably the primary reason the 2024 Rebels didn’t make it: Kentucky. In retrospect, that home defeat to Kentucky, which was a 17-point underdog, ranks as one of the biggest upsets of the 2024 college football season. After somehow defeating No. 6 Ole Miss 20-17 on Sept. 28, Kentucky lost its last six games against FBS teams. Most weren’t close. 
Defeating Kentucky on Saturday — and the Rebels are 9.5-point favorites to do so — won’t exorcise last year’s demon; however, it would be a first step toward making the playoffs this season. It also will provide a first SEC start, on the road, for Ole Miss sophomore quarterback Austin Simmons, who appears to these eyes potentially every bit as good as Dart. Yes, that is sky-high praise, but Simmons appears to have it all: the arm, the smarts, the speed. He appears to throw the football with the ease of throwing a baseball, and you can’t say that about a lot of quarterbacks. Yes, he made a couple of poor decisions in the opener against Georgia State, but he is 19 years young. Saturday should provide a big step in his maturing process.
Kentucky? Kentucky is a question mark, the case with so many college football teams in this transfer portal era. The Wildcats overhauled their squad with 24 transfers, including quarterback Zach Calzada and running back Dante Dowdell, the former Picayune superstar, who is making his third stop in three seasons of college football. Dowdell, who signed with Oregon and transferred to Nebraska as a sophomore, led Kentucky to its opening victory over Toledo with 129 yards and a touchdown on just 14 carries. Dowdell, who packs 227 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame, will challenge the Rebels’ retooled defensive front.
Simply put, Ole Miss needs to take care of business. Stopping Dowdell and forcing Calzada to throw is the first order of that business. Calzada, making his fourth collegiate stop in his seventh year of college football, completed 10 of 23 passes for just 85 yards against Toledo.
Jackson State at Southern Miss, 4 p.m.
Southern Miss is a 7.5-point favorite, but don’t think for a second T.C. Taylor’s JSU Tigers don’t expect to win. And why wouldn’t they? The Tigers have now won 11 straight games. Meanwhile, Southern Miss has lost 11 straight. Jackson State has won those 11 straight by an average margin of 23 points. Southern Miss has lost those 11 straight by 25 points a game. At first glance, you ask yourself: How can USM be favored?
Yes, there is a difference in competition. FBS team such as Southern Miss can offer as many as 85 scholarships. JSU, which plays at the FCS level, can offer 63 scholarships, each of which can be split among multiple players. Theoretically, USM should have more depth. But then, Taylor says the Tigers are a solid two-deep at every position, and I haven’t heard Charles Huff, USM’s new head coach, say the same.
Huff has had nothing but praise this week for JSU, which defeated Huff’s alma mater, Hampton, 28-14 last Saturday. “Winning cures a lot and they have won,” Huff said. “Their players expect to win, their fan base expects to win … It’s gonna be a challenge. We need to improve quickly.”
To these eyes, Southern Miss appeared an improved team, although it was overmatched at the line of scrimmage last Saturday against Mississippi State. The biggest difference is at the quarterback position, where multi-talented Braylon Braxton should give the Golden Eagles a chance to win any game remaining on the schedule. Of course, until they prove differently, the Eagles also could lose any game remaining on the schedule, including this one. Expect a near-sellout crowd, a terrific atmosphere and a highly competitive contest. 
Arizona State at Mississippi State, 6:30 p.m.
Oddsmakers make Arizona State a 6.5-point favorite in what could be a statement game for Mississippi State. The statement? “We’re back!”
We will see. But I saw enough last Saturday to believe State is much improved over last season, especially at the line of scrimmage. State is huge — and can move — on both sides of the ball. Blake Shapen, a top-shelf quarterback, is healthy after sitting out the last eight games of 2024. Do not forget that the 24-year-old Shapen four years ago quarterbacked Baylor to a Big 12 Conference championship and was the MVP of a 21-16 championship victory over Oklahoma State. Shapen completed a record 17 straight passes in that one.
Clearly, Shapen can play, and he played well early last season in a 30-23 road loss to Arizona State. Led by irrepressible running back Cam Skattebo, who rushed for 262 yards and broke seemingly that many tackles, the Sun Devils staved off a fourth quarter State rally. Arizona State went on to an 11-victory season and the NCAA playoffs. You know what happened to State.
But a Mississippi State victory Saturday night would not shock this writer for any number of reasons, including that Skattebo, who pretty much single-handedly whipped State last year, now plays for the New York Giants. Other reasons:

Arizona State was far from impressive in its 38-19 opening week victory over Northern Arizona.
Arizona State is 0-2 all-time playing on the road against SEC teams and 1-6 overall against the SEC.
State has covered the spread in its last four games against ranked teams. The Bulldogs are due to win one of those.

It’s hard to overstate how important this game is for State, mostly because of how difficult the schedule becomes down the road. Beginning Sept. 27, the Bulldogs finish the season, in order, against Tennessee, Texas A&M, Florida, Texas, Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri and Ole Miss. Good luck with that.
Reaching six victories and a bowl game would be a huge step forward for Jeff Lebby and his Bulldogs. It’ll be hard to find six without one of those coming this Saturday.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/04151907/AP25243056487570.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

Charles Jackson French, a 22-year-old mess attendant aboard the USS Gregory, rescued 15 sailors during the Battle of Guadalcanal.
Four years before the U.S. entered World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served as an attendant — one of the only positions open to Black Americans. And when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, he reenlisted.
Nine months later, three Japanese destroyers opened fire on the USS Gregory, killing 24 and injuring many others. When French saw injured shipmates drifting toward enemy fire, he tied a rope around his waist and dove into the dark water. He swam through the night, dragging the raft of injured shipmates through shark-infested waters. More than six hours later, a plane spotted them, and they were rescued.
French received a letter of commendation for his heroic act, but no medals.
Now his heroism is being recognized. The Naval Base in San Diego has renamed its rescue swimmer training pool after him. He has been posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and now the Navy plans to name a destroyer after him.
French’s nephew, Roscoe Harris, called the story of his uncle “an American story. … He cared about his fellow sailors. He cared about them when the Navy was segregated. He saved those white sailors because they needed saving.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/03125730/Sept5-charles-jackson-french-navy-73022-768x432-1.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434
,Mississippi Today,2025-09-05 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Meet the unlikely pair behind an ousted Hinds County supervisor’s election heist allegations,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/05/meet-the-unlikely-pair-behind-an-ousted-hinds-county-supervisors-election-heist-allegations/,"Three years ago, Cynthia Walker and Marilyn Hetrick didn’t know the ousted Hinds County supervisor from Adam. Today, they're battling what they allege is a hijacked election process.","Cynthia Walker said she was 15 years old when she participated in her first ballot box review — reconciling the number of ballots with poll book entries and taking a count of everything, down to the number of rubber bands in each box.
She claimed her findings, recorded in handwritten notes on a yellow legal pad, led to a landmark election challenge for a Black supervisor 50 miles north of Jackson. The 67-year-old Yazoo City resident said she’s taken part in dozens of these examinations since then.
So when Walker saw former Hinds County Supervisor David Archie in the news in the summer of 2023, incredulous that he’d lost reelection in a smackdown by a political newcomer, she thought to herself, “I know what happened to him,” Walker told Mississippi Today. “I’m going to reach out to him.”
Two days later, Walker appeared beside Archie at a press conference outside the sheriff’s office to decry an alleged “high-tech” conspiracy involving a former election commissioner and voting machine company. She stood 5-foot, wearing a short tapered haircut, jewel dotted shades and a pastel yellow pantsuit.
“She’s a little bitty person, but she has the power of a giant coming out of her,” said Marilyn Hetrick, a 75-year-old Clinton resident, retired assistant personnel director for the city of Jackson, and one of Archie’s staunchest supporters.
Three years ago, Walker and Hetrick didn’t know each other — or the ousted supervisor, for that matter — from Adam. 
It was a curious time to become an ally of Archie, who’d become widely defined by his antics, such as a profanity-filled fit during a 2021 supervisor’s meeting. As officers removed him, he tore down the plexiglass partitions on the dias. This behavior, according to his supporters, has all been in the name of drawing attention to corruption in the county.
But the two retired women have teamed up in the last two years to fight what they call a calculated election heist. The alleged proof?
Missing voter signature books. Improperly sealed ballot boxes. Commingled election machine hard drives. A post-election Facebook message from the chair of the Democratic Executive Committee reading, “I’m f—ing David Archie on site !!!” 
This spawned a lawsuit, crafted from Hetrick’s suburban kitchen, exhibits strewn across her banquette, with Walker on speed dial from up north near the edge of the Mississippi Delta.

“It was a radical departure from election laws. It was gross misconduct. It was illegal and immoral and disrespectful. It was voter disenfranchisement,” Walker said on the steps of the courthouse last week, Hetrick behind her.
“You just cannot ‘have it your way,’ like you’re at Burger King, when you’re processing election materials,” Walker added.
Even the harshest critics of Hinds County elections, such as former longtime Hinds County Republican Party chairman Pete Perry, say the challenge is baloney. Procedural irregularities alone do not demonstrate fraud, and they’re not likely to nullify a wide-margin outcome, experts said.
“I don’t think they ran a good election. I don’t believe they ran it legally,” Perry said. “I also don’t believe they did a damn thing that affected 1,800 votes. It’s not possible.”
On the day of the deadline for Archie’s petition for judicial review of the election in September of 2023, Hetrick said her fingers were practically bleeding from all the typing. Then at about 10 a.m., Archie received a call from Supervisor Robert Graham: The county had just experienced a cyber attack. The circuit clerk’s office cleared out for the day.
“My heart just dropped,” Hetrick said. 
Archie went down to the courthouse anyway, manilla folder in hand, and recorded videos in front of the locked glass doors to the unlit, empty office, according to his recent Facebook post. 
Still, Hinds County Circuit Clerk Zack Wallace — who was initially named as a defendant in the lawsuit — testified that his office was open that day, and Archie took no additional steps to file, meaning he’d missed his deadline. The judge agreed.
Thus ensued a two-year battle over whether the office was open or closed, culminating in over a dozen subpoenas and a packed courtroom hearing on Aug. 27, featuring a who’s who of county powerbrokers.
The special judge appointed to hear the case, retired Circuit Court Judge Barry Ford, reversed his original ruling that dismissed the case, allowing Archie’s lawsuit to proceed. 
“Today’s ruling was a win for our case to restore election integrity,” Hetrick wrote on Facebook later that day. “Those who intentionally disregarded election law and protocol must be held accountable as a deterrent to others who might try this in the future.”
One morning in the fall of 2022, a recently widowed Hetrick struck up a conversation with a tall, broad fellow with a slick head while walking on the track at the Baptist Healthplex near her home in Clinton. 
He was friendly, calm and knowledgeable, she said. Hetrick asked the man what he did for a living. “I work for government,” he said. What branch? “County.” What position? “I’m a supervisor.”
Which supervisor? “I’m David Archie,” he said.
Hetrick was floored. This wasn’t the loud-mouthed politician she was used to reading about in the news, whose opponent she actively supported years earlier.
Hetrick asked him about his boardroom blow-ups, which he described as a statement, a method of getting people to care about their local government’s dysfunction. After Hetrick vetted her new friend with her former coworkers from City Hall, Archie took her on rides-along to show her the progress he’s made in the county — the things he says the media never broadcasts.
“I started to understand where he was coming from,” Hetrick said.

Hetrick lives just outside of Archie’s district, in an area that was represented by Archie’s main foe on the board, former Supervisor Credell Calhoun. The two men hadn’t always been at odds.
Calhoun, a businessman and former auditor in the governor’s office, told Mississippi Today he supported Archie’s campaign for supervisor in 2019. When Archie won narrowly and it looked like there may be a challenge to that election, Calhoun said the board of supervisors directed all of its state road funding to Archie’s district, District 2, to ingratiate voters to Archie in the event there was a rematch. 
When that didn’t happen, Calhoun said the board took half of the money back to divvy up across the county, angering Archie. “We were trying to help him so much and then he turned,” Calhoun said.
Archie refutes this, saying the board directed the funding to his district because it had been neglected for several years. Archie has repeatedly accused Calhoun of misspending public money and impeding county progress, which Calhoun denies. He calls Calhoun a “40-year con man,” and Hetrick parrots.
So when the county’s Democratic Party primary rolled around the next year, Hetrick spent most of her energy supporting the candidate Archie’s camp preferred against Calhoun, former state representative Deborah Dixon. Dixon and Calhoun had similar contention, and she ran against the incumbent after she said he backed the candidate who knocked her out of the Legislature in 2019.
Hetrick served as a poll watcher — her first time in the role — for Dixon. At the election watch party that evening, Hetrick celebrated her candidate’s victory but was stunned by her friend Archie’s loss.

Archie had lost convincingly to Anthony Smith, the owner of a computer maintenance company and a real estate firm, by nearly 2-to-1. Smith, regarded by some as “somebody nobody knew,” took home more votes in 25 out of 26 precincts in the district. The total count was 2,810 for Archie and 4,687 for Smith. 
Plenty of residents were unsurprised by Archie’s ouster after all of the bickering. After all, voters shook up more than half of the board – including voting out Calhoun and a third incumbent. But Archie and his team were taken aback.
“Something just doesn’t feel right and we’re trying to figure it out,” Archie told Hetrick when she called him later that night.
Cue Walker. 
The retired paralegal, who’s since opened her home to shelter homeless families, had run as an independent for mayor of Yazoo City in 2022 and lost, receiving just 5% of the vote. 
Walker publicly alleges her election, and others in Yazoo, were rigged, the work of a Jackson-based election consultant named Toni Johnson. 
This is where Walker claims to have found a pattern: She alleges Johnson “came into Yazoo City blazing” starting during the 2018 municipal elections. Walker paints a vague picture of Johnson being in cahoots with the election machine techs and having special access to the computers. And that the candidates Johnson works for always win.
“She went to the highest bidder,” Archie said.
This connection is a handy detail for the Archie camp because Johnson previously served as a Hinds County Election Commissioner, where she found herself in Archie’s crosshairs. She’d also run against him for the supervisor seat in 2019.
Archie accused Johnson of pocketing county money in 2021, WJTV reported, and in early 2022, the auditor’s office arrested her for allegedly defrauding the government by using pandemic relief funds to purchase a television for her home and issuing no-show contracts for services including voting machine audits.
In the 2022 Yazoo City election, Walker alleged Johnson attended the ballot examination wearing her ankle monitor. Johnson pleaded guilty to embezzlement related to the flat screens in 2023 and stepped down from the commission. 
Later that year, after forming a nonprofit called We Must Vote, Johnson consulted Smith’s campaign against Archie. 
“She was very effective in helping me and, you know, I don’t judge anybody,” Smith told Mississippi Today. “I think she’s still a beautiful person.”
Archie’s team hasn’t provided evidence, or a description of evidence, to support allegations of election machine tampering. But Walker did proclaim during the post-election press conference that Johnson’s “blueprint, her DNA, her blood is all over the stealing, the roguishness and the thieving of elections in Mississippi.”
Johnson’s attorney Lisa Ross spoke at the event: “Show us one machine Toni Johnson has touched. She has touched none,” Ross said.
Archie vowed to bring his information to the county district attorney, the attorney general, the secretary of state and the FBI. 
“It is unbelievable that she (Johnson) runs around throwing her weight around because it’s our understanding there’s a real big fish,” Archie said at the 2023 press conference, holding his hands at the distance of a walleye, “that is behind her and protecting her.”
Archie repeated the “big fish” line to Mississippi Today during the reporting of this story, but would not elaborate, saying “you’ll soon find out.”
About a week after the press conference, the resolution board was still working to canvas the absentee ballots to determine which were legally cast and should be accepted. Democratic primary elections, which often determine the winner in Hinds County, are overseen by the Hinds County Democratic Executive Committee.
Jacquie Amos, then-chair of the committee, explained to Mississippi Today that some voters fill out absentee votes on ballots printed on regular paper, which cannot be fed through the machine. Resolution board members, trained by the committee, must transfer the votes to scannable ballots.
So if someone walked into the courthouse basement that day, one week after the election, this is what they’d see: Tables of people bubbling in hundreds of fresh ballots. 
Archie, joined by supporters, did just that, and things got heated. 
“You don’t really know what they’re doing, marking one ballot to another,” said Dixon, who was there to follow her own race.
Amos said she went down to the basement to try to explain the procedure to onlookers, since “no one knows the process, they always think something is wrong,” she said.
Perry was there, too, and said workers should have been looking over the board’s shoulder but weren’t — an account Amos rejects. Local activist Addie Lee Green, who was attempting to observe workers behind the counter in the clerk’s office, said the election officials attempted to call the sheriff to escort her out.
In addition to Dixon, Archie had backed Malcolm Johnson, former county special projects manager and talk show host, in another supervisors race. 
“He said, ‘Jacquie, we’re not going to let you steal this election from Deb or Malcolm,’” Amos said. “I turned around and said, ‘Are you kidding me?’”
Someone had to hold Amos back from a physical altercation. She said she was fuming when she left the courthouse to cool off and received a Facebook message, “Hey, don’t let them cheat Debroha (sic) Dixon out of her election. She won fair and square.”
“She won,” Amos responded. “But I’m f—ing David Archie on site !!!”
Amos said she’d already been on the outs with the supervisor. She said she’d incensed Archie when she refused — in response to many pleas — to run against Calhoun. Archie said that’s not true.
Soon, her profane Facebook message — which became exhibit E in Archie’s lawsuit — would appear in news outlets across the metro, though she said Mississippi Today was the first to call her for her side. 

Exhibit E in former Hinds County Supervisor David Archie’s election challenge.
Amos said she was disappointed Archie would use the message, composed in a heated moment, to paint her as corrupt, especially because she grew up with him as a kid. 
Amos’ father, a basketball and baseball coach at the now-defunct Hinds County Agricultural High School in Utica, had been Archie’s mentor before he passed. Her father campaigned door-to-door for Archie and was “crazy about him,” Amos said.
“‘If Daddy were here, David would not be acting that way.’ Mama says that all the time,” Amos said.
All of the drama is hurtful in more ways than one.
“What it does, in my opinion, is make voters stay away from the process,” Amos said. “People won’t vote. They say, ‘There’s corruption.’”
After the dust up in the basement, and the committee officially certified the election, Archie asked Cynthia and Hetrick to help with his ballot box review — the process a candidate must undergo in order to challenge the results.
Hetrick accepted the offer, thinking it probably wouldn’t bear fruit, but at least she could help her friend accept his loss. Until she saw inside the boxes.
In the election commission’s fluorescently lit office in late August of 2023, two white top folding tables sat end to end. Wallace, the circuit clerk, brought the election contents, the soft blue boxes carrying ballots and precinct materials, into the room so Archie’s camp could conduct its examination.
Walker was the leader, joined by Hetrick, advertising specialist Taylor Turcotte, Turcotte’s friend and Green, a former Bolton alderwoman and a frequent unsuccessful statewide candidate.
What happened in that room is a matter of perspective. Smith, who brought a campaign supporter known only to him by his alias “Eyes”, sat across the table from the women, filming videos of them on his phone. 
Walker described a tense scene, a gaggle of “grown rusty men that were on the attack, that ran interference, that cussed and screamed and threatened to fight.”
Turcotte’s friend was so uncomfortable that she didn’t come back after the first day. “They didn’t grow up in the hood like me,” Walker said. 
Smith rejected this telling, insisting all he did was “watch them very closely.” But Turcotte said Smith’s unblinking, “cold, dead stare” actually made her fear for Archie’s safety. At one point, a scrap nearly broke out, three of the women said.
“That’s how they pick fights with David is they get up in his face and they insult him, and then he gets loud to overwhelm them. And then David looks like the ass,” Turcotte said.
Hetrick, a devout Catholic, began arriving at the commission with her rosary wrapped around her wrist. Walker, who carried pepper spray, made a joke that Hetrick should bring holy water.
The next day, Hetrick said she brought her tiny white plastic bottle, embellished with a gold cross, and sprinkled the chairs around the table before Smith arrived that morning. The tiffs subsided after that, Hetrick said.
What disturbed the women more than the intimidating environment was what they said they found — or didn’t find — inside the boxes.
Each of the precinct boxes contained paper ballots, the petition states.
But the team alleges they found no machine tapes, the print-outs containing the number of votes scanned. They allegedly determined that all of the precinct media sticks, the hard drives that contain the digital record of the vote, were commingled in a bag with no seal, stashed in a commissioner’s desk in an open cubicle.
They alleged that out of 26 precincts, the boxes contained only eight receipt books, where voters record their signature when they sign in to vote, five ballot accounting forms, which show the number of ballots used and left over, and one machine key. 
This was after seven days of review.
“Everything was stored in all kinds of different places illegally but nobody cared,” said Turcotte, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican against U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson in 2024 and for an open seat on the Jackson City Council in 2025.
The team alleges there’s no way to determine how many people actually voted in the election due to the illegal maintenance of the records. 
“If Mr. Smith won, why will they not allow us to validate his win?” Walker said.
Amos said she didn’t know of any documents that were missing, and if the materials weren’t in their designated precinct boxes, it would have been because the commissioners had already started cleaning the boxes out to prepare for a runoff. The records should be stored together in the commission’s office, Amos said.
“I am not Olivia Pope and this is not Defiance,” Amos said.
The committee voted Amos out in 2024, replacing her with Clinton alderman James Lott, a director at Hinds Community College. She left the committee altogether and now serves as the chair of the committee for the 2nd Congressional District. Lott told Mississippi Today his goal is to advance integrity in Hinds County elections through proper pollworker training and giving equal treatment to any complaints.
“Everything deserves to be heard and investigated,” Lott said.
Through an attorney, the Hinds County Election Commission did not respond to Archie’s allegations or answer questions about the current status or whereabouts of the materials. 
Because the commissioners will make up the tribunal that offers recommendations to the judge deciding Archie’s case, commission attorney Ray Chambers said they have a responsibility not to respond to press inquiries prior to trial. The only filings from defendants in the lawsuit so far argue Archie submitted past the deadline and avoid any explanation or alternative to the claims Archie laid out.
Perry said his experience is that the laws around election procedure — such as chain of custody, storage of materials and ensuring they are sealed — are frequently disregarded in Hinds County. But it’s inconceivable to him that 18 signature books have vanished.
“I’ll bet my ranch on the fact that the sign-in books exist,” he said.

Mississippi Today requested to inspect the books, but Chambers said state law requires that when a challenge arises, the materials are kept under seal until the court hearing.
Perry, who has conducted dozens of ballot box examinations and testified as an expert in election challenges, was present at the commission’s office for some of Archie’s review. He said he observed the team talking back and forth; it didn’t look to him like they knew what they were doing.
“There wasn’t anything to be gained by where they were spending their time,” he said. “All they did was make a scene to say, ‘We spent a week down there.’”
Archie’s lawsuit itself does not allege that the paper ballots he reviewed were forged. It doesn’t utter ballot stuffing or vote buying.
“As a kid in the 60s, I saw it done,” Perry said. “That’s where everybody was marking paper ballots and putting it in a box. And at the end of the day, they’re sitting there, late at night underneath a light hanging from a single cord above a table in an old closed grocery store.”
But that’s not how it works anymore. Today, votes are counted by a scanner instead of by hand. When ballots are printed, there’s a record attached to verify how many are used and left over. The receipt books record how many people entered the polls through their signature. In the poll books, election workers mark on a roster of registered voters, recording who voted. Both of these may be matched to the number on the machine or the number of paper ballots. 
Mistakes do happen, particularly with affidavit and absentee votes, and can make a difference in a slim margin race when challenged.
But fabricating ballots in the hundreds, let alone thousands, in theory would require a multi-person conspiracy and a kind of sophistication that all evidence shows Hinds County officials do not possess, Perry said.

“You can’t manufacture that kind of vote. The system has too many checks and balances in it to do it,” Perry said.
That doesn’t mean Hinds County elections don’t have problems. 
Bridgette Morgan, a candidate in the 2024 election for Hinds County Court Judge, brought a challenge after losing in a runoff last November. In the first race of three candidates, she received nearly enough votes, shy just 9, to win outright.
Morgan alleged that irregularities were to blame for her not being declared the winner. She was unsuccessful in getting a jury to agree with her in July, and she told Mississippi Today she plans to appeal. (Morgan’s challenge was for a general election, so a regular panel of jurors was responsible for deciding the case).
Perry said he’s repeatedly told Hinds County officials that if they don’t start following the laws around securing and storing ballots and maintaining proper accounting, a close election will soon enough result in a new election, costing the county an extra $100,000.
“Because in a close election, the way that they’re ignoring the law, refusing to even pretend to follow the law, it’s going to get overturned,” Perry said. “Now, David Archie’s is not a close election.”
Both Hetrick and Walker refute Perry’s analysis. Hetrick said he lacks imagination; Walker said if he knows of repeating violations, he should have done something about it by now.
In the case of suspected outright election or voter fraud, a local district attorney, the attorney general’s office or the U.S. Attorney’s Office may step in.
But most of the election laws Archie’s lawsuit alleged were broken — those related to controlling the contents of precinct boxes, sealings, receipt book storing, the process for examining affidavits — do not come with criminal penalties for violations, leaving few avenues for prosecutors.
Reached about Archie’s claims, a secretary of state’s office spokesperson said simply that the state office has no involvement in the matter. The attorney general’s office confirmed to Mississippi Today it had an active investigation into Morgan’s case, but not Archie’s.
So what’s the recourse? In Mississippi, virtually the only way to address a complaint over the handling of an election is for a failed candidate to file a challenge with the qualifying body in the race — in Archie’s case, the Democratic Executive Committee. If that doesn’t work, a candidate can petition the court for judicial review. 
The losing candidate must have the money to hire a lawyer. In these cases, the proper defendant is the winning candidate, not the officials who were responsible for running a fair election. 
In the course of one of these lawsuits, a judge could order an election official be jailed for breaking the law, but Perry said he’s only seen that happen once.
Candidates have a difficult time prevailing in election challenges. They must show how irregularities could have made a difference in the outcome of the race. The courts are reluctant to order a new election without clear evidence that the will of the people could not be determined.
Take the challenge of Eugene Fouche, a Black candidate for supervisor in Yazoo County, in 1979. This is the election challenge and ballot review Walker referenced – she was actually 21 at the time.
Walker called it a precedent-setting case that resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Fouche’s favor, finding that he should have been declared the winner over the white incumbent. 
That never happened, according to the lawyer who brought the case in circuit court, Ed Blackmon. The local judge dismissed the case and Fouche lost on appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, records show. 
“I’ve never cited it,” said Blackmon, who has brought several election challenges since.
Still, anyone interested in politics in Yazoo County in the 1970s and 80s would have been enthralled by the case, which came as Black Mississippians were increasingly engaging in politics following historic enfranchisement progress made during the Civil Rights Movement.
“I could think of someone who was living in that community at that time, that would be a seminal moment in their lives,” Blackmon said.
Where Archie has had slim success in his political career — winning just one of at least nine campaigns for office and serving one term as supervisor — he’s excelled at recruiting a loyal audience.

On his podcast, a recording by an R&B singer introduces the host, “David Archie, yeah, he’s a man that will take a stand,” before shifting into an Alvin Garrett tune belting, “If you won’t fight with me, if you don’t believe in me, I’m going to walk on by myself.”
Archie has been stirring up news long before the blockbuster supervisor’s meeting: getting arrested at a protest against racial profiling, holding a demonstration against a civil rights figure or alleging excessive force against Jackson airport officials after a bloody altercation during his 20s, when he worked as a fraud prevention officer with the state’s welfare department, according to the Clarion Ledger. 
“I know some of y’all are afraid to shake the system, to challenge government, to challenge status quo,” Archie told listeners on one of his most recent broadcasts. “And then you get mad at me because I’m fighting to make it better for you.”
Earlier this year, Archie ran for mayor of Jackson, then took a job in constituent services at City Hall at the tail end of then-Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s term before getting canned by incoming Mayor John Horhn.
He’s nothing if not persistent — a quality Hetrick and Walker say they can get behind.
Walker said in the majority of her election reviews, when she has recommended candidates challenge their election, they say they don’t have the money or energy. “No one thought David would go this distance,” Walker said.
Hetrick, who left her job under former Mayor Harvey Johnson in 2001 after a local newspaper printed her address, rattling the mother of a then-middle schooler, feels similarly ready to fight now.
Smith’s attorney in the election challenge, Warren Martin, offered another perspective: “He’s convinced people to follow him no matter what, follow him through the desert to water. But it’s a mirage. They’re drinking sand.”
Hetrick said the detractors are missing the point: The case isn’t just about Archie’s supervisor’s seat. It’s about shining a light on the brazen mishandling of elections at large. She doesn’t wish for the spectacle to discourage voters from participating in elections, but to ignite them to demand better.
“Even if we lose the trial, we’re not through,” Hetrick said.
By now, Smith has served nearly half of his four-year term. Judge Ford asked lawyers in the case to agree on a hearing date in the coming days, but it’s possible another appeal could delay it further. By the time Archie’s team exposes the evidence it says it has, the next election could be underway.
So will Archie run again? 
“I hope to be in the position before then,” he said. “And I absolutely, 100%, unless I’m sick or fall off the face of the earth, will run in 2027.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/27161202/Archie-hearing-1.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: More CT families slipping toward poverty,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/ct-families-poverty-report/,"About 40% of Connecticut households couldn’t afford basic needs in 2023, United Way found, and poverty is growing fastest outside urban areas.","A record-high 581,000 Connecticut households, about 40%, couldn’t afford a basic “survival” budget in 2023, according to a new analysis from the United Way of Connecticut.
And while more than 60% of families in Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford and other poor cities fall below this threshold, poverty now is growing the fastest outside of urban centers.
The United Way on Friday released its annual poverty assessment based on its ALICE methodology. An acronym for Asset-Limited, Income-Constrained [and] Employed, ALICE is an alternative to the longstanding Federal Poverty Level, a metric increasingly criticized by policymakers as outdated and misleading.
The United Way estimates it cost a family of four — two parents and two children — $116,000 to cover basic survival needs, including food, housing, utilities, child and health care and transportation in 2023.
For a single parent with one child, the projected survival budget two years ago was $69,000.
The ALICE methodology assumes these families cannot afford a computer but rely only on a smart phone to meet all information technology needs.
Minimum earnings to cover a survival budget rose about 9% from 2021 to 2023 while the number of ALICE households has grown almost 17% since 2019.
“The number of ALICE households has really ticked up pretty meaningfully since 2019,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president of the United Way’s Connecticut chapter. “That’s not the direction any of us want to see this going.”
Most of the largest increases have occurred in the state’s rural eastern half and in the suburbs surrounding cities. For example, the share of ALICE households in New Milford, a suburb north of Danbury, grew from 26% in 2019 to 44% in 2023.
“The idea of people struggling is not limited to any one part of our state, and, in fact, is getting worse in parts of our state [that] might like to think that they are somehow safe from this, this epidemic of financial need,” Bates said.
The new report also underlines Connecticut’s longstanding income inequality along racial and ethnic lines.
While 34% of white households and 31% of Asian households were below the ALICE threshold, other groups faced greater rates of hardship. These include:

Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 63% 
Hispanic, 59% 
American Indian Alaska native, 59% 
Black, 56% 
Two or more races, 49% 

The ALICE calculations represent an alternative to the Federal Poverty Level, a simple metric developed in the mid-1960s by U.S. Social Security Administration economists and based largely on the cost of a minimum food diet. A family of four earning more than $30,000 was considered above the poverty line in 2023. A family of two had to make just $19,720.
The Urban Institute, a nonprofit economic and social policy research group based in Washington, D.C., echoed the United Way’s ALICE conclusions last December.
The institute reported a family of four in the northeastern U.S. needed to earn close to $151,100 in 2022 to be economically secure. Its True Cost of Economic Security measure evaluates adequate food, clothing, housing, health care, child care, transportation, postsecondary education, debt service, savings for unexpected expenses and retirement, and additional miscellaneous costs.
“The [federal] poverty line tells you very little about who is struggling in your community,” Bates said. “It tells you about who is suffering the most. It does not tell you who is the whole of that universe of people trying to make those basic tasks, month to month.”
The United Way, which has been presenting ALICE projections since 2014, initially encountered surprise and resistance from state officials and others when it reported a survival cost far above the Federal Poverty Level, Bates said. 
But once skeptics review the ALICE budget component-by-component, Bates added, “every single time, not kidding, 100% of the time, people will have said, ‘That number’s too low.’”
Critics of the ALICE projections and similar calculations note Connecticut’s social safety net, on average, is far more generous than those offered in most other states.
But Connecticut’s investments in these areas, relative to inflation, have been slipping for more than a decade as state officials prioritize reducing the huge pension debt the state amassed between 1939 and 2010. 
Connecticut, which entered this past fiscal year with more than $35 billion in unfunded pension obligations, has dedicated $8.6 billion captured by savings programs into the pensions since 2020 and is expected to deposit close to another $2.5 billion this fall.
Meanwhile, a legislative leadership plan to dramatically boost payments to doctors who treat poor patients on Medicaid was scaled back dramatically.
Connecticut hadn’t raised Medicaid reimbursement rates in a broad-based fashion since 2007, leaving many insured patients unable to find physicians who will treat them. Leaders said a $250 million infusion in this area is needed to make a big difference and pledged to get there in four years, starting with $75 million in extra Medicaid spending this fiscal year.
But because of budget caps and savings rules, that $75 million investment ultimately was scaled back to just $15 million.
Similarly, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities says state education aid to cities and towns — once adjusted for inflation — effectively is down more than $400 million per year since Gov. Ned Lamont took office in 2019, forcing increasing property tax hikes at the local level.
Advocates for low- and middle-income households say one of the best ways to assist families in or slipping into poverty is to create a new per-child credit within the state income tax. The United Way is among those spearheading a push for a $600-per-child credit – with a maximum of $1,800 – for single-parent households making less than $100,000 and couples under $200,000. 
The credit, which analysts have estimated would cost the state $300 million to $350 million per year, also would be refundable. That means even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to apply the credit to, it would have $600 per child added to its refund. 
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has been resistant to a child tax credit. The administration says the governor prefers to offer tax breaks that reach a broader range of households than the roughly 270,000 that would qualify for a per-child benefit.
The governor last year proposed boosting another income tax credit that offsets a portion of municipal property tax bills from $300 to $350, and broadening eligibility. But while Lamont’s plan would have benefited about 800,000 filers, it only would have distributed about $85 million or one-quarter of the total relief proposed for the child tax credit.
Lamont and the Democratic-controlled legislature in 2023 adopted one of the largest income tax cuts in state history, returning about $460 million, chiefly to middle-class households this year. Most families received about $300 extra.
But many legislators have said that, since income taxes are rarely reduced, the claim of the largest cut in state history is misleading. That relief, they say, has been too modest given inflation and eroding municipal aid and core state programs.
Congress and President Donald Trump recently ordered big cuts in aid to Connecticut and other states for health care, food stamps and other programs, Bates noted, adding many families here likely will continue to lose ground over the next few years. A $600-per-child credit, while costing just a fraction of recent state surpluses, could lift thousands of households above the desperation level.
“Legislators, I think, understand that if you are interested in talking about the people in your district scraping by paycheck to paycheck,” she added, “this [ALICE report] is the data that you want to pay attention to.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_057-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434
,California,2025-09-05 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,San Mateo County lawsuit exposes California’s penchant for state budgeting tricks,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/california-budget-san-mateo-lawsuit/,The tools and tricks employed to close California's budget deficits come from an inventory of techniques developed over decades. A recent lawsuit spotlighted a strategy used in 2004.,"California has a sorry history of shortsighted state budgets, leading to periodic crises when revenues fall short of matching spending due to economic slowdowns or fanciful expectations. The current budget, enacted in June, is one example.
Three years ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed that the state had a $97.5 billion surplus, based on what turned out to be revenue projections about $40 billion a year higher than reality. The phantom surplus spawned big increases in spending that could not be sustained.
The 2025-26 general fund budget has an actual $20 billion gap between income and outgo that’s being covered by dipping into emergency reserves, accounting gimmicks and on- and off-the-books borrowing. Moreover, both administration and legislative budget advisors believe that a “structural deficit” will be felt indefinitely.
The tools and tricks being employed to close the current budget’s gap come from an inventory of techniques that fiscal insiders have developed over several decades and given monikers, such as double-flip, triple-flip and ERAF, that only veterans of the Capitol’s incessant money battles understand.
ERAF stands for Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and was created 33 years ago, during Republican Gov. Pete Wilson’s first term, to help him and legislators deal with a recession-caused budget deficit. They diverted billions of dollars in property taxes from local governments to school districts through the augmentation fund, thereby reducing the state’s constitutional obligation to finance education and closing the state budget deficit.
Although local governments had to eat a major reduction in revenue, Wilson and legislators later made it up — more or less — with proceeds of a new sales tax, although restricting the money to police and fire services.
Similar maneuvers have been used to cover subsequent budget pinches, including one that newly elected Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger employed in 2004 to help fill a major hole in the budget he inherited after Gray Davis was recalled by voters.
The 2004 scheme included shifting another $1.3 billion in local property taxes to schools and eliminating local governments’ historic share of vehicle license fees. In return for giving up license revenue, local agencies would receive annual payments from the state calculated on a formula based on property tax growth.
In essence, these property tax and vehicle fee shifts are loans. Local officials have complained for years that the state’s promises of repayment have fallen short of covering the lost revenues by many billions of dollars.
The ongoing conflict entered a new phase last month when San Mateo County sued the state, alleging that it had been shorted the money it should have received from the 2004 license shift due to a quirk in the way San Mateo’s school districts are financed.
Several of the county’s school systems are designated as “basic aid,” meaning they receive only token amounts of state funds because local property taxes completely finance their operations, thanks to having high taxable property values. That, San Mateo contends, unfairly bent the formula used to calculate its vehicle license reimbursement.
The county pegs the shortfall at $38 million, and says it would have been even higher under the state’s original calculation but was partially modified after complaints.
“These funds are owed to San Mateo County and our 20 cities,” County Executive Mike Callagy said in a statement. “And instead of living up to its obligations, the state wants us to absorb the cost.”
While the amount at stake in the suit is relatively small, it represents the much larger rift between state and local officials, and exemplifies the convoluted ways the state has continued to paper over its shaky finances rather than squarely face them.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/030825_San_Mateo_Sheriff_JK_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-05 08:56:42.940434

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) An Iowa nursing home inadvertently locked a resident out of the facility, leaving her outside the building overnight in the rain.
According to state inspection records, a female resident of the Harmony Marshalltown nursing home exited the facility at 8 p.m. on July 7, to sit in the home’s courtyard. The resident couldn’t get back into the facility until 6 a.m. the following day.
Inspectors allege the staff failed to do visual bed checks on the woman for 10 hours, leaving her pounding on the door of the building amid rain, thunder and lightning.

The woman “began to panic, became fearful, scared and crying,” inspectors allege. Eventually, a kitchen worker heard her pounding on the door and let her inside. The woman later told inspectors she would no longer go outside alone to smoke for fear of it happening again.
The woman “experienced serious actual psychosocial harm due to being left outside overnight,” the inspectors reported.
Inspectors concluded that while the courtyard door’s locking mechanism wasn’t engaged, the latch and the weight of the door effectively locked out anyone not strong enough to open it. The door “failed to open without excess force,” the inspectors concluded, which resulted in “in a serious likelihood of serious injury, impairment or death.”
The woman later told inspectors she had been had been scared and cold. She reported that she kept pushing on a doorbell to summon the staff but later learned the device was broken and didn’t work. She reported that she sat by the gas grill in the courtyard but didn’t want to touch it due to the lightning.
“She just tried to huddle against the door to keep warm,” the inspectors reported.
The kitchen employee who let the woman inside later told inspectors the woman was crying and shaking from being wet, scared and cold. A colleague described the woman as hysterical. A licensed practical nurse told inspectors the woman was “emotionally and psychosocially devastated” about being left outside all night.
Man was left with ‘nowhere to go’ 
Harmony Marshalltown was also cited for an incident involving a male resident of the home who left the facility on July 3 at 6 p.m. to visit his dog at a friend’s home. The man didn’t inform the staff he was leaving, according to inspectors.
At around 8:50 p.m., the administrator of the home became aware the staff couldn’t find the resident, so she and the director of nursing left the building to go look for the man.
At around 10 p.m., the administrator notified the police the man was missing. She and the director of nursing then continued their search until 1:30 a.m.
At about 2 a.m., the resident called Harmony Marshalltown to request a ride back to the facility from his brother’s house — although state records also refer to the house as belonging to a friend.
After no one from the facility showed up, the resident left his brother’s house and, at 5:30 a.m., was found at a gas station where the police provided assistance and summoned the administrator of the home.
At the convenience store, the administrator allegedly attempted to have the resident sign a form indicating he was discharging himself from the facility against the staff’s medical advice. The resident later told inspectors that because he was so angry about the situation, he signed the paperwork, after which the administrator left the store.
The inspectors allege the resident then drove his motorized wheelchair around town for a few hours, “scared, fearful and upset that he had nowhere to go.” At about 9:30 a.m. he returned to the home and was readmitted at his request.
According to the report of the state inspectors, they asked the administrator of Harmony Marshalltown about the staff’s failure to respond to the resident’s request for a ride. The inspectors allege the administrator responded that “she and the director of nursing were exhausted.” The administrator allegedly told the inspectors something to the effect of, “Excuse me if I went to bed (and) let the police handle the situation.”
The administrator reportedly added that she didn’t hear her phone when a worker called later to report the resident was at his brother’s house in need of a ride.
During her interview with inspectors, the administrator reportedly became “very upset” and, according to the inspectors, said, “Well, the facility didn’t have transportation to bring him back at that time of the morning and what were we supposed to do?”
According to the inspectors’ report, someone with the home’s corporate staff agreed the facility could have handled the incident better and had someone bring the man back to the home when he sought assistance.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing proposed three fines against Harmony Marshalltown totaling $19,000. The fines have been held in suspension while the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines whether a federal fine is warranted.
The administrator of the home, Grace Maitland, was not at Harmony Marshalltown on Friday and could not be reached for comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 11:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Over 100K CT residents could lose Medicaid coverage. What towns may be hit hardest?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/ct-medicaid-loss-town-data/,The One Big Beautiful Bill Act could cause 100K-170K people in CT to lose Medicaid coverage and would hit low-income areas the hardest.,"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act could cause millions of people to lose Medicaid coverage over the coming years — with estimates of between 100,000 and 170,000 people potentially impacted in Connecticut.
The law, passed on July 4, makes several changes to Medicaid and imposes limits on the amount of funding states can collect from the federal government for the program. However, this change would hit low-income areas the hardest.
Hartford is projected to undergo the biggest loss according to data from the Connecticut Data Haven, with 10.6% of the town’s total population projected to lose Medicaid coverage. That means that of the nearly 120,000 Hartford residents, nearly 13,000 stand to lose their coverage in the next decade. More than 90,000 people in Hartford receive health care under Medicaid. 
Waterbury and New Britain residents are also projected to have high levels of health care coverage loss. CT Data Haven found that 102,000 Connecticut residents who live below 200% of the federal poverty line are projected to lose Medicaid coverage. 
While the majority of those that may be impacted are white, a disproportionate percentage of minority communities — 9% of the Latino population and 8% of the Black population — are projected to lose coverage, according to CT Data Haven.
However, Medicaid isn’t the only health care coverage affected. Residents insured under Access Health CT, Connecticut’s official health insurance exchange, may also be impacted. A July press release from the organization stated that between 30% and 35% of its over 150,000 customers could lose coverage in the next decade.
“These changes can be expected to increase costs for customers here in Connecticut, and nationwide, and create barriers to financial help,” James Michel, the chief executive officer of Access Health CT, said in the press release regarding federal policy changes.
Nationwide, Medicaid enrollment is projected to drop according to analysis done by the KFF Health News, a nonprofit U.S. health policy organization.
It’s projected that, in Washington state, over a quarter of the population formerly eligible for Medicaid by 2034 would not receive coverage, while southeastern states would see more limited effects from the big beautiful bill. While Connecticut won’t see the biggest drops out of the entire nation, these changes could still leave thousands of people without insurance.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-111325.png,,,2025-09-05 11:59:47.259514

Sept. 4, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThree groups of activists fighting extremism and local policies that reduce free speech in libraries, schools and other public spaces are looking to grow and organize against future attempts by the far-right to curtail critical thought.
On Thursday evening, a small but mighty cross-section of those groups gathered in Hartland, Michigan to discuss strategy, and to hopefully recruit like-minded people as conservative activists have made strides in their communities to take over local, county, school and library boards — many with the aim of undoing those institutions and suppressing access to information.
The three groups that gathered for the forum, to discuss those advances and how to fight them, included members of Stand Against Extremism of Livingston County, or SAGE, the Lapeer County chapter of Fight 4 the First and Friends of Patmos Library. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Together, the groups recently found themselves in a struggle to protect their local libraries from new efforts to defund the institution and upend staff to change the culture of the libraries In several instances, those libraries and schools have attempted to sequester books some board members have deemed sexually explicit or inappropriate for children. 
Many of the books in the latter instance have faced challenges from conservative groups and were targeted exclusively because they contain LGBTQ+ themes, or deal with other sensitive subjects, like racism or historical injustices.
While their work as individual units have helped prevent those efforts from taking root, or at the very least watered down new policies by bringing awareness to them, Julie Ohashi, cofounder of SAGE LivCo, said Thursday that those efforts have taken a great deal of time and energy to combat.
Simply put, Ohashi told the crowd that the forum was a call to action to bring new members into the fold and to help form a group similar to Fight 4 the First in Livingston County.
Local Michigan library board backs away from policy to sequester LGBTQ+ themed books

“This is how this starts,” Ohashi said. “This is a great start, because you can go home and have conversations with four or five more people, and then the next group comes in, and we’re three-times bigger.”
The panel also talked shop on ways average people could fight against hostile takeovers of small community boards by Christian and far-right activists.
Kate DeRosier, a former member of the Cromaine District Library Board of Trustees, which was at the center of a sequestration and labeling effort earlier this year, said it was important for new activists to understand that what is occurring is not a normal function of a library or school board.
She said that before the board came under the leadership of Bill Bollin, pastor of the FloodGate Church in Brighton, Cromaine officials were never involved with book challenges.
“The board is there for big picture [issues], fiduciary, advocacy, community outreach, planning and long-term views,” DeRosier said. “Its is not to operate on a daily basis. This is a new problem … since the 2022 election. It’s been painful to watch as a former board member but also a library lover. It’s not normal. This is not the correct conduct of a board anywhere.”
One of the first strategy steps discussed at the forum Thursday was to know your rights and never back down to bullies, even if those bullies hold high positions of power.
In that vein, several people who attended the forum, held at the Hartland Music Hall, said they were concerned about eroding free speech rights across the nation. Ohashi said that the first simple act of showing up to public meetings and not backing down has been a measure for some of their success.
It was also suggested that power in numbers was always effective.
One community member from Livingston County noted that the Cromaine District Library Board of Trustees has created a suppressive environment at public meetings.
In June, when the board was deliberating on its new policy to label books as explicit — again, those with LGBTQ+ content and themes — called the sheriff’s office and had activists thrown out for speaking out. One board member and her husband, who is a member of the local school board, physically removed some of them. 
One advantage of joining an established activist group, like SAGE, Ohashi said, was that they were well versed in their rights.
Some panelists suggested making recordings of each meeting or event where activists might find themselves at odds with those they are trying to shine a light on.
Lapeer library board mulls age restrictions on materials despite shaky legal ground 

Building bridges, not walls
Rhonda Laur with Fight 4 the First, said the group led an effort to have Lapeer District Library board member John DeAngelis resign from his position due to his affiliation with the AxMiTax anti-property tax ballot initiative. The initiative, if it makes the ballot and is approved by voters, would eliminate property tax in Michigan — which is a source of funding for some tax-dependent libraries. 
In the case of the Lapeer District Library, property tax is a primary funding source.
While the cascading efforts to remove him or have him resign were ultimately unsuccessful, Laur said the group was able to gather nearly 300 signatures calling for his resignation. They did that by being relentless in their organizing efforts, which included pickets, writing letters to the editors of local newspapers and speaking up at every meeting.
Gigi Griffith, also with Fight 4 the First, added that it was OK to be annoying to those who might not uphold a community’s First Amendment and free speech rights.
Tricia Kryda, with Friends of Patmos Library, said it was important to be hyperaware of the opposition’s talking points and highlight them when they suddenly back away from them once they are elected. She noted that the Patmos Library Board flipped to a conservative majority that primarily ran on the wave issue of parental rights over what their children were reading, learning about or consuming in other media.
Kryda said once they were elected, the ethos changed to a belief that the board had been given a mandate by voters to take care of the issue of those materials themselves, disavowing their initial zeal in letting parents decide what is right for their children.
“You have to kind of hold those people back and say, ‘they did say this,’” Kryda said. “Well look at what they did. Don’t look at what they said, look at what they do. That’s really important, because it’s been a fight to get people to listen to someone [who might be considered more liberal on the issues facing schools and libraries].”
Kryda said you have to slowly peel the situation back to expose hypocrisies in some instances, and that includes slowly bringing your conservative friends back into the fold to help fight against censorship.
Ohashi said that was true in Livingston County, saying there were many anti-censorship conservatives who might be willing to join in the fight.
Griffith noted that it was a matter of letting them in and not alienating them.
“You’ve got to get them in by getting on their level and parents’ rights is a great way to do that,” Griffith said. “This shouldn’t be political.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250904_181721-scaled-e1757069378767-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

While dispensaries in other states are offering steep discounts to try and attract customers, Missouri’s prices have remained steady. 
“Missouri is viewed as a stronger market than others,” said Kris Walker, president and chief commercial officer at Hoodie Analytics, during a panel discussion on retail data analysis. “There are things happening in Missouri that are causing consumers to not just be shopping on price. When you’re only shopping on price, it becomes a race to the bottom.”
Samuel Soong, chief revenue officer at Grön cannabis edible brand, called Missouri customers “very savvy.” 
“They know what they want,” he said. “They’re expecting a lot of value in their purchasing.”
The numbers agree. When the average shopper goes to a Missouri dispensary, they end up spending about $65, with the average price per item being $24.60, according to data compiled by Hoodie. That’s above the national average of $61 and $18.41. 
In Colorado and New Mexico, the average item price is about $11. 
The most popular item in Missouri is still traditional marijuana buds, or what the industry simply calls “flower.” However, the item that’s seen the most growth in the last year — both in Missouri and nationwide — is pre-rolled joints. 
A year ago, 48% of every transaction included flower, and today it’s 43%. Walker said that’s largely due to customers buying more pre-rolled joints, which are often infused with concentrated cannabis oil. They’re designed for people who want a more potent and longer-lasting high than what traditional flower offers. 
“It’s a convenient form factor,” said Krista Raymer, chief strategy officer at C3 Industries that operates High Profile cannabis dispensaries. “It’s great for the customer.”
Raymer said in some other states, the growth of pre-rolled joints has brought challenges because it meant that customers are spending less.
“Fundamentally, they are purchasing less brands per transaction,” she said. “Missouri pre-roll prices are holding a little bit differently than maybe what we’ve seen in other markets, but it is something that we pay attention to, a lot.”
Throughout the country, Missouri is still considered a “shining star,” Walker said. 
John Mueller, co-founder and CEO at Greenlight, believes the regulatory environment is a big part of the state’s success, particularly because the industry was able to write its own laws.
“If you can write your own rules and ballot initiative and it’s in the constitution, that’s like your best line of defense,” Mueller said. 
Every year, industry lobbyists work to kill any legislation that attempts to “control our business,” he said. 
“Just let us do business, stay out of our way, we keep paying the veterans, everything’s good here,” Mueller said. “I go around talking in the other states we operate, I think we’ve set a gold standard here.”
He also points to the limited number of licenses. 
“Limited licenses is the whole key to any market,” he said. “We won’t go into a market unless there’s a set number.” 
Walker said that Missouri also has “disciplined operators.” 
“If you’ve got a discipline operator who knows they’re running a business for profit and growth and long-term brand building, you make different decisions than, ‘Oh my God, the guy across the street just dropped his price by 30%. I should do it too,’” he said. “That is an undisciplined choice that unfortunately has very significant consequences.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MJ-Unpacked-sales-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

(Map from READI website)A state-commissioned report endorses the state’s regional economic development approach, aligning with districts established under former Gov. Eric Holcomb. 
The Regional Economic and Acceleration and Development Initiative, or READI, allocates federal and state dollars to boost public-private projects seeking to improve Hoosiers’ quality of life. Some projects focused on housing or transportation while others funded parks or community centers.
Earlier this year, Gov. Mike Braun issued an executive order ordering an assessment of economic development regions in the state by the year’s end — and researchers with the Indiana University Kelley School of Business submitted their report on Aug. 15. Braun publicized the 12-page document on Thursday.

“This report proves what we’ve seen on the ground: Indiana’s regions are strong, well-defined, and ready to lead. The 15 READI regions were built by local leaders, tested through real collaboration, and now validated by independent research. By aligning the state around this framework, we remove confusion, cut costs, and give Hoosiers one clear plan forward,” Braun said in a release.
Though not the state’s first stab at a regional economic development approach, READI first launched in 2021 with $500 million. That round was so popular — the overseeing Indiana Economic Development Corporations had to process $1.5 billion in requests across 800 projects — that lawmakers approved another $500 million in 2023. 
The first-round awards were dispersed slowly, mostly due to requirements tied to the federal dollars. But the second round of state dollars moved more quickly. During a tight budget session, legislators declined to include a third round of funding in the 2025 budget. 
The first round involved 17 districts. For the second READI round, local units of government organized into 15 regions, the base of the IU analysis. Researchers Phil Powell and Tim Slaper, with the Indiana Business Research Center found that, “READI regions provide a socially efficient and empirically sound foundation for regional policy, satisfying the goals of (Braun’s) executive order.” 
“They capture economic activity nearly as effectively as state-drawn regions, but with the added advantage of trust and collaboration already built among local leaders. That gives Indiana a durable framework to deliver economic and workforce development,” said Powell, the executive director of the Indiana Business Research Center, in the release.
Indiana Secretary of Commerce David Adams likewise praised the paper and its conclusion.
“This report confirms that Indiana’s regional approach is working. With READI regions now validated as the economic planning framework, we can focus on strategy — empowering regions to grow population, wages, and opportunity with one clear map,” he said.
Different types of county groupings considered by IU researchers include READI regions, Economic Growth Regions and Metropolitan Statistical Areas. (Maps from READI, the Indiana Department of Workforce Development and the Census Bureau)

Other agencies use different boundaries for their various missions, including within the IEDC. As such, the study explored whether the regional economic development approach under READI could be translated into other workforce and economic development activities.

The current 12 Economic Growth Regions used by some agencies were organized under former Gov. Mitch Daniels without the same input from local governments. Powell and Slaper compared the READI districts with those regions as well as Metropolitan Statistical Areas used by the federal government. 
Notably the Metropolitan Statistical Areas are grouped across state boundaries, meaning that portions of Indiana belong to regions centered around Chicago, Louisville and Cincinnati.
Intergovernmental cooperation makes READI regions “a socially efficient choice,” research concluded, though that is weakest in southern Indiana. The nine-county Economic Growth Region containing Evansville, for example, is split between three different READI regions with roughly five noncontiguous counties lumped into one region. The paper cautions that special consideration should be given to this southwestern corner of the state when granting project dollars to ensure cohesiveness. 
However, the three different groupings of counties are relatively comparable, with all having overall tightness scores between 0.868 and 0.891 on a 0-1 scale.

After floods threatened his soybeans and corn, Gerard switched to planting rice. (Julia Rendleman for ProPublica)
One Illinois man’s decadeslong fight to convert his fields into rice paddies demonstrates how it’s possible to bring diversity to the Corn Belt, but improbable so long as federal farm policy remains focused on soybeans and corn.

This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Capitol News Illinois. A portion of the reporting in Alexander County is supported by funding from the Pulitzer Center. Sign up for Dispatches to get our stories in your inbox every week.
On a late July morning, Blake Gerard zips across his Southern Illinois rice farm on a four-wheeler, wearing his usual USA Rice shirt and shorts that hit above the knee. It’s the only rice farm in Illinois, a place where rice never grew before.
He carries rubber hip boots in his truck for when he needs to wade into the water to check or change its depth. The young rice has entered a crucial stage; it has taken root but is still tender and needs a shallow, steady blanket of water, which Gerard maintains with a system of cascading fields surrounded by levees and pumps. Two to 4 inches of water is ideal.

Second image: Young rice requires between 2 and 4 inches of water to grow. Third image: Gerard holds soil from the thick, muddy ground that he calls “gumbo.” (First and second images: Julia Rendleman for ProPublica. Third image: Lylee Gibbs/Saluki Local Reporting Lab for ProPublica.)

For the parts of the fields he can’t reach in his truck, a drone does the seeing. This morning, it catches a patch where the water pools too deep, and he turns on a pump, moving water into a drainage ditch that flows into the nearby Mississippi River. “That whole corner would’ve gone under if I hadn’t seen it,” Gerard says.
This daily scramble across 2,500 acres of flat, muddy bottomlands is now routine for one of America’s northernmost commercial rice farmers. But it wasn’t always. Gerard’s story is both proof that change and innovation in farming are possible and evidence of how hard they are — and why so few have tried. The transition took decades. It was also expensive and largely unsupported by federal farm policy, which is heavily focused on corn and soybeans.
Corn, soy and wheat were the crops Gerard, now 55, was growing in the early 1990s when he took over his family farm near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. By then, the floods were already coming more often. Gerard’s grandfather remembered them in 1943 and 1973, but as Gerard began farming, they came every two years — in ’93, ’95 and ’97.


Gerard plants rice near the Mississippi River in spring 2024. The land is prone to flooding, which Gerard uses to his advantage to grow rice. He refers to rain as “free water.” (Julia Rendleman for ProPublica)

According to the latest National Climate Assessment, annual precipitation in the Midwest increased in some places by as much as 15% between 1992 and 2001. Importantly for farmers, the amount of precipitation on the days with the most rain has increased by 45% over the past 50 years.
“The most extreme heavy precipitation is increasing at a far faster rate than overall total seasonal or annual precipitation,” explained Trent Ford, the Illinois state climatologist. That increased intensity “has been a faster and larger change, and that has caused more impacts due to flooding and erosion.”
For Gerard, a fourth-generation crop farmer, only in his 20s, working the fields of the Mississippi River bottomlands in Alexander County, Illinois, there was no sense in fighting the water anymore.
“I could grow something that would grow in water,” he said. Or quit.
Climate change is shifting where rice can grow. Long considered a southern crop, it has crept north through the Missouri Bootheel, and with Gerard’s expanded operation, now has a foothold in Southern Illinois. It’s a crop that can thrive where others can’t, like along the riverbanks of flood-prone Alexander County.
But for many farmers, making the transition to a new crop is nearly impossible, as ProPublica and Capitol News Illinois reported this week. Although rice is a commodity crop and Gerard receives insurance subsidies and commodity supports, corn and soybeans dominate U.S. agriculture, especially in the Midwest, and that’s what federal subsidies are set up to support.
Federally backed insurance for those crops cushions the risk of climate change for growers, even in floodplains; ethanol policy props up demand; and the entire infrastructure — from grain bins to rail lines to river barges — helps move corn and soy from fields to market to overseas. Illinois is the second-largest corn exporter in the nation.
There’s also culture: Farmers tend to grow what their parents and grandparents did. Even the local experts — the folks at the nearby Farm Bureau offices and university extension programs — are largely trained in what’s always been done.
“Everything’s stacked against it,” said Jonathan Coppess, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture official and current farm policy expert at the University of Illinois. “Nobody says no, but the system doesn’t know how to say yes.”
And federal policy is moving deeper in that direction. President Donald Trump has scrubbed climate language from farm programs. Although the “Big, Beautiful Bill” signed in July provides additional funding for programs that could help with crop diversification, it largely reinforces the idea that crops should stay where they’ve always been.
ProPublica and Capitol News Illinois sought comment from the USDA on Aug. 20 about how it is responding to climate change and crop diversification. An agency spokesperson said the USDA was working on a response but did not provide it in time for publication or specify a day when it would respond.
This stretch of the country where Gerard did the seemingly impossible is an important testing ground. But it wasn’t easy. There were no mills to process what he grew, no market to sell it into, no roadmap to follow. Ultimately, it took 25 years and millions of dollars to make it work. Gerard shows what is possible, but also how improbable it is for the Corn Belt to diversify without the sustained effort of federal policy.

In 1943, when the Mississippi tore away from its banks and charted a fierce and muddy course across America’s central farmlands, Gerard’s grandfather, Harold Gerard, had already fled the waters once.
He had been living on a tiny island in the middle of the river just north of Cairo, Illinois. Seeking dry land that would be amenable to the wheat, alfalfa, corn and cotton he was accustomed to growing, he moved his family about 30 miles north.
But even there, the water kept rising. Blake’s father took over the farm and put in a pump on his lowest field to take water away from the corn, but the water kept coming up.
“The water comes from under the ground here,” Blake Gerard said.
He was studying at Mississippi State when his father died in August 1990. Overwhelmed, he left school, came home and harvested the final crop his father had planted. But with floods coming more frequently, he worried that the government would get out of the crop insurance business, which helped keep him afloat. He briefly considered fish farming but worried about floods there too. Ultimately, Gerard realized he needed a crop that loved the thick, muddy ground he calls “gumbo.”

Around that time, farm policy was changing: In 1996, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act — known as the “Freedom to Farm Act” — gave farmers flexibility in crop choice.
He looked south, to Arkansas and Missouri, for guidance, driving around, knocking on doors and asking farmers about a crop that wasn’t afraid of the water.
At one farm in the Missouri Bootheel, an older man listened to Gerard’s questions for an hour, then said, “You know what? I met your dad. You’re a lot like your dad. He came down here in the ’70s asking me the same questions.”
Gerard hadn’t known about his father’s early interest. But it led them both to the same place, where he found his answer: “I’ve got rice ground.”
In 1999, Gerard planted his first 40 acres of rice. The next season, he tripled his acreage. After that, Gerard started converting his fields “like crazy.” There were no government programs to help pay for the transition, and it was expensive.
The big effort was grading the land: flattening it and building embankments so water would cascade from one field into the next. At $1,000 per acre, Gerard would invest millions into turning his ground from soy to rice.
Gerard realizes the investment was one he could only have made when he was still young and unafraid of debt. “I had time to get it all paid for, but if you’re my age now, mid-50s, why do I want to borrow a quarter of a million dollars to do this and make all these changes and create more work for myself? It’s more work. Rice farming is way more work. Double, triple the work that corn and beans are.”
Gerard also had to invest heavily in farm equipment. He rattles off a list: power units, fuel tanks, turbines, pipes, the water control structures, and on and on. Gerard scratches his head when asked about his total investment — it’s too much to remember and too hard to keep track of, he said. What he knew for certain was that he was going to commit to rice.

This year, Gerard’s farm finally got some help: a Climate-Smart Commodities grant that would allow him to invest in things like soil moisture meters, pump automation and water monitors. Then in April, he received more news: The funding, considered a “climate” program, had been canceled by the Trump administration. Then in May, he was told the funding was back — under a different name.
But around the state, conditions for farming this year have continued to deteriorate. In May, the National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning for the first time ever for the city of Chicago. High winds brought loose topsoil across the state and into the city, limiting visibility and shocking meteorologists who had not documented a weather event of this kind in the city since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.
Researchers believe that the corn and soybean rotation that dominates Midwestern farming is at least partially to blame — replacing the grasses that gave the Prairie State its nickname with crop rotations that don’t hold the soil in place, and a steady stream of fertilizers and pesticides doesn’t help.
The dominance of soy and corn, with little variation, could have “possible long-term impacts” on “economic returns, communities, and the environment,” according to the website for Diverse Corn Belt, a USDA-funded project of researchers and scientists who collaborate with government agencies, farmers and conservation groups. They want to find ways to give farmers more crop options.
That’s especially pressing in places like Alexander County, a corner of the country that bridges different farming regions. “It’s one of the most difficult places to understand in U.S. agriculture,” said Silvia Secchi, a professor at the University of Iowa, who studies farm policy and is an investigator with Diverse Corn Belt. “But the system isn’t built for a place like this. The system is built for: you’re in Nebraska, you raise cattle; you’re in Iowa, you grow corn. All these places that are kind of funky at the margin — we don’t make policy for them.”
Diversifying crop rotations would help in the Midwest, but also in places with other climate-related woes, like increasingly dry Texas and storm-wracked Louisiana. Making such changes is not impossible, said Louisiana State University researcher Herry Utomo, who developed the rice strain grown by Gerard. Climate change is “coming anyway, so we have to be positive and respond to it appropriately,” he said. “With good planning, anticipation and understanding of the rate of change, we can respond.”

But Coppess, a former USDA official, said farm policy has never been great at planning for climate change.
“There’s nothing in farm policy that takes into account climate change. In fact, most arguments would be that it’s at best neutral and at worst counterproductive for climate change,” Coppess said.
And under Trump, research universities are losing funding and climate initiatives are being decimated.
For Gerard, his willingness to risk everything paid off. He had a banner year in 2024 — his most successful rice-farming year to date. He no longer wonders whether the “big river” or a deluge will take out his crop. While a range of factors — from weather to international markets — affect whether he makes money, his shift to rice has taken production volatility out of the equation and he rests easier.

He remembers one of his first harvests, late in the growing season, when the mature stalks of rice had begun to bend toward the ground under the weight of their own grain.
One farmer, he recalled, pulled over and laughed at the drooping stalks. To him, the field looked ruined — nothing like the stiff, proud stalks of wheat growing nearby.
“People said you can’t grow rice here,” Gerard said. “I had the crop growing in the field and they’re like, ‘You can’t grow rice, we’re in Illinois, they grow rice in Louisiana.’”
That was a quarter-century ago.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers entered the 2023 legislative session with a majority in both chambers and a pair of gun control bills high on their list of priorities: universal background checks for firearm purchases and a “red flag” law, which allows judges to confiscate guns from people who are a danger to themselves or others.
They succeeded in passing both priorities, plus a few other gun control policies, all without Republican support.
Democrats stopped short of banning semiautomatic military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, like those used by the shooter who fired more than 100 rounds into Annunciation Church in Minneapolis last week, killing two students and injuring 21 others. 
Following that shooting, Gov. Tim Walz said he will call lawmakers back to the Capitol early to consider those bans and potentially other gun control legislation. 
These firearms were banned federally from 1994 to 2004, but states have since been left to their own devices to figure out their own legislation on assault weapons and 10 have done so. There is some evidence that banning high-capacity magazines and assault weapons reduces deaths in mass shootings.
(Gun rights advocates criticize the term “assault weapons,” arguing that the definition is largely based on aesthetics rather than function; Minnesota law defines 17 firearm models and their offshoots as “semiautomatic military-style assault weapons,” including AK-47s and AR-15s.)
But the odds of gun control legislation passing are worse now that Democrats have lost control of the House and Senate, pending special elections. Republicans have 67 members in the House, while Democrats have 66 following the June assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman. Any gun control legislation would need bipartisan support in a special session to pass.
“I’m going to need some Republicans to break with the orthodoxy and say that we need to do something on guns,” Walz said at a news conference this week. 
Gov. Tim Walz, on Sept. 2, 2025, said he will call a special session for lawmakers to vote on gun control measures after two children were killed and another 21 wounded at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis last week. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)
So why didn’t Democrats ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines when they controlled the Legislature? 
In 2023, Democratic lawmakers had bills to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines as well as new requirements that guns be stored safely and reported lost or stolen in a timely manner. 
Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, introduced an assault weapons ban in 2023 but DFL leaders didn’t forward the legislation for a hearing. He said Democrats for a long time have been scared to talk about gun control and are worried about their reelection prospects if they take a stand on stricter gun measures.
“Democratic politicians are still in the old mindset that it could hurt them to talk about gun violence. I happen to believe that regardless of public opinion, the public respects people who are willing to talk about the tough issues,” Marty said.
Similarly, in the House, DFL Floor Leader Jamie Long of Minneapolis said in a press conference after the shooting that he had drafted a bill banning semiautomatic military-style assault weapons in 2023, but never introduced it.
“(It) felt like the right decision to try to focus on taking that really big, important first step on gun violence, and I think we’re ready to take even bigger steps now,” Long said.
Those bills were unlikely to pass, even had they received hearings.
At least three Democratic senators — Grant Hauschild of Hermantown, Rob Kupec of Moorhead and Judy Seeberger of Afton  — said they wouldn’t support any gun control measures other than the red flag law and universal background checks.

Last year, the House passed legislation requiring safe storage and the reporting of lost or stolen guns. The bills never came up for a vote in the Senate.
The three senators have remained quiet on the issue of gun control since the school shooting. 
Hauschild and Seeberger did not return the Reformer’s calls for this story. Kupec declined an interview. 
In an unrelated press conference Thursday, Seeberger was asked whether she would support an assault weapons ban, and she said she’s reviewing proposals.
“We need to get together and figure out what we can pass. We can’t do anything without each other, and so it’s going to be important for all of us to speak,” Seeberger said. 
The resistance from Hauschild and Kupec, among just a handful of Democrats representing greater Minnesota, reflects a rural-urban divide over guns. 
A 2022 MinnPost poll found that a slight majority of Minnesotans — 54% — supported banning “assault-style weapons.” The topline number belies an urban-rural divide; 51% of rural Minnesotans opposed an assault weapons ban, while 69% of urban residents supported a ban. The same poll found that a slight majority of rural Minnesotans also oppose bans on high-capacity magazines.
Walz has noted the public broadly supports assault weapons bans and suggested Republicans would risk public backlash by voting against the proposals in a special session. But a special session would force difficult votes for members of his own party, too.
“Some of these votes are not easy for members, and members can only make so many difficult votes at a time,” said Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, who chairs the public safety committee. “These are close bills. So we got done the two biggest, most far reaching and impactful ones that we thought we could accomplish, and let the other one sit for another day.”
Republicans remain uninterested in new gun laws with Senate Republican Leader Mark Johnson calling a potential special session a “partisan stunt.” 
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, was evasive when asked if her caucus would support an assault weapons ban or any other gun control proposal: “I can’t really say whether or not we would be for or against something without seeing what the proposal is.” 
Her caucus released a “school safety agenda” on Thursday in response to the Annunciation shooting that didn’t include any proposals on gun control. Instead, they called for increased funding for school safety at private schools, boosting funding for more mental health treatment beds and increasing penalties for repeat firearm offenders. Their agenda also includes reversing a conversion therapy ban for minors.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250903_0073-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

Yet, their proposed map seeks to flip the seat of U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a longtime Democratic congressman who is also a United Methodist minister.
In announcing a special legislative session to redraw congressional lines, Gov. Mike Kehoe insisted the change would represent Missouri’s “common sense values, rooted in faith, family, and freedom.” Similarly, Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin claimed Kehoe “wants to be sure Missouri’s representation matches Missouri’s Christian conservative majority.”
Somehow, the plan allegedly rooted in faith values to represent Christians means driving out of office one of only three ministers in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a Baptist minister in Missouri who would be thrown from the third district to the fifth district that is currently Cleaver’s seat, I reject efforts to bless this profane partisan power grab as based on Christian values.
During the redistricting process over three years ago — at the constitutionally prescribed time — some conservative politicians and activists unsuccessfully targeted Cleaver’s seat. Ultimately, state lawmakers approved a map keeping a 6-2 Republican advantage in Missouri’s congressional delegation instead of carving up Kansas City to try for a 7-1 map now under consideration.
Of course, a 5-3 split would more closely match statewide elections. That divide still gives Republicans a bit more than the 2024 results when Trump defeated Kamala Harris 58%-40% and Kehoe beat Crystal Quade 59%-39%. So the current map is gerrymandered, just not as badly as Trump wants.
Even if we accept O’Laughlin’s claim of needing a map to represent “Missouri’s Christian conservative majority,” that would not justify a 7-1 map. Only 62% of Missourians identify as Christian — the same percentage as five seats out of eight. Even that gives her argument too much credit since not all of Missouri’s Christians are conservatives, as Cleaver proves.
For those who desired a 7-1 split three years ago, the partisan goal of rigging the maps was often cast as a Christian mission. As I documented in my new book, The Bible According to Christian Nationalists, proponents of a 7-1 map in 2022 misused Scripture to justify trying to oust a Methodist politician. They twisted Bible verses out of context to depict themselves as divinely chosen heroes on a righteous crusade to save the nation.
Yet, as they gerrymandered the Bible to defend their partisanship, they overlooked basic moral teachings like treat others how you want them to treat you, do not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself. Kehoe and O’Laughlin make the same mistake now. They wish to claim the mantle of upholding Christian values all while violating how Jesus clearly taught his followers to behave.
Although Kehoe and O’Laughlin spin their motives, Cleaver noted more honestly what this “unprecedented” attempt will do. Calling it a move to “silence voices,” Cleaver insisted voters should pick their representatives, not the other way around. He added: “Our nation has endured wars, depressions, and great struggles for civil rights. And through it all, the principle that every vote counts has carried us forward. That principle is bigger than me, this seat, or any president looking to rig the rules for personal gain.”
If Kehoe and O’Laughlin were honest, they would admit the inspiration for this partisan gerrymandering came not from Christian values but Trump. While they appear to hold enough political power to ram the new map through, they do not own the terms “faith” and “Christian.” I will not sit by quietly as they seek to rig morality.
As the biblical prophet Isaiah insisted, we must not call bitter “sweet” or call evil “good.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022724_cleaverfiling1-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

(Photo by Tom Banse)A billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded enterprise to kickstart a clean hydrogen industry in the Pacific Northwest took another hit due to energy companies getting cold feet. 
Portland General Electric and its partner Mitsubishi Power have quietly shelved a planned hydrogen production, storage and hydrogen-fueled generation complex near Boardman, Oregon. 
“Given the exit of an essential project partner in June, along with challenging project economics for utility customers and federal policy changes, PGE is no longer pursuing” the hydrogen complex, PGE spokesman Drew Hanson said via email. 
The cancellation comes at a dicey time for the tri-state Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, the ringleader that is channeling federal money to projects in the region. The U.S. Energy Department is scrutinizing clean energy programs and initiatives launched under the Biden administration, including the Northwest hub. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he is ready to terminate funding for projects that he deems “a bridge to nowhere.”
Elected officials from across the political spectrum in the Northwest have defended low-emissions hydrogen as a promising means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power. 
“We have several new projects in the pipeline that we’re excited to share more on soon,” spokesperson Kaitlin Sheppherd said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Northwest hydrogen hub. “PNWH2 continues to evaluate additional project interest and remains focused on supporting a broad, resilient regional hydrogen ecosystem with the potential to deliver lasting economic value to Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest.”
The PGE and Mitsubishi Power pullback follows in the wake of the scrapping of a different hydrogen factory in Centralia, Washington, proposed by Fortescue, which was to be one of the primary producers of the alternative fuel within the regional clean energy hub. Another founding partner in the PNWH2 Hub, Seattle-based developer of hydrogen-powered mining trucks First Mode, declared bankruptcy last December.
PGE’s pivot calls into question what will happen at the nearby Port of Morrow, where Air Liquide planned to build a hydrogen liquefaction plant to support distribution of clean hydrogen to urban fueling stations and the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. PGE and Mitsubishi were supposed to supply the gaseous hydrogen to Air Liquide via a short pipeline from the site of PGE’s demolished coal power plant outside Boardman.
Air Liquide acknowledged a request for comment, but a spokesperson declined to shed more light about where things are headed now.
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub said in its emailed statement that “project adjustments were expected and planned for” in the early development phase of the nascent industry. The pullback in this region tracks with what is happening elsewhere. 
Brand name corporations — such as Shell, BP and Airbus — and lesser-known startups around the world are scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. Commonly cited reasons include a slower-than-anticipated emergence of customer demand and stubbornly high costs to produce green hydrogen.
The developers behind the two remaining large-scale projects in the Northwest hydrogen hub are pressing ahead. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro plans to build a $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, for which hydrogen produced on site will be a key ingredient. Meanwhile, Calgary-based AltaGas has a costly plan to redevelop the closed Alcoa aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.
Crucially, Atlas Agro and AltaGas need to secure large volumes of affordable renewable electricity for the energy-intensive process of making hydrogen. The green fertilizer plant reportedly needs around 300 megawatts of power, which is a bigger load than all of the rest of Richland combined.
AltaGas estimated last year that it needs about 265 megawatts of electricity to achieve its maximum production target at Ferndale. Neither company has confirmed they have a power supply contract amid rising competition for sources of renewable electricity.
“The success of this project is contingent on regulatory and financial incentive certainty, timely approvals, and a clear and predictable path forward from government and commercial partners,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement. 
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub game plan envisions that producers will make “green” hydrogen exclusively by splitting water molecules with an electric current. This process (known as electrolysis) must use renewable electricity for the resulting hydrogen to be considered green.

Hydrogen sector dependent on uncertain government support
A year ago, the Pacific NW hub collected the first installment from its potentially $1 billion federal allocation. That $27.5 million in initial funding through the Energy Department partially passed through to participating companies and to Washington State University to begin site planning and community outreach. 
Under the original program terms, another tranche of funding would come 12-18 months after the first to subsidize developer permitting and engineering. A third tranche could underwrite the construction phase for multiple years, before a possible final shot of money comes to subsidize production ramp up. In all, the hub could pass through federal subsidies to its participants for 8-12 years. 
But this past May, Wright, President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, announced a department-wide review of grant programs to root out “wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.” Wright expressed skepticism about government support to scale up clean hydrogen. 
“Hydrogen, it’s tough with the math to see how in the long term it becomes a meaningful commercial energy source,” Wright told senators at a budget hearing in front of the Senate Energy Committee in June, during which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, pressed him to state his position on the hydrogen hubs.
“It’s expensive to produce, but there are high value uses,” Wright went on to say about hydrogen. He predicted the agency will continue funding some projects under review, modify others and terminate the “low-value” ones.
Cantwell responded that the Northwest’s renewable hydropower made her region a good place to make hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize sectors.
A spokesperson at Energy Department headquarters confirmed this past week that the program vetting was ongoing, but declined to estimate when the results will become known.
Democrats in the U.S. Senate preemptively wrote a joint letter to Wright in April asserting it would be illegal for the Trump administration to unilaterally cancel Congressionally-approved spending on clean energy projects. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Washington’s Patty Murray and Cantwell signed on.
“Our Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and exclusive power to appropriate funds,” the 27 senators wrote. “In this instance, where Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for programs that support clean energy projects, the Department must faithfully execute the law and expend the funds for the purposes provided.”
If the PNWH2 Hub survives the Energy Department vetting, the pressure will still be on. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress shortened the window for companies to get lucrative tax incentives that were created in the 2022 Biden climate and clean energy package.
Private developers now have until the end of 2027 to begin construction on a hydrogen plant in order to qualify for production tax credits. The deadline was previously 2033. Clean hydrogen producers strive to qualify for the tax credit in order to lower the otherwise high retail price of the fuel.
“Under current federal and state permitting regimes, this accelerated timeline may jeopardize our eligibility for the tax credit, which is essential for achieving positive project returns, and we are evaluating our ability to meet the new timelines,” said Doyle from AltaGas.

In her new role, Jenner will continue to lead the state's K-12 education department, as well. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)If there is anyone who deserves a raise in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration, it’s Secretary of Education Katie Jenner. Especially now that she will essentially be doing two full-time jobs.
Jenner recently was named the new commissioner for higher education on top of the state’s highest K-12 official.
She replaces Chris Lowery, whose resignation takes effect next month. His salary was $237,000, and Jenner’s is $275,000. And she isn’t getting any more to double her workload.
Of course, there is more to this move than just dollars.
Chairman of the higher ed board, Dan Peterson, praised the move — saying it “helps bring the education vertical as close together as possible, makes a ton of sense. He also added that “when you’re a great leader, you get more and more responsibility.”
On one hand, I understand that K-12 and higher education are related and should have seamless coordination. But how much can one person handle without a change in performance?
And I would argue that both the higher education and K-12 systems need someone fully watching their back. They are related but have distinct charges and goals.
K-12 certainly has a role to play in ensuring Indiana’s future workforce is prepared to fill open jobs. But it shouldn’t eclipse the more important foundation of reading and math skills, as well as offering well-rounded opportunities for all students.
Indiana’s college-going rate drops again, dipping to 51.7%

Accountability, absenteeism and graduation rates are among the most important items handled by the Indiana Department of Education. We have finally started to see metrics moving in the right direction for Indiana’s students, and part of that is due to Jenner’s focus on those items. She is also a master at staying out of the political fights and keeping her eyes on students.
Meanwhile, the Commission for Higher Education has seen its plate of duties grow in recent years as legislators have added more authority and tasks. For instance, they now handle intellectual diversity complaints; they spearheaded a recent reduction in degree offerings; and now have to annually prepare and submit reports that examine the utilization of physical facilities for instruction at each state educational institution.
On top of that, the agency reviews operating and capital budget requests of the state’s universities and colleges; administers $400 million annually in student financial aid; monitors tuition; and advances career and technical education.
The most significant goal of the agency is improving Indiana’s college-going rate as more jobs require some sort of postsecondary training or education. But that statistic has been hard to move.
What’s next for CHE and DOE? They both have separate boards, unless the next step is to combine them.
The Braun administration already eliminated the Governor’s Workforce Cabinet. It was established in 2005 to “ensure a talent-driven education and workforce system by addressing current and future needs for Indiana employers and individuals, strengthen Indiana’s economy by integrating state and federal resources, and provide strategic alignment for state agencies and organizations driving workforce, education and economic development.”
It was abolished as of July 1, and duties were transferred to the Department of Workforce Development — another agency seeing funding cuts and layoffs.
The state budget said responsibilities of the cabinet related to education were shifted to CHE.
Jenner’s new appointment might be a brilliant move. But in the short-term, it’s another example of the “do more with less” mantra that could have long-term costs.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-09-05 10:56:22+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,NJ abandons $100M hike in state workers’ health care plan under new deal,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/05/nj-abandons-100m-hike-in-state-workers-health-care-plan-under-new-deal/,State and labor officials say a new deal repeals a $100M cut in the State Health Benefits Plan that would have spiked costs for state workers.,"Hundreds of union workers rallied outside the Statehouse in Trenton on Sept. 13, 2022, to protest healthcare premium increases. The State Health Benefits Commission approved the increases on Sept. 14, 2022, despite the protest. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State and labor officials have reached an agreement to cut costs for New Jersey’s distressed state worker health plan after months of protests and negotiations, officials announced Thursday.
The deal would reverse a $100 million cut state lawmakers signed off on when they passed a new $58.8 billion state budget in June, which would have been borne by state employees covered by the State Health Benefits Program.
While workers still will see their out-of-pocket costs rise, those increases will be “modest,” and the agreement bars any increases in member contributions next year, according to Communications Workers of America District 1, which represents more than 140,000 state workers.
It also requires reforms intended to identify the root causes of runaway medical costs and contain costs going forward, and urges state legislators to ensure future budgets respect existing health care agreements, union officials said.
Gov. Phil Murphy in a statement characterized the deal as one that would implement one of the most significant updates to state health benefits plans in nearly 15 years. The changes must be approved by a state committee, which is expected to review the agreement later this month.
“I am committed to working with the unions until the end of my Administration to provide solid recommendations to future State leaders on how the State can adopt best practices and get the best deals in the health care market on medical care and drug pricing,” said Murphy, a Democrat whose two terms as governor are ending in January.
Billy Gallagher, the union’s assistant to the vice president, called the agreement “a hard-won victory for the 100,000 state workers and retirees who were facing catastrophic health care cost hikes.”
“It proves that when we sit down at the table through the proper channels, we can find solutions that protect working families and control costs for the state,” Gallagher said in a statement.
According to Murphy’s office, the agreement includes some of the following changes:

A $110 in-network deductible for individuals and $220 in-network deductible for families for all plans that currently have lower deductibles.
A $750 out-of-network deductible for individuals and $1,500 out-of-network deductible for families for all plans that currently have lower deductibles.
A $2,500 out-of-network, out-of-pocket maximum for individuals and $6,000 out-of-network, out-of-pocket maximum for families for all plans that currently have lower out-of-network, out-of-pocket maximums.
New co-pays on anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, plus generic, brand, nonpreferred brand, and specialty medications across all plans.
New co-pays on lab visits and imaging across all plans.
Limits on out-of-network physical therapy visits across all plans.

Under the deal, the state and union officials will create a working group to draft a roadmap for the next administration that will recommend ways to stem soaring health care costs, including by reducing provider prices. Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill are vying in November to succeed Murphy.
Officials also will examine overpayments to providers and work to recoup those funds, promote in-network providers over costly out-of-network options, and steer employees to ambulatory surgery centers instead of hospitals for common procedures like colonoscopies and lumpectomies, the union said.
They’ll also implement a reverse auction, or online bidding process, to cut pharmaceutical costs and incentivize healthy lifestyles to manage costs associated with employees on pricy weight-loss medications, officials said.
“This deal not only rescinds a dangerous precedent of bypassing our contracts but also establishes a collaborative path forward to tackle the root causes of rising health care costs,” Gallagher said. “It is a powerful testament to what we can achieve through collective bargaining and good-faith dialogue, and it ensures our members’ voices are heard in shaping the future of their healthcare.”
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) in a statement said he is pleased by the agreement.
“We have always believed that the best way to make public health benefits affordable for taxpayers and public employees is by working collaboratively with workers and their unions,” he said. “We look forward to reviewing the agreement and continuing our efforts to protect taxpayers from rising costs while providing affordable health care options to public workers.”
While union leaders and Democrats celebrated, the New Jersey Legislature’s Republican leader and budget officer lamented the news, saying the deal just defers problems with the health benefits program to a later date.
“It’s clear the Democrats’ health insurance plan means increased property taxes and big premium increases for public employees,” Sens. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) and Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) said in a joint statement. “Meanwhile, the local benefits death spiral is being left to the next governor to fix.”
The Treasury said in a May report that the side of the State Health Benefits Program that covers local government workers has become “structurally unstable” and “financially unsustainable” after years of sharp premium increases and a dwindling subscriber pool.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-09-05 10:35:55+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,"State, school district defend NJ guidance on transgender students from court challenge",Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/09/05/state-school-district-defend-nj-guidance-on-transgender-students-from-court-challenge/,A Hunterdon County dad sued the state in an effort to overturn 2018 state guidance on transgender students.,"Attorneys for the state and a Hunterdon County school district are hitting back at a parent's lawsuit challenging statewide guidance on transgender students. (Photo by Alexander Castro)Parents’ constitutional right to raise their children how they want does not give them authority over school policy, attorneys for the state and a Hunterdon County school district argue in new court filings defending state guidance on transgender students.
The filings are the latest development in an escalating legal battle that started in January 2024 when Christin Heaps of Pittstown sued his daughter’s school, the Delaware Valley Regional High School in Frenchtown, after he learned school officials agreed to the child’s request to use a male name and pronouns without telling him.
Heaps wants a judge to strike down Policy 5756, the guidance state education officials issued in 2018 that advises districts they can accept a student’s change in gender identity without notifying parents. A federal judge has twice ruled against Heaps. He’s now appealing his case to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals with the help of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group.
Attorneys Roshan D. Shah and Ashu Verma represent the district and school board. In a Tuesday brief, they agree that the right of parents in the care and custody of their children is one of the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests encompassed by the Constitution’s due process clause.
“However, the historical analysis of how far this right extends does not support the broad power that Heaps believes he wields — i.e., the power to dictate the school environment and the policies governing it,” they added.
Neither the Constitution nor court precedents give parents the right to “notice and veto power over a high-school-aged student’s preferred pronouns or name,” they wrote. Heaps ignores that parental rights must be balanced with a child’s right to privacy, they added.
“Heaps’s position leaves no space for this balancing. He ignores that the desire to maintain confidentiality originated with Jane,” they wrote of Heaps’ daughter, who’s identified as Jane Doe in filings. “His argument effectively demands that school officials ignore the student’s request in all instances no matter the consequences. The Constitution doesn’t impose such a Hobson’s choice upon school officials.”
Attorneys for the state argued in a Tuesday brief that Heaps’ belief in the supremacy of parental rights, if applied to school policies universally, would wreak havoc in schools. They gave examples of students secretly eating school lunches of chicken nuggets when their parents are vegetarian, changing into skirts once they got to school when parents object to such clothing, or asking to go by their middle name in school.
“On Heaps’s expansive view of substantive due process, and without a limiting principle, a school would risk infringing the parent’s constitutional rights any time it honored these students’ requests over the parent’s objections,” attorneys from Attorney General Matt Platkin’s office wrote. “Educators would be subject to disruptive and inconsistent demands, undermining uniformity and predictability at school.”
They pointed to a 1948 landmark decision, McCollum v. Board of Education, that barred religious instruction in public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court in that case decreed: “if courts were ‘to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any [group] or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave public education in shreds.’”
It’s unclear “how a court could decide that one parent’s views on gender identity have greater weight than another’s on vegetarianism, modest dress, or sci-fi novels,” the attorneys wrote.
Heaps also had argued that the school’s policy interfered with his right to direct his child’s medical care. She has been diagnosed with depression, high-functioning autism, and anxiety, and Heaps told the court she was in therapy.
But that “therapy” was provided by a pastoral counselor with no medical license, Shah and Verma noted. The state’s attorneys also argued that the child wasn’t diagnosed with a mental health condition related to gender identity, and calling someone by their preferred pronouns is not medical care.
“The school has not made any medical decision for Heaps’s child or taken away any medical decision from Heaps. The school merely decided not to disregard the student’s voluntary request to be addressed by a particular name and pronouns,” they wrote. “Accepting Heaps’s capacious view of medical care would have destabilizing consequences. If addressing a student by a different name and pronouns (on the student’s own request) is medical care, teachers or school officials would be required to have a medical license to honor that request, even if a parent consented.”
The state has repeatedly tried to get the case tossed as moot because Heaps now homeschools his child, and attorneys on both sides of the fight have said she no longer wants to socially transition.
U.S. District Judge Georgette Castner has denied that request, writing in November that the case is not moot because Heaps wants his daughter to return to the 700-student school, where the policy remains in place and would be enforced.
But Shah and Verma challenged that logic, saying Heaps’ attorneys have said his child has not wanted to change her identity for over a year. Gender identity is neither transitory nor temporary, they added.
“The District Court’s decision effectively rests on the assumption that Jane is likely to flip a switch and seek to socially transition when back in school, thereby reviving Heaps’s concerns and alleged injury,” they wrote. “But such an assumption rings hollow and treats Jane’s gender identity as continually fluid. There is no evidence to support such a belief.”
The appellate court has not scheduled oral arguments in the case.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Democrats in the state Legislature began circulating draft legislation Thursday that they said would strengthen the state’s economy by supporting workers and undoing policies that undercut union-represented employees.
The package includes four bills: restoring Wisconsin’s prevailing wage law, repealing a ban on project labor agreements, repealing the state’s “right to work” law, and strengthening laws against wrongly classifying employees as independent contractors.
“We know that these are popular policies that the people of Wisconsin need to be able to thrive in our state,” said Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) at a press conference in the Assembly chamber Thursday morning. “We  have all 60 members of the Assembly Democrats and the Senate Democrats signed onto these bills.”
A crowd of union members and supporters occupied the Assembly, packed in rows where the body’s leaders usually sit as well as bunched throughout the seats that lawmakers typically use during floor sessions.
One draft bill would undo Wisconsin’s “right-to-work” law enacted during former Gov. Scott Walker’s second term. The law bars employers and unions from requiring in their labor contracts that all union-represented employees pay union dues or fees to cover the union’s operational expenses.
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said the law “allows private sector workers to benefit from union protections without paying their share of union dues.” Spreitzer recalled he was in his first Assembly term when the measure was enacted in 2015 and spoke twice against it during an all-night floor session.
“Under federal law, unions are required to represent all employees in a workplace, but right-to-work laws like Wisconsin’s allow non-dues paying employees to receive the benefits of belonging to a union — such as bargain contracts for higher wages and union representation in employment disputes —without having to pay union dues,” Spreitzer said.
“That is not fair. It is well past time to return to the requirement that every union represented worker pays their dues for that privilege in Wisconsin,” he added.
Nurse Colin Gillis, a member of SEIU Wisconsin, called the law’s name “a misnomer.” Union members deride such laws as “right-to-work for less” because they tend to weaken wage gains, he said.
Right-to-work laws were first enacted in the segregated South after World War II. “Right-to-work laws were designed to divide and conquer and prevent us from joining together and increase living standards for working families from all races and backgrounds,” Gillis said. “Repealing ‘right to work for less’ will give me and my union siblings back the freedom to organize.”
A second bill would repeal another Walker-era law, enacted in 2017, that bars state and local governments from requiring contractors on public works projects to sign a project labor agreement with relevant unions. It also forbids government bids that require the bidder to have a union contract.
“Repealing the ban on project labor agreements, or PLAs, gives power to local and state governments to utilize a tool that would streamline the building process for public construction projects,” said Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson).
LeVar Wilson, a journeyman glazer represented by the Painters Union in Milwaukee, said he got his start as an apprentice 25 years ago when the Milwaukee baseball stadium, then known as Miller Park, was being built. The stadium project labor agreement guaranteed a percentage of jobs would go to Milwaukee County residents.
“I was one of those workers hired under this provision,” Wilson said. “It led me to a sustainable career that’s allowed me to raise a family of four without the struggle of poverty that I went through when I was a child.”
A third bill would increase enforcement and penalties for businesses that misclassify workers as independent contractors.
State Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) said that when employers misclassify workers, they dodge state and federal payroll taxes, evade minimum wage laws and overtime payment requirements, and don’t pay into the worker’s compensation and unemployment insurance programs.
“By avoiding these costs, dishonest employers often successfully undercut their competitors with very low bids,” Sinicki said. “In this way, misclassification harms the law-abiding employers and their employees and also the taxpayers who have to pick up the slack.”
The draft bill would increase the penalties for lawbreakers and expand outreach both to contractors and the public about misclassification.
The legislation would “level the playing field for business owners like us, who play by the rules,” said Larry Statz, a second-generation union painting contractor with 30 employees who said that he’s seen more contractors misclassify employees in recent years.
“We refuse to break the law or shortchange our workers. But it’s getting harder to compete with dishonest companies who cut corners,” Statz said. “State laws on misclassification do not have enough teeth in them, and these cheating companies too often avoid being caught.”
The fourth bill would reinstate Wisconsin’s prevailing wage law, which set a standard for what workers on state and local government projects are paid. The prevailing wage law was repealed in the state budget Walker signed in 2017.
State Sen. Bob Wirch (D-Somers) said Republican lawmakers who voted to repeal the law “promised it would save the taxpayers money. Well, the opposite has happened.”
A study published in 2020 by the Midwest Economic Policy Institute found that  in the years that followed the repeal, construction workers’ wages fell by about $2,600 a year and highway construction costs increased.
At the time the report was published, a co-author, economist Kevin Duncan, said that the findings “underscore the longstanding academic consensus” that doing away with prevailing wage requirements leads to a lower-skilled, lower-wage workforce and doesn’t save money.
“Instead, it creates new inefficiencies in the form of workforce turnover, quality, cost overruns and safety problems,” Duncan said in a news release announcing the report. 
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said she has sought to persuade GOP Senate Majority Leader Devin Le Mahieu (R-Oostburg) to pursue bipartisan lawmaking.
“I do not know if the Senate Republicans have caucused on any of these measures, but I’d encourage them to do so,” Hesselbein said.
Neubauer said the Assembly Democrats would continue advocating for the measures, but also tacitly acknowledged that they might not advance until after the 2026 election — when Democratic leaders are hoping to flip one or both chambers.
“We will continue pushing for them as long as it takes,” Neubauer said of the bills. “And if that’s next session, so be it.”

(Courtesy of Idaho Office of Refugees)As part of the major tax and spending bill passed by Congress in July, many refugees and asylum seekers in Idaho have immediately lost access to food assistance and will lose access to medical coverage from Medicaid next year. 
Those seeking temporary humanitarian parole — a process to get legal authorization, used by many who came to Idaho from Afghanistan and Ukraine — will also have to pay a much higher fee to get a work permit. 
Immigration groups ask appeals panel to reinstate refugee programs

Around 550 individuals have resettled in Idaho since last fall, said Holly Beech, communications manager for the Idaho Office for Refugees. As a result of the budget reconciliation package approved July 1, named H.R. 1 or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” many of those individuals who had been using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and have not yet obtained their green card have been removed from the program. 
Refugees in the U.S. will also have their access to health care through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program removed by Oct. 1, 2026. Refugees will also lose eligibility for private health care through the Affordable Care Act on Jan. 1, 2027, and through Medicare Jan. 27, 2027.  
“Providing people access to food and health care benefits has been a pillar of the resettlement program,” Beech said, “because when they’ve first arrived, they’ve often had to flee their home country out of fear for their lives, so they don’t have wealth built up or resources built up….  Those are the really crucial months where those programs mean a lot to people.” 
The removal of food benefits has already gone into effect, but it’s unclear how many people have been affected. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, which administers SNAP, told the Sun that the agency can track recipients who were not citizens, but did not immediately provide the number of Idaho refugees who had been using the program before losing eligibility. 
“We’re still awaiting guidance from our federal partner so we don’t have any details yet on how we will be asked to implement the changes in H.R.1.” 
Around 70% of adults who arrive as refugees start working within five months, Beech said, but often the first job upon arrival doesn’t come with health insurance. Refugees must apply for their green card, which would reinstate their eligibility for public assistance, after one year. 
 U.S. senator for Idaho says he’s open to changes to refugee access to public assistance 

U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, serves as chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee and was key in authoring much of the version of the Big Beautiful Bill that passed. He supported the bill, but told the Idaho Capital Sun in a recent interview he would be open to reconsidering the revocation of public assistance for refugees.

Crapo said the refugee part of the nearly 900-page law was a “political negotiation.”  
“I wish I could answer it any differently than that,” Crapo said. 
He said he believes another approach could be taken “if we identify a very specific need there that can be resolved.”
“It’s a small population, and it’s one that is legally following the rules,” he said. “It seems to me that is the kind of population that would justify a second look.” 
To be a refugee, people must be referred for consideration to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program; demonstrate persecution or legitimate fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group; and be located outside the U.S. 
A small percentage of those who apply get approval to come to the U.S., Beech said. Seeking asylum follows a similar process, but it is for people to arrive at the U.S. border and apply from within the country. 
 Federal U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service policies slowing green card processing 

Lately, changes at the federal agency that processes Permanent Resident Cards — known as green cards — seem to be slowing down that process, said Beech and Boise-based immigration attorney Chris Christensen. 
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or UCIS, paused the processing of all green card applications between March 21 and April 10, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project. Beech said the office’s resettlement partners are also reporting continued delays in processing in the residency documentation.

Some people with temporary protected status who received work authorization are getting held up or have not been able to have their parole renewed. The U.S. previously established parole programs, which allowed temporary legal status for citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela with a confirmed U.S.-supporter. 
The temporary status was valid for two years and could be renewed. However, the federal government terminated the program and did not allow new parole to be granted. 
“People came here legally, are working hard, are providing for their families, and these delays are really impeding their ability to do that,” Beech said. 
People who applied for asylum in the U.S. are also facing long delays. 
Christensen, the immigration attorney, noted that the backlog of asylum cases was already long, but the Trump administration also fired a number of immigration judges or offered deferred resignation, PBS reported. 
He has clients who first applied for asylum in 2015 and are still awaiting an interview, he said.

 Fees added or significantly increased for asylees and parolees 

The large tax and spending bill also significantly increased fees for a number of asylum seekers. For instance, there used to be no cost to apply for asylum, but the new law implemented a $100 fee for an application and an additional $100 annual fee for each year the application remains pending. 
“Most people seeking asylum are fleeing persecution. They often leave with just the clothes on their back, and now there’s a $100 filing fee in order to apply for asylum,” Christensen said. 
He called the annual fee a “disincentive for the government to quickly adjudicate those cases.” 
Asylum applicants used to also be able to file for their first work permit free, Christensen said, and now that fee is $550. The fee for a green card more than doubled to $2,940 if applying in immigration court. 
Before the law, there was no fee for special immigrant juvenile cases, in which a court has determined a child has been abused, abandoned or neglected by their parents and that it is not in the best interest of the child to go back to their country of origin. That fee is now $250. 
These fees were implemented quickly upon the passage of the budget reconciliation on July 4. It happened so quickly, that there isn’t yet a mechanism to pay the $100 asylum fee in immigration court, Christensen said. 
“I’m afraid the administration may use this to make it complicated enough to pay, that people miss paying and their cases get denied simply on that basis,” he said. 
 Lost Medicaid coverage adds to new Idaho limitations on refugee medical assistance 

Refugees without a green card will lose health care coverage October 2026, and as of this July, some refugees in Idaho have already lost access to some medical services. 
The Idaho Legislature this year passed a law that limited the income eligibility for the state Refuge Medical Assistance Program, the Sun reported. House Bill 199 decreased the income eligibility for the program to 133% of the federal poverty level from its previous cap of 150%. 
The Refugee Medical Assistance program is a federally funded program that provides short-term medical coverage for refugees who aren’t eligible for Medicaid, according to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement.
Without either access, it’s unclear how certain required medical screenings will be paid for. Among many of the strict conditions for refugee resettlement is a requirement to receive a medical screening upon arrival and again when they receive their green card, Beech said. 
Medicaid and the refugee medical assistance typically has covered the cost of this screening, she said, and it’s unclear how it will be paid for if the refugee cannot afford it. 
Refugees without green cards and asylees will join the estimated tens of thousands of Idahoans who are predicted to lose access to health care because of provisions in the bill, the Sun previously reported. 
Health care advocates have estimated that many Idahoans will lose access to Medicaid because of recent work requirements — a policy the state of Idaho had already sought to implement before the federal tax and spending bill — and another 35,000 Idahoans are expected to lose health insurance coverage because Congress did not extend the enhanced premium tax credits. Those credits reduced health care premiums through the insurance marketplace established in the Affordable Care Act. 
Crapo and fellow U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, have said the changes to Medicaid will preserve the program for those it was intended to help, including pregnant women, children, seniors and those with disabilities. 
Beech said the idea behind all of the programs, including the public assistance, offered to refugees is to set up new residents for success, and it’s been shown to be successful over the last 45 years. 
She cited a National Bureau of Economic Research study that found refugees in the U.S. ending up paying significantly more in taxes than they received in public benefits in their first 20 years in the country. 
“It’s an investment in people, and it’s an investment in our communities,” Beech said. “I am concerned to know that these two, the food and health care portions, of that support that they receive when they’re brand new here, I’m concerned about what it will mean to not have access to those anymore.”

Laramie and Platte County commissioners selected Love to represent a Senate seat vacated by Trump appointee. 
The post A Q&A with Cheyenne’s Taft Love, Wyoming’s newest state senator appeared first on WyoFile .","Taft Love of Cheyenne will be sworn in Tuesday as a state lawmaker, filling a vacancy in Senate District 6 left by Darin Smith, who President Donald Trump nominated as U.S. Attorney for the District of Wyoming. 
Love, a rancher and business owner, previously served on the Laramie County School District 2 Board and as chairman of the Laramie County GOP. 
Senate District 6 encompasses Platte County and a rural swath of northeastern Laramie County. The process to fill its vacancy began late last month with a meeting in Guernsey, where GOP precinct committee members nominated Love alongside Roy Birt of Wheatland and Jeff Barnes of Cheyenne. 
Last week, the two counties’ commissioners gathered in Cheyenne to make the final determination, selecting Love out of the three nominees. 
Love was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and grew up the son of a Navy man. When he graduated from high school as Indiana’s bareback rodeo champion, a Laramie County Community College coach recruited him to ride bucking horses. 
Love went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in wildlife management and range management from the University of Wyoming. He worked for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department as a biologist and in the state’s former tourism division before starting several businesses, including a construction company and TKO Ranch.

Love and his wife, Jill, have three children. 
In 2024, he ran in the Republican primary against Smith and four other candidates for the district he will soon represent. He said he plans to run again in 2026 to keep the seat. 
WyoFile spoke with Love by phone Thursday ahead of his swearing in. 
WyoFile: Starting about halfway through the term, how are you preparing for the job? 
Sen.-Elect Taft Love: Really, the appointment is going to impact the budget year, and then we’ll have to run again next year. Then if we win that seat, it will sustain for two years, and then we’ll have to run again, and it’ll go back on its normal four-year schedule. So there’s actually a pretty aggressive schedule to make sure the people have the say as quickly as possible in this. Barring a special election though, we still go through the appointment process, and the appointment is truly focused on the budget session. And so what I did is I dove into the Platte and Laramie County budgets and the state of Wyoming budget and the supplemental budget to make sure I understood where we were at and what was being presented as we move forward. 
I understand there’s another property tax [proposal] that is being presented to the voters in this election cycle as well. The voters will determine what happens with this. I know counties are extremely concerned about additional property tax cuts because it’s going to start impacting their infrastructure. And it may actually start putting faces to the cuts, because you can only go so deep before, you know, personnel is, in general, the largest expenditure of most government agencies. So it’s hard to cut too many things before you get to the point where you have to start cutting personnel.
WF: Unlike Laramie County, Platte County is a hardship county, so it generates lower revenues and that can make it challenging to fund public services. Do you think the Legislature has been sensitive to Wyoming’s hardship counties, particularly when it comes to property tax cuts?
TL: I think they keep it in mind. I think if the intention is to continue to do deeper tax cuts on property tax then I’m not sure one-size-fits-all is going to work anymore for some of those poorer counties that — and I don’t want to say poorer counties, I want to say that they have less revenue than what others have. Such as Platte County, they don’t have a lot of the minerals and petroleum and those revenues coming in, where Laramie County does. And so I absolutely think we have to be cautious as we move forward and make sure those counties are able to sustain their essential services for sure.

WF: What role, if any, should the Wyoming Legislature play in economic development?
TL: I don’t believe we’re supposed to pick winners and losers in economic development. I think that we set the framework at the 30,000-foot view, and we allow our local governing bodies to make those decisions as far as recruiting and bringing businesses into the state of Wyoming. They are best suited to know what fits their community and their community needs in that growth-and-development scenario. So I think the state needs to stay at that 30,000-foot view and not pick winners and losers.
WF: Having served on the Laramie County School District 2 Board, you’ll be able to bring the perspective of local government to the Legislature, where there’s been an evolving conversation about local control. I’m wondering how well you think lawmakers have followed the conservative principle of local control in recent years?
TL: I do think that everybody feels strongly about local control, and the best government is the government closest to the people. And I intend to uphold that as I move through the process, and be very cognizant of that as I try to make decisions.
WF: You mentioned in Guernsey that education would be a priority of yours as a lawmaker. Can you elaborate on any specific ideas related to education that you’d like to pursue?
TL: I have not started with any specific bill draft ideas. I’ve got a few in mind. I’m going to hold those until I can develop them a little bit more. There’s a lot that can be done in education, and as we work towards the defederalization of our education system and more of a state-run and state-guided education system, I think Wyoming lawmakers are going to have the ability to make influence into that. And maybe there’s an opportunity for us to get more efficient, both economically and in the education itself of our children, and make sure that we are industry ready when we’re graduating from high school, and any trade schools that we might have going on as well. We need to very much focus on making sure that we’re meeting the industry needs with the graduates. And so there’s a tremendous opportunity to be able to grow and to write some new laws and take some new opportunities in those areas.

WF: And related to that, Wyoming has a youth exodus problem. What, if anything, should the Legislature do to keep young people here?
TL: Business recruitment and entertainment are the two things that are going to keep our kids here. And so making sure we have an inviting tax structure that allows growth of small business in our communities, and making sure that we recognize the needs of those communities, making sure our land use, land-use regulation, water and [the Department of Environmental Quality,] the state engineers office — the DEQ do a great job of helping guide those paths. And we need to be creative in the way we make opportunity for new industries to come into our communities, so that our kids have the opportunities to stay and not have to seek jobs outside of the state. That’s the age-old question in Wyoming is, “How do we retain our children?” I think as time grows and things change, we need to figure out ways to protect some of our legacy ag and ranching industry. We need to find ways and be creative in how we can maintain a good, healthy growth and keep Wyoming’s values in that growth. And that’s the true challenge we see. I’ve watched other areas of the nation where their values have deteriorated in certain areas based on what has been allowed through their legal system. And so I think we have to be really cautious as we grow our communities.
WF: Lawmakers have spent a lot of time in recent years aiming to overhaul the state’s election system. One thing they have not pursued is a ban on mail-in ballots. Last month, the Trump administration announced it plans to prohibit states from using mail-in ballots. I’m wondering, do you think that kind of restriction would be a good fit in Wyoming, where a lot of residents cast their ballots by mail?
TL: So mail-in ballots by and large, I think it’s another one of those things where you can’t use a one-size-fits-all. I think we have elderly communities that it will be very difficult for some of them to go to a polling location. I think we have disabled veterans that are going to have issue with that. We have traveling veterans and military personnel that are not going to be able to get there. There’s a good place for the use of mail-in ballots, and I think we can be careful with how we do that. And so I’ll be anxious to see what’s presented. And I guess I’d withhold any decision until I’m able to see the full documentation on it. 
WF: You’ve been an active member of the Wyoming Republican Party, having recently served as Laramie County GOP chairman. I want to ask you about the divide among Republicans about who is a true conservative and who isn’t. Where do you fit into that conversation?
TL: I’m really disappointed to see the divide inside of the Republican Party. And by and large, I believe most of everybody who calls themselves a Republican in the state of Wyoming has conservative values. And they agree on probably 80 or 90% of the platform, and what we need to be doing. The issue we have is that we’re spending 90% of our time talking about the 10% we don’t agree on, instead of doing the business of the people and working together for the 90% we do agree on.
WF: What else would you like your constituents to know about you?
TL: I am very honored to be serving and grateful for the opportunity and that I will be present in their communities, and that my email and phone are open to them anytime they need to reach out. I intend to be there for different community functions and opportunities, and I want to hear about their concerns. I’m very much here to serve the people of Senate District 6.

(Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)By Chris Porrino
Now that the gubernatorial nominees have been chosen, we can expect to hear more about their leadership philosophies. One issue that likely will garner little attention but will have far-reaching implications is this: Should the new governor strictly enforce Executive Order No. 6, issued by Gov. Jim Florio in 1990, which requires that all state departments and agencies rely exclusively on the attorney general for legal counsel?
At first glance, this may seem like a bureaucratic detail. In practice, the question of who advises state officials on the law can significantly shape how decisions are made, how policies are implemented, and how much authority the governor actually wields. When that legal counsel is the attorney general — a lawyer nominated by and almost always an ally of the governor — the governor will possess greater power and control over state agencies and departments. On the other hand, when EO 6 is not enforced, legal advice will be dispensed by lawyers within the departments and agencies themselves, affording greater independence.
There are pros and cons to both approaches, and different governors have taken different paths on this infrequently discussed subject. I can tell you from personal experience, as a former director of the division of law (which acts for the attorney general as the “law firm” to the state), former chief counsel to Gov. Chris Christie, and attorney general of New Jersey, very few matters of consequence in state government happen without the involvement of legal counsel. I therefore urge the current candidates to make a purposeful choice on this issue after careful consideration and discussion with prior administrations.
 The case for strict enforcement

Enforcement of EO 6 across the board creates a potentially very powerful benefit for the next governor — in a state that already has one of the most powerful governorships in the nation. Requiring that all legal advice be obtained from the Attorney General’s Office consolidates legal strategy under one roof, making it far easier to ensure that departments and agencies are carrying out a unified policy agenda. When agency heads rely on “in-house” counsel who report only to them, not to the attorney general, legal advice can easily become siloed or even adversarial to the governor’s goals. EO 6, if applied rigorously, reestablishes a more hierarchical chain of command — one that strengthens the governor’s ability to lead and better achieve his or her policy objectives.
Of course, this all assumes that the attorney general is aligned with the governor on key policy issues, and that the attorney general’s leadership team spends the necessary time to ensure that the legal advice being given to different departments helps advance the administration’s agenda. While the attorney general is appointed by the governor and usually has close ties to him or her, New Jersey’s unique constitutional structure gives the attorney general considerable independence once confirmed. If the attorney general diverges from the governor’s views — or takes a more cautious or differently motivated legal approach — there is little the governor can do to override that legal advice.
 The drawbacks

Yet there are significant potential downsides to enforcing the order without flexibility. Most department and agency leaders — whether in human services, environmental protection, corrections, or transportation — prefer having legal advisors embedded within their leadership teams. These internal counsel often possess expertise tailored to the specialized operations and day-to-day legal needs of their departments in ways that an externally assigned deputy attorney general may not.
Moreover, in-house counsel are often seen as trusted strategic partners, helping shape decisions in real time. In many cases, in-house counsel are hand-picked by the relevant commissioner and the Governor’s Office, ensuring that they are ideological adherents of the administration’s agenda as opposed to career civil servants in the Attorney General’s Office. Removing in-house counsel could lead to slower responses, reduced innovation, and a sense of detachment from legal strategy. In a state government as complex as New Jersey’s, a one-size-fits-all model may sacrifice practicality for formal control.
 Finding the balance

The next governor must weigh these competing considerations carefully.
This is not just a governance issue. It is a question of how power flows, how leadership is exercised, and how effectively New Jersey can respond to the challenges of modern state government and its frequent interaction with the business community and citizen advocates. After prevailing on Election Day, the next governor would be wise to revisit this foundational issue during the transition — not just to reassert control, but to build a more cohesive, responsive, and strategically aligned executive branch. While this decision won’t make headlines, it may determine the success of the new administration.

On a Labor Day adventure, a WyoFile reporter and his editor unknowingly traversed a high-density snake zone.
The post Wyoming rattler road trip appeared first on WyoFile .","Fall’s cooler temperatures send Wyoming’s prairie rattlesnakes slithering home to hang out closer to their dens.
“Your highest occurrence of crossing paths with the rattlesnake is going to be May, June, July, August and September,” said Matt Rasmussen, vice president of the Wyoming Herpetological Society. 
For ophidiophobes — those with a fear of snakes — hoping for a firm date, when all rattlers tuck themselves in for winter, Rasmussen says there is no such thing.  
“You can expect to see a rattlesnake in most of Wyoming below about 7,200 feet until there’s snow on the ground, because even if there’s a warm day, they can be out,” Rasmussen said. “I’ve seen rattlesnakes every month in Wyoming, except for December, January and February, but that’s typically because I look for them and I like them, and I’m going to where they are.”
Driving the backroads between Pathfinder Reservoir and the town of Medicine Bow, WyoFile reporter Andrew Graham and his editor had a near miss with two rattlers within a few miles. 
“That particular area of Wyoming is the highest density of rattlesnakes anywhere in the state,” Rasmussen said. “And it’s one of the highest densities of rattlesnakes anywhere in the country.” 
The Shirley Basin’s rock pile hills and lower elevation mountains are home to huge rattlesnake dens, Rasmussen said. 
He’s heard talk of rattlers traveling 3 miles from their dens, and is certain they can range up to a mile.

The WyoFile staffers were delighted to catch a glimpse of snakes slithering and sunbathing from the safety of their pickups. The first snake was more of a brunette, while the second leaned blonde. 
“They’re highly variable in their phenotype and appearance,” Rasmussen said. “Their name, Crotalus viridis, is green rattlesnake. And some of ours that we have here are extremely green. They’re just beautiful — glowing chartreuse and green. And others, they’re just chocolate or gray or kind of muted sandy colors. In the same area, in the same population, there’s wide, wide variability in their appearance.”
If you see one, and you don’t want to get bitten, all you have to do is walk away. Rasmussen advises: “A snake will never chase anyone.”
But seeing them is key? 
“You cannot see a rattlesnake if it doesn’t want to be seen,” Rasmussen said. “But you can see the sagebrush that it likes to coil underneath. You can see that small pile of rocks out in the prairie that it likes to hang out by. So if you can identify these small, sun-dappled, shaded areas where they could feel comfortable, and you avoid those, you’ll be fine.” 
Rasmussen stands by that advice even after being bit by a rattlesnake last year. 
“It was a complete one in a million fluke,” Rasmussen said. “I work for the railroad in eastern Wyoming and I knelt down to pick up something in between the ties, and it was underneath the foot of the rail, and it got me.” 
That painful encounter — which he said left his arm looking like a football — didn’t undermine Rasmussen’s admiration. 
“They are an important part of our ecosystem,” Rasmussen said. 
Many humans appreciate them for eating rodents, Rasmussen said, but the benefits extend beyond pest control. “They’re proven to be seed dispersers, because they don’t digest those seeds that are in the stomach of the rodents that they eat.”
He said they’re also an important food source for other animals from badgers and bobcats to raptors and hawks. 
“They’re just really cool,” Rasmussen exclaimed. “I mean, it’s an animal with no legs that lives in a state that gets down to 30 below. They’re only active typically for three or four months of the year and can live for over 20 years with that activity level. And there’s been studies that some adults only eat once a year.”

When dictators decide to take over a nation, the first thing they do is purge their government of anyone that doesn’t kow-tow to their ideological mandates.  Then they target the intellectuals, the press and those who raise dissent over their loss of freedoms – including individuals, businesses, universities, and political opponents.
Then they turn the military against their own citizens to crush any thoughts of protest while weaponizing the government against any entities that resist the crushing jackboot on their necks.
If this sounds mighty familiar these days, there are far too many reasons to list in one column.  In truth, the American people are now largely in shock at what the historically unpopular president is doing to our country — and to the total disregard of the ethics and norms so many have taken for granted. 
We have taken pride that our still very young nation was founded and operates on three “separate but equal” branches of government that are supposed to provide the checks and balances to contain abuse by any one branch.  But the supposed balance of the legislative, executive and judicial branches no longer exists.
Historically, the executive branch implements the laws and spends the appropriated funding as per Congressional intent.  Only now, through the administration’s legally dubious process of recission, billions in congressionally approved funds are being cut and/or redirected from their intended use. And in far too many instances, it’s being intentionally done as punishment for universities, cities, states, businesses or Congressional members’ districts that do not support the dictatorial mandates of the White House.  
This week a federal judge ruled the White House illegally froze billions of dollars in research funds for Harvard, writing:  “A review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”  
And that’s just the tip of the abuses emanating from the executive. 
In the meantime, the National Guard that was sent to Washington, D.C., from so-called red states to supposedly “restore order” is mostly picking up litter — at a cost to taxpayers of a million bucks a day with no end in sight. 
Chicago is next on the list of “blue state” cities that will enjoy the freedom of having armed American soldiers on their streets based on the hyper-sensitized claim by the president that it’s “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far.”  But many other cities have higher crime rates and the shootings and homicides in Chicago are down by more than 30% this year alone — the fourth year of declines. 
Following the dictator’s pattern, the press has been in the crosshairs with outrageous bribes being demanded by the administration.  Meanwhile, press and social media outlets are threatened with investigations, shut-downs, and lawsuits from their own government.  And those that publish news, facts, or positions unfavorable to the administration are the primary targets of retribution. 
Montanans hold individual privacy a sacrosanct “Inalienable right” along with popular sovereignty, self government, individual dignity, freedom of assembly, religion, speech, expression, and press.  We likewise prohibit any random search and/or seizure of our citizens as well as their “papers, electronic data and communications, homes and effects.”
On the last day of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Ben Franklin was asked: “What have we got a republic or a monarchy?”  He replied: “A republic, if you can keep it.”  Right now “keeping it” is a daunting and unprecedented challenge — and one at which which we must not fail.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-9310-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-05 06:57:23.578626

The American Association of University Professors survey of approximately 4,000 faculty members was conducted in August. Respondents are members of the association’s chapters in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. About 200 were from Louisiana. 
The survey found professors are deeply dissatisfied with the state of higher education in their states and are looking for employment outside the South. 
The same survey last year found that salary was the main reason faculty were considering leaving.

Professors also reported they fear teaching about climate change, feminism and other topics extreme conservatives have put in their crosshairs when attacking universities they consider “too woke.” 
There is a “fear of talking openly about academic findings that may contradict political ideology,” one associate professor in Georgia said in their survey response. 
In addition to higher education-specific concerns, such as attacks on tenure and removal of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, some faculty cited anti-LGBTQ+ state laws and abortion bans among their reasons for wanting to leave the South. 
LSU isn’t recording complaints from student athletes in most sports 

The survey also found that 17% of faculty have had their syllabi or curriculum choices questioned by university administrators. Another 10% said their grants or federal contracts were ended by the Trump administration. 
Over half of respondents said they would not recommend their state as a desirable place to work and almost 40% said they had witnessed a tangible effect on hiring. 
Approximately a quarter of all professors surveyed – and over 29% of all Louisiana professors – said they are considering leaving their jobs.
LSU Board of Supervisors Chairman Scott Ballard pushed back on the idea that politicians have an outsized influence on universities. 
“Your elected officials will always have an opinion,” Ballard said at a board committee meeting Thursday. “I don’t get orders.” 
“Good luck going anywhere where your elected officials aren’t involved,” Ballard added. 
Multiple professors in Louisiana reported fear that something they say in class could be recorded and posted out of context on social media, sparking backlash from politicians, as happened in the case of two LSU law professors last year. 
“My colleague (tenured, full professor) was summarily suspended without a hearing or any form of due process based on a student complaint that he verbally criticized the Governor and President in a joking way with off-color language in his first class of the semester,” one full professor wrote in response to a survey question. “We’re terrified, which is the goal. “
The professor’s response refers to Ken Levy, an LSU law professor who was removed from the classroom after a student posted a video of him making critical and profane comments about Gov. Jeff Landry, leading to Landry calling for him to be fired.

(Getty Images)The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is accepting public comments on recent pay rate cuts for health care providers who treat Medicaid patients. 
Last month, the state health agency announced it would cut Medicaid reimbursement rates for all provider types and services by 4%, starting Sept. 1. The news came a week after Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered state agencies to cut budgets mid-year by 3% ahead of an $80 million projected budget shortfall.
The Medicaid cuts are meant to reduce rapidly rising Medicaid costs, and more could come, state officials said. But said the cuts — coupled with another Medicaid program set to end soon — could push some doctors’ offices to stop accepting Medicaid, Idaho Medical Association CEO Susie Keller previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.

The cuts took effect Monday, but Health and Welfare is working with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “to clarify operational expectations with any claims needing to be reprocessed,” agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
At the Idaho Legislature’s Medicaid Review Panel’s Wednesday meeting, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron said “making changes to this proposal is not out of the question.”
“What we expect to see and dig into — in addition to some folks just saying we disagree with this — is ‘are there specific access or impact concerns within specific communities that we need to look at?’” she said in response to a question from a lawmaker. “For example, maybe it’s a specific home and community-based service in a very rural community.”
Here’s how the cuts will work, according to Health and Welfare’s announcement last month:

The providers: That includes hospitals, nursing and intermediate care facilities, home and community-based services for people with disabilities, hospice, ambulatory surgical centers, school-based services and more. Pharmacy benefit rates will also face 4% cuts. Tribal providers will be exempt from the cuts, since they are “reimbursed entirely with federal funds when serving tribal members.”
Managed care: Payments to private companies that manage Medicaid benefits will also be cut by 4%. The cuts to those payments, called capitation rates, may come through “provider rate reductions or changes to optional covered costs.” Some Idaho Medicaid services — like mental health care, medical transportation and dental care — are run by private managed care organizations. Idaho hopes to shift all Medicaid benefits to managed care by 2029, under a state law passed this year.

(Getty Images)My name is Raymond O’Dell. I am a Boise resident, a veteran and I receive my medical care at the Boise VA. 
For some time now there has been an effort by the federal government to privatize veterans’ health care. If you’ve been watching the news, you will see that the Trump administration has put this effort in the fast lane. The intent seems to be to bust the VA union (done), critically understaff VA facilities (done) and divert VA funding to “community care” (done). In other words, cripple VA health care to the point of failure in order to justify complete privatization. 
Proposed cuts to the VA will limit health care access for our Idaho veterans. They deserve better.

You may ask, what is wrong with privatizing VA care? In Idaho it would be catastrophic. The Boise VA sees over 40,000 patients per year and provides veteran specific care related to conditions such as burn pit exposure, Agent Orange, post-traumatic stress and loss of limbs. This care extends from Salmon to Twin Falls and Ontario to Idaho Falls. The impact on Idaho communities cannot be overstated. 
Idaho ranks 50th among states in the number of doctors per capita. Communities throughout Idaho are experiencing a severe shortage of primary care physicians, specialty physicians and nurses. This can be attributed to many factors, among them, Idaho reproductive rights laws, Medicaid cuts and the lack of medical schools in the state. 
This equates to Idaho citizens competing with one another in a literal health care abyss. When you throw in 40,000 plus veterans who have lost their VA care it further floods a severely flooded system. Community residents suddenly find themselves competing with not only their neighbors for care but also competing with thousands of veterans for care. 
VA health care providers are oftentimes veterans themselves and understand the special needs of veterans. All VA health care providers are specially trained in the physical and psychological needs of the veterans they care for. This cannot be said of care outside of VA facilities. 
Job loss is another consequence of privatization. The Boise VA employs approximately 1,500 Treasure Valley residents of which one third are veterans themselves. The health care cuts mentioned previously are more than likely to cause those employees to leave the state in order to find employment. The ones who stay will find themselves in a flooded local job market outside of health care. 
The Boise VA is a teaching hospital and major training ground for physician residents, nurses and other health care professionals. Nationwide, a large percentage of health care professionals receive part of their training through VA programs, and the availability of residency slots is a major limiting factor in how many physicians can be trained, eliminating the VA would be a serious blow. Eliminating the Boise VA would seriously hinder the ability to train and maintain doctors in the Treasure Valley. 
I have shared an awareness of all this information with our elected leaders from the Boise city mayor (who was very receptive) to our Idaho congressional delegation and most everyone in between. Except for Mayor Lauren McLean’s office, most were unconcerned and continue to give “lip service” and promises that are not reflected in their priorities or their votes. For example, U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, would have you believe “Community Care” is the answer and blames Joe Biden, invoking partisanship when the problem is resources. 
It is my position that they need to be proactive. By the time they become reactive it will be too late. I do NOT want our elected officials to be able to say “I had no idea this would happen.” Let it be known that they have been informed. What they do with that information will be on them.

(Getty Images)After 30 years as a teacher, Cathy Proctor, 72, is still working at a nearby Malden Elementary school as a substitute. She said the money is necessary to pay for groceries and growing medical bills after her husband became ill.
Plus, she’s going to pay more for her health insurance through the Public Employees Insurance Agency, which is offered to retired state employees. 
In July, sweeping premium hikes went into effect for PEIA participants and some retirees as the program has struggled for years to stay afloat financially. The program provides health insurance coverage for teachers, state employees and more. 
“It angers me,” said Proctor, who lives in Rand, W.Va. “I feel like this part of my life that I gave meant nothing to them.”










I feel like this part of my life that I gave meant nothing to them.


– Cathy Proctor


She added, “If they are in trouble financially, there’s other avenues they could go without  tacking everything on us.”
PEIA premium hikes are supposed to make up an estimated $113 million gap for the coming fiscal year because medical and prescription drug expenses have outpaced the program’s budget. 
While Gov. Patrick Morrisey has floated the idea of a special session this month to “fix” PEIA, the governor and the GOP-supermajority Legislature can’t seem to reach a consensus. 
PEIA premiums are increasing by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. 
The agency will also raise premiums by 12% for the 42,000 retirees enrolled in PEIA. The premium increase went into effect for retirees not on Medicare in July; retirees using Medicare will see the increase Jan 1.
“I know living on this fixed income, which we get no raises, it’s tough on retirees, especially if they increase the PEIA rates on us,” said Robin Beamer Dalton, of Princeton. Dalton taught school in Mercer County for 33 years before she retired in 2015. Because she has a Medicare plan in addition to PEIA, Dalton’s PEIA rates will increase early next year.
Dalton, a widow, said she’s trying to cut expenses in anticipation of the rate increase, but she hasn’t ruled out the possibility of finding a part-time job to help cover it. 
“I don’t want to [work], because I feel like — well, I have worked over half my life,” she said. I just lost my husband four and a half months ago. I feel like I need to be home.”

Lawmakers should allocate $10M to reverse retiree price hike, senator says 
A spokesperson for the state Department of Administration said the average increase for retirees in the program depends on the individual’s years of service and type of coverage. 
She explained that, for example, a Medicare policyholder with single coverage and 25 years of service will see a $10 increase, while a non-Medicare family plan will see a $76 increase.  
PEIA co-pays for certain medical services and prescription drugs increases, too.
When asked if PEIA leaders were considering reversing these changes for retirees, the department spokesperson said, “This continues to be an ongoing dialogue between the administration and PEIA. With the increasing costs of health care and recent shifts in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans, these changes are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the plan.”
State lawmakers wrapped up their legislative session in April, exiting the Capitol without any action on PEIA while the price hikes loomed. 
Sen. Mike Oliverio, R-Monongalia
Sen. Mike Oliverio, R-Monongalia, said he’s working on gathering support for lawmakers to gather in October to allocate $10 million to reverse the PEIA premium hike for retirees. It’s not part of Morrisey’s alleged PEIA special session plan; the governor can call a special session or lawmakers can with the support of three-fifths in both the House and Senate. 
“These are the folks who have cleaned our schools and state office buildings for decades. They’ve been our school bus drivers, they’ve been our school cooks,” Oliverio said, adding that these retirees are typically on fixed incomes.
He added, “A budget of $5 billion, a surplus of $280 million — surely we could find $10 million to hold off these premium increases on these folks who have served our state and our citizens for many, many years … The Legislature could come in, one day in October, suspend the rules and pass this.”
Morrisey has proposed a plan to “fix” PEIA, MetroNews reported. It includes establishing a new plan for new employees; removing coverage eligibility for spouses who are offered health insurance through their own employer; and establishing a PEIA fraud unit. Retirees weren’t mentioned. 
In July, Morrisey’s spokesperson told West Virginia Watch that the governor would “look to find solutions for all who receive coverage, including retirees.”
The possible PEIA-focused special session could start as early as Sunday since lawmakers will gather in Charleston for September legislative interim meetings. 
Dalton said officials should consider using the state’s surplus to give retired workers a raise. 
“There are people that have been retired longer than me that we never get a wage increase unless it’s Social Security, which they take part of that for insurance so you really don’t get much,” she said. 
For Proctor, the premium hike comes as she is helping her husband recover from a serious illness that requires a list of medications. 
“Every time I turn around, utilities are going up … everything is just piling up,” she said, adding that she turns to her faith and prayer in these times. 
“God is in control, he provides our needs,” she said.

(Getty Images photo)Gov. Tony Evers is on a back-to-school tour, visiting classrooms around the state and touting the budget deal he recently struck with Republicans after declaring 2025 the “Year of the Kid.” Evers “proudly signed a pro-kid, bipartisan state budget into law earlier this summer that invests nearly $1.4 billion in spendable revenue for K-12 schools,” according to a press release from his office celebrating Back to School Week.
You would never know from that announcement that the amount of new general aid schools receive from the state in the current, two-year budget cycle is exactly zero. Or that, as a result, about 70% of school districts across the state are starting the year with less money in the budget than they got in the last, austerity-level biennial budget deal. 
True, the budget includes a total of about $500 million in special education funding, with the state increasing the share of special ed costs it covers from less than 30% to 42% in the first year and 45% of costs in the second year. As Evers’ office puts it, that’s “the largest increase to the special education reimbursement rate in state history.” But it follows decades of decline and amounts to one-half of the 90% reimbursement rate under former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and significantly less than the 60% Evers originally proposed. And the zeroed-out general aid from the state seriously undermines the impact of those long-awaited special education funds. 
The lion’s share of the $1.4 billion in “spendable revenue” Evers is celebrating comes in the form of increased taxing authority the state gave to local school districts — meaning the amount by which they are allowed to raise local property taxes to cover their costs. But local property taxpayers are getting weary of the constantly increasing demand on them to pay more for schools, and local school officials are dismayed that the state did so little to take on some of that cost.
Since special education is a federally mandated expense, the state’s shrinking reimbursement rate has taken a heavy toll on all school programs. For years, schools across Wisconsin have had to cut art, music, sports and other programs to pay a larger and larger share of special ed expenses. That’s why, at budget hearings throughout the state, so many people showed up to say a top priority for the new budget was an increase in the state’s share of special ed. 
“But never did anyone in those budget hearings come to the mic and say, ‘you should either give us general aid or special ed funding,” says Heather DuBois Bourenane, director of the Wisconsin Public Education Network, a statewide group that lobbies for public schools.
DuBois Bourenane says she’s already been getting calls asking her to help local communities put together springtime referendum campaigns asking local property taxpayers for more money on top of what the budget allows them to raise — something that’s never before happened this early in the year. She predicts another record-breaking year of school referendum efforts. Meanwhile, “we’re hearing in some districts they’re afraid to use the authority because local taxes are so high,” she says. “They’re talking about cuts.”
“It’s scary,” she adds. “The belt-tightening is going to be really bad.”
Advocates and school leaders had high hopes that Evers, a former science teacher and state superintendent, would fight to adequately fund public schools. Determined to get a deal, and negotiating with Republicans who seemed all too willing to let schools starve, Evers got what he felt was the best deal he could. And now he’s selling that deal as a good one. But the victory lap is misleading. Public school leaders across the state say the budget leaves teachers, students and local taxpayers in a bad situation. 
“Allowing an increase is one thing — paying for it is another,” LaCrosse News8000.com TV reporter Allyson Fergot explained in a story on how the state budget leaves schools strapped. “This summer lawmakers opted not to fund [a per pupil school funding] increase with state money, so if districts want it, they’ll have to raise district property taxes.”
“The state of Wisconsin currently has a $4.2 billion surplus, but no new general state aid has been provided to help schools meet rising costs,” Madison Metropolitan School District Superintendent Joe Gothard told Wisconsin Public Radio.
How did this happen?
During the budget debate, it was clear that Republicans were outraged by Evers’ line-item veto of the 2023-25 state budget, which extended a provision that increased the amount by which school districts could raise property taxes for the next 400 years.
In retaliation, Republicans promised that there would be no new state aid for schools in the current budget. And they stuck to their word. Wisconsin kids, not Evers, will pay the price of that maneuver. Clearly, it didn’t pay off. 
“It did real harm,” DuBois Bourenane says of Evers’ 400-year-veto. “This was a spite budget. It was petty.” And it wasn’t worth it: The amount of the increase Evers locked in for the next four centuries, at $325 per kid, didn’t even cover inflation. Overall, spending on schools in Wisconsin hasn’t kept pace with inflation for nearly two decades.
“We’re about a little over $3,000 short per kid just because of inflation over the past years,” Cochrane-Fountain City Superintendent Troy White told News8000.com
Could Evers have held out for a better deal? DuBois Bourenane thinks so. She was impressed by the massive public outpouring of support for schools at budget hearings, and the way public pressure helped shape bipartisan consensus on the need to support schools, take the burden off property taxpayers and increase state funding for special ed.
“And schools still came out with nothing,” she says.
When you add in the massive increases in funding for private schools through the state’s voucher programs, the outlook at the start of this school year is grim.
As the state mulls whether to accept a federal voucher program that has the potential to turbocharge the already rapidly expanding system of taxpayer-supported private schools, the Wisconsin Public Education Network is launching a voucher transparency project this month, to help taxpayers get a clear picture of how much they are spending on school vouchers on their property tax bills.
Meanwhile, “everyone should call their legislators and give them the numbers on how much less their districts are coming back to school with,” says DuBois Bourenane. “We need more leaders to do what they can with the leverage they can to fix this.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-681888015-e1579578237667.jpg,,,2025-09-05 06:57:23.578626

A week after saying he wasn’t considering deploying National Guard troops to Memphis or Nashville, Gov. Bill Lee reportedly said this week anything is possible. 
The waffling came amid increased calls for troops to patrol the streets of Tennessee’s bluest cities, even though last week Lee referred to statistics showing a 15% decrease in Memphis crime to explain why the Bluff City didn’t need troops on patrol. The governor said increased efforts by Tennessee law enforcement with local and federal agencies combined to cut down on criminal incidents.










Sen. (Brent) Taylor reportedly says in an interview that even though he hasn’t ‘seen any evidence’ that MPD is reclassifying crimes to make the numbers look better, he wants to waste TBI resources to act as Big Brother to our police department based on rumors and hearsay.


– Rep. Jesse Chism, D-Memphis


The same day, or thereabouts, though, Republican state Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County and GOP Rep. John Gillespie of Memphis asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to audit Memphis’ crime report for accuracy. It marked another Taylor bomb lobbed at Memphis after he worked this year for a state takeover of the city’s school district, saying – without providing proof – an audit could lead to criminal charges. 
Now comes Democratic Rep. Jesse Chism of Memphis calling their request “ridiculous.” 
“Sen. Taylor reportedly says in an interview that even though he hasn’t ‘seen any evidence’ that MPD is reclassifying crimes to make the numbers look better, he wants to waste TBI resources to act as Big Brother to our police department based on rumors and hearsay,” Chism said in a statement.
The normally soft-spoken Chism acknowledged more work is necessary to cull crime, but added, “We don’t need people casting doubt on the work being done by the dedicated men and women of the MPD, just like we don’t need an armed occupation by the National Guard.”
The governor’s stance last week put him at odds, somewhat, with President Donald Trump, who illegally – according to one court – unleashed the California National Guard and U.S. Marines in Los Angeles during protests over his deportation policy, which is putting a dent in the nation’s workforce.
Tennessee National Guard to join D.C. police order

Next week, Lee could have a different outlook, depending on how shrill the cry is to deploy.
Lee had no trouble sending Tennessee Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to patrol the streets at Trump’s request. If he sends troops into Memphis and Nashville, where will they go? What will they do? Will that be a sign that seven years of his policies failed?
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who rarely disagrees with Trump, except when it came to certifying Joe Biden’s presidential election five years ago, chimed in to agree with the president about occupying Memphis.
This elicited a response from Memphis City Council member Jerri Green, who thinks it’s a terrible idea and believes officials should focus on education and poverty. She’s running as a Democrat for governor and toured craft beer joints across the state to kick off her campaign, a great idea.
Can we get more pale ales, please?
Another Democrat ogles a congressional seat
Capping a couple of months of rumors, Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder kicked off his race for the Democratic nomination in Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District at an ice cream joint on the Columbia square Thursday. 
Molder, a Columbia native and attorney, is in his second term in office and has his sights set on the incumbent congressman, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles.

“People are tired of electing the most extreme voices on either side,” said Molder. “They’re looking for responsible leaders, whether Republican or Democrat, who aren’t just chasing the latest soundbite to grab a headline.”
“We don’t have to be embarrassed by our congressman,” he said, in an obvious reference to Ogles, who has had his share of ethical scrapes. 
Molder is the third Democrat to enter the primary, joining Metro Nashville Councilmember Mike Cortese and Jim Torino, the COO of a telemedicine business. But it’s no secret 5th District Democrats have been whispering in Molder’s ear for years, urging him to run. It won’t hurt that former House Democratic Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh, who is respected on both sides of the political aisle, is Molder’s father-in-law.
Taking it on the chin
Lee is appealing a Chancery Court decision declaring the state’s “intent to go armed” law and guns-in-parks prohibition unconstitutional, a move drawing heavy criticism from some House Republicans.
State Rep. Monty Fritts of Kingston penned letters to the governor and Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, blasted the decision in a Facebook post as “betrayal” and accusing the “elitist political class in Nashville” of spending tax dollars to take away “our Creator endowed rights.” WSMV reported it.
Besides complaints about the gun-law appeal, Fritts said the governor “created out of control budget growth,” up 59% in six years, and ignored lawmakers’ requests for immediate help after Hurricane Helene. Fritts also says “we cautioned him about placing us in the judgment path of God on the IVF/contraception bill which places babies at risk and he did not listen. But the Watchman must continue to call out the danger.”
(Never mind that a woman, Republican Rep. Iris Rudder of Winchester, sponsored the bill to make in vitro fertilization a right.) 
Sounding a bit like a gubernatorial candidate, Fritts wrote that the “Nashville establishment” doesn’t understand the concept of more liberty and less government (which is probably true).

— Monty Fritts (@MontyFrittsTN32) September 3, 2025
“I am already in the doghouse of a group of petty and weak bullies who cut backroom deals to kill my bills. I am certain my straight words here will not help that. But let the hard truth be heard,” Fritts says. “Pray for Tennessee. We are in trouble.” 
It’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry. But it does sound sort of like the song that never ends.
“As the gutless, drunken, and dimwitted politicians smile at you and assert all is well, your money is being taken needlessly to fund corporate welfare and special interests, your rights are being eroded while crime in some cities explodes and we fund the education of illegals, you are told by senior leaders in Nashville that the church sign (which had been in place for 30 years) was in a right of way and they could do what they wished with it while you repair tires from potholes, and the people doing this to you feel no accountability to you.” 
OK, let me up, I’ve had enough.










That’s not freedom. That’s a recipe for disaster.


– Rep. London Lamar, D-Memphis, on allowing gun owners to carry weapons in parks


Asked why he appealed, Lee’s spokesperson Elizabeth Johnson said only that the governor appreciates the attorney general’s “leadership to defend Tennessee’s gun laws and provide clarity for law enforcement personnel and citizens.”
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis backed the decision to appeal, saying the laws exist to help police protect people.
“If the lower court’s ruling is allowed to stand, it will tie the hands of police officers – even when they encounter someone with a loaded assault rifle parked outside a children’s park,” she said.
Lamar accused Republican lawmakers of pandering to the gun lobby and dismantling the state’s gun-carry permit requirements (which would include Lee).
The senator added that officers wouldn’t be able to question a person’s intent for carrying an assault rifle “until it’s too late.”
“That’s not freedom. That’s a recipe for disaster,” she said.
The hits keep coming
The congressional House Freedom Fund endorsed state Rep. Jody Barrett in the 7th District special election set for Oct. 7 and is pouring a big chunk of cash into ads backing him for the post, the Tennessee Journal reports.
A Facebook post by the group says he’s the first elected official in the state to earn a 100% conservative rating on the Tennessee Legislative Report Card, a group backed by Williamson County-based Tennessee Stands and its leader, Senate candidate Gary Humble.
The House Freedom Fund, a political action committee
Barrett, a Dickson Republican, also signed Fritts’ letter to the attorney general questioning the gun-ruling appeal.
Also this week, Matt Van Epps, the state’s former General Services commissioner, got a lift from the Patriot Fund with an independent expenditure of nearly $28,500, according to the report.
On the Democratic front, state Rep. Gloria Johnson, one of the infamous “Tennessee Three,” endorsed Rep. Vincent Dixie in the 7th District race, saying she agrees with his focus on families.
This will be sure to win friends in the House Democratic Caucus, as two of Dixie’s colleagues — Reps. Aftyn Behn and Bo Mitchell of Nashville — are also running.
Head of the class?
Tennessee is leading the nation – again – with a bill requiring mass shooters to be tested for psychotropic and gender-altering drugs to see whether those might cause them to go on a violent spree such as the Covenant Schools shooting in Nashville.
The bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Rusty Crowe of Bristol and Rep. Mary Littleton of Dickson requires autopsy results on shooters to be sent to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center for studies on how the substances interact and whether they cause violent behavior.
“People often ask why these mass shootings were so rare decades ago,” Crowe said in a release. “We know the widespread use of powerful psychotropic drugs began around the same time we saw a rise in these horrific attacks, and it’s important to look into possible links. This law is about getting the data we need to protect our communities.”
Sounds almost like they’re trying to make transgender people the scapegoat for shootings. 
Then again, will they look for root causes in the legislature to inane bills and comments such as outlawing chemtrails, lynching people and encouraging first-cousin marriage?
“Alligator lizards in the air, in the air.”*

Credit: (Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)A New Orleans law aimed at boosting disaster planning at certain senior housing facilities has mixed results four years after the hurricane that prompted it.
 
This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Verite News and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.

Passed about two months after Hurricane Ida struck New Orleans in late August 2021, the law requires the dozens of independent living facilities in the city to obtain an annual license, develop emergency plans and coordinate disaster responses with city officials. During the extended citywide blackout after Ida, many of these facilities were abandoned by staff, forcing residents to fend for themselves in darkness and broiling heat. At least eight people died from excessive heat and other health issues at the city’s independent living facilities in the days after the storm.
Unlike nursing homes and assisted-living apartments, independent living facilities aren’t regulated by the state or required to have on-site staff or backup generators. Independent living facilities are generally more focused on socialization than on daily care or medical needs.
As of late last month, about a third of the 71 independent living facilities in New Orleans were still not in compliance with the law, according to city health department data. Sixteen of the  facilities that have yet to reach compliance submitted license applications that were approved, but no licenses were issued because the associated fees weren’t paid. Ten others submitted incomplete applications, according to the data, which was compiled by the department in late August.
It’s not a great compliance rate, but pretty good for New Orleans, which often takes a “wait-and-see attitude” toward disaster planning, said Howard Rodgers, executive director of the New Orleans Council on Aging, which provides social, educational and food services to the city’s elderly residents.
“It’s a step in the right direction,” he said. “But a lot of the responsibility for taking care of the seniors isn’t on the individuals running the independent living centers, it’s back on the seniors.”
After four years, anything less than 100% compliance is inexcusable, said Shirley Holmes, a senior housing resident whose husband died from health problems related to the post-Ida blackouts, which took 10 days to fix.
“They need to be held responsible and be in compliance,” she said. “Just telling somebody they need to do something isn’t enough. They’ll put it off as long as they can. It can take so long that it can be deadly.”

The health of Holmes’ husband, Walter, deteriorated after power was lost at the Oak Villa Apartments in Algiers, where they lived at the time. An inoperative elevator made it difficult for the couple to leave, and no staff were available to help them down the stairs from their second-floor apartment. Walter Holmes began rationing his oxygen and missed a scheduled medical treatment. As his breathing troubles worsened, an ambulance was called, but Walter couldn’t be revived at a hospital, where he was declared dead of heart failure.
The Oak Villa’s owner, real estate firm Latter & Blum, did not respond to requests for comment. The owners of several other independent living facilities either declined comment or did not respond. Shirley Holmes has since moved to a different apartment building.
Despite their more limited role with residents, independent living facilities should do more to plan and prepare for disasters, City Council members said in 2021.
“Many of the tenants were physically or financially unable to evacuate, and the owners and operators of the properties left them in inhumane conditions to fend for themselves,” then-Council member Kristin Gisleson Palmer said in 2021, shortly after the law was approved.

Facilities were slow to comply. In 2023, two years after the law was passed, most facilities were noncompliant. Last year, about a quarter of the facilities had not yet applied for licenses, according to the health department.
The threat of fines appears to have turned the tide somewhat, Rodgers said. In May 2024, the City Council approved new penalties for out-of-compliance facilities, including a $100-per-day fine during declared emergencies. The council also eased a requirement that facilities provide a list of all residents and on-site staff.
Last year, four fines were issued, according to the health department. Fines and related hearing costs totaled $1,350, with the largest single payment reaching $625. So far this year, a $1,000 fine with $125 for hearing costs was levied at a facility.
Rodgers said he would like to see the law strengthened, possibly with new requirements for backup generators and a mandated staff presence during disasters. He knows such measures would be costly for facilities, but he worries more lives will be lost when the next big storm comes.
“I know all that gets into profit margins,” he said. “But what we should be focused on is the best interests of our seniors.”

(Photo by Phillippe Gerber/Getty Images)The Keystone Exams were designed with two commendable goals: to establish a consistent statewide graduation standard and to serve as an accountability measure for high schools in preparing students for postsecondary success.
The exams were intended to become a graduation requirement by 2017.
Enacted in 2010, state legislation authorized the creation of ten end-of-course assessments; however, to date, only three Keystone Exams have been fully developed: Algebra I , Biology, and Literature.
The Keystone graduation requirement was indefinitely postponed in 2023, and students are now able to demonstrate their postsecondary preparedness and meet statewide requirements through one of five Pathways to Graduation. This has provided school districts with needed flexibility and recognizes diverse measures of achievement.
While the original intent of the Keystone Exams remains a commendable goal, it is increasingly clear they are no longer serving Pennsylvania students in a meaningful or equitable way. The time has come to reevaluate how we assess student readiness and school performance.
A careful evaluation of all our options for assessing student learning and performance is needed to make sure we are picking the right tools. That could mean ultimately moving to a widely recognized college entrance assessment such as the SAT or ACT. These exams focus on core reading and math competencies that are critical for both college and career readiness. Similar pathways have been successfully used by neighboring states for several years.
The SAT and ACT are already taken by thousands of Pennsylvania high school students and provide valuable feedback and opportunities for college admission. They also provide school districts with timely and actionable data.
This transition also presents a fiscally responsible path forward. Utilizing a single, nationally normed college entrance exam, rather than spending additional monies developing and maintaining the current Keystone, could reduce the burden on schools, free up valuable instructional time, and lessen the financial burden on families — many of whom currently pay out-of-pocket for these exams.
In the Pennsbury School District, we have successfully administered the PSAT and Pre-ACT during the regular school day for several years. Expanding this approach to include the SAT and PSAT would be a seamless transition. Shifting to these assessments would help streamline our overall testing strategy, minimize duplicative exams, reduce assessment-related stress for students, and likely reclaim valuable instructional time currently devoted to Keystone administration.
Most importantly, it would broaden access to college pathways for all students by integrating meaningful, nationally recognized assessments into the school experience.
It’s time to move away from the Keystone Exams and adopt an assessment system that better reflects the needs, aspirations, and realities of today’s students.

This story discusses suicide.  If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please call or text the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.
Even though callers have lost access to a line dedicated to support the LGBTQ+ community, the director of a 988 crisis line in Kentucky says “help is still there.”
Geneva Robinson, director of the Crisis and Information Center for Seven Counties Services, told the Louisville Metro Board of Health on Wednesday that the loss of the LBGTQ+ option “doesn’t mean that services aren’t there.” 
Until recently callers to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline could press 3 to be connected with staff specially trained to help LGBTQ+ callers who are negotiating mental health issues, KFF Health News reports. But the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced this summer that the dedicated line was being eliminated. 
A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget told NBC News that the administration would no longer “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.” 
The Trevor Project reports the LGBTQ+community is at heightened risk of depression, with 45% of LGBTQ+ youth having seriously contemplated ending their lives at the time they were surveyed by the organization. 
Meet some of the Kentuckians answering 988

In Louisville, Robinson said 988 staff are trained to respond to concerns from all callers.
“All of our people who provide the services have specialized training, not only in crisis intervention generalist techniques, but cultural competency training and specific training to work with groups like those who present with issues related to LGBTQ areas,” she said. “So, people can still get that help that they need. They just don’t have, unfortunately, that dedicated line any longer to reach that help. But the help is still there.” 
The 988 system, launched by the federal government in 2022,  is a national network of more than 200 crisis centers that field calls, texts and chats. 
Seven Counties Services answered nearly 13,000 calls to the 988 line in the 2024-2025 fiscal year, Robinson said. In addition to Jefferson County, the agency serves Bullitt, Henry, Jefferson, Oldham, Shelby, Spencer  and Trimble counties. 
About 9,000 of those calls —70% — were from Louisville. That’s an average of about 173 local calls a week to the 988 line, which launched in July 2022, replacing a 10-digit number. The number is a mental health version of 911.
Other at-risk communities should feel safe to call when they need help and know that they’ll receive it confidentially, Robinson said. 
“There are a lot of folks in our community, particularly those who who are traditionally in disadvantaged groups or disenfranchised groups, who may not feel comfortable reaching out for help, who, for a lot of different reasons, may feel that they can’t trust calling into any line or going anywhere to receive services,” Robinson said. 
She referred specifically to undocumented immigrants, who have been the target of crackdowns from the Trump administration. 
“I’m thinking about a lot of folks who might be in this country undocumented, or might have family members or friends who are undocumented, and right now they’re very concerned that if they reach out for help — even medical help they might need — that it might result in deportation, it might result in being arrested, being taken away from their family, or having a family member taken away,” Robinson said. 
But, she stressed that 988 calls are confidential and anonymous. The only time a 988 operator would check caller identification is in the case of an imminent risk to life, Robinson said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado is one of the healthiest states in the country, but health isn’t determined by lifestyle choices alone. Our well-being is deeply influenced by the air we breathe, the water we drink and the environment we live in.
Too many Coloradans suffer the health impacts of pollution that are outside their control, especially children with asthma, seniors with respiratory issues and low-income communities near highways and industrial polluters. Despite this reality, U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans voted for a federal spending bill that cuts critical investments proven to reduce pollution and protect public health.
As a physician, I see these impacts up close in my patients every day. Poor air quality affects my patients even before they are born, impacting fetal lung development and resulting in an increase in premature births. When air quality is poor, I know that there will be more children in my clinic struggling to breathe from asthma. And despite living in beautiful Colorado, I have to tell kids it is not safe to play outside. We have a responsibility, as a community and a state, to make choices that create a clean and healthy environment for everyone.

The science is clear: The dirty fossil fuels we burn release pollutants and greenhouse gases that are endangering our health, especially in frontline communities living along highway corridors and around oil and gas operations, refineries and other polluting industries. According to the American Lung Association’s State of the Air report, 80% of Coloradans live in communities with unhealthy air.
Air pollution is one of the most dangerous threats to public health, more than high blood pressure, smoking or diabetes. It’s strongly linked to heart attacks, strokes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and even dementia.
Over the past 20 years, Colorado has led the way in reducing emissions and cleaning up our air. We’ve closed coal plants, expanded wind and solar energy, regulated methane emissions and been among the top states in the adoption of electric vehicles. We’ve installed electric vehicle chargers, bought electric school buses and strengthened building efficiency standards. These steps aren’t just good for the planet — they’re good for our lungs, our hearts and our families.
Until January, we had a strong partner in the federal government, and Colorado received hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy and climate-related projects from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Now, Congress has passed a spending bill that not only eliminates the clean energy investments protecting our health, but takes away health care from the communities most impacted by higher levels of pollution. Evans helped make that happen. He had the chance to stand up for his constituents’ health; instead, he voted for legislation that puts Colorado communities at greater risk of pollution, illness and economic instability.
This summer, as ozone season worsens and more Coloradans are warned to stay inside, it’s important to remember that by cleaning up our air and cutting pollution, we make our communities healthier. One study predicted that national IRA investments in greenhouse gas reduction could, by 2050, prevent nearly 1 million asthma attacks, 41,000 heart attacks and 19,000 hospital admissions — a total of more than 3 million lost workdays and 33,000 deaths. Those are real lives saved by the kind of clean energy policies Evans just voted to dismantle.
Every Coloradan will benefit from cleaner, healthier energy. But let’s especially remember those disproportionately affected: children, pregnant individuals, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, communities of color, people in historically redlined neighborhoods, and communities near highways, power plants or industrial facilities. No matter the individual health choices they make, they bear the burden, or will reap the benefits, of the choices we make together.
Clean energy is preventive medicine. Let’s prescribe more of it — and demand that our leaders prioritize it, too.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)For many Kentuckians, the American dream feels harder to reach than ever. Homeownership, once a reasonable goal for young families in Bowling Green or Lexington, now feels like a fantasy. Farmers in Western Kentucky see the cost of new equipment loans edging out of reach. Rising grocery prices leave families in Louisville and Lancaster alike wondering how much further their paychecks can stretch.
Kentuckians may not see the inner maneuverings of Washington every day, but when political leaders bend economic levers to reward allies or punish critics, it is our wallets, our homes and our farms that will feel the impact first.
Friedrich Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist whose “The Road to Serfdom” remains a libertarian benchmark, warned nearly 80 years ago about exactly this danger: When political leaders turn economic life into a tool of power, ordinary citizens pay the price. The point of his book was not simply about socialism, as it is often miscast, but about the concentration of power where calculating and capricious rulers bend economic institutions to their own ends.
That is what we are seeing today. President Donald Trump’s attempted firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has little to do with mortgage paperwork and everything to do with Trump’s ongoing campaign to weaponize the federal government against anyone deemed insufficiently loyal.
In this case, it happens to be the first Black woman to serve in one of the most powerful economic institutions in the world. 
Should Kentuckians care? Absolutely. Because when the independence of the Federal Reserve is compromised, it’s not Wall Street bankers who suffer first; the first to suffer are the families at the local Kroger, the borrowers at the local credit union and the farmers depending on affordable credit to plant next year’s crop.
The authoritarian playbook
This is not an isolated event. Sen. Adam Schiff, Attorney General Letitia James, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and national security adviser John Bolton have all faced Trump’s ire for the same reason: they dared to dissent. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman recently summed up the lesson of these attacks succinctly: “If you get in our way, we will ruin your lives.”
Hayek, who witnessed authoritarian regimes consolidate power in pre-WWII Europe before immigrating to England and then the United States, would instantly recognize the pattern. Authoritarians don’t necessarily just jail their opponents in remote prisons using secret police; they make professional life, business opportunity and financial security contingent on political loyalty. They turn independent institutions like the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission into instruments of fear.  And fear, once entrenched, corrodes faith in the institutional independence of these vital institutions that help sustain both democracy and prosperity.

Why the Federal Reserve matters to Kentucky
The Federal Reserve is not some distant, abstract body. It sets interest rates that shape mortgage costs in Pikeville, farm loans in Murray and small business credit in Louisa. It regulates banks throughout our commonwealth and works to keep the financial system sound. If its independence collapses under political pressure, Kentuckians will feel the impact long before anyone on Wall Street.
Trump has already said he wants interest rates kept low to bolster the stock market. If Fed governors fear that defying him could lead to public smears, firings or investigations, they won’t act on sound judgment — they’ll act out of fear. That turns monetary policy from a tool of stability into a tool of political convenience. 
Look no further than Turkey under Erdoğan or Venezuela under Maduro today for examples of economic chaos following politicians who strong-armed central banks. Imagine banks judged not by their solvency but by their willingness to please the White House. Imagine monetary policy dictated not by data but by fear of retribution. That’s not free enterprise. That is Hayek’s warning realized: a road to serfdom paved with crony capitalism and authoritarian intimidation.
Freedom through fear is no freedom
We should be clear about what’s at stake. This is not just about Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve or any other independent institutions on the president’s “nasty list:” It’s about whether ordinary Kentuckians can rely on a financial system that operates fairly and independently, or whether mortgages, loans and credit become rewards or punishments in the hands of political leaders. 
If political power can reach into your mortgage application, your student loans, your tax filings or your professional record to punish you for speaking your mind, then freedom becomes a front, nothing but a weak façade to mask authoritarianism. This is how authoritarianism works — not always with gulags and barbed wire, but with threats, ruined reputations and the constant fear of being next.

Hayek ended “The Road to Serfdom” with a plea: Resist the temptation to let leaders amass unchecked power over economic life.
That plea is ours to hear again. The independence of the Federal Reserve may seem like an abstract battle in Washington, but it directly affects the mortgages Kentuckians pay, the farm loans that keep fields planted and the small-business credit that keeps Main Street stores across Kentucky open. Protecting that independence is nothing less than protecting the economic freedom of every family and entrepreneur in the commonwealth.

If Trump succeeds in strongly bending the Fed to his will, Kentuckians should expect not prosperity but instability with an economy ruled by favoritism, fear, and the hollow promise that what serves the loyal and the powerful will somehow trickle down to the rest of us.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)On Friday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port, otherwise known as the Fairwinds Landing renovation project in Virginia’s Hampton Roads region, would have its over $39 million in federal funding withdrawn. Work has already begun on that project. He also announced the termination of $20 million for the Portsmouth Marine Terminal (PMT) Offshore Wind Development Project, which has already been spent.
“Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Duffy said in the announcement. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry.” 
It is not clear how much of that funding for the Fairwinds Landing project has been spent already and how much would have to be returned to the federal government. A representative for the Norfolk Economic Development Authority said they have supported the effort to request for reconsideration on the cut. They also said the project will positively support the local economy and the U.S. Navy’s shipbuilding needs.
“Our revised project scope of work, which was submitted to the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) in mid-August in response to their request, will help restore America’s maritime dominance by focusing on rebuilding America’s shipbuilding and maritime industrial base in line with MARAD’s current priorities. We look forward to working with MARAD to utilize the (Port Infrastructure Development Program) funds at Fairwinds to address critical port upgrades that support its goals,” Mia Byrd Wilson, a spokeswoman for the Norfolk Department of Economic Development said.
The PMT project was billed as an effort to upgrade the terminal to be a staging area for offshore wind infrastructure buildouts, such as the nearly $11 billion Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project that is over halfway completed. The overall PMT project cost $223 million and was completed in March. The federal funds had been awarded in 2022.
“The Port of Virginia has completed the improvements made to Portsmouth Marine Terminal and as a result, the deep-water terminal is fully-functional, ” Port of Virginia spokesman Joseph Harris said. “The federal government’s Port Infrastructure Development Program grant was integral to the success of this project because funds from that program helped offset some of the improvement costs. The PMT project was delivered on-time and on-budget, thus this port has no unobligated federal funds.”
The Dominion project did not have any federal grants, John Larson with Dominion said in the meeting. With the PMT renovations already finished to allow for the staging of pylons for the wind turbines, the project should continue as planned. The 2.6 gigawatt offshore wind project is anticipated to come online in 2026.
“You know, we’re continuing to move forward and focus on the project,” Larson said. “If you look at the president’s comments, he stated that, you know, companies that were doing well with their projects, that were far along, they’re going to take hard reviews. What does that mean?”
At a September 3 meeting, the Virginia Offshore Wind Authority discussed continuing to promote offshore wind projects, despite their newfound unpopularity on the federal level. With Virginia facing an energy crisis, the board said that an “all of the above” approach needs to include offshore wind as part of the puzzle of addressing the state’s needs.
“The political reality is that we need all of them because based on who’s in office, energy projects change. Right now, SMRs and gas are popular, who knows? Next year, it can be back to renewables. We need to be developing all of it,” Virginia Maritime Association Senior Vice President Will Fediw said in the meeting.
Virginia’s federal lawmakers are also weighing in. Democratic Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, along with U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, said the efforts to withdraw funds from the Norfolk project are reckless and impact more than just offshore wind projects, as the funds for the port would have improved the port overall, including for shipbuilding, an industry critical to the nation’s economic and defense sectors.
“If the Administration took the time to learn about the project, it would realize that it is about investing in maritime supply chains and port infrastructure to support not only clean energy but also shipbuilding and ship repair. Stopping this project makes no sense, hurts our economy, and is completely counterproductive to the Administration’s so-called efforts to ‘restore America’s maritime dominance,’” the delegation said in a joint statement. “We will be working with our colleagues in Congress, state officials, and partners in the region to urge the Trump Administration to reverse its decision.”

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. 
 Hundreds of red flag orders used in Hampton Roads

A Virginia law that allows law enforcement to temporarily take someone’s guns if there is evidence that they could hurt themselves or others was used at least 379 times in the Hampton Roads region over the past five years, a local television station’s FOIA requests revealed in late August.
In 2020, Virginia passed the law, known as the red flag law or the Substantial Risk Order law, in an effort to address gun violence. At the time, Democrats controlled the General Assembly and held the governor’s mansion.
According to the records request made by 13News Now, the city of Hampton had the highest number of orders per person, at 169. 
Virginia Beach followed with 58 orders, and Chesapeake and Newport News each had 35. 13News also learned that in York County, 25 red flag orders have been issued since 2020. 
Further investigation by the station found that the measure’s intervention “may not guarantee a peaceful resolution in the end.”
In 2024, Dana Plummer kidnapped his three children from their Virginia Beach home after stabbing their mother, before leading police on a cross-state chase. Records revealed that Plummer surrendered several weapons, including a shotgun, to Virginia Beach police under a red flag order before the abduction.
Officers assessed that Plummer “seemed to be going through a crisis” and a judge later found that he was not “mentally fit” to stand trial.



The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings. 


 Court denies attorney fees in Augusta County closed meeting case

The Virginia Court of Appeals denied $20,000 in attorney fees to Breaking Through Media LLC, which attempted to obtain a secret recording from a county Board of Supervisors’ closed session.
Closed meetings are generally not recorded because they are exempt from the state’s open meeting requirements. The recording was allegedly made by one of the supervisors. 
According to a report by the News Leader, Breaking Through Media LLC and Samuel Orlando sued Augusta County to obtain the March 20, 2023 recording, arguing that the locality violated the state’s open meeting law.
Ultimately, the board successfully appealed to keep the records sealed because the court found that releasing them could violate the privacy of a county employee.
However, in an appeal to collect $21,632.45 in attorney fees, the appeals court upheld the August County Circuit Court’s decision in denying the attorney fees. Records show the circuit court denied the request because Breaking Through failed to prove the fees were fair and they didn’t win enough in their case.
“This court finds that the main object of appellants’ petition was to obtain documents requested under VFOIA that they believed the county wrongfully withheld,” reads the opinion written by Judge Vernida R. Chaney on Aug. 26. “Because appellants failed to obtain this recording, they did not obtain the object of their suit. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellants were not entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs.”
News Leader reported that Breaking Through has not posted anything on Facebook since June 1, and links on its posts no longer link to an active website. Breaking Through’s last video report was uploaded to the site’s YouTube page three months ago.
 Governor hopeful cites ‘working papers’ to rebuff schedule request

The office of Virginia’s Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears, the Republican nominee for governor, has withheld several records as “working papers,” according to a recent investigation by VPM News.
The finding comes after the media outlet asked Sears about her role in Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, and made a records request for her schedule — a record that is required by law to be maintained and permanently held. Public scrutiny of Earle-Sears has mounted since she became the nominee to succeed Youngkin against her opponent, former Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger.
“I’m not going to divulge what we talk about. But remember that I’m a former legislator as well, and I understand the legislative process,” Sears said to VPM, as reported August 20. “We’ve talked about some things, and I’m just going to leave it at that. I’ve given him advice on certain things … we just have things that we’ve discussed on how to move certain things and how certain things will move.”
In response to the schedule request, the office produced a “largely-blank, 297-page PDF” that excluded records, citing the exemption covering “confidential correspondence and working papers of the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.” The released documents also did not include events that Earle-Sears’ office had previously released to the public.
VPM filed another request, clarifying and broadening the original request, but reported that the office did not respond within the required time period under Virginia law — an initial five business days, with the option to invoke a seven-day extension, which Earle-Sears’ office did, according to VPM.
The office reiterated its earlier response to VPM, and noted that it does not maintain records for Earle-Sears’ roles as president of the state Senate or on boards and commissions.
“We remain committed to transparency and accountability in government, but must also adhere to statutory provisions in place to safeguard information of a sensitive nature,” the office wrote in the response.
 Richmond tells WTVR free report would cost $700

The city of Richmond told WTVR a redacted copy of the consultant report on the aftermath of the city’s May boil advisory would cost $700. Instead, WTVR acquired the same report at no cost from the Virginia Department of Health.
State law allows government agencies to make reasonable charges for searching and supplying public records, or to waive those charges. WTVR faced a charge $87 to $93 per hour for senior public utility leaders to review the records and “cross-reference best practice regulations and homeland security requirements to determine appropriate redactions,” the TV station reported.
WTVR made the request after widespread attention and concerns about the city’s water treatment plant, which serves the city and its neighboring counties. The May water advisory follows the water crisis in January, which left residents without drinking water for days and delayed the return of the General Assembly, and a fluoride exceedance in April.
When asked whether $700 was a reasonable charge to provide an 18-page report, spokesperson Rhonda Johnson from the city’s Department of Public Utilities (DPU) told the station “the $700 value provided was estimated based on the time required to complete this request by the city at the time of the request.”
The report found that while data supported DPU’s coagulation process as effective, there were several ways in which it could be improved, according to WTVR. The coagulation process removes ​​suspended impurities from water.
WTVR said the report noted that “current procedures for operating the filters during normal flow and backwash are not optimized provide for increased filter efficiency or operational flexibility in response to adverse water quality conditions” and that “coagulation control at the [plant] has the ability to be improved upon through” enhanced water treatment and monitoring.
The report stated the city should implement more testing and sampling to determine the optimal coagulant dosing. It also recommended providing “additional operational oversight leading up to and during events that have the potential to lead to adverse raw water quality conditions.”
WTVR said it requested an interview with a DPU leader, but no one was available.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohioans could soon be able to sign up for programs that reduce their energy bills in exchange for allowing the utility to dial back their consumption. These demand response programs already exist for big energy consumers like factories, but state Rep. Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, thinks residential consumers should have the opportunity as well.
“This is one more tool in the toolbox that gives the distribution folks, the ability to manage the power so those that need it the most — and you can put whatever you want in there — that they are never without power,” he said.
In a press release describing the measure, House Bill 427, Klopfenstein offers a few examples. Utilities might roll back your smart thermostat on a really hot day, or cycle home appliances like your water heater.
Klopfenstein’s measure doesn’t specify the exact terms of a program. Instead, it directs state regulators to consider proposals from utilities so long as the programs are voluntary and open to everyone. It also requires that customers can override the power reductions. The Public Utility Commission of Ohio gets tasked with weighing whether programs are cost-effective for consumers and offer long-term savings to the energy grid.

Many states offer demand response programs for residential customers, with varying incentive or rebate structures. In California, for instance, PG&E’s Power Saver Rewards Program notifies customers that demand is high and then gives them a dollar per kWh of power they save.
“My rural cooperative has had a radio control on my electric hot water heater probably for 40 years,” Klopfenstein said. “This gives them the ability to shut the hot water heater off to limit demand during peak times. And in 40 years, I have never recognized when it was shut off.”
Although he got paid up-front to participate, Klopfenstein said he doesn’t get a monthly incentive on his bill. Because he gets power through a co-op, though, he said the better they manage demand the lower his bills are overall.
“Now, I will tell you what I believe consumers will want today, they’re going to want to be rewarded probably more than I am — and that’s OK.” Klopfenstein said. “Somewhere in there there’s a balance, but we need to give them a tool to manage the power distribution.”
Supply and demand
Klopfenstein sponsored a sweeping energy measure known as House Bill 15 earlier this year. That measure aimed to encourage new energy generation by offering tax incentives to new facilities and streamlining the regulatory process. The bill also ended a controversial coal plant bailout tied to the House Bill 6 scandal.
Notably, that bill got broad bipartisan support and Rob Kelter, managing attorney with the Environmental Law & Policy Center, sees Klopfenstein’s newest proposal as a continuation.
“Good energy policy manages both supply and demand. Ohio lawmakers took measures in HB 15 to increase supply, and we commend Rep. Klopfenstein and Chair (Rep. Adam) Holmes for moving quickly to lower demand,” Kelter said. “Republicans and Democrats worked together on HB 15, and we know there will be similar cooperation here.”
In a press release, the Environmental Law & Policy Center estimates residential demand response could “create estimated net savings of between $34.5 million and $104 million for the utility system, depending on participation rate.” The group added that companies can roll out programs to reduce demand far faster than they can increase supply by standing up new power plants — even with HB 15 greasing the skids.
Klopfenstein explained residential demand response almost made it into HB 15 itself. But it showed up as an amendment late in the process, and lawmakers stripped it out so they could debate it further.
Still, the idea appears to have supporters on both sides of the aisle. Nolan Rutschilling from the Ohio Environmental Council said demand response is “crucial to addressing skyrocketing energy costs.”
“This legislation allows utilities and retail energy providers to establish programs that save customers money, reduce strain on our electric grid, and create more capacity in the PJM market, lessening the burden on all energy customers,” he added.
Ohio Conservative Energy Forum Executive Director Shayna Fritz said, “providing demand response solutions will ensure we are helping our energy remain reliable during peak times. We worked with Ohio lawmakers on critical energy legislation such as House Bill 15 and look forward to working with them again to develop the best solutions for all residents.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending law will likely force more than half the states to reduce payments to doctors and hospitals that treat Medicaid patients, a change critics warn will be particularly harmful to rural hospitals struggling to stay afloat.
Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for low-income people, reimburses doctors, hospitals and nursing facilities for treating enrollees. But in many cases, the program doesn’t fully cover the cost of care, straining providers that serve a large share of Medicaid patients.
To help providers cover losses and continue to serve poorer populations, the federal government allows the 41 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have contracted with Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) to run their Medicaid programs to direct them to pay providers more — in some cases, as much as commercial plans
Ultimately, taxpayers cover the costs of these so-called state directed payments — and those costs are growing. As of August 2024, the higher payments were projected to add $110.2 billion per year to Medicaid spending, nearly 60% more than the previous year’s projection.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

That higher spending attracted the attention of conservatives on Capitol Hill.
Beginning in 2028, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cap the payments, forcing state Medicaid programs to reduce reimbursement rates by 10 percentage points each year until they reach either 100% or 110% of what Medicare pays. States that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would be capped at the lower rate.
The new law will reduce Medicaid spending by $149 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and reduce Medicaid provider payments in as many as 31 states, according to KFF, a health policy research group. A separate analysis by The Commonwealth Fund, another research group, found that Medicaid payments to hospitals would drop by at least 20% in 19 of the 25 states that had publicly available data.
Critics say the change could be disastrous for hospitals, many of them in rural areas, that see a large share of Medicaid patients.
“This is all on top of an already pretty strained financial situation for rural hospitals,” Alexa McKinley Abel, director of government affairs and policy at the National Rural Health Association, a group representing rural health care providers, said in an interview. “We are worried about seeing service line closures at hospitals in an environment where OB-GYN and chemotherapy service lines are already being cut.”
Covering the cost of care
Supporters of the change say the extra payments inflate federal spending on the Medicaid program, giving hospitals “windfall profits.”
“Not only do these programs sidestep the truly needy on Medicaid and favor special interests instead, but all this is financed by growing the federal debt, leading to inflation and higher interest rates for all Americans,” the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative think tank that helped draft the bill, stated in a policy brief.
Hospital leaders dispute that. Earlier this year, the American Hospital Association asserted that without the extra payments, Medicaid managed care organizations in 2023 only covered about two-thirds of the actual cost of care.
GOP senators warn mega-bill’s new Medicaid cuts will hurt rural hospitals

Cindy Samuelson, senior vice president of the Kansas Hospital Association, said the additional payments are especially critical in a rural state such as Kansas, where some researchers have found that 87% of rural hospitals are in the red. Kansas is one of 10 states that did not expand Medicaid, and like other nonexpansion states, it will have to begin reducing direct payments to 110% of what Medicare pays starting in 2028.
“Over time, commercial payers are paying less and less,” Samuelson said. “Many hospitals in our state are at risk of closure.”
Samuelson said that in rural areas, health care providers see fewer patients, which makes it hard to spread out the cost of care and make up for losses that come from serving underinsured, Medicaid and Medicare patients. One result is that rural hospitals are trimming services. A report published this year by Chartis, a health care consulting firm, found that between 2011 and 2023, nearly 300 rural hospitals across the country stopped offering obstetrics care, and 424 rural hospitals ceased chemotherapy services.
In Hutchinson, Kansas, Benjamin Anderson, CEO of the rural and community-owned Hutchinson Regional Health System, said his hospital barely broke even this year, and lower Medicaid payments will take a toll. The 190-bed hospital serves more than 65,000 people in the central Kansas region, and sees a lot of patients who are struggling with mental health issues and substance use disorders.










When we think about the cuts to Medicaid, it isn't simply about cutting services to the poor. It's threatening services to everyone.


– Benjamin Anderson, CEO of Hutchinson Regional Health System


“We are closely managing our workforce expenses. We’re going to be relying more heavily on philanthropy,” Anderson said, adding that the hospital wouldn’t lay off staff but would reduce the number of workers by not filling open positions.
He said his hospital has some cash reserves that should enable it to keep going, but that many other rural hospitals lack such a cushion.
“When we think about the cuts to Medicaid, it isn’t simply about cutting services to the poor. It’s threatening services to everyone, because in a rural community, we all get care in the same place,” he said. “If we cut out the safety net that’s sustaining these hospitals, everyone’s health care is threatened.”
Searching for answers
Three hours northeast of Hutchinson is the rural town of Holton, where about 3,400 people live. Holton Community Hospital is a 14-bed critical access hospital, meaning that it provides emergency care around the clock for a rural community. For the past two years, it has been struggling, according to Carrie Lutz, the hospital’s CEO.
Lutz said the hospital is not part of a broader health care group, and it relies on philanthropy and local taxes. Due to financial strains, it’s in the process of selling off its home and hospice services to another health care facility. The cap on extra payments will be an additional barrier, she said.
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

Samuelson said Kansas is applying for money under the five-year, $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, which Congress added to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act amid concerns about its impact on rural hospitals. She expects Kansas to get at least $500 million between 2026 and 2030.
Rural hospitals in Mississippi also hope to tap into those funds. The Mississippi Hospital Association, which is advising state leaders on their application, said it expects Mississippi to get at least $500 million over the next five years.
Like Kansas, Mississippi did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care, a decision that deprived it of additional Medicaid patients and thus extra revenue.
“A few years ago, we had several rural hospitals that were facing some imminent closure challenges, and so our enhanced supplemental payment based on the average commercial rate has been a lifeline,” said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“What we’re concerned about is that when those payments start to decrease, then we’re going to be right back to where we were in 2022, with concerns about rural hospitals again.”
Roberson said Medicaid, with the additional payments, had become “one of the best payers, if not the best payer, for our hospitals over the last two years,” and helped a lot of hospitals stay out of the red.
He said the new rural health care fund is promising, but noted that Mississippi will decide where to spend any money it gets, and some rural hospitals might miss out.
“We want to make sure we’re working with the state to provide sustainable solutions, not one-time fixes,” Roberson said. “The big wild card is the Rural Health Transformation fund and what the state chooses to do with that money.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine isn’t considering sending National Guard troops to Chicago amid the Trump administration’s newest plan to mobilize the military — but that could change once he gets the request, his team said.
In a recent press conference, President Donald Trump told reporters that Chicago was a “hellhole.”
“Well, we’re going in,” Trump said. “I didn’t say when we’re going in.”
At least eight people were killed and 58 others were injured in shootings over Labor Day weekend, Chicago police said. The violence is the reason why Trump, despite already threatening to come to the city, made his decision.
“Look, I have an obligation,” he said. “This isn’t a political thing.”
Currently, more than 150 National Guard members from Ohio have been mobilized in Washington, D.C. for nearly two weeks.
“Their work has been, continues to be, guarding federal buildings and doing some patrols,” DeWine said.


The Trump administration asked DeWine to deploy the troops, with Vice President JD Vance saying they will help reduce crime.
“The national capital of the most powerful nation in the history of the world had a murder every other day, carjackings, armed robberies that rival literal third-world countries,” Vance said at an event.
Violent crime is at a 30-year low, according to D.C. police. Recently, troops have been spotted cleaning up garbage and doing landscaping.
“To see those folks walking around with big trash bags on the National Mall, it’s just not the best use of those folks, and frankly, not the best use of taxpayer money,” veteran and lawyer Adam Miller said.
A Joint Task Force–District of Columbia spokesperson said Ohio troops haven’t been on trash patrol, though.
Miller rallied with about 30 other protestors when the troops first got to D.C., arguing to bring them home.
“Cancel this ill-considered, legally problematic and unwarranted mission,” he said.
And a federal judge agreed — at least for Trump’s deployment in Los Angeles. A California judge ruled that the president illegally sent troops in June to quell immigration protests, since federal law states that the military can’t be used for “domestic law enforcement” under the Posse Comitatus Act.
The judge ruled that Trump must stop using the military “to execute the laws, including but not limited to engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation or acting as informants” unless it meets the federal threshold.
“‘Does the mission in front of us meet the requirements of federal law and the state law that implements that law in our federal system?’ And if it doesn’t, then we don’t send our troops,” Miller said.


Trump’s team dismissed the ruling, and the president said that he actually helped California in curbing the anti-ICE protests.
DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney said that this ruling doesn’t have the same application in D.C., since Trump has more authority in the capital.
Tierney said they could not consider sending troops to other cities without seeing an order, and thus, aren’t considering it yet.
However, DeWine has repeatedly said that he approved the D.C. request because he tends to accept every ask, like he has done in the past for both Republican and Democratic leaders of other states during natural disasters or from mayors when there is civil unrest in Ohio cities.
“My decision to send the National Guard to Washington, D.C. is the same reason that I did to Columbus — made that available when the Columbus mayor wanted the guard — the same way with Cleveland,” the governor said.
The DC deployment will last 30 days, but the governor’s team said if Trump asks, he will extend.

Hundreds of business people, policy analysts, and conservative advocates filled a downtown Cleveland conference hall last week for the National Conservative Energy Summit. One major theme: the need for both the federal and local governments to remove increasingly high hurdles to building renewable energy.


“Conservatives can and should lead on energy,” said John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, in his opening remarks.


The group, which cohosted the program with the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum, has a mission ​“to champion secure, reliable, affordable, clean American energy.” Its goal of achieving American energy independence includes support for a range of technologies, including solar, wind, battery storage, hydrogen, biomass, and small modular nuclear reactors.


The Trump administration has taken a more single-minded approach to energy.


Since January, it has promoted more fossil-fuel use and stalled the retirement of aging power plants. At the same time, it has rescinded grants and loans for clean energy projects; eliminated tax credits for wind, solar, EVs, and home-energy upgrades; and even halted construction on some offshore wind projects.


“While it’s easy to view this as a roadblock, … it’s a signal that we have more work to do,” Szoka said. He encouraged attendees to use what they learned during the conference in their grassroots efforts to build support for clean energy, especially when faced with extremism and misinformation. ​“If we don’t explain what’s going on clearly, we risk losing the argument before it even starts.”


As President Donald Trump attacks clean energy at the federal level, some states like Colorado and Maine are pushing to speed up deployment. But in general, state and local laws that restrict renewable energy development are gaining steam nationwide. A June report by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University notes 16 states with laws limiting solar or wind, with over 450 counties and municipalities across more than 40 states imposing other restrictions.


Speaking at the conference, Jenifer French, chair of Ohio’s Power Siting Board and its Public Utilities Commission, noted that approximately 30 counties in the state ban solar or wind energy in all or parts of their territories, an authority granted to them by a 2021 law known as Senate Bill 52. The board or its staff have also determined solar and wind projects are not in the public interest in several cases where bans didn’t apply but where local governments unanimously opposed the proposals.


Asked for her advice to developers, French said, ​“I just think communicating with the local officials around the project is so helpful, and being part of that community and earning their trust is very effective.”


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCompanies often hear such suggestions, but ​“frankly, I think that’s used as a cop-out sometimes,” said Drew Christensen, senior director of public engagement at utility-scale developer Apex Clean Energy, during a later panel about how policies shape companies’ decisions.

No matter how many community meetings are held, some people will still fight projects, putting pressure on local officials who may not have expertise in energy issues, he noted.


The deference to local governments creates a slippery slope, said Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power, who also spoke on the panel. In her view, the states that pile on restrictive policies will not only see less investment from solar and wind developers, but will also discourage other industries from moving in.


Constraints on renewables also tread on landowners’ property rights, Stallings said, pointing out that in some cases a local government tells farmers not to use their land for solar but would have no problem with a housing development.


“What country do we live in when our government tells us what we can and can’t do?” Stallings said. The point resonated with various attendees from state chapters of the Land and Liberty Coalition, who made comments during networking breaks that property owners should be free to make their own economic decisions about their land.


Meanwhile, ​“this idea of behind-the-scenes picking winners and losers, that’s what’s going to create a reliability problem,” Stallings said. That risk is already visible: Late last month, the grid operator ISO New England warned of potential reliability issues from delaying Revolution Wind, a nearly finished offshore project that the Trump administration has halted for now.


This past spring, Ohio managed to pass bipartisan legislation that is expected to help the state build more energy — both renewable and fossil-fueled — in large part because the law doesn’t pick winners, according to state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood. House Bill 15 passed with unanimous support in the Ohio Senate and just two dissenting Republican votes in the House.


Speaking on a panel about the new law, Rader called it a big step but emphasized that the state still has barriers to getting additional renewable energy on the grid.
“We don’t need to incentivize it. In Ohio, we just need a level playing field,” he said.


For one thing, the Ohio Senate removed provisions from HB 15 that would have created a community solar pilot program. Two Republicans in the House have introduced a separate bill to revive a version of that measure.


Beyond that, the law left SB 52’s extra hurdles for solar and wind in place, along with property line setbacks for wind that were tripled by a last-minute addition to a 2014 budget law.


“We have put up a lot of barriers to different forms of power over the years,” said state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, who noted that added levels of government review compound uncertainty for developers. ​“I think the solution is removing those barriers.”

Board of Education National Historical Park in Topeka on May 18, 2024. (Cuyler Dunn for Kansas Reflector)A directive from the Trump administration has many worrying: What will happen during the next few weeks to the history on display at the five Kansas locations managed by the National Park Service?
The concern stems from a March executive order from President Donald Trump and a subsequent order from his director of the Interior, Doug Burgum. Brace yourself for vertigo if you read them both in one sitting. 
Trump and Burgum (or whoever wrote on their behalf) swirl legalese and political buzzwords into an Orwellian toxic stew: phrases like “any other measures” and “shall be implemented” mixed with “our extraordinary heritage” and “divisive narratives.”
The writing is half campaign press release, half authoritarian playbook — or perhaps I am being nostalgic by separating the two. 
In substance, the orders instruct federal workers to swiftly whitewash America’s past at its most significant historical locations. 
Most urgently, Burgum’s May 20 order requires park service employees to review properties for “inappropriate content” and potentially change “images, descriptions, depictions, messages, narratives or other information (content) that inappropriately disparages Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times).”
The bottom-line goal? To remove “any signs or other information that are negative about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features” by Sept. 17. 
The National Park Service seems all tied in knots. Its website offers a very unTrumpian line: “Some history hurts and some heals, but all of it can surprise and inspire us.”
A group of university librarians and data researchers aims to preserve these National Park Service signs. Using a website called Save Our Signs, the five project leaders are asking for digital photos documenting each park’s exhibits and signage, including here in Kansas. 
Visitors to national preserves, parks and sites are sending images to the website to compile a history that the federal government might soon alter. 
Locations that have been photographed appear as green dots on the “Save Our Signs” map, contrasting the gray un-photographed locations. 
Here in Kansas, three of the five National Park Service locations have not yet been documented at all. We can change those gray dots to green before the history itself gets changed. 
Save Our Signs does not yet have images for: 

Fort Larned National Historical Site 
Nicodemus National Historical Site
Fort Scott National Historical Site

Visitors have already uploaded 35 images from the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in Topeka and one image from Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve.
Time is running out for Kansans to turn all five locations into green dots. 
Call it hobbyist photography. Call it political activism. Call it your chore for the resistances. Regardless, we Kansans can get this done. 
Molly Blake, one of the university librarians who created the national database of images, said in an interview that Save Our Signs will publish the submitted images on Oct. 13. They will first confirm the images’ authenticity and also ensure the privacy of people who appear in the images. 
“Our goal is to preserve all the signs as they are right now, so that we have a record of them, and so members of the general public can see these signs that were created by taxpayer money, created by civil servants in the National Park Service with the intention of helping the public understand the historical significance of these sites,” Blake said.
The people who maintain the Save Our Signs website aren’t saying the signs are perfect, Blake said. 
“We know they were created over a number of years, and people might take pictures of a sign that maybe they have a critique about or think it doesn’t tell the full history,” Blake said. “We’re not asking people to pass judgment on the signs. We invite them to think critically about the signs.”
The focus has been on signage because at least one exhibit, according to the New York Times, already has been altered in Muir Woods National Monument in California.
Consider the folly of presenting American history in the halcyon way that Trump and Burgum describe. 
It would be nice to have a country built exclusively on the “greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people,” as Burgum instructs. Trump’s executive order targets any content that might “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (…) and instead focuses on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”
Blake sees the absurdity in these orders, and I agree. 
“We all know that actual American history encompasses everything that happened and how all communities experienced it,” Blake said. “And people have the right to access that information. I think something that’s especially insidious about the secretarial order is that there’s obviously no shared definition of what it means to be disparaging.”
This MAGA historical naivete has been exposed, particularly here in Kansas, where our National Park Service sites are significant because — not in spite of — of their contentious histories.
Yes, President Trump, the Brown v. Board of Education park is an uplifting testament to the grit and courage of Kansas school children. 
But it also doesn’t exist without violent, white American racism that kept Black children out of certain schools. At the Brown v. Board of Education park, the Trump-inspired makeover would need to be more extreme than removing a few signs. How can you create a museum that is wholly “solemn and uplifting” when it documents how Black school children were required to fight for their right to an equal education — an injustice that defined American life for hundreds of years, starting in the colonies?
Yes, the Nicodemus settlement in Kansas documents the Christian faith of Americans searching for and finding their “Promised Land.” But it also stands as living proof of formerly enslaved Black people migrating north, away from the Jim Crow laws of the South. The community of Nicodemus doesn’t exist without racist hostility of Reconstruction following the Civil War. 
And yes, Fort Larned documents the lives of 19th century American soldiers. But our government built Fort Larned to manage escalating conflicts with Native American tribes that U.S. Army muskets displaced. As the National Park Service’s own website says (for the moment, at least), forts like Larned were “a place where Army troops in the area fighting Indians could get supplies and rest.”
This violent, racist and aggressive past is our history, as Americans and Kansans. Chasing down signs won’t change that.
Scrubbing these Kansas sites until they are squeaky clean would effectively erase them. And vanishing these American stories certainly seems like the administration’s goal.
Instead of a simplified and censored history, our Kansas sites and their visitors deserve an honest, complicated American narrative — if only for the next few days.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC_0161-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-05 04:57:46.974467

Bernie Sanders at a Labor Day rally in Portland, Maine on Sept. 1, 2025. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins returned to Congress this week after a month-long recess. While she made few public appearances during her time in Maine, some of her constituents seized opportunities to hear directly from her Democratic challengers.
What do those Mainers want? Many told Maine Morning Star they’d like to be represented by someone rooted in the community. They also said they want specifics — unambiguous plans for how to restore programs dismantled during President Donald Trump’s second term so far and make life more affordable. Plans that are different from the Democratic establishment. 
Some are already convinced they’ll find that in Graham Platner, the oysterman and military veteran from Sullivan who is backed by unions. But many Mainers are undecided, using town halls and rallies to find out more about the Democrats vying for Collins’ seat.
That was the case for Alfred Beattie of Dresden, a socialist-leaning Democrat who was one of more than 6,5000 people to attend the Labor Day rally Platner spoke at with independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Kevin Oster of Portland, a Democrat who didn’t know anything about Jordan Wood, a progressive former congressional aide, when he attended his town hall in Portland on Aug. 27. 
Beattie, Oster and others said those events and other upcoming public forums offered by Senate candidates are providing them with the type of opportunity they’ve been wanting from their sitting senator — to speak directly with her. 
Oster has attended “Where’s Susan” town halls, empty chair events constituents have organized to air their concerns. Some Mainers decried the lack of accessibility at some of Collins’ few public appearances in Maine during the recess. 
Officials had to move a ribbon cutting she attended to celebrate the completion of Searsport’s downtown revitalization inside because nearly 200 protesters lined the streets, some holding signs advocating for Platner. Following inside, the protesters drowned out Collins’ comments with booing.

When the town manager tried to bring the focus back to celebrating the project completion, someone yelled, “She doesn’t have a town hall, which is why we’re here.” Some protesters later interrupted Collins’ visit to the Bath Area Food Bank.
Collins’ press secretary Blake Kernen said the disruptions underscored the response she gave in the spring when Maine Morning Star asked Collins about constituent criticisms of her not hosting town halls.
“She prefers smaller group meetings or Zooms, rather than holding town halls where very few people get to speak, and the level of civility is often not that high,” Kernan said then. 
But many of her challengers are relying on those very forums to garner support. 
This includes Wood, whose town hall in Portland was the tenth of his planned tour throughout all 16 counties, Platner, who has also begun a series of his own scheduled across the state, as well as several of the lesser-known challengers. (Read more about all of the candidates in our voter guide.)
The latest to enter the race, co-founder of Maine Beer Company Dan Kleban, said he plans to tour the state and, whether it be town halls or casual conversations in his tasting room, he said, “I think we just have to do a lot more listening and a lot less talking at people.” 
Here’s what that listening so far has revealed about how Mainers are assessing Collins’ challengers: 
Concrete plans
Abby Huntoon of South Portland told Wood at his Aug. 27 town hall at the University of Southern Maine that she liked what he stood for and what he was telling the roughly 75 attendees. “But,” she said, “I personally feel it’s really important to hear specific ideas. I mean, everybody says they want to change things.” 
“How you’re going to attack things — I think that’s what we all want to know,” Huntoon said. 
Wood went on to outline some of his platform, such as reevaluating the tax code, but other questions from attendees returned to this idea of wanting concrete plans, especially when it comes to how to rebuild the structures Trump has dismantled or packed with his loyalists.

For example, a Portland resident said she’s worried about the next nor’easter after the gutting of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, America’s disaster relief agency.
“I would like to see a plan,” she said, “because I just see an endless pile of corruption and garbage just being dumped on the state of Maine because we’re not cooperating.” 
Collins’ victory over Democrat Sara Gideon in 2020 underscored the importance of a viable challenger having clear plans for how they can help Maine, Jerzy Sylvester of Peaks Island said at Platner’s rally on Labor Day. 
“Gideon lost because her only campaign was that she was going to beat Susan Collins and didn’t talk anything about what she was going to do for Maine people,” Sylvester said. 
The 25-year-old unenrolled from the Democratic Party a few years ago because he wasn’t satisfied with the message or candidates being endorsed, arguing they haven’t represented or looked out for the average working person. That’s the pitch many in the 2026 race are making.
Feeling ‘real’
Several of Collins’ challengers are emphasizing their working-class roots, living the same affordability challenges as their would-be constituents, and trying to draw a contrast to Collins, a now-multi-millionaire who is approaching 30 years in Congress.
“Most of my 20s I didn’t have money to pay for health insurance,” Kleban said. “I remember pulling into a gas station on an empty tank of gas and putting gas in my car, a gallon or two at a time. I remember, after a hard day’s work on a construction site or painting houses, going home and having a loaf of bread in some Tabasco sauce and I called that dinner. I remember vividly. Those are things you don’t forget.” 
Wood, pointing out his parents who attended his Portland town hall, said his family lived mostly paycheck to paycheck growing up, with his mother having to stop working when he was young because of the cost of child care.  
“These issues are not abstract to me,” he said. “They’re lived experiences.”

At the recent rally, Platner similarly spoke about his own challenges trying to start a family in the current economy and seeing friends driven out of the state due to what he called an affordability crisis.
“Piecing it together has always been a part of life, working multiple jobs, seasonal jobs, this is not a new thing for us,” he said of Mainers. “But in the past few years, it’s really beginning to feel like hard work is not enough.” 
That appeal is working for some Mainers. 
Before Platner took the stage, Portland resident Ryan Lizanecz, a 27-year-old Democrat who previously served on the Portland Charter Commission, said he’s drawn to Platner because “he’s a regular guy.”
He’d been familiar with Wood, but Platner has stuck out to him most so far. “He seems very genuine to me,” Lizanecz said. “I like that he speaks very plainly about issues.” 
Another Democratic Portland resident, Anthony Emerson, 30, said Platner “feels real,” pointing to his background being the harbormaster of a small town. 
Emerson is already likely voting for Platner in the primary and appreciates that he echoed many of the points Sanders has been pushing for decades. He criticized Maine for having a “professional political class,” noting that the children of two of the state’s current members of Congress are running for governor.  
“Graham is outside of that, which is appealing,” he said.

The appeal of “realness” voters are after also extends to how they’re funding their campaigns. 
Wood said he won’t be taking any money from corporate PACs or lobbyists. He also refuses to engage in selling individual stocks and will prohibit his family members and those of his staff from lobbying his office for issues. But, South Portland resident Rosemary Reed said at his town hall she has concerns about Wood’s husband’s ties to Mothership Strategies, a controversial Democratic fundraising firm.
Meanwhile, Democrats are currently going after Collins in a digital ad campaign for not backing her Republican colleague’s bill to ban lawmakers, presidents and vice presidents from trading stocks. 
And, reporting from Rolling Stone this week revealed the leader of a major private equity firm gave millions of dollars to a PAC backing Collins right before she cast a vote to advance Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Collins’ office strenuously objected to the idea that the contribution influenced Collins’ decision, but Platner took to social media to say in response, “I’ll be a senator for people who can’t buy senators.”
A shift away from the establishment
Part of what draws voters to Platner in particular is his distance from the establishment. As Democrats in Washington, D.C., have been pressuring Maine Gov. Janet Mills to enter the race, unions and community groups scouted Platner. 
Emerson compared Platner to Zohran Mamdani, who recently won the primary for New York mayor, and John Fetterman, the plainspoken former steel town mayor — pointing to Platner’s detailed platform and him being unafraid to call Israel’s war in Gaza a genocide. There is also overlap in their staff. Some of the progressive strategists behind Platner’s campaign also worked for Mamdani and Fetterman.
Fetterman also came to mind when Sophie Creamer of Brunswick, a 25-year-old who is not enrolled with a party, first heard about Platner. However, Creamer’s connection was out of worry that Platner would in time walk back his more progressive stances, as Fetterman has done since Trump was re-elected.
“The only thing that convinced me that it wouldn’t be another Fetterman was the fact that he has tribal sovereignty and indigenous rights on his website,” Creamer said.

While other Democrats have distanced themselves from those types of decolonial policies, Platner has embraced them.  
“I think that it’s important to have a more progressive Democrat to continue to push the Democratic Party in a way that actually represents the people that it’s supposed to represent,” Creamer said. 
With Mills, the Democratic establishment’s pick, still undecided, all of the candidates in that field are distancing themselves from the establishment to some extent.  
When asked where he stands politically compared with Platner, who’s leaning into democratic socialist ideals, Kleban said in an interview with Maine Morning Star, “I don’t know what to call myself. I’m a small business owner. I’m a get-shit-done Democrat.” 
But he said the Democratic Party needs to get better at turning anger into action to win back voters who split tickets. 
“They’re not going to give us our vote unless we can convince them that we’ve got their back and we’re going to try to come up with pragmatic solutions,” he said. 
Wood joked to Maine Morning Star that he “doesn’t expect Chuck Schumer’s endorsement any day” and is not under an illusion that the establishment likes primaries. 
Similar to how he sees the lack of town halls as a reason for eroding public trust in democracy, Wood said, “this idea that we shouldn’t have primaries in an open process also I think has undermined democracy because this is how voters participate and make the decision on the candidate that they want to move forward.”

It would be a showstopper. Yet, students, faculty, and staff regularly pass by one another, energy drink in hand, without a second thought. 
How have we become so callous to consuming things not meant to be in our bodies, basically biological machines?
Unlike vehicles, we cannot easily repair broken parts or replace our biological machines. Though popular energy drinks are marketed as harmless performance enhancers, they pose serious health risks, which are often overlooked, especially by young consumers.
College students are attracted to the quick energy boost and performance enhancement promised by strategic marketing targeting adolescents. It’s easy to see why: juggling demanding schedules, late-night study sessions, and the pressures of newfound independence can make that extra kick seem like a lifesaver. 
But what’s often overlooked are the real health risks tied to these drinks. Energy drinks are linked to several health complications, including heart problems (irregular heartbeats and high blood pressure), mental health concerns (anxiety and sleep disturbances), and even an increased tendency to partake in risky behaviors. Yet, students often overlook or underestimate how severe the health risks really are. So, while students are investing tens of thousands of dollars into their education and chasing their dreams, they may also be unknowingly compromising their cognitive and behavioral performance due to their energy drink dependence.
Regular use of caffeinated energy drinks can also lead to caffeine dependency and withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches, irritability, and fatigue. This is especially concerning because adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these negative effects, with reports of seizures, mood disturbances, and even death in extreme cases.
Some argue that energy drinks are no different from coffee, but there are some key differences worth paying attention to. Sure, both have caffeine, but energy drinks often come packed with extra stimulants like guarana, taurine, and ginseng. These can actually make the effects of caffeine stronger and put more stress on the body. 
Recent research has raised concerns about ingredients like taurine, which may be linked to the growth of leukemia cells. And let’s not forget the sugar – the Centers for Disease Control reports that energy drinks can have up to 27 teaspoons of sugar in a single can. That kind of sugar load is tied to health problems like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and even dental issues. So, it’s not just a matter of swapping coffee for something stronger – there’s more lurking behind the boost energy drinks promise.
While other countries have taken steps to protect their youth –some banning energy drinks for anyone under 18, and one country currently banning sales for anyone under 21 — we continue to offer these addictive drinks to students with little to no regulation, even on campuses across Connecticut colleges and universities. We are turning our backs on our duty to safeguard the social and medical well-being of the next generation of changemakers.
As we encourage our future leaders to chase their dreams, we also have a moral obligation to arm them with the facts to make informed health choices. Energy drinks need clearer warning labels that highlight the real implications of consumption, including both short- and long-term health effects. Educational interventions targeted at adolescents must raise awareness about the risks students take when reaching for that quick boost.
Beyond education, we must address the underlying behaviors and pressures that drive energy drink overuse. This includes peer-led wellness programs, access to healthier alternatives, and stress-management resources that help students find sustainable ways to stay alert and focused without relying on high-caffeine stimulants.

Our mission is straightforward but urgent: to make poverty a focus of U.S. foreign policy and to advocate for smart, cost-effective legislation that saves lives and promotes long-term stability.
One of the persistent myths the organization encounters is that the U.S. spends a large portion of its budget on foreign aid. In reality, it’s less than 1%, a fraction that funds programs proven to prevent famine, combat disease, and stabilize regions at risk of conflict. These investments have ripple effects: they help create trading partners, reduce the root causes of forced migration, and make the world safer for U.S. citizens. In a time when global crises can impact us locally, from supply chain disruptions to public health threats, these programs are more vital than ever.
Food security is one of the most urgent pieces of this work. When families have reliable access to nutritious food, children can grow up healthy, adults can work productively, and communities  remain stable. Hunger drives instability, and when people are forced to make desperate choices for survival, the impact can be seen far beyond their borders.
Supporting programs that strengthen food systems ensures resilience against droughts, crop failures, and economic shocks, reducing both suffering and the risk of future crises. In fact, studies consistently show that every dollar invested in agricultural development yields multiple dollars in economic growth. Building stronger food systems abroad not only helps struggling families but also creates more reliable markets for American farmers and producers here at home. Food security is more than a moral issue; it is a foundation for stability, health, and shared prosperity.
Education is equally critical in breaking cycles of poverty. When children gain access to quality schooling, they are equipped with the knowledge and skills to contribute meaningfully to their communities. Education empowers young people to secure jobs, build businesses, and participate in civic life, creating ripple effects that last for generations. It also promotes gender equality, as educating girls has been shown to dramatically reduce child marriage, improve maternal health, and boost family incomes.
In societies where education is prioritized, conflict decreases and stability grows. Investing in classrooms, teachers, and learning materials is one of the most cost-effective ways to promote peace and economic growth worldwide. Every child who learns to read and write today has the potential to be a leader, a problem-solver, and a contributor to global progress tomorrow.
By elevating these issues — food security and education — we can demonstrate that small investments make a profound difference in creating a safer, healthier, and more prosperous world.

The same, 31% of Florida respondents, said they plan to seek employment in another state during the next hiring cycle.  
“The governor of Florida threatens at every turn to take funding away so administration at colleges don’t stand up to him or board of education.  I no longer have any motivation or creativity to make courses better,” a tenured professor at a public community college wrote.
The survey focused on policy affecting employment, including whether faculty would recommend working in their state to up-and-coming academics, and trends in applications for faculty positions. It included nearly 200 responses from Florida faculty among its nearly 4,000 responses across Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.
The survey concluded with an open-ended question asking faculty to provide examples of how “attacks on higher education are directly impacting your work.” It did not report respondents’ identities beyond basic demographics like gender, race, tenure status, years of experience, and type of institution they teach at. 
‘Walking on egg shells’
“Students report any classroom discussion they don’t like directly to the Governor’s office. Everyone is afraid all the time,” one woman teaching at a public four-year school wrote. “I have stopped teaching books that might be in any way controversial. I don’t open up general discussion in class but ask only direct questions that will elicit non-controversial answers. I need health insurance so I can’t just quit.”
The state scanning course materials for disfavored viewpoints was a widespread stressor for many faculty.
Florida DOGE to ‘deep dive’ into state universities, ‘prune’ ‘ideological study stuff’

“Most of the courses I’ve taught for decades now violate state and university mandates,” a man teaching at a Florida tier-one research university said. 
As of earlier this year, Florida institutions’ general education courses no longer contained “indoctrinating concepts,” State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues proclaimed in January.
Florida universities have conducted a review, required by a 2022 law, of general education courses to ensure that they do not “distort significant historical events or include a curriculum that teaches identity politics.” 
“I’m continually worried that the content of my clases [sic] will be flagged as “DEI” because I am a historian of the Caribbean, a region mostly populated by non-white people,” one professor said. 
One women’s studies professor described the effect as “Constant anxiety, walking on egg shells trying to anticipate what would be used against me/us.”
More than a third, 34%, of Florida respondents said administrators have questioned syllabi or curricula choices for their courses. Among all states surveyed, half as many, 17%, indicated administrators questioned their curricula. 
One professor said that since the state and federal government have made illegal “a wide range of Constitutionally protected components of speech and expression,” “I must break the law in order to tell the truth. Because I’m hired to tell the truth, and because I’m much more committed to the truth than to the law, I break the law. This means I am expecting to be arrested in front of a classroom any day, for actions that are illegal only as a result of the right-wing fad of the most recent decade.”
Nearly three in four, 71%, of faculty in Florida who were surveyed said they would not encourage a graduate student to seek employment in Florida. 
“I am going to take early retirement despite a great job and salary. The threats are real and I am exhausted, between fighting this and fighting AI and poorly prepared, lazy, unethical students,” a tenured professor at a four-year public university wrote. 
Higher education funding cuts have been the subject of nationwide political debate, including Florida State University reporting that it lost $100 million in federal grants, although $83 million of that has since been reinstated, the school’s president said last week.
About one-in-10, 11%, said they have had a federal contract ended by the Trump administration. 
“The loss of vital federal grants has removed opportunities from me and my colleagues,” one professor wrote. “Attacks on LGBTQ students, immigrants, and diversity have also made it difficult to recruit promising graduate students or to guarantee their health and safety. Florida colleges being forced to remove diversity languages has destroyed years of valuable work, overturned an incredible general education curriculum, taken power and governance away from faculty, and wasted a lot of valuable time.”

Tenure troubles
Since 2023, professors in Florida with tenure have been subject to post-tenure review, graded on standards crafted by university trustees relating to research performance, teaching, service, and compliance with state laws and university policies.  
Of the nearly-one-third who recently applied for an out-of-state job, tenure and DEI issues, academic freedom, the political climate, and cost of living were among the most common concerns.
Respondents said the number of applications for coworkers’ positions, as well as the quality of applicants, have decreased. 
“Our department is trying to improve, but we have had several failed searches in recent years because candidates don’t want to move to Florida because of the broad political climate and the fact that tenure protections functionally no longer exist here,” a tenured public university professor said. 
Some faculty said they have not experienced problems with “attacks on higher education,” one stating, “I haven’t felt any — Florida is great!.” Another said, “They’re not, and freedom in the classroom still persists, and I am at a public university in… wait for it… FLORIDA…” 
“I find that I’m having to spend more time explaining to students why they need to use evidence to support their views and why clear arguments are important,” a professor at a private institution wrote. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One professor complained that “our board of trustees stacked with heritage foundation members, our president was forced out and replaced by a republican politician.” Course materials face heightened scrutiny, this professor added. 
“The climate of persecution, retaliation, and ideological imposition makes it impossible to teach my discipline accurately or well without opening oneself to disciplinary measures,” that professor said. “While New College got a lot of headlines, similar invasions of public universities are happening with no national press, leaving those of us who work here isolated and vulnerable to attack.”
‘Academic freedom is on life support,’ say professors surveyed on tenure, censorship

Gov. Ron DeSantis orchestrated a shake-up of the University of West Florida Board of Trustees in a more conservative light earlier this year and that institution is now led by a former GOP lawmaker.
Results for the survey were collected throughout August and more than 60% of respondents said they are tenured. Last year’s iteration of the survey featured responses from about 350 Florida professors.
“There is a lower threshold of critical thinking because everyone is fearful about what is ‘allowed’ vs. ‘banned’ by law. The fear and the self-censorship is widespread. Our administration, now saddled with a governor-imposed, unqualified hire as a President, is understandably more cautious rather than vocal about protecting academic freedom,” one professor wrote.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump has clean energy in the crosshairs,Shannon Laun,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/05/trump-has-clean-energy-in-the-crosshairs/,"The Trump administration is making efforts in the northeast to replace job-producing, affordable solar and wind projects with price-volatile gas.","Fossil fuel companies and the Trump administration are dramatically ramping up efforts in the northeast to replace clean, job-producing, and affordable solar and wind projects with price-volatile gas from out of state. If they prevail, they’ll drive up our energy costs, harm our health, and throttle our opportunities for local economic development.
The Trump administration has our clean energy economy in its crosshairs. Federal agencies are on a mission to find new bureaucratic means of stopping clean energy projects that are already financed and under construction or fully permitted. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has been meeting with political leaders in the northeast to demand that they concede to new gas pipelines thatdo not have financial support and are unlikely to reduce energy costs
If the administration and the fossil fuel industry get their way, New England families and businesses could be stuck with expensive bills to pay for gas infrastructure and price-volatile gas for years after Zeldin and President Trump are long gone.
In Connecticut, Governor Lamont doesn’t seem to grasp that investing in new gas pipelines would be costly and shortsighted. While Lamont supports the state’s climate goals, he has cravenly agreed with Trump’s demand to expand gas pipelines in the region. Lamont claims he’s responding to high electricity rates, but new gas pipelines are not the answer. In fact, investors have been unwilling to finance new pipelines in the region because they’re not a viable investment and there are no buyers for long-term gas contracts.
What Zeldin and Lamont seem to forget is that New England has been here before. In 2016, the region rejected a similar push for new gas pipelines. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that it was not legal to charge electric customers for the high cost of a pipeline and the Maine utility regulator determined that the plan was not cost-effective, those plans fell like a house of cards.
What Lamont is really doing is bowing to pressure from Trump and the fossil fuel industry at the expense of the people he represents. Industry front groups with deceptive names like Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future and Consumers Energy Alliance are mobilizing in support of fossil fuels and attacking clean energy. They release pro-fossil fuel studies and surveys of questionable accuracy while receiving funding from fossil fuel companies, or in the case of Mass Fiscal Alliance, refusing to say who funds them.
Despite the fossil fuel industry’s attempts to strangle clean energy, deployment has exploded across the U.S. and globally. Nationally, solar, wind, and batteries dominate as we race to add new sources of electricity to meet growing demand. Solar is the cheapest and fastest growing source of energy in the U.S. and globally
But the transition to clean energy in the U.S. is not happening fast enough to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil fuels. The Trump administration is making things worse by taking unprecedented – and often illegal – actions to slow the transition and continue inflating the profits of fossil fuel companies, which already enjoy huge government subsidies.
The Trump administration’s support for fossil fuels is purely ideological and unbelievably myopic. Nationally, 90 percent of new capacity added to the grid is from solar and wind. In the winter, wind power – a free and local resource – ramps up just when we need it most. In summer, abundant sunshine makes solar an excellent source of power. During the heat wave that hit the region this summer, rooftop solar and batteries saved us from losing power – and saved consumers almost $20 million in fuel costs.
When the federal government does the bidding of multibillion dollar corporations while driving up costs for the average American, we need states to step up. Our state and local leaders have a responsibility to lead where this administration has failed us: by investing in clean, local, and affordable sources of energy, enabling families and businesses to access clean technologies that are more efficient and better for our health, and refuting Trump’s nonsensical claims that fossil fuels are the future. Not in New England, they aren’t.

The payment returns […]","The M/V Susitna docked in Ketchikan (Photo courtesy of Patty Sullivan/Matanuska-Susitna Borough)PALMER — The Matanuska-Susitna Borough must repay nearly $6 million in federal transit grants used for the defunct Knik Arm ferry project or face hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual fines and the withholding of current funding, according to a debt order federal officials sent to the borough late last month.
The payment returns a portion of more than $12.3 million in Federal Transit Administration grants issued to the borough between 2002 and 2008 that paid for a ferry terminal and related infrastructure at the borough’s Port MacKenzie for the never-used M/V Susitna ferry.
The grants required the borough to operate the ferry and terminal for transit services – actions that never happened – or repay part of the funds, the letter states.
“As you are aware, the debt arises from FTA funding the borough spent in pursuit of a never-completed capital project to initiate ferry service between Port MacKenzie and Anchorage,” the letter states. “After 10 years of working to bring the project to fruition, the borough was unable to implement ferry service in accordance with the requirements of the grant agreements.”
Mat-Su abandoned the ferry, which was gifted to the borough through a series of federal earmarks, because no passenger landing was constructed in Anchorage. The borough ultimately sold the nearly $80 million vessel to the Philippine Red Cross in 2015 for about $1.8 million.
The debt letter was sent to Borough Mayor Edna DeVries on Aug. 26 and signed by FTA acting Chief Financial Officer Adam Schildge, according to documents released by the borough Wednesday.
The borough must repay the debt by late this month or face fines and the withholding of current federal grant payments, the letter states. The borough may file an appeal with the U.S. Department of Justice, it states.
The debt letter is the latest development in a decade-long dispute between the borough and the federal government over whether Mat-Su must repay the millions used to build infrastructure for the failed ferry program.
It is the first such communication from the FTA to the borough since 2017, Borough Attorney Nicholas Spiropoulos told the Assembly during a regular meeting Tuesday. The FTA did not respond to a request for comment as to why the letter was sent now.
FTA officials in 2017 said the borough owed about $9.3 million in grant repayments. The new letter reduces the debt to $5.8 million after recalculating figures provided during a 2016 borough appeal, according to the letter.
Originally envisioned as a state-of-the-art commuter ferry between Port MacKenzie and Anchorage and billed as the world’s first ice-breaking passenger catamaran, the ship was designed by the U.S. Navy and and built in Ketchikan in 2010, where it remained docked throughout the borough’s ownership.
The transit project first stalled in 2011 after funding and political will to build ferry docks in Anchorage dried up.
The ship’s construction and acquisition was free to the borough – but keeping it afloat was not. In 2012, borough budget shortfalls, mounting costs of docking and insuring the vessel, and the absence of a viable operating plan prompted the borough to offload the ship.
Officials initially sought to transfer the Susitna to another government agency, a move that would have allowed the borough to avoid repaying the FTA grant. But after years with no takers and docking and maintenance costs totaling nearly $5 million, the borough sold the ship to the Philippine Red Cross in 2015 for about $78 million less than its construction cost. As of 2016, the Susitna had cost borough taxpayers about $15 million.
Renamed the M/V Amazing Grace, the vessel served as the Philippines’ first humanitarian ship until earlier this year, when the Red Cross transferred it to the Philippine Coast Guard for use in search-and-rescue missions.
Federal officials first notified Mat-Su in 2014 that it would be required to repay the transit grants because it had “never used the ferry vessel or passenger terminal facilities for transit purposes,” according to the 2017 letter. The borough appealed, arguing factors out of its control such as disagreements over a ferry landing site in Anchorage had prevented the project’s operation, the letter states.
That appeal was denied, with federal officials stating the borough failed to “make adequate progress” on the project. They agreed to reduce the debt by the amount the borough spent on preliminary design and construction work, a deduction of about $3 million. That figure was recalculated in the letter sent last month, resulting in a new debt total of $5.8 million, according to the documents.

The Assembly will be briefed on the new debt letter during a closed-door session at a meeting scheduled for Sept. 16, Spiropoulos said Tuesday.
“I need to get you all up to speed on the Susitna ferry project. After eight years of being dormant, we got some information from FTA that we’re going to need to respond to,” he said. “Everybody who was involved in the entire ferry project is gone. So we’ll get everybody at this meeting, have a plan, talk to the manager a little bit, and respond to FTA.”
The discussion will not be held in public because it is a pending legal matter, Spiropoulos said in an email Wednesday.
“We are going to be discussing documents I prepared that are confidential work product, and the immediate public knowledge of our discussions would have an adverse effect upon the finances of the borough,” he said.
Next steps and payment decisions will not be subject to a public vote by the Assembly, he said.

(Courtesy of SD Game, Fish and Parks)The commission overseeing wildlife management in South Dakota approved a proposal Thursday in Rapid City to expand the area where dogs can be used for hunting mountain lions.
The decision by the Game, Fish and Parks Commission increases the area within the Black Hills where hunters can use scent-tracking hounds to chase mountain lions up trees. The expansion includes areas in the eastern and southern Hills. 
The rule change also removes the requirement for hunters without dogs to obtain an access permit in addition to a hunter’s license to hunt mountain lions in Custer State Park. 
The annual harvest limit remains capped at 60 mountain lions or 40 females, whichever is reached first.

The decision to expand the area for dog-assisted hunting follows months of debate and hundreds of submitted comments over the role of dogs in lion management. Another roughly 30 people spoke during Thursday’s hearing.
Supporters of the new rule said that expanding dog hunting opportunities will improve mountain lion management. Hunters with dogs have an approximately 50% success rate, while hunters without dogs have less than 4%. They said the move will help the state meet its population objectives and ensure that problem lions attacking livestock are killed. 
A report issued this year by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks says the latest mountain lion population estimate for the Black Hills is 393, but also says mountain lion population estimates “often have low precision.” Averaged over multiple years, the department said, the population generally stays within the management objective of 200 to 300.
Supporters also said hunting with dogs and chasing lions up trees allows hunters to get close and better identify the sex and age of lions before deciding to shoot them. They said fewer lions would also increase the mule deer population in the southern Hills, where hunters complain of low numbers. 
“Mountain lion numbers are too high in the Black Hills. So are coyote numbers. The deer population is trending down,” wrote Jordan Schneider of Rapid City. 
Opponents said hunting with dogs undermines the principle of fair chase — giving the animal an opportunity to escape — and reduces opportunities for hunters without dogs. Others called the practice inhumane and said the proposal was not based on science. 
“This is not a real ‘hunting sport,’ but a cruel and unethical event,” wrote Leisa Bailey of Vermillion.
Commission Chair Stephanie Rissler, who spoke in favor of the proposal, said the move will help manage problem lions without increasing permit numbers or the harvest limit. 
The final vote was 7-0, with one commissioner, Travis Theel, recusing himself. During the public comment period, state Rep. Tim Goodwin, R-Rapid City, alleged that Theel, who runs a guided hunting service in the Black Hills, and Commissioner Travis Bies, who owns land near the Black Hills, had conflicts of interest. Bies did not recuse himself, saying his land is not in the affected area.  
Mountain lions were nearly eradicated from South Dakota by the early 20th century due to bounties and unregulated hunting. After lions recolonized the Black Hills in the 1980s, the state established a hunting season in 2005.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mountain-lion.png,,,2025-09-04 22:57:48.003587

Wendy DeBoer of Bennington and Victor Rountree of Bellevue answer questions from reporters about a proposed plan to transform a Nebraska prison center in McCook into an ICE detention center. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — There are still plenty of unanswered questions about plans to transform a Nebraska rehabilitative prison facility into a federal immigration center after a closed-door meeting with state lawmakers. 
Some new details that did come up, however, revealed that the state initiated conversations with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the potential of converting the McCook center to ICE use. 
Most of the Nebraska Legislature’s Judiciary Committee attended a closed-door meeting Thursday to discuss the planned repurposing of the Nebraska Work Ethic Camp. 
Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a state-federal plan Aug. 19 to convert the nearly 200-bed dormitory-style prison into a 300-bed immigration detention facility over the next 45 days.
While several Republican members of the Judiciary Committee have said they were notified of the plan shortly before the public announcement, Democrats on the committee were excluded. A group of 13 progressive lawmakers then submitted a letter requesting a public hearing to cover questions about the proposal. The Governor’s Office and Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln then organized the briefing.

Several state officials reportedly attended to answer questions, including Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys and Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly,  former prosecutor in Lancaster County and a former chief of the criminal bureau for the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Neither were available to answer questions after. They took a separate exit down the hall from where reporters had gathered. 
Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature who did not sign the letter requesting a public hearing, said state officials were not able to provide many answers to her questions, including whether the McCook facility has the capacity to house the ICE detainees or the funds to cover the expected costs of the conversion. 
During the meeting, DeBoer said officials did share that Nebraska reached out to Homeland Security about repurposing the McCook center — and not the other way around — following a social media post by President Donald Trump inquiring about states with space to house such a facility. 
She did not specify which Nebraska official reached out. But Pillen has made several trips to Washington, D.C., and to the White House. 
DeBoer said she was told there is currently no agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services to convert the McCook facility into a detention center, but she expects one to be completed within the next 60 days. 
This contradicts or clarifies Pillen’s estimates last month that the repurposed facility would be operational within 45 days. Bosn said her understanding is that the ICE center would open around 45 to 60 days after the agreement is finalized. 
DeBoer said she was told that the existing employees at McCook would remain state employees through the transition and that the repurposed center would house “low-level” inmates, or inmates that meet an ICE-specific classification. 
The new center will house only adults, according to Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, who also attended the briefing. He said officials were unable to clarify whether detainees will be only men, or a mix of men and women, but noted that there won’t be any mixing of Nebraska inmates with ICE detainees.
As for what will happen with the state inmates currently housed in McCook, DeBoer said some will go to various community corrections centers, where they may have been transferred naturally. Others will be reabsorbed into other prisons, and DeBoer said there was talk that some of the other eastern Nebraska prisons may need to expand their low-level security housing areas, as the McCook center currently has a large share of those available beds. 
Bosn said she was reassured at the briefing when Jeffreys said no existing inmates should lose access to resources or lose progress in their programming as a result of the transition. She said Jeffreys told her he has an employee dedicated to ensuring the transition goes smoothly.

Jeffreys reportedly told meeting attendees that Nebraska’s overall prison bed capacity was at 98%. Rountree said an engineer is currently examining the capacity of the McCook prison. 
The Work Ethic Camp currently houses 168 inmates, and DeBoer noted the facility was originally designed for 100. Pillen’s press release claimed the center is currently at 84% of bed capacity. Either way, DeBoer said the repurposed center would likely be crowded. 
With Nebraska having one of the most overcrowded prison systems in the country, some have expressed concerns about how a new ICE center might exacerbate the problem by eliminating one of the state’s existing prisons. 
Corrections is already dealing with displacing 387 inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln after an August windstorm tore the roof off of two buildings, which are currently under repair. DeBoer said Jeffreys told senators the penitentiary is also dealing with a new water problem that occurred this week. 
Bosn said she “disagrees with the narrative” that Nebraska’s prisons are overcrowded. She argued that since the overall system’s capacity is below 100%, that means there’s still room. But DeBoer said the combination of capacity concerns and the quick timeline for the project has her worried about what the conditions will be like in the repurposed center. 
“My confidence is a little shaken about whether or not the Department of Homeland Security will live up to the standards that I would want Nebraskans to have,” DeBoer said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
DeBoer visited the McCook facility Wednesday and said she met with people who were considering modifications that may be needed to transform the building into an ICE detention center. She mentioned that they were considering installing a second fence but said officials at the briefing did not share other details about what modifications would be necessary. 
She said she asked if the new center would have space for detainees to consult with attorneys and got no answer. The current center has little need for such meetings, DeBoer said, as most of the inmates are there late in their sentences. During her visit, she said she didn’t see any space that could be used for that purpose. 
Rountree said state officials also were unsure about how much it would cost to make this transition, although he got the indication that hosting the center might be helpful toward state finances. 
Repurposing the Work Ethic Camp won’t just reduce bed space within Nebraska’s prison system, DeBoer said, but it would also eliminate a facility with a specific mission that was set by the Legislature in 1997. 
Though it is crowded, DeBoer said WEC appears to have better conditions for its inhabitants relative to other Nebraska prisons, including offering better food and overall more humane treatment. 
“I took the time to look out the windows, and they look over a meadow,” DeBoer said. 
Of the questions asked in the letter that prompted the briefing, one that was not addressed was whether the executive branch has the authority to initiate this project. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”
DeBoer said she purposefully didn’t ask about this because she didn’t think it would be a “productive” conversation. She believes her opinion on the topic differs from that of the governor’s team and said the question is better left for the courts. 
In Pillen’s press release, he argues that state statute gives him the authority through the creation of the Department of Correctional Services, as well as an article in the Nebraska Constitution that states that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
DeBoer said there may be enough reason to justify the Legislature filing a lawsuit to challenge Pillen, though she said she had no details on whether such a lawsuit is coming. 
The meeting was closed to the press and lawmakers outside the Judiciary Committee. Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln tried to attend, but was quickly kicked out. 
Conrad said Bosn told her the meeting was meant to be for Judiciary Committee members only. But she countered that in Bosn’s own words from her letter responding to progressives, the committee “has no more extraordinary authority than any individual senator, or group of senators, to seek answers” to their questions. 
“Senator Bosn’s public statements, and now private actions, stand in sharp contradiction to each other,” Conrad said. 
Bosn countered that committees commonly hold private meetings open only to committee members and said Conrad has the same ability to call a meeting of her own. DeBoer declined to comment on Conrad’s exclusion.

Mike Kehoe to require a majority of voters in all of Missouri’s eight congressional districts and a statewide majority in order to pass a constitutional amendment or state law on the ballot. 
This means a very small percentage of statewide voters in just one district could defeat a ballot measure and it would only apply to citizen-led initiatives, not those placed on the ballot by the legislature. Based on last year’s general election, where 2,960,266 votes were cast for governor and only 311,915 in the 1st District, under the proposed change only 156,000 voters could defeat ballot question — or just shy of 5.3% of the statewide vote.
If approved by lawmakers, the proposed constitutional amendment debated Thursday would go on the statewide ballot and require a simple majority to be enacted.
Missouri is one of 24 states that allows citizen initiative petitions. They can be used to either amend the constitution or change state law, though the path to successfully doing so is often arduous and expensive, requiring tens of thousands of signatures to even land on the ballot. 
In the past few years alone, a majority of Missourians voted to legalize abortion and recreational marijuana and to increase minimum wage and mandate paid sick leave through the initiative petition process, all issues opposed by the Republican-dominated legislature. 
These ballot measures, Lewis said, compelled him to sponsor legislation raising the threshold for passing initiative petitions. He pointed specifically to a 2022 amendment legalizing recreational marijuana use.
“The voices of those voters in less populated counties were not heard and were overwhelmed by the few heavily populated counties,” he said.
Lewis also criticized a constitutional amendment passed last November that overturned Missouri’s abortion ban. 
“This (abortion) amendment didn’t pass in most areas in Missouri, and I believe, would not have passed in even half of the congressional districts,” he said.
Last November, the abortion rights amendment won with just shy of 52% of the vote by drawing support from the state’s urban and more populous areas. Voters in all but eight of Missouri’s 115 counties opposed the amendment.
Lewis said the current process disenfranchises rural Missouri because it doesn’t require “broad geographic support.” 
“Every last inch of the state of Missouri needs to be represented when we’re changing the constitution,” he said.
State lawmakers are considering the resolution alongside a proposal to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts.
State Rep. Eric Woods, a Kansas City Democrat, said the two issues could not be “decoupled.”
“If your concern is that certain underpopulated or rural parts of the state don’t have a voice and are using congressional districts as a (corrective) measure,” he said. “If that is important for a ballot measure, how does that argument fly when we’re about to pass a map joining downtown Kansas City to rural Webster County 200 miles away.”
State Rep. David Tyson Smith, D-Columbia, speaks during Thursday’s hearing on proposed changes to the initiative petition process (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
State Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Democrat from Columbia, said the changes to the initiative petition process would remove a pathway for Missourians to remedy redistricting they believe is unfair.
A slew of initiative petitions have been approved for circulation this year ahead of the 2026 General Election. Many focus on preserving the current initiative petition process.
The state’s initiative petition process has been in place since 1908, when it was approved by a majority of voters.
“This whole special session is insidious,” Smith said. “Because it is not just about the initiative process, it’s also about redistricting… The two go hand in hand.”
Lewis said he didn’t believe the two are “linked.”
His legislation also seeks to bar ballot measure campaigns from accepting contributions from citizens of countries deemed “foreign adversaries” of the United States. Kehoe’s request called for banning contributions from “foreign nationals.”
“For far too long, Missouri’s Constitution has been the victim of out-of-state special interests who deceive voters to pass out-of-touch policies,” Kehoe said in a statement last week. “It’s time we give voters a chance to protect our Constitution.”
This year, Kehoe signed into law ​​a restriction on foreign spending on state ballot measures.
Smith said the inclusion of proposals seeking to ban things that are already illegal is simply “ballot candy” seeking to deceive voters. 
“We are going to load this up with all this other stuff as a charade to trick people because no one is going to vote for this resolution if they knew exactly what it is going to be,” Smith said.
Lewis rejected that claim, saying contributions from foreign adversaries were not yet illegal when he began sponsoring initiative-petition reform legislation.

Republican members of the committee suggested Lewis amend the proposal to ban all foreign contributions, mirroring Kehoe’s request.
The state of Kansas recently passed a law to ban foreign contributions to initiative petition campaigns. The law was affirmed by a federal judge in July.
Lewis, when asked about foreign spending in Missouri, could not give an in-state example.
The citizen-led campaign to legalize abortion in Missouri, known as Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, raised more than $30 million last year. This included millions of dollars from U.S.-based liberal groups known as dark money organizations because they don’t disclose their donors. A dark money group was also among the main contributors to the anti-abortion movement, which ultimately raised far less money.
Lewis’ proposal would also require a public hearing before an initiative petition is placed on the ballot and that the full text of the ballot measure be on display at polling places.
Another provision would create a criminal election offense for anyone who fraudulently signs or gathers signatures for an initiative petition. This includes those who sign initiative petitions while knowingly not being a registered voter and would charge them with a class-A misdemeanor.
Smith called the provision “ridiculous.” It “doesn’t make any sense,” he said, because corporations could break the law and lack an individual for the charge.
Lewis said he was open to changes to improve the legislation.
“The only way to make this bill better is to burn it,” Smith said, with applause from hearing attendees.
A majority of those who testified spoke in opposition to the proposal, with many calling out a perceived “double standard” between voter-led ballot measures and those placed on the ballot by lawmakers.
“The most offensive part of (the resolution) is the fact that it creates a double standard when you continue to let the legislature place things on the ballot that will be ratified with a simple majority vote,” Ron Calzone, an activist and executive director of Missouri First, told the committee. “That is a shift of power to the government. That’s not a Republican thing either. That’s not a conservative thing either.”
Susan Klein, executive director of Missouri Right to Life, hosts a rally in the Missouri State Capitol rotunda in March (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Opponents who testified Thursday included people who have gathered signatures for recent ballot-measure campaigns and groups involved in recent initiative petitions.
Truman Oaks, a 19-year-old Columbia resident who gathered signatures for a ballot measure last year, said the proposal would set an unfair standard for citizen-led petitions.
“If this joint resolution passes, it is the end of the petition process, though not formally,” he said. “I speak for myself and so many other people I know that have been involved in this work in saying that maybe there is a one in 100 chance we win all eight districts.”
Susan Klein, executive director of anti-abortion group Missouri Right to Life, said the proposal would safeguard the State Constitution from “one or two districts that are making the rest of us live by constitution (changes).”
State Rep. Keri Ingle, a Lee’s Summit Democrat, asked whether Klein would support the stricter standards for an upcoming anti-abortion ballot measure proposed by lawmakers.
“Would you bet that Missouri is so pro-life that it could pass by a majority in every congressional district next year, if you were to put it on the ballot by that standard?” she asked.
“That is not what we are here to testify on today,” Klein said.
The committee rejected an amendment offered by Ingle that would apply the stricter standards to resolutions placed on the ballot by state lawmakers in a party-line vote.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ed-Lewis-initiative-090425-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 22:57:48.003587

(Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold said Thursday that impending systemwide budget cuts of more than $40 million will be “incredibly painful” but “necessary” for NU’s survival.
Dr. Gold, speaking at his inaugural “State of the University” address, said NU will still embark on what he’s coined the “Odyssey to the Extraordinary.” He set out his vision one year ago during the formal ceremony celebrating him as NU’s ninth president. Gold returned Thursday to say he still seeks to make an “already good, already excellent” NU “something more.”

Gold didn’t shy away from NU’s challenges, such as slowing state support and uncertainty in federal research dollars or policies, in an event believed by NU officials to be the first NU presidential address of its kind, and which Gold hopes to make an annual tradition.
“While the challenges are significant, I see this as a time of profound opportunity,” Gold said Thursday. “An opportunity to actively reimagine our university. An opportunity to lead. An opportunity to help define what higher education in the next decades must look like.”
Thursday’s address and Gold’s 2024 investiture were both held in the Nebraska State Capitol, which Gold said was purposefully in the “people’s house.”
Fiscal uncertainties
Gold said Thursday that since 2016, NU has had an average annual net loss of $206 million across the NU system, when accounting for inflation and state funding growth. He said the university system is funded to about 74% of where it would be if available money had matched inflationary expectations.
Tuition increases have also been kept lower over the past six years than many of NU’s national peers, increasing tuition by 13.8% in that time frame, slightly more than half what many other universities increased tuition by during that period. 
Combined, those pressures mean an NU budget that has annually been about $260 million leaner in recent years.

Under President Donald Trump, NU now also faces a tightening research environment in which competition is growing for more-limited funding. Universities also need to absorb the costs of more cutting-edge research, Gold said, which he said isn’t sustainable in the long term. He said federal research dollars often make discoveries possible.
“Fewer federal resources put this nationwide research enterprise at risk,” Gold said.
At NU, nearly three out of every four students are Pell Grant-eligible, stressing federal dollars, and Gold noted that student demographics are also shifting. Instead of 18-year-old high school graduates, NU is seeing more teenagers taking dual-credit courses to get a leg up or attending community college first. Many also prefer online courses or online-only degree programs.
Combined with inflation and a smaller-than-requested bump in state dollars this spring, NU faces a $20 million shortfall by the end of this year. That comes even as the NU Board of Regents raised tuition by 5% ahead of this academic year.
‘Cannot cut out way to excellence’
NU’s four main campuses in Lincoln, Omaha and Kearney have already unveiled how much each campus will have to cut to shore up that systemwide deficit and campus-specific structural deficits, though specifics of most of these cuts have yet to be announced:

University of Nebraska-Lincoln: $27.5 million.
University of Nebraska Medical Center: $9.1 million.
University of Nebraska at Kearney: $4.5 million.
University of Nebraska at Omaha: $1.9 million.

At UNL, for example, costs have outpaced revenues. UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett, the lone campus chancellor not to attend Gold’s address, is expected to announce UNL’s proposed cuts next week. UNL’s target of $27.5 million in cuts is greater than the combined budgets of the UNL College of Journalism and Mass Communications, UNL College of Architecture and Nebraska College of Law.
Gold said the Office of the NU President also would make cuts. He did not specify by how much, but said the combined efforts are required for a “sustainable, viable future” for an NU that still contributes to students, the state’s economy and communities.
“Make no mistake: We cannot cut our way to excellence, and certainly we cannot cut our way to our extraordinary destiny,” Gold said.
Gold told reporters that cuts would likely include eliminating whole degree programs and possibly departments, along wit combining some departments or degrees, while some new degrees might be established.
Any cuts of that nature would need the approval of the eight-member NU Board of Regents, likely by the board’s December meeting. Most campuses hope to finalize budget decisions by late October.
Changing state dynamics
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen served as an NU regent for 10 years before becoming governor in 2023, a period that included confirming Gold as UNMC chancellor in 2013.
Pillen in January initially proposed cutting NU’s budget by 2% over the next two fiscal years. Gold and Pillen negotiated, landing at a staggered increase this fiscal year and a smaller bump next year.

illen had indicated whether NU would not get its increase next year, a 0.625% increase, Gold said no. He said Pillen has also not asked NU to make deeper cuts.
Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokesperson, said Thursday that Nebraska provides more than $720 million to NU each year, equivalent to 13% of state tax spending and the largest spending area that comes out of the main state piggy bank. She said Nebraskans expect fiscal responsibility across state government.
“Governor Pillen applauds the university for recent steps to curb spending and notes that more can and should be done as a good steward of taxpayer dollars to meet the mission of educating students and ultimately making sure that the university’s focus is on improving graduate outcomes,” Strimple said.
A recent third-party analysis of NU’s annual economic impact, done at NU’s direction, indicates an impact of $6.4 billion and a return on investment for every state dollar of $10. NU also educates one in seven working-age Nebraskans and represents 9% of Nebraska’s gross domestic product.
Lawmaker reactions
State Sen. Dave Murma of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, was one of about a dozen lawmakers to attend Gold’s event. He said NU is vital as an economic driver and for research and education that officials hope to build and grow, even in tight budget times.
“We will do what we can to fund the university,” Murman said. “Our goal is that the university will continue to be the premier university in Nebraska … and one of the best universities nationwide.”

State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, also a member of the Education Committee and the Legislature’s most senior member at 11 years of service, said she is proud of NU’s accomplishments but placed the blame for NU’s challenges on Pillen and the Legislature.
Conrad said support for higher education, such as during her first two legislative terms in the 2000s and early 2010s under former Gov. Dave Heineman, wasn’t political. But now, NU and others are caught in the “crosshairs of ridiculous political battles” that she said have passed on the state’s “fiscal mismanagement” to NU students and families. She called it a “Pillen tax.”
“Being a supporter of the university means more than just waving a flag on game day,” Conrad said.
‘Ability to emerge stronger’
Gold said the 10:1 return is a good deal for state officials but that NU leaders will not waver from quality and growth, even if that means a deep cut in one area to help preserve NU’s ability in the others.
“I’d rather see programs disappear than do anything to dilute the quality of what that diploma means to people,” Gold said.

Any students in degree programs slated for elimination would still be guaranteed a chance to graduate, Gold said, adding: “Rest assured, we’ve got you and we’ll take care of you.”
Gold also took his address Thursday to explain how NU is already engaging in its “odyssey” to improve despite budget challenges, including major investments in health care, a groundbreaking clinical trial in a multiple sclerosis treatment, continued emphasis on digital and precision agriculture, growing collaborations in national defense and security, athletics achievements and a record-setting year in philanthropic support (though about 99% of the $416.6 million raised is restricted and must be used for specific purposes, not for core budget functions).
“If I were to go to the major donors and say, ‘Listen, we’ve got a leaky roof down on city campus. Maybe you’d like to help us replace that roof.’ I can only tell you that it would never work,” Gold told reporters.
NU will also create a new center for excellence in artificial intelligence for “groundbreaking discovery” for every campus, college and NU faculty, staff or student. Gold said that for Nebraska to thrive in an increasingly complex and competitive world, it needs bold investment, particularly from state leaders.
“We must acknowledge the hard truths of our challenges … but never lose faith in our ability to emerge stronger,” Gold said. “Our ‘Odyssey to the Extraordinary’ requires nothing less.”

Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, led a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence on Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2023. (Screenshot from U.S. Senate webcast)President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is one of 10 federal prosecutors whose confirmations were delayed Wednesday when a senior Democratic lawmaker objected.
David Metcalf has been serving in the role under an interim appointment by Attorney General Pam Bondi that was extended indefinitely in June. Trump nominated Metcalf in March for the top federal law enforcement position covering Philadelphia and nine surrounding counties.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration on Wednesday announced the nomination of Brian David Miller to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Miller served as special inspector general for pandemic recovery during Trump’s first term and General Services Administration Inspector General during the George W. Bush administration.
Trump has yet to announce a nominee for U.S. Attorney in the Western District of Pennsylvania. 
During Senate proceedings Wednesday, Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) called for unanimous consent to approve the 10 U.S. attorney nominees, which would bypass the requirement for roll-call votes.
The committee’s ranking Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill) objected to Grassley’s request, preventing the voice vote. Grassley’s office said in a statement that Durbin cited precedent in then-Sen. J.D. Vance’s (R-Ohio) hold on a limited number of U.S. attorney nominees during the Biden administration.
In a statement on the Senate floor, Durbin noted the history of blocking judicial and U.S. attorney nominations by both parties in the Senate, recalling Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama’s choice to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. 
And in 2023, Vance announced he intended to place a blanket hold on all Justice Department nominees to “grind it to a halt,” Durbin said. As a result, Biden was able to fill only 68 of 93 U.S. Attorney positions.
“I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, that you did not agree with Senator Vance’s actions back then, and I don’t believe you do now, but we can’t have one set of rules for Republican presidents and another for Democratic presidents,” Durbin said. 
The statement from Grassley’s office said Durbin’s objection is a break from tradition and deprives the communities that the nominees would serve of law enforcement leadership. 
Metcalf, who was previously an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, has overseen dozens of criminal and civil cases this year in his interim role. They include an indictment announced Wednesday accusing a Lancaster County businessman of running a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors in an ATM company of $770 million.
Grassley’s office said in a statement Durbin’s objection would force the Senate to use hours of floor time to process the nominations and deny the 10 communities the nominees’ service. It added that 94% of President Joe Biden’s U.S. attorney nominations were approved by a voice vote, while none have received unanimous approval during the second Trump administration.
Metcalf began his career in the Department of Justice as an assistant U.S. attorney in Maryland prosecuting organized crime, narcotics and violent crime. He also served as a top aide to Justice Department officials, including the U.S. attorney general, supervising and advising on major criminal prosecutions.

Now, Trump is back. And so is the commission charged with tracking federal impacts on Maryland’s health insurance market.
This past session, the General Assembly revived the group with passage of House Bill 718, allowing the commission to run for another four years. The commission is tasked with monitoring federal changes to the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, the Maryland Children’s Health Program and the state’s hospital system, and to offer recommendations to lawmakers on how to react to such changes.
At least one familiar face will be on the commission: Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All coalition, will join the revived state commission, after being tapped by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
DeMarco will be one of two members of the public to serve on the 25-member commission. Other members will include a handful of delegates and senators, along with representatives from the state health department, insurance commission, the state insurance marketplace, the Maryland Hospital Association and other health care focused groups.
DeMarco has been a vocal advocate in Maryland for affordable health care policy and other initiatives for decades.
“I thank Gov. Wes Moore very much for appointing me to this commission,” DeMarco said recently. “This commission will play a key role in protecting Maryland from federal attacks on our health care and making sure we continue to go forward to achieve our goal of quality affordable health care for all our people.”
Chandler takes charge
The Frederick County Council confirmed the appointment Tuesday of Leshia Chandler to be the next director of the Frederick County Division of Family Services.
Chandler has been deputy director of the division since April 2024, where she led the Frederick County Local Management Board, which created a Neighborhood Action Plan to end high concentrations of poverty, and assisted county efforts on a comprehensive child care study. Before she was deputy director, Chandler worked as a local care team coordinator, connection families to community resources.

Frederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater called Chandler “a compassionate and strategic leader who has dedicated her career to strengthening families and protecting vulnerable children.”
“Her deep knowledge of our community and her unwavering commitment to equity and service make her the right person to lead the Division of Family Services into the future,” Fitzwater said in a statement announcing the appointment.
Before working for the county, Chandler worked at the Mental Health Association of Frederick County, supervising programs such as Court Appointed Special Advocates, Parent Coaching, and Health Families. She brings a decade of executive-level experience in early childhood education at Aramark Educational Resources, now known as KinderCare Learning Centers. The Frederick resident earned a master’s degree in human and social services from Walden University and a bachelor’s degree in English from Shippensburg University.
Integrity report on Prince George’s schools
The Prince George’s County Public Schools’ Office of Integrity and Compliance (OIC) released its first report Thursday, more than two years after it was created by the General Assembly to independently assess Maryland’s second-largest school system.
The office was created in response to allegations of financial mismanagement, fraud and even public discourse between former board members.
Some of those accusations were highlighted in Thursday’s report based on 128 complaints the office received starting in February 2024 through June of this year.
No specific names are mentioned, but a few “significant findings” include one former school board member who was also working full time for an out-of-state school district. David Murray accepted a job as chief academic officer in Missouri. According to the integrity office report, board leadership failed to promptly address violations to an attendance policy and made a formal referral only after local news reports.
“The Board’s omission to take prompt action on this matter created the right set of circumstances for wasteful receipt of PGCPS funds and/or property by an absent Board member in the amount of $9,792.32,” the report stated.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One recommendation calls for updating the code of conduct and require posting the board’s attendance record on the school system website.
Some of the other 29 recommendations include clarifying language to identify the integrity office as the unit specified to investigate allegations of financial impropriety; enhancing quality control for processing leave requests to ensure timely responses on workplace injury and accommodation; and ensuring the board understands and receives updated guidance and training on the process to retain legal counsel.
The report also highlights how the office with six employees and a nearly $1.6 million budget this fiscal year faces potential challenges such as resistance to oversight and implementation of any recommendations. “This resistance to addressing serious issues could lead to operational failures and reputational damage.”
Some of the goals and initiatives for the office are:

Equipping staff with an understanding of navigating legal complexities to secure information more effectively;
Implementing a regular review process for office operations and incorporating feedback from stakeholders to continually improve effectiveness and responsiveness; and
Collaborating with the interim superintendent “as opportunities to improve operational efficiencies, compliance, and risk mitigation.”

“As I continue to learn, navigate the institutional history of PGCPS, and train the new OIC staff, I am particularly grateful for the trust placed in the OIC by the residents, employees, and stakeholders who have courageously shared their concerns,” integrity and compliance officer Frank Turner II said in a statement. “Your willingness to come forward is vital to our mission.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0221-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-05 07:57:24.250906

As a little girl growing up just south of the Arctic Circle in Alaska, Mackenzie Englishoe  understood that her Gwich’in people and salmon were intrinsically connected. Salmon was the conduit of her first childhood lessons: Never take more than what you need; if you respect the salmon this year, they will come back the next.
Englishoe, now 22, described the salmon as “good medicine.” The fish protect Alaska Native people from diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Salmon comprises two-thirds of the food supply in Gwichyaa Zhee, also known as Fort Yukon, which sits adjacent to the Yukon River. More than physical sustenance, salmon is spiritual food.
But by the time Englishoe moved permanently to her ancestral land after completing school in Fairbanks, her chance to fish had already passed. There were so few salmon in her part of the Yukon that the state closed fishing.
“It hurt the deepest parts of me,” said Englishoe, who is also part of the Arctic Youth Ambassadors, a program run by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of State. In 2023, she was selected as an emerging leader by the Tanana Chiefs Conference (TCC), a tribal consortium and nonprofit organization serving tribes in Interior Alaska.
Indigenous peoples first reported concerns about the salmon run 60 years prior, after seeing drops in salmon numbers and sizes. The crash intensified in 2000, plummeted in 2019, and was so severe by 2024 that Alaska state managers and First Nations in Canada signed an agreement to close fishing for all Chinook, or king salmon, on the Yukon River for seven years. The fishing moratorium was set to span the life cycle of the Chinook salmon, named for an Indigenous tribe along the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest. It is also called king salmon for its size, reaching up to 5 feet long and 130 pounds.
Englishoe’s village of Gwichyaa Zhee is home to about 500 people, the second-largest along the Yukon. Part of the Yukon Flats, the region about the size of Maryland extends to the Canadian border. Residents throughout the Yukon Flats depend on salmon to make up the vast majority of their food supply, according to Alaska Department of Fish & Game (ADF&G) Subsistence Chief Caroline Brown.
But “the salmon can’t provide for us right now, so we have to let them go by,” Englishoe said.
The Yukon Flats represents a small subset of the Yukon River, which is home to more than 50 Indigenous communities, many of whom are hundreds of miles from the road system. The river spans 2,000 miles and two countries, and the land is home to multiple languages, distinct management structures, and varied access to other food resources. Upriver, First Nations in Canada, who are granted autonomy over management by the government, haven’t fished for decades. Downriver, Alaska Natives historically had access to additional salmon stocks on the Yukon, but the total closure of Chinook salmon fishing is devastating. The state of Alaska manages fishing within state boundaries. Commercial fishing in the ocean is federally regulated. While U.S. federal law prioritizes subsistence, Alaska’s state law does not.
Alaska Natives, whose Indigenous practices were banned by U.S. federal laws for generations, continue to face colonial policies that eradicate their culture. Subsistence king salmon fishing is cut off on the Yukon, while commercial fishing continues in the ocean. Policymakers are also largely ignoring the Indigenous stewardship practices that have kept salmon stocks thriving since time immemorial. The combination of state and federal policies prioritizes commercial fishing while subjugating Indigenous stewardship. Englishoe and other Alaska Natives along the Yukon, including Jody Potts-Joseph and Karma Ulvi in Eagle Village, are now fighting for the right to manage the river and save the remaining salmon stocks for future generations, before their way of life dies off with the salmon.
 “We’re linked and tied to the salmon”

About 50 miles upriver from Englishoe, Potts-Joseph can feel the absence of salmon in her bones.
For generations, Potts-Joseph and her ancestors have looked to the Yukon and its salmon to provide key nutrients, including vitamin D, which sustains them through the long, dark winters, and fatty oils to lubricate their joints on dog sled runs to visit trap lines and gather firewood.
Potts-Joseph is a long-distance musher in Eagle Village, another part of the Yukon Flats, which is 6 miles from the Canadian border and 50 miles south of the Arctic Circle. She said mushing is her personal path toward cultural preservation, a way to honor her ancestors and her cultural connection to the land. Alaska Natives have used dogsleds in winter for generations, and still do. But the salmon crash has also made it more difficult to feed dog teams, which traditionally ate chum salmon, sometimes called dog salmon.

“We’re linked and tied to the salmon,” Potts-Joseph said. “It’s a big part of our culture and our society and family relations.”
In Eagle, 80% to 90% of the 2017 subsistence harvest was salmon, according to a study by Brown, the ADF&G subsistence chief, and Brooke McDavid of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
The salmon crash is already causing health problems for the Alaska Native peoples who rely on salmon to feed their communities.










Alaska Natives living along the Yukon faced a 70% increase in prediabetes, a 50% increase in malnutrition, and a 25% increase in diabetes after the salmon collapse, according to data collected by the TCC.


“There’s a lot of health implications of not having the king salmon in our diet because that’s when we get a lot of our nutrients. As Indigenous people, our DNA is … used to these kinds of traditional foods,” Potts-Joseph told Prism.
Alaska Natives living along the Yukon faced a 70% increase in prediabetes, a 50% increase in malnutrition, and a 25% increase in diabetes after the salmon collapse, according to data collected by the TCC. Research also shows salmon has protected Indigenous peoples from cancer and improves glucose tolerance.
“Normally, we would eat salmon two, three times a week all winter long, and now we don’t have any,” Potts-Joseph said while preparing a pot of moose and rice on the stove in her Eagle Village cabin. To combat food insecurity amid the salmon decline, some Alaska Natives are forced to turn to store-bought food to supplement their diets—and the expense is substantial. Food must be flown in by air cargo, costing 60 cents per pound for those in Fort Yukon and 73 cents per pound for those in Eagle. A trip to a major grocery store from Eagle in winter would also require a $320 airplane ticket.
 “Part of their confidence”

Potts-Joseph reflected on the cultural loss of the salmon during a walk between her home and her parents’ house in February. She said her mother belongs to the generation of Alaska Native children who were sent to boarding schools. Alaska Native families are still healing from the colonial violence of that forced assimilation under the guise of education. Compounding that harm is the loss of culture threatened by both the decline in salmon populations and the government’s refusal to allow Alaska Natives to practice their foodways.

From 1891 to 1969, the U.S. operated boarding schools with laws mandating the removal of Native American children from their families. Children as young as 6 years old were sent to boarding schools many miles from home. Alaska Native children were called by a number instead of their name, and they were beaten for speaking their own language. Nationwide, at least 973 Native American children died while attending the schools, according to an investigation by the U.S. Department of the Interior that concluded in 2024. The youngest among Alaska Natives who were sent to boarding schools are now in their 60s.
“It’s just so important for us to hold onto our culture in any way possible,” Potts-Joseph said, her boots crunching into the snow shimmering in the sunlight as she made her way toward a set of cabins.
Eagle has a self-sustaining economy with service industries, a general store and hotel, solar power plants, a wellness center, and an emergency medical service, said Ulvi, the Eagle Village chief.
Potts-Joseph raised her now-adult children before the salmon collapse, imparting traditional knowledge, skills, and generational values.
“That’s a part of their confidence. That’s a part of their self-worth. They know where they come from and what they, as just a young kid, can contribute,” she said.
Englishoe said the loss of salmon left a void for young people, because their summers were dedicated to fishing.
She remembers a time of salmon abundance as a young girl when her great-grandmother, Mariam James, gave her an entire bag of dried salmon skins, her favorite food and a treat that she always looked forward to when seeing them. James taught Englishoe to honor her relationship with the salmon, and now Englishoe’s ability to honor ancestors is lost with the salmon.
At funeral potlatches, which were banned by colonial laws for generations, salmon ceremonially sends the deceased into the afterlife. Holding funeral potlatches without salmon is a double loss to grieve.
 A long battle  

A combination of factors is contributing to the salmon decline. The ecosystem is transforming due to climate change, with rising water temperatures harming the cold-water fish and melting permafrost and sea ice altering the river’s composition. Other factors include increased competition with hatchery fish, commercial salmon fishing, bycatch (or salmon caught accidentally by pollock trawl fishers), and a fish disease called ichthyophoniasis, which plagues Yukon Chinook salmon in particular and is exacerbated by warmer waters.
“It’s all of those things happening simultaneously and unpredictably, because they interact with each other,” said Bathsheba Demuth, an environmental historian and professor at Brown University who has spent five years researching her book on Yukon River history.

The seven-year moratorium on fishing also established the Yukon River Panel, made up of 12 people from the U.S. and Canada, tasked with developing a comprehensive rebuilding plan for Chinook salmon.
The Alaska Salmon Research Task Force, established by an act of Congress in 2022, released a final report in 2024 identifying research gaps and priorities to address the salmon collapse. It recommended incorporating Indigenous knowledge into research examining the salmon life cycle in both the ocean and freshwater environments.
Any potential progress was halted when President Donald Trump signed executive orders to expand commercial fisheries and decrease marine protections, cutting funding for Alaska fisheries management and research. This cut included the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages bycatch limits. The council did not respond to multiple interview requests.










When we’re talking about the food that we’ve relied on for generations, for thousands of years, it’s hard to understand why our people aren’t involved at the table when we have the closest relationship to the salmon. 


– Mackenzie Englishoe


The bycatch limit for Chinook salmon is 60,000, double the total subsistence harvest in 2012 (which was the largest harvest in more than a decade), according to data collected by the TCC. There is no bycatch limit on chum salmon, a stock that has also collapsed. Chinook and fall chum are the only salmon species to reach the Yukon headwaters. By 2021, the subsistence harvest had dropped to zero for both species, the TCC data shows.
Indigenous communities along the river are now asking state managers for rights to co-manage the river.
“When we’re talking about the food that we’ve relied on for generations, for thousands of years, it’s hard to understand why our people aren’t involved at the table when we have the closest relationship to [the salmon],” Englishoe said.
Scientists have proposed multiple models aimed at rebuilding salmon stocks, and none of them indicate it could be done in less than 50 years. Alaska Natives like Englishoe likely view the time span differently than Western scientists. Indigenous practices are centered on their impact on future generations, operating on a different timescale from colonial governments. Colonialism, with its individualistic values, forces capitalistic rules onto Indigenous cultures centered on communal benefit.
Englishoe is taking on the fight for the salmon, knowing that she is unlikely to see an end to the battle in her lifetime.
“This is a generational task. It’s not just mine,” she said. “It’s my turn, though.”
 “The Yukon River has the right”

Before the salmon decline, during an August afternoon, Alaska Natives would have been sharing stories and salmon together at a fish camp. Following in the traditions of their nomadic ancestors, Alaska Natives built camps along the river where they spent long summer days catching and preparing fish under the midnight sun, smoking salmon for the winter and passing on traditions. Instead, on a recent August afternoon, some were gathered on a weekly conference call, known as the In-Season Salmon Management Teleconference,hosted by the Yukon River Drainage Fisheries Association. A woman on the call announced the progress of 12 Chinook salmon—10 males and two females—who were following their instincts 1,800 miles upstream on the Yukon River toward their spawning grounds, unaware their journey was a news item for an international audience.
Yukon River Chinook endure the longest migration of any salmon, traveling up to 2,000 miles upstream, the equivalent of swimming north to south along California’s coast twice. The salmon spend the majority of their adult lives in the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska, the base of operations for a $1.5 billion pollock industry. Salmon that survive to the end of their lifespan return to the Yukon to spawn, then die.
Salmon’s journey takes them through fisheries operated by the U.S. and Russia, through portions of the Yukon managed by the state of Alaska, and across the Canadian border, where First Nations manage the river.
“The regulatory tangle on the Yukon is so intense,” said Demuth, the environmental historian and university professor.
Land use agreements signed on each side of the border wildly differentiate the authority Alaska Natives and First Nations have over the river. First Nations are given autonomy to manage waterways in Canada, while Alaska law has no mandate to consult with Indigenous peoples in management, Demuth explained.
Demuth set off down the Yukon River in 2020, expecting to find lively fish camps all along the river, with kids running along the riverbank and people stopping by to visit and share news just as they did when she lived in Yukon Territory. Instead, she found them all empty.
Five years later, Englishoe said fish camps are deteriorating. The costs to maintain them cannot be justified when they are not being used to fish, and gas costs $11 per gallon.
“We can’t save those things anymore,” she said.
But Alaska Natives are determined to preserve their culture, and they are finding ways to do so.
“I’ll tell you what, the Gwitch’in are some tough people,” Potts-Joseph said. “We definitely won’t back down. We’ll continue to fight.”
Eagle Village hosted a culture camp in August aimed at preserving traditional skills, including fishing, language, and crafts. Ulvi, the Eagle Village Chief, told Prism a whitefish and a moose were used for demonstrations to pass on the skills from elders to young people. She also hosted gatherings for the village elders, and the TCC paid $2 million to provide salmon from commercial fisheries to its people.
An exception to the seven-year moratorium on Chinook fishing was added in June to allow for limited fishing for cultural and educational purposes. A representative of the Alaska Department of Fish & Game said during the August teleconference that they received a few applications after opening the program in June.
Still, Alaska Natives are calling on state decision-makers to take one simple step toward solving the salmon crisis: Listen to the Indigenous-led solutions.
“We have solutions, and they know what the solution is but they won’t do it because it’s money over anything,” Potts-Joseph said, referring to commercial fisheries and state managers.
Courtney Carothers is a professor of Fisheries and Ocean Science at the University of Fairbanks, where she is also part of the university’s Tamamta program, a graduate program that incorporates traditional knowledge into Western science. When it comes to fishery management in Alaska, Carothers said there is a chasm between the way state managers view salmon as a commodity and how Alaska Natives view salmon as a relative.

This resonated with Englishoe, who was told something by an elder on a recent trip to Whitehorse that she said she will never forget.
“He said, ‘Mother Nature will always provide for our needs, but never for our greeds,’” Englishoe recalled. “I think about that now every day.”
The Yukon River Drainage Fisheries Association is advocating for Native rights to manage the Yukon River, looking to federal and tribal co-management of Alaska’s Kuskokwim River and the Alaska Migratory Birds Co-Management Council as guides. Englishoe wants to go a step further and obtain “personhood” for the Yukon.
“All across the Yukon, we all know how influential this river is to us. We’ve planned our entire lives around this river, and our travels, our stories. It’s carried our fish, our canoes,” she said.
“So I look to the river—I’m looking at it right now—and I think that the Yukon River has the right to stay clean. The Yukon River has a right to feed its Indigenous people. The Yukon River has a right to host its salmon on the longest salmon run in the world. The Yukon River has a right to feed its own animals and its land,” she said. “And this is something I’m going to be fighting for for the rest of my life.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-05 00:15:36+00:00,CT Mirror,A CT special session? Lawmakers agree on issues — just not solutions,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/ct-special-session/,"From drafting a new version of H.B. 5002 to potential Trust Act revisions, lawmakers may not agree on solutions to key issues before October.","A consensus is emerging on what topics should be tackled in a special session of the General Assembly: Revisit a vetoed affordable housing bill, respond to federal spending cuts and policy changes, and consider ways to protect immigrants facing detention and potential deportation.
But how and when to address those things? That is a puzzle Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature’s Democratic majorities still are trying to solve.
There is no deal on a revised housing bill Lamont would sign, though he and one of the bill’s key backers, House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said Thursday they are making some progress. Nor is there agreement on how the state could strengthen its Trust Act.
Given the absence of a concrete action plan, Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney of New Haven said he sees little chance of a special session before mid-October.
“It’s all still pending,” Looney said.
As for the impact of federal fiscal and policy changes on Connecticut, the picture remains fuzzy. President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act has impacts on health insurance exchanges and Medicaid spending, but most will not be fully felt until after the midterm elections of 2026.
“I think most of us think we’re probably going to have a special session,” Lamont said. “You might as well have it when you know what’s going on, or we can just imagine a lot of worst case scenarios and set aside money.”
Lamont is to meet Friday with other New England governors via video to talk about a joint strategy to stabilize the health care exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, a target of the Trump administration.
“The big thing is they’re really going after the exchanges and the subsidies on the exchanges,” Lamont said. 
Rep Josh Elliott of Hamden, the Democratic state representative who is running for governor as a liberal alternative to Lamont, is working with labor to sign up colleagues for a press conference next week aimed at creating a sense of urgency for the governor to call a special session. 
He sent lawmakers a letter he intends to send to the governor and asked them to sign it.
“We, the undersigned members of the General Assembly, write to you with urgency and resolve. Connecticut families are facing mounting challenges, and we believe it is imperative to convene a special session to address them,” the letter says.
It proposes four issues to be included in the special session call: Protecting access to Medicare, Medicaid and SNAP; addressing housing instability; filling federal funding gaps; and protecting immigrant families. 
Recognizing his involvement could make the press conference a campaign event, Elliott told his colleagues he would neither speak at the press conference, nor emcee it.
“I’m trying to thread that needle,” Elliott said in an interview Thursday. “I’m very much trying not make this about me.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the topics in the letter are not surprising, but he notes there is no need to get a commitment from the governor on a detailed agenda, which is known as “the call.”
“The reality is, no matter what the governor does, or even if the legislature petitioned its way in, you can expand the call once you’re in. And so I actually think people worry too much about the call,” Ritter said.
Ritter saw no complications in Elliott, a potential rival for Lamont next year, trying to organize Democrats to pressure the governor.
“It’s political season, and these things will happen,” Ritter said. “But I would generally say, just objectively, I don’t know that there’s any disagreement or issues amongst the things that we’ve discussed with the administration or what’s being requested by whoever signs on to this.” 
In other words, the topics are fine. They just need to devise legislation addressing them.
On immigration and the Trust Act, Ritter said the leaders are awaiting suggestions from the Democratic co-chairs of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Gary Winfield of New Haven and Rep. Steve Stafstrom of Bridgeport.
“We’re in the midst of some really deep conversations about what is possible,” Winfield said.
The Trust Act, which is based on a constitutional provision that state and local law enforcement cannot be compelled to enforce federal immigration law, limits what information police and correction officers can share with Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents.
The original intention was make immigrants, regardless of legal status, comfortable in reporting crimes or testifying in court without fear of being detained by ICE. In recent months, there have been numerous reports of ICE officials arresting individuals attending immigration hearings at courthouses across the state and the country. 
“We’re certainly concerned about the escalation in and around the courts,” Stafstrom said. “That’s a real concern of mine. Courts should be a place where everyone feels they can go and receive justice without interference. The whole point of the Trust Act is to make people feel safe.”
Lamont and the leaders said there is little clarity about how much further the state can go strengthening its Trust Act; there is a fine line between not assisting ICE and obstructing it. Lamont said he has asked his general counsel to research it.
“I don’t know what we can do, what we can’t do yet,” he said.
Without a consensus on immigration or housing, legislators might still return in special session to address federal spending cuts — even if the full impact remains unknown.
If the governor and legislators wish to make money available to offset federal cuts, they most likely will have to take some action before the end of 2025 — or Treasurer Erick Russell would be required to use much of the $2.5 billion surplus from the fiscal year that ended on June 30 to pay down pension debt.
Russell is required by a 2017 law directing that traditionally volatile sources of revenue go to budget reserves up to a certain limit that already has been reached, then to the pension fund. 
“He intends to make the volatility transfer after a special session, if one happens, and no later than the end of the year,” said a spokesman, Brett Cody.
Lamont said he and Russell already have spoken about keeping some of those funds as a contingency to address the federal cuts.
“We’ve gone over some scenarios,” Lamont said. “So we have some idea of what we think are the worst case solutions, and what some of our efforts might be to backfill, not everything, but at least protect the most vulnerable.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0604_SR_SessionLastDay_240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 20:56:45.063109

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder (file photo)The Georgia secretary of state’s former chief operating officer, who soared to national prominence in the aftermath of the 2020 election, is launching a bid to become the state’s next top elections official. 
Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who has been one of the most prominent supporters of Georgia’s Dominion Voting Systems machines, spent over six years at the secretary of state’s office, where he oversaw the implementation of the state’s $104 million voting machine system ahead of the 2020 election.
A close ally of current Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Sterling made national news in 2020 after publicly calling on President Donald Trump to condemn threats to election workers after President Joe Biden’s narrow victory in the general election. He filed paperwork to run for secretary of state on Tuesday, but did not reply to a request for comment.
Raffensperger has not announced his plans for 2026.
Sterling joins a growing field of Republican candidates for secretary of state, many of whom have publicly opposed the voting systems Sterling has worked to implement. State Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican who currently chairs a House “blue ribbon” committee on elections, recently co-authored a letter to Raffensperger urging him to switch from electronic voting machines to hand-marked paper ballots. Kelvin King, a former Republican candidate for U.S. Senate and husband of State Election Board member Janelle King, has also called for hand-counts of ballots, citing concerns often raised by right-wing election activists about the security of voting machines. 
Senate Republicans have also advanced a bill that would phase out the use of voting machines. Legislators in the House could take up the issue as soon as January.
So far, Sterling, King and Fleming are the only candidates in the race for secretary of state. No major Democratic contenders have announced their candidacy.

(Photo by April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)The cyber attack that has crippled many of the State of Nevada’s services and websites did not compromise the state’s financial accounts or personal information data kept by the Department of Motor Vehicles, according to Gov. Joe Lombardo.
That was one of the few new details offered by the governor Thursday at a press conference on the cyber attack.
“To the best of our knowledge at this time, the data compromise did not include state financial information,” said Lombardo. “No state bank account, treasury funds, or state budget payment systems data appears to have been part of the breach.”
State officials previously confirmed that “some data” had been exfiltrated — moved outside the state network. Lombardo on Thursday said the exfiltration did not involve databases at the DMV, or client information at Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, better known as SNAP and TANF.
Lombardo emphasized that information was preliminary, repeating the phrase “to the best of our knowledge.”
“If investigators eventually discover otherwise, we will follow Nevada’s strict statutes about personal data breaches by notifying any affected individuals promptly and providing resources to help protect them,” he added.
Lingering questions about the nature of the cyber attack, such as the identity of the attacker or attackers, the scope of the data extracted, or whether a ransom has been demanded, remain unanswered. Lombardo repeatedly said he could not answer any questions related to the ongoing investigation.
“Transparency during a cyber incident must be balanced with security,” he said. “Public updates can sometimes trigger more attacks.”
Lombardo said his office will be transparent “when the time comes.”
He said staff has and continues to work “24/7” on the incident, including through the three-day Labor Day Weekend. He said the state is tracking the labor costs but that he did not have an estimate on what the current total is. He added that the state has an insurance policy for such attacks and he expects that to help with the cost.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are both involved in the investigation.
The cyber attack, which the state has described as “ransomware-based,” was discovered on Sunday, Aug. 24. The following day, state employees were put on administrative leave as state offices like the DMV were shuttered and unable to provide services.
Since then, many services have resumed in-person service but are still unavailable online. Information on the current status of various state services can be found at oem.nv.gov/recovery.
Lombardo said the typical recovery timeline is “several weeks to months,” citing an IBM study, and Nevada is “moving well ahead of that projection.”
He added that “tomorrow would be the goal” for restoring all state systems and services “but more realistically it should be the next few days.”
Lombardo, who faced criticism last week for not attending the first press conference about the cyber attack, was asked whether he thought his handling of the incident would have any affect on his campaign for re-election next year.
The first-term governor responded that he thought it would have “no effect.”

Judge William G. Young, during […]","Turbine tower components stand tall at the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal in April. (Photo by Eleonora Bianchi/The New Bedford Light)BOSTON — Massachusetts, and the wind projects that have invested millions to build off its coast, will have to wait a bit longer to see if a federal judge will provide any relief from President Donald Trump’s wind memorandum that has frozen offshore wind permitting for the last eight months.
Judge William G. Young, during a hearing on Thursday, again expressed some skepticism about the multistate lawsuit. In opening remarks, and during questioning to both parties, Young said that Trump has made his position against offshore wind very clear. So, if he were to rule in favor of the states (and against the memo), he asked what change it would make for the projects that have been stuck in permitting limbo. 
“[Trump’s] view of the presidency is, those people who are subordinate to me are going to follow my instructions. That’s the presidency as we know it today,” Young said. “Given the president’s view, where does that get you? … He’ll tell [agencies] to deny [permits] and they will, because they have to follow orders.”
Massachusetts Deputy Attorney General Turner Smith in response said that although that may be true, the states will address it case by case and permit by permit, if necessary.
“They may decide to issue or deny a permit,” Smith said. “Our hope is that the agencies would take to heart that they are required to follow applicable law in processing and issuing these permits.”
U.S. Department of Justice attorney Michael Robertson, on behalf of the federal government, argued the states have not sufficiently proven violations of cited laws, and that if the judge were to rule in their favor, it should be on a permit by permit and project by project level. 
Revolution Wind featured briefly in the hearing arguments. Late last month, the federal government issued a stop-work order on the under-construction project, citing Trump’s wind memo. 
“BOEM invoking the Wind Memorandum to halt the fully-permitted and mostly-constructed Revolution Wind project exemplifies how the Wind Memorandum harms, and will continue to harm, Connecticut, its residents, its investments, and its offshore wind industry,” wrote a Connecticut state official in a filing for the case. 
Hours before the hearing, Orsted, the project developer, filed a lawsuit against Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and several agencies over the Revolution Wind stoppage. In its filings, Orsted said the project is already losing millions of dollars per week, and that the longer the stop-work order remains in place, “the more likely it … will lead to the project’s termination.” 
Massachusetts and more than a dozen other states are ultimately asking Young to rule that Trump’s wind memo is illegal, vacate it, and prevent the administration from taking any action to delay or prevent wind energy development. 
The suit’s intervenor plaintiff, Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said it ultimately wants the judge to vacate the memo, but that it would be open to a remand, which would require the agencies to go beyond citing Trump’s wind memo to support their permitting freeze.
If the judge issues a remand, it means the federal government would have to provide such documentation to the court.
Young expressed some skepticism of the federal government’s standing with regards to this. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, agencies are required to explain their actions and undertake “reasoned,” not arbitrary, decisionmaking. The states argue that the agencies have failed to provide justification beyond Trump’s wind memo in their decision not to issue permits. 
As the Alliance for Clean Energy argued, the agencies cannot legally freeze permitting because “the president told me so” with his memo. 
An environmental attorney who has been following the case described Young as guarded and cautious during Thursday’s hearing. They said a remand would demand further explanation from the government, but it wouldn’t stop the actions the Trump administration is taking against the offshore wind industry. 
In recent weeks, the administration has ratcheted up its targeting of offshore wind, taking more than a dozen actions. In addition to the work stoppage at Revolution Wind, the federal government in other court cases has stated its intention to revoke project approvals for SouthCoast Wind (which is already in need of three permits) and New England Wind 1, a fully permitted project. 
The states argue the memo has caused significant harm — stymieing domestic investment, jeopardizing states’ abilities to supply enough electricity, and creating an “existential threat” to the industry.  
In recent filings, SouthCoast Wind, which has featured as a prominent voice — and the only developer voice — in the lawsuit, said Massachusetts, its agencies and businesses will lose out on millions of dollars and jobs if the project cannot move forward. (SouthCoast Wind is not a plaintiff, but has filed numerous affidavits with the court in support of the states’ claims.)
Among the harm the project has cited is a $15 million contract to an unnamed “local academic institution” to conduct scientific monitoring of the project, nearly $2.5 million to the National Offshore Wind Institute in New Bedford, and $33 million to MassCEC’s marine commerce terminal, also located in the city. 
“All of this funding will be delayed or potentially cancelled as a result of the indefinite delay attributable to the Presidential Memorandum,” wrote SouthCoast Wind CEO Michael Brown in one filing. If the pause continues, “MassCEC will not receive these payments which will impact its ability to execute capital improvements and support [New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal] operations.”
In June, Young partially allowed and partially denied the states’ several claims against the federal government over the wind memo. 
He ruled that the states have standing to bring this case, and that the permitting freeze — which has been assigned no deadline or timeline — is essentially a final agency decision (as opposed to an ongoing review) and as such, can be challenged by the states.
Attorneys general from the following states are challenging the wind memo through this suit, filed in May: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington. The District of Columbia is also a party.
The hearing lasted about 45 minutes. At its close, Young did not deliver any tentative rulings, as he did in June. He thanked the parties for their arguments and for answering his “genuine questions” on the matter.
“I expect to issue in due course a declaration of rights on this administrative record,” he told the parties. “We’ll see where we go from there.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The evening after state leaders announced they had decided to build a 1,300-bed “transformative” homeless campus in northwest Salt Lake City, the community’s fear and anger was palpable. 
About 100 people from west-side Salt Lake City crammed into a room at the Day-Riverside Library in Rose Park on Wednesday night, when state leaders listened to frustrations after they had already made the decision to purchase the property at 2520 N. 2200 West following a long, secretive search. 
Nicole and Matt Solt — who live closest to the site of the future homeless campus on a nearly 3-acre farm directly north of the property along 2200 West — were first of the neighbors to speak out. 
Utah officials unveil site for 1,300-bed homeless campus after long, secretive search

“I’ll be honest with you, if we knew this was coming, we would not have built such a beautiful barn a year ago,” Nicole Solt said, breaking down in tears while worrying that people experiencing homelessness would find it a “great location” to sleep. 
Nicole said she and her kids check their horses in the dark, morning and night, before she trailed off, her voice straining with emotion, before her husband interjected angrily. 
“Do you want me to send my wife out there every morning to feed my horses (with) Joe Blow laying there?” he said. “Sh-t’s going to go bad. You know it and I know it.” 
‘We want to care for the vulnerable’
The Solts, along with dozens of other neighbors, grilled State Homeless Coordinator Wayne Niederhauser and the state’s Homeless Services Board Chair Randy Shumway on why they thought it was a good idea to put the campus in a fairly remote location with little to no public transportation or other services. 
Niederhauser and Shumway said no location is perfect, but it was the best available parcel they could find after more than a year of searching that was the right size for the envisioned campus, which they have described as key to not only increase the state’s strained emergency shelter capacity but also transform the state’s homeless services system to be more “healing” but also “accountable.” 
Shumway said it’s fair for the neighborhood to be angry, but he guessed that “a lot of your fear” and anger comes from questions around whether the campus will be “a place that’s helping people or … a place that’s permissive and allows absolute lawlessness in our community.” He said “we have got to prevent” the latter scenario.

“We want to care for the vulnerable. We need to have a place of healing and rescue. But simultaneously, we also have to be tremendous neighbors,” Shumway said. 
Most of the neighbors’ concerns centered around the future homeless campus’ impact on property values and neighborhood safety. 
“There’s no security out there,” said Nicole Green, who lives off of 2200 West, adding that she already fears for her 10-year-old daughter’s safety because of people speeding down the street. 
Tears rolling down her face, Green urged state leaders to prioritize security “for all of us, not just them,” especially if people experiencing homelessness end up on their properties. 
“We all go outside at night to check our animals,” she said. “Is that just not an option anymore?”
Niederhauser and Shumway tried repeatedly to emphasize that safety and security will be a top priority for the campus, which they envision as a facility different from any other homeless shelter so far built in Utah. 
They described it as a secure, fenced off campus where people experiencing homelessness won’t want or need to leave because all of their services — including mental health, substance abuse treatment, and medical — will be provided on site.

“We have got to do it differently and better and take into account your safety over everything else,” Shumway said. 
“Our priority is that they would exit and enter by shuttle,” Niederhauser said. “Our whole design is that we want to give reasons to stay on campus. That’s the whole idea.” 
But for neighbors, more questions than answers — and skepticism — remained by the end of the hourlong meeting, though Niederhauser promised there would be more community meetings in coming weeks and months to field comments, questions and complaints. 
‘I should have violated closed session law’
Several neighbors questioned why they learned of the decision early Wednesday only after it had already been made. Green said she found out about it while at work in the middle of the day. 
“What the hell is that?” she said. 
As state officials have said before while declining to reveal what properties Niederhauser and his team had been considering, Shumway cited privacy considerations for real estate transactions. 
“By law there was confidentiality that all of us had to maintain until 7 a.m. this morning,” Shumway said. “By law.” 
But one city leader expressed regret for not telling people sooner, even if it would have broken the law.

Her voice straining with emotion, Salt Lake City Councilmember Victoria Petro — who was in closed-door meetings regarding that real estate contract between Salt Lake City and the state — apologized to neighbors that “I didn’t violate closed session rules to get you information so that your voice could be heard.”
“I’m sorry. I should have violated closed session law. I should have taken the misdemeanor,” Petro said. “I should have told you.”
Bobby Taylor, another resident who lives off of 2200 West, called building a campus near a remote, agricultural neighborhood a “horrible idea.” 
“Crime’s going to go up. The drug dealers are going to follow them. We’re all going to lose our property values,” Taylor said.

He said the state will be putting “people that do not subscribe to the social contract we all do” with people who just “want to be left alone.” 
“If we are going to endure this thing that nobody wants for obvious reasons, there ought to be some things that we can ask for, like waiving property tax within a certain radius,” he said. 
Another neighbor asked if the city would consider allowing residents “the opportunity to streamline their zoning” to manufacturing — since the area has already been trending in that direction as more warehouses are being built — so they can “get out” before the campus is built. 
Petro said city leaders hadn’t considered that, but it’s something she’s willing to explore. 
West-side burdens
As emotions ran high at the onset of the meeting, Petro told her constituents that they were right to be angry, especially because she said west-side Salt Lake City already carries beyond its fair share of social services — like the prison and other homeless facilities — and environmental concerns from the Utah Inland Port Authority. 
“It is not just this instance that’s causing you to be angry (or) me to be angry,” she said. “It is the years of disregard. It is the fact that they’re turning us into 1970s Newark, New Jersey, with smoke stacks and tenements. … We don’t have enough grocery stores and we don’t have amenities that we can walk to. And no one’s going to want to do business if we keep consolidating poverty and chasing away industry.” 
“So your anger is right,” Petro added. “But the other truth I know about you is that you’re the most resilient community on the planet. I’ve literally chosen to raise my kids here among you because of who you are. … We are a community that accepts every challenge with grace and resilience.”

While Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall — who has been urging state leaders to act quickly to expand the state’s homeless shelter capacity and other services — said in a statement she supported the homeless campus site, Petro said she will “not even come close” to supporting it until “there is a real strategy” to fully fund and operate the campus safely and effectively. 
She especially took issue with Shumway for blaming Salt Lake City for “permissive” policies that he said has allowed “lawlessness” in parts of the city. 
“I want real evidence-based solutions, not culture war solutions,” she said. “And when those solutions are identified, there has to be (adequate) funding.” 
Top Republican leaders are supportive, but will lawmakers fully fund it?
Niederhauser told Utah News Dispatch he expects it will take roughly $75 million in one-time money to build the campus’ infrastructure, then “north of $30 million” a year to operate it. 
Niederhauser’s office last year got about $24 million to purchase land and start building the campus, but he acknowledged it will be a “heavy lift” to lobby the 2026 Utah Legislature for more funding, while also engaging with other private funders. But that’s something he’ll be working on. 
One of Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, issued a statement Wednesday expressing gratitude for Niederhauser’s “exhaustive efforts to secure land” for the campus. 
“To succeed, this new campus must offer more than just shelter; it must deliver real accountability through treatment, recovery, and long-term stability, or it will fail like every half-measure before it,” Schultz said. “If done correctly, this transformative campus has the opportunity to improve public safety, clean up our cities, and change lives.”
Schultz also said he plans to work with the Utah Homeless Services Board to take “full advantage” of President Donald Trump’s recent executive order that upended the federal government’s support for “Housing First” policies. 
While national homelessness advocates say Housing First is a proven approach to help end homelessness by prioritizing housing as an essential need first, Schultz said Trump’s executive order “squarely aligns federal agencies with Utah’s focus on public safety, support, and accountability.”

Schultz said that could also include “exploring opportunities to reprioritize existing resources to improve public safety and achieve lasting outcomes.” 
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox also issued a statement Wednesday expressing support for the campus, calling it a “place where law enforcement, service providers, and local leaders will work together to ensure safety and accountability, both inside the center and in the surrounding neighborhoods.” 
“Shelter alone is not enough; we must pair it with treatment, recovery, and a path to long-term stability,” Cox said. “By engaging the public throughout this process, we can build a system that improves safety, restores order, and helps people rebuild their lives.”

(Sept. 4, 2025) — A new civic-education initiative will spotlight one of Delaware’s most defining moments when the Caesar Rodney Institute (CRI) and the Institute on the Constitution present Caesar Rodney’s Midnight Ride as part of a Constitution Day program later this month.
The Sept. 17 event at the DuPont Country Club in Wilmington will feature a live theatrical retelling of Rodney’s 80-mile overnight journey to Philadelphia, where he cast Delaware’s decisive vote for independence in 1776. A second program is scheduled for Oct. 23 at the Boardwalk Plaza Hotel in Rehoboth Beach.

Following the performance, radio host Rick Jensen will moderate a panel with CRI policy experts, who will address some of Delaware’s most pressing issues, including energy, education, healthcare and the economy.
The program also marks the launch of Caesar Rodney 250, CRI’s ongoing civic series commemorating America’s Semiquincentennial in 2026. Organizers said the goal is to connect the nation’s founding ideals to the challenges facing Delawareans today.
“Individual liberty thrives when citizens are informed,” said Dr. Michelle Parsons, CRI’s board chair. “By connecting our founding history to today’s decisions, this series encourages Delawareans to reflect, engage, and take part in shaping our democratic future.”
For many, Rodney’s ride is more than a dramatic episode in history—it embodies a spirit of personal sacrifice and conviction that resonates with center-right values today. His determination to secure Delaware’s voice for independence underscores the principle that individual courage and commitment to liberty can tip the balance in shaping a nation. Supporters of the series say the retelling is timely, reminding citizens of the enduring need for limited government, personal responsibility and vigilance in protecting freedoms.
By revisiting Rodney’s example, CRI organizers argue Delawareans can draw strength from the nation’s founding to confront modern debates. Just as Rodney’s decisive action changed the course of history, informed citizens today, they say, must stand ready to ensure that liberty and self-governance remain at the heart of American democracy.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana’s top election official said she has discovered 390 non-citizen registered voters in the state, with 79 voting in at least one election over the past several decades. 
The 390 suspected non-citizen voters represent approximately 0.016% of the roughly 2.4 million registered voters in Louisiana. 
Secretary of State Nancy Landry, a Republican said Thursday at a news conference she called that the results are the “preliminary findings” of an investigation her office launched in May after gaining access to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database, which the Trump administration rolled out to state and local governments this year. 
Landry said her investigators ran names from Louisiana’s voter rolls through the SAVE database and worked with the FBI to confirm their citizenship status. Investigators scoured state voting records going back to the 1980s, she said. 
Landry declined to release further details about the suspects of the incidents of alleged fraud, saying her investigation remains ongoing.  
In a later interview, Landry acknowledged the possibility that some of her findings could be attributed to errors or outdated information. Suspected non-citizen voters will be afforded due process to determine if they are innocent, she said. 
While Landry said voter fraud is “not a systemic problem in Louisiana,” she noted that some local elections have been decided by just a handful of votes. She didn’t say if the newly discovered noncitizen voters impacted any of those elections. 
It’s a crime under state and federal laws for noncitizens to vote or to submit false voter registration information. Landry said her office is working with local and federal authorities to determine if anyone implicated in her findings can be prosecuted. 
Gov. Landry targets ‘noncitizens’ in Louisiana, claiming immigrants pose voter fraud risk

The secretary of state’s investigators have not interviewed or spoken to any of the alleged suspects but have sent out letters notifying them of the findings, she said. 
Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, who chairs the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee, attended Landry’s news conference alongside his counterpart in the House, Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia. Kleinpeter authored recent changes for stricter state elections laws and said he was surprised that only 79 noncitizens have voted in Louisiana over so many years.
Kleinpeter said he thought the number would be higher, adding that even one unlawful vote is too many.
“Every illegal vote counts against a legal vote,” Kleinpeter said in an interview. 
One voting rights advocate questions why the secretary of state would go public with preliminary findings of an investigation before all the evidence has been collected. 
Ashley Shelton, who leads the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, noted that state investigators haven’t spoken to any of the alleged suspects. 
“Why do a press conference if you’re not really sure, or you don’t have undeniable evidence that the allegations are true?” Shelton said in a phone interview. “Of course everybody wants elections to have integrity, but there’s a reason why they had to go back to the 1980s to uncover the alleged 79 people.”
Shelton said bigger problems with election integrity stem from the way they are administered and failure to educate poll workers and voters when election rules are changed. 
“Voting rights are under attack,” Shelton said. “We have so many elections we can’t even keep count, and there’s no willingness to streamline the process.”

“The numbers don’t lie: Detroit has become a hub for violent crime,” Rogers, a Republican, said in a statement published on his campaign website Thursday. “These aren’t just statistics – they’re people and families, whose lives have been flipped upside down because they aren’t even safe in their own community anymore. We have got to make our cities safe again.”
Despite that assertion, Detroit saw a 19% drop in homicides in 2024, from 252 in 2023 to 203 last year, the lowest rate in more than 50 years. Nonfatal shootings, meanwhile, were down 25% year-over-year, from 804 in 2023 to 606 last year.
Regardless, Rogers, a former Michigan congressman, called on Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan to reach out to Trump to request federal intervention.
“The Mayor of Detroit should be on the phone with the President now calling for backup,” Rogers said.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDuggan, a lifelong Democrat who is running an independent campaign for governor, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.
The proposal drew immediate condemnation from U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who likened the call to the 1967 deployment of the National Guard during the Detroit uprising — a move that resulted in over 40 deaths and widespread destruction.
“Mike Rogers just called to deploy the National Guard to Detroit,” Stevens said in a statement. “Was wrong in ’67 and it’s wrong now. This is exactly why I introduced a bill to stop Trump’s abuse of power, because this chaos won’t stop in someone else’s community. It’ll come to ours unless we do something.”
Stevens referenced her “Stop Trump’s Abuse of Power Act,” a bill she introduced earlier this year to limit presidential authority in deploying federal forces domestically without congressional approval. It was referred to the House Armed Services Committee, where it is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives.
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) also condemned Rogers, referring to her statement last year when Trump, on the campaign trail, denigrated Detroit.
“As a proud elected representative of tens of thousands of Detroiters: F*** this guy. Don’t come back,” McMorrow posted.
Stevens and McMorrow are among the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in the August 2026 primary, along with former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed and research health specialist Rachel Howard.

And Kansas […]","State Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, presents legislation that would redraw Missouri's congressional map to a House committee on Thursday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications). If a new Missouri congressional map endorsed by President Donald Trump is put into place, voters living on Kansas City’s east side will share a congressional district with people living nearly four hours away in Osage County. 
Anyone living in downtown Kansas City would be in a district stretching south nearly to Springfield. And Kansas Citians living north of the Missouri River would be in a district running to the border of Iowa and Illinois. 
All of those voters currently reside in the 5th Congressional and are represented by 11-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. 
But under the proposed new map, which was approved Thursday by a Missouri House committee after more than five hours of public testimony, that district would be carved up in hopes of creating another Republican-leaning seat.
“This is a superior map than the one we have today,” said state Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Noel Republican sponsoring the redistricting legislation. 
Missouri has eight congressional districts, with Democrats holding two. 
Trump, facing a potentially difficult midterm election cycle next year, has instructed GOP-controlled states to redraw maps to add more Republican seats. 
Even though mid-decade redistricting in Missouri is nearly unheard of — it hasn’t happened in six decades, following a U.S. Supreme Court decision — Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into session this week to redraw the map so the GOP would hold nearly seven of the state’s seats in the U.S. House.
Republicans Thursday downplayed any role Trump’s demands had on the gerrymandering push. And they insisted the map was drawn by the governor’s staff, not the White House.
Democrats didn’t buy it, denouncing the map as unconstitutional and the push to split up Kansas City for partisan gain as “morally corrupt and inexcusable.”
“Every Missourian deserves fair representation, not these political tricks,” said state Rep. Mark Sharp, a Kansas City Democrat. “My city, Kansas City, hangs in the balance right here, right now.”
State Rep. Mark Sharp, a Kansas City Democrat, speaks in opposition to a proposed congressional map during a House committee hearing on Thursday (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
The Missouri Constitution calls for the legislature to draw new congressional districts every 10 years after new census numbers are certified to the governor. That happened in 2022, and Democrats argue it violates the state constitution to draw another map before the next census is complete. 
There are also questions about whether relying on old population data could also violate the state and federal constitution. 
The Missouri NAACP filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Cole County arguing the governor’s decision to call a special session was unconstitutional. Cleaver has also promised to go to court to challenge any gerrymandered map lawmakers approve.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, on Thursday demanded demographic information about the map be made available to the public before the committee took a vote. 
“I’m asking for information for the public and for this committee,” Aune said. “We deserve to have that information, and if you are not willing to provide it, what are you hiding? 
She also pressed Deaton whether the governor’s office actually drew the map, or whether it was crafted by the Trump administration. She noted Trump last week praised the map and instructed Missouri lawmakers to approve it “AS IS.”
The proposed new map meets constitutional requirements of districts with equal population as precisely as possible, Deaton said, and is more compact and contiguous, and divides fewer communities, than the current map. 
He said the governor was clear that his staff drew the proposed map.
“Gov. Kehoe has never lied to me,” Deaton said, “so I take him at his word.”
The only person to testify in favor of the proposed new map was Susan Klein, executive director of Missouri Right to Life. She said her organization is committed to helping pass anti-abortion legislation and supporting anti-abortion elected officials. 
“We support the process that would increase those numbers,” she said.
A parade of critics testified against the map, including the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, the Missouri NAACP, the League of Women Voters and several residents of the 5th District. 
Shannon Cooper, a lobbyist for the city of Kansas City and former Republican lawmaker, said the proposed map “chops our region into three different pieces.” The needs of downtown Kansas City, he said, are different than the needs of rural Henry County.
“I have gone through three redistricting processes in my time here, and what is sorely lacking in this is the amount of public input and the time where, in the past, the committees have traveled across the state and gone into communities and taken the local input from citizens, businesses as well as elected local officials to see what they care about and how they want to be put into those districts,” he said. “And we’re going to do this in six or eight hours and vote it out Monday and Tuesday.”
Phil Scaglia, testifying on behalf of Cleaver, who could not attend Thursday’s hearing, said the map violates the “one person, one vote” principle by relying on old census data. It also unconstitutional, Scaglia argued, because it “fails to be compact and divides communities of interest.”
The new map could be still be redrawn in a way that includes all of Kansas City south of the river in the 5th District, Scaglia said, and still give Republicans the electoral advantage in the district they are seeking.
State Rep. Don Mayhew, a Republican from Crocker, countered that he believes Kansas City would benefit by being represented by three members of Congress instead of only one.
Missouri Republicans are pushing to enact this map to revise congressional district lines in a special session. The GOP’s goal is to win the 5th District seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat (Screenshot from Missouri House website).
The proposed new map leaves two districts untouched — the 7th District in southwest Missouri and 8th District in southeast Missouri, both represented by Republicans. It only tinkers with the 1st District, based in St. Louis and represented by Democrat Wesley Bell. 
The 2nd District, represented by Republican Ann Wagner, moves south of the Missouri River, taking in southern St. Louis suburbs along with Gasconade,  Crawford, Jefferson and Washington counties. 
The 3rd District, represented by Republican Bob Onder, swaps territory with the 2nd, taking over all of St. Charles and Warren counties, adding Audrain, Lincoln, Monroe, Pike and Ralls counties as it stretches north to Hannabil and encompasses nearly all of Columbia.
The 4th and 6th Districts are where the Kansas City voters who previously all lived in the 5th will be moved. 
The 4th District loses parts of Columbia, along with Sedalia and Warrensburg to the 5th District in order to pick up downtown Kansas City. It is represented by Republican Mark Alford. 
The 6th District runs across the entire northern half of the state, picking up a piece of Kansas City north of the Missouri River. 
It’s the 5th District that sees the most substantial changes. Previously encompassing nearly all of Kansas City, the district now only includes the city’s east side, then stretches east to encompass Jefferson City all the way to Phelps County. It also includes the northern portion of Boone County, but not the Democrat-leaning areas of Columbia. 
The 5th District also picks up six counties from the 3rd District — Cole, Cooper, Howard, Maries, Moniteau and Miller counties as well as Morgan County from the 4th District.
Sharp asked Deaton Thursday whether he would be open to changing the map, even in small ways. Deaton said the map was produced and requested by the governor, and he “can’t imagine myself at this time supporting any changes.” 
“You move one line to make one person happy,” Deaton said, “and you have to move seven other lines and you’ve got seven new enemies… this is the map I’m supporting.” 
As the committee was preparing to vote on the proposed map, Sharp offered an amendment moving a small portion of south Kansas City in the Hickman Mills area — around 12,000 voters — back into the 5th District. The change would be balanced out by moving voters near Grain Valley to the 4th District.
Republicans opposed the change, and Sharp withdrew the amendment.
Aune said the entire process “reeks of an authoritarian power grab.”
State Rep. Richard West, a Wentzville Republican and chair of the committee, praised the map for moving all of St. Charles County into the same district. 
“My county is currently split up,” he said. “This is going to make us whole.”
State Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, pushed back on the idea that what Republicans are doing by redrawing the map is out of the ordinary in American politics.
“I’m not saying we should gerrymander or we shouldn’t,” he said, adding: “I’m just saying it’s been part of the republic from the beginning.”
The Missouri House is expected to debate the proposed new map on Monday and send it to the Senate on Tuesday.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gt38Uggw.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 18:57:25.210293

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Davona Williams transferred to Michigan after ICE arrest in Manchester.","After a week detained in a Vermont facility following her arrest in Manchester, Davona Williams vanished from the state Department of Corrections system Tuesday morning, leaving her lawyers and family unsure of her whereabouts for around 24 hours. 
Williams, 42, is originally from Jamaica and has lived in the United States for about 17 years, according to her attorney, Christopher Worth, a visiting assistant professor at the Center for Justice Reform at Vermont Law and Graduate School. Williams was in the midst of a yearslong process to gain legal status and was living in Manchester with her partner and three children, he said.
Wednesday morning, Williams called a family member and told them she had been transferred from the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility to the North Lake Processing Center in Detroit, Michigan, Worth said.

The federal online system is supposed to notify legal representatives of transfers in immigration cases, but Worth said he was not notified. Williams has yet to appear in the federal ICE detainee locator, which reflects an “imperfect system,” he said.
The Bennington Banner first reported Williams’ move to the Michigan facility.
On the morning of Aug. 25, Williams was pulled over by ICE officials in unmarked cars, who were carrying out a prior order to have Williams deported, which was issued in 2013, Worth said. Williams was given time to call a family member to pick up her 18 month old son who was with her at the time of the arrest before she was transported to Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, he said. 
While she remains in Michigan, Williams’ case is being litigated in the Boston Immigration Court. Since taking on the case last Thursday, Worth said filed an emergency stay so she could remain in the country. After a judge granted the motion, Worth said his next step is to argue against the 2013 order with the goal of having it dropped. 
Worth said he did not file a petition to prevent her from being transferred out of state because the most “pressing issue” in a short time frame was to block deportation.
“Davona is staying strong in the face of a challenging legal system that is stacked against her,” Worth said.
Rutland NAACP President Mia Shultz said it was scary to learn early Tuesday morning that Williams had disappeared from the system, and that ICE detention has been tough on Williams and her family. But Shultz said the local community has rallied around the family by starting a GoFundMe campaign to help her family pay bills during the immigration proceedings.
“She is beloved by her community,” Shultz said. “We’re trying to ensure the things she built here stay intact.”

(Photo courtesy of Luther College)Work completed ahead of the new school year by veteran and aspiring anthropologists at Luther College could help locate now-forgotten burial sites and survey archeological finds before putting shovel to dirt.
Luther College anthropology professor Colin Betts, joined by three student researchers, spent the summer visiting historical cemeteries, laying out grids and slowly moving through them with special equipment, to identify possible unmarked graves buried long ago.
The group surveyed three cemeteries in Winneshiek County, each with unique aspects that students had to take into account. Each cemetery also yielded different data for the researchers to analyze, and served as important teaching grounds for the students, who said they gained valuable knowledge they’ll be able to apply to their future work.

Tools for testing and teaching
To best identify potential graves, the team utilized three different instruments to gather data — magnetic gradiometry, soil resistivity and ground penetrating radar. Magnetic gradiometry and soil resistivity tools use different methods to find where soil has been disturbed, like when a grave is dug and then refilled. Ground penetrating radar sends electromagnetic waves underground that bounce energy back when encountering different materials in the soil.
These tools allowed the team to examine larger areas and receive information faster, than if they had employed the usual tool — digging — to find what’s underneath the surface.
“It’d never replace traditional archeological methods, but it can add a whole lot to it,” Betts said.
Benson Newhouse, a Luther College junior and one of the students who worked with Betts this summer, said he was excited to be able to train on the remote sensing equipment, as those skills and knowledge will serve as an asset when he graduates and pursues a career in archeology.
While many graduate programs have access to this equipment, Betts said Luther is unique in being able to offer undergraduate students the chance to learn with them.
“It’s wonderful for me because it’s a great research tool, it’s great data, but on the other hand, it’s just a fantastic teaching tool, so students like Benson can get that practical experience,” Betts said. “They can learn how to use the instruments, how to interpret the data, all that other fun stuff. So it’s just an integral part of what I do.”
The group conducted tests at Big Canoe Norwegian Methodist Cemetery, Springwater Cemetery and Crossroads/Metcalf Cemetery. Weather caused the occasional problem with equipment measurements and the ability to complete the work in a timely manner, but Betts said they found promising signs at both Springwater and Big Canoe of what could be unmarked graves.

Betts and the students are still going through the data they collected from the cemeteries, which they will use to craft presentations and a report. With information provided to the Winneshiek County Pioneer Cemetery Commission on areas where graves could be, Betts said staff can use it to better manage the cemeteries and avoid unearthing bodies unexpectedly. The commission was happy to see an initial presentation from Betts in August, he said.
“They were really excited, because they were seeing it in ways they hadn’t and could already see the value in some of that stuff,” Betts said.
Even with all the data collected by the team, student researcher Rebecca Zheng said they can’t say with complete certainty whether the indications of shifted dirt and different objects under the earth are actually the coffins from graves lost to time.
If an object detected by the equipment has very similar dimensions to that of a coffin and is measured at the correct depth for a burial, Betts said they can be “pretty sure,” but that’s the furthest they can go with the equipment they used.
“We can say that this anomaly has all the characteristics of (a grave), but the only way to know would actually be to dig it up,” Zheng said. “And I hope we can develop our ability to do these things and not have to excavate as much as our predecessors.”
A first step with big potential 
One inherent problem with traditional archeology methods is that once researchers dig up a site, they’ve potentially destroyed areas or objects of interest by virtue of disturbing the space. There are “no do-overs in using traditional techniques,” Betts said, and when burial sites and human remains are involved, there are moral and ethical reasons for not disturbing the area.
However, this equipment can provide an avenue for gathering at least some information about an area before anyone starts digging, Luther College student and research team member Evan McElroy said.
“It’s a perfect first step for any sort of archeology work that you do anywhere, because if you have an area where you want to dig into, being able to use this in advance is super necessary to guarantee the integrity of the site,” McElroy said.
Betts and the students said the equipment could also be used  to identify gravesites at indigenous boarding schools, where Native American children were taken from their families and forced to attend.
The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs identified four boarding school locations across Iowa as of Jan. 1, 2024.  Betts said he would be interested in using the technology to help locate some of these gravesites, but no official project has been initiated.
Zheng, who said her interests lie more with cultural anthropology, said the use of noninvasive equipment will be important to expand historical and cultural knowledge.
“It’s emphasizing the context that archeological monuments, whatever they may be, are within, and how that is so important just for everything that’s involved, whether it be people or history or things like that,” Zheng said.

In a rare media appearance, Vermont’s top federal prosecutor joined U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in Florida to tout successful arrests of alleged human traffickers smuggling people into the United States. 
Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont Michael Drescher, along with law enforcement peers from Texas and Florida, celebrated the expanding work of Joint Task Force Alpha, a U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security partnership targeting human smuggling and trafficking operations in Mexico and Central America. 
What once might have been considered a southern border issue has increasingly shown up at the country’s northern border with Canada, according to the country’s top law enforcement official. 
“We are investigating and prosecuting their crimes more aggressively than ever, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” Bondi said. 
Drescher highlighted the recent arrest of Norma Linda Lozano, charged with seven criminal counts including conspiracy to commit “alien smuggling.” She allegedly attempted to profit off transporting people who were in Vermont illegally after they entered from Canada. Lozano’s indictment was unsealed Wednesday, according to federal court records. 
“Offenses such as those charged pose a risk to the nation’s security,” Drescher said, noting Lozano allegedly trafficked children, one of whom was located alongside luggage in her vehicle. 
“I especially want to thank you, Attorney General Bondi, for bringing attention to the extraordinary work that the men and women of the United States Border Patrol and Homeland Security Investigations are doing in Swanton Sector,” he said, “the portion of the U.S.-Canada border that includes Vermont, northern New York and New Hampshire.”
Bondi touted Joint Task Force Alpha’s work, part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to eliminate international drug cartels. The Trump administration has labeled some of these organizations as terrorist groups.
On Tuesday, the U.S. military carried out an airstrike on a boat Trump said contained members of the Venezuelan cartel Tren De Aragua. Eleven people were killed, the NYTimes reported, and Trump said the boat was transporting drugs.  
At the Thursday press conference, Bondi characterized the southern border with Mexico as “secured,” a change she said was shifting cartel activities to the U.S. border with Canada. 
“As our U.S. attorney in Vermont knows,” she said, then referencing the northern border, “it’s gotten much worse.”

At 317 miles long, the Cowboy Trail is the nation’s longest rails-to-trails conversion project, stretching from Norfolk on the east to Chadron on the west on the abandoned Chicago & Northwestern rail line. The rail line was dubbed “the Cowboy Line” because it traverses some of Nebraska’s best cattle country.

Events on Friday begin at 9 a.m. with a bike ride from Valentine eastward to the Arabia Ranch. The ride is either 16 miles to the ranch, with shuttles available, or 32 miles out and back.
Dinner will be served from 5-7 p.m. at the Valentine trailhead for those who preregistered. A free social hour will follow until 8:30 p.m. on the iconic railroad bridge that spans the Niobrara River east of Valentine, with a shuttle available.
A crushed limestone trail exists between Norfolk and Valentine, spanning about 187 miles, but the portion west of Valentine to Gordon remains to be built. About 17 miles of trail were built from Gordon to Rushville in recent years, and a segment westward to near Chadron is expected to be built in 2026.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Zina Crum was already feeling sentimental when she opened up Zina’s Blue Corn Cafe on Thursday morning for the opening day of the New Mexico State Fair —even with 10 days left.
She’s run the restaurant during the fair for the last 23 years, she told Source New Mexico between Navajo Taco and frybread orders. Moving the fair from its home for the last 87 years, which a newly created board is now considering, could mean fewer local vendors and less New Mexico flavor, she said. 
“The State Fair is going to lose the State Fair-ness, you know, like the red and green chile, made fresh, authentic,” she said, if it moves elsewhere. She credits the existing site and kitchen, at least in part, with her restaurant inventing the blue corn Navajo Taco. 
In the most recent legislative session, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 481, which creates a new district board that is empowered to raise property taxes and issue up to $500 million in bonds to revamp the Expo New Mexico site where the fair now occurs. 
One of the board’s first actions at its first meeting in July was to award $850,000 to design firm Stantec to come up with master plan options for the current fairgrounds, including “identifying potential new sites for the annual New Mexico State Fair,” according to its contract. The firm has eight months to come up with options.

Martin Chavez, a former Albuquerque mayor who is spearheading the Expo New Mexico redevelopment for the governor, told Source on Thursday that the master plans are expected by February. They’ll include at least one option that contemplates the State Fair leaving its current site, and at least one option with a brand new arena, he said, that would be “transformational for the area.”
The master plan will also propose sites to move the fair to, Chavez said, though he believes only a handful of options exist that are centrally located, with multiple roads leading to at least 220 acres of space. The other areas are in northern Valencia County, along with the west sides of Albuquerque and Rio Rancho, he said. 
“What a new modern fair looks like and how much real estate it occupies, that’s still an unknown,” he said. “And there’s a lot of work to engage in to make those decisions.”
The new board’s members include New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), among other state and local leaders. 
New State Fair board meets, mulling International District revival and $500m investment

Board members stressed in July that no decision has been yet made about what will happen with the fair, but they spoke at length about what the site could look like in its absence. Some options include mixed-income housing, an arena or other commercial opportunities that would exist year-round. 
Lujan Grisham has previously touted the windfall of new spending on the fairgrounds as a way to tackle the state’s housing shortage and invest in an area known for high crime and poverty. She said in a December news release that the state-owned land “in the heart of New Mexico’s largest city presents a unique opportunity to create badly needed new housing for the workforce, while spurring massive private investment.”
The board met again in August to hear about the economic impacts of existing businesses, including the fair and a weekly flea market, along with statistics about crime in the neighborhood. The board will meet again on Sept. 25, said Peter Belletto, a neighborhood association leader and board member, in an email this week to Source. No agenda has been released.

Dan Mourning, general manager of Expo and the State Fair, told Source New Mexico in an interview at the fairgrounds Thursday that he applauds all the new investment. He also said he thinks the fair can continue at its current site while also accomplishing the board’s objectives for the site and surrounding neighborhoods. 
“I’m glad that they’ve done that in the Legislature, and the governor, more importantly, have taken that bold move to do something unique, something different,” he said. “And I think we can repurpose this property and look at it, but I still believe that, in my opinion, we can still have a State Fair here too.”
While he stressed that the decision is out of his hands, he did list the benefits of having the State Fair at its current site and also of having the large site empty at least part of the year. During natural disasters, for example, equipment is often staged there temporarily, he said, including trailers for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims in 2022. And the state stood up a massive COVID-19 vaccine testing site there, he noted.
“We learned a lot from the pandemic, and we are here for the people in New Mexico” he said. “So anytime they’re in trouble, we’ll pitch in to take care of it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0886-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 18:57:25.210293

Roger Marshall of Kansas describes, with signage, the number of vaccines U.S. children typically receive by the age of 18 during a Sept. 4, 2025, hearing of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Senate Finance Committee livestream)TOPEKA — In a rare moment of reprieve for U.S. health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as he faced a grueling group of senators Thursday, U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas gave him the opportunity to explain his views on vaccines and leadership.
Democrats and Republicans alike expressed their distaste and concern for Kennedy’s decisions as leader of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during a roughly three-hour hearing before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. Kennedy defended staff turnover, the erosion of vaccine investment and funding stalls.
But Marshall spent his allotted five minutes leveling with the secretary.
“One of your themes for the CDC is transparency,” Marshall said.
Part of that transparency, he said, is sharing what Kennedy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention know about vaccines so parents can be better equipped to make decisions. An aide standing behind Marshall held a large sign containing a graphic depicting the current CDC recommendations for vaccinations for children.
“By the time they’re 18 months, they’ve had 18 jabs,” Marshall said. “By the time they get to be old enough to vote, they have 76 jabs.”
An aide moved the sign with the graphic to the side to reveal another sign, which read in bright red type, “76 JABS!”
Marshall, a former OB-GYN who said he’s delivered 5,000 babies, also said he doesn’t understand why newborns are given a hepatitis vaccine if a mother has no risk factors. The hepatitis vaccine is typically the first vaccine a newborn receives.
Hepatitis B is most commonly transmitted from mother to child at birth, and an estimated 1.1 million people died from hepatitis B infections in 2022, according to the World Health Organization.
Marshall said vaccines should be treated like medication and asked how Kennedy uses transparency to do just that.
Kennedy agreed with Marshall, confronting accusations that he is anti-vaccine.
“Saying I’m anti-vaccine is like saying I’m anti-medicine,” Kennedy said. “I’m pro-medicine, but I understand some medicines harm people. Some of them have risks. Some of them have benefits that outweigh those risks for some populations.”
Marshall said he and Kennedy are fighting to empower parents to make their own decisions surrounding vaccines.
“I guess before the press labels me wrong, I’m not anti-vaccine either,” Marshall said, expressing support for the MMR, DPT, polio and smallpox vaccines.
Marshall also gave Kennedy time to clear up any confusion about his stance on the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 vaccines.
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, which Kennedy oversees, more than 1.2 million deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 as of Aug. 30. In an estimated 87% of those deaths, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, and it was listed as a contributing cause in the remaining deaths.
Earlier in the hearing, Kennedy said he didn’t know the total COVID-19 death toll in the U.S., refuting existing estimates of both the death toll and vaccine efficacy rates. He blamed “data chaos” at the CDC, which he also oversees.
Marshall agreed with Kennedy, articulating the difference between the number of people dying from COVID and the number of those who died with COVID.
“The calculus is different and it’s complicated,” Kennedy said, “and, you know, if you want to just turn everything into a sound bite, it makes it — you can’t have a grown-up conversation.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250904_marshall-1024x594.png,,,2025-09-04 18:57:25.210293

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)Dr. Steven Eshenaur, health officer for the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department, kicked off a campaign for the West Virginia Senate on Thursday.
Dr. Steven Eshenaur
Eshenaur has served as the KCHD public health officer and executive director since March 2022. He’s also currently serving as the Fayette County health officer. 
He’s running as a Republican for the 8th district state Senate seat, which is currently held by Sen. T. Kevan Bartlett, also a Republican. That district represents Clay and Roane counties, as well as portions of Kanawha, Wirt, Jackson and Putnam counties. 
“Over the last few years in public health, I’ve had the opportunity to educate members of the Legislature about health issues,” Eshenaur said. “Now, I’ve felt the need to join them to provide additional medical expertise and to work to improve the lives of all West Virginians.”
According to the West Virginia Secretary of State, Bartlett has filed precandidacy paperwork to keep his current position in the upcoming 2026 election. Bartlett was appointed to the state Senate in January to fill the seat after former Sen. Mark Hunt won the election as state auditor.
Kanawha County Commissioner Lance Wheeler, a Republican, is also campaigning for the seat.
One other candidate, Chase Linko-Looper, is listed as a precandidate and running for the seat as a member of the Mountain Party.
Eshenaur said he felt “extremely strong” about his chances in what is already shaping up to be a crowded Republican primary. 
In addition to his role at the health department, Eshenaur still works rotating shifts as an emergency department physician at WVU-Jackson General Hospital in Ripley, and two other regional hospitals. With 30 years of service in the U.S. Army, he previously served as the state surgeon for the West Virginia National Guard, as well as medical director at Summit Bechtel Reserve.
Eshenaur said that while his career has focused on public health and health policy — Eshenaur holds a Masters of Business Administration for health care management as well as being a doctor of osteopathic medicine — his 2026 state Senate campaign will focus largely on job creation and improving the economy.
He’s the owner of Trophy Whitetail Hunts in Kenna, a small business that runs hunting tours for paying clients. He also operates the lodge attached to the hunting grounds.
“That’s the most important piece I want to add to the Legislature — a focus on our economy. It’s the tide that rises all ships,” Eshenaur said. “I have experienced the challenges of doing business in West Virginia and the importance of supporting businesses so that they can provide better opportunities for our workers.”
Eshenaur said he’s concerned about continual moves at the Legislature to repeal Certificate of Need. Working in rural hospitals, he said, he sees firsthand how critical they are to keeping communities safe. He said he worries that CON repeal could threaten those small, critical access hospitals.
“I’m just not sure we can afford that risk,” Eshenaur said. 
As a health officer, Eshenaur has been vocally opposed to legislative attempts to water down West Virginia’s stringent vaccine requirements for school-aged children. He has testified to the Legislature regarding the importance of mandating childhood vaccines for public health and has criticized claims from people who say loosening the state’s vaccine requirements won’t threaten community health. 
West Virginia state law includes some of the strongest childhood immunization policies in the country. For the past several years, however, a growing faction of Republican lawmakers have moved to remove those policies due to concerns over personal freedom. 
Bartlett, in the 2025 legislative session, voted in support of legislation to add non-medical exemptions to the state’s school vaccine requirements. That bill ultimately failed in the House, however an executive order from Gov. Patrick Morrisey to do the same is still in effect. Litigation is still ongoing regarding the executive order. 
Eshenaur said he remains steadfast in his support for common-sense public health policy — including strong childhood vaccine requirements, which are likely to reemerge in the next legislative session. 
Using his background — and his experience still regularly treating patients in rural West Virginia — he wants to educate members of the Senate on these issues to form better policy.
“I’ve demonstrated a lifetime of serving West Virginians, from first going to war as a member of the West Virginia National Guard at 20 years old until today,” Eshenaur said. “I want to continue to serve them with the same grit and resiliency that I was raised with.”

Repeated mistakes from the Burlington Electric Department over four years have prompted state officials to audit the department. They hope to pinpoint what’s going awry in the Queen City’s electric utility department. 
Kerrick Johnson, the commissioner for the Department of Public Service, recommended the audit after the Vermont Public Utility Commission sent him a letter late last month including a list of 11 mistakes Burlington Electric had made in recent years. Many of the listed items detailed errors in how the electric department reported its work and spending to state regulators. 
The utility commission saw a “pattern of errors, inconsistencies and shortfalls,” members wrote in the letter. In response, Johnson proposed that an outside firm audit the utility department “with a specific focus on internal quality controls,” he wrote. 
Like every electric utility department in Vermont, Burlington Electric has a monopoly over its area, Johnson said. The department provides service for over 21,000 residential and commercial accounts, according to Darren Springer, Burlington Electric’s general manager. It also owns two large generating facilities, including a hydropower facility in Winooski and part of the McNeil Generating Station wood-burning plant in Burlington.  
So, it’s important that the department’s reports to regulators are correct, Johnson said in an interview with VTDigger. “The repeated mistakes time after time over a period of years, what that demonstrates is a lack of professional rigor,” he said. 
The electric department “certainly takes accountability” for its mistakes and acknowledges that it’s performing below the state’s expectations, Springer said in an interview with VTDigger.
The electric department does provide a reliable service and receives few complaints from customers, Johnson acknowledged in his letter. 
But some of the department’s mistakes have been costly. 
In 2024, the electric department failed to properly report to officials some of the operations at its Burlington wood-burning plant, costing the department almost $1 million in renewable energy credits, as first reported by Seven Days. The work slipped through the cracks due to staff turnover, Springer said. 
After that, the electric department set up a number of internal checks to catch mistakes before it’s too late, Springer said. He claimed those checks have worked well. 
Not all of the department’s mistakes are public facing. In another instance mentioned in the letter, the electric department overspent part of its budget by 33% due to invoicing errors. Other complaints relate to inconsistencies in paperwork filings to the commission, the letter shows. 
Though the impact of those mistakes “absolutely affects ratepayers,” Johnson said, it’s hard to tell in what form. 
While Johnson is unsure why things seem to be falling through the cracks, the pattern of mistakes makes him wonder if there’s more dysfunction that he isn’t seeing, he said. 
“What else are we not seeing that could be an error? Are there opportunities not being seized?” Johnson asked hypothetically. 
He hopes the audit can answer those questions. It isn’t decided what company would run the audit, how much it might cost or how long it might take. But the electric department will have to pick up the tab, Johnson said. 
“Let’s be clear, Burlington Electric customers are paying for this,” Johnson said.

Opposing views on the project highlighted divisions within the Republican Party on economic development. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The Republican primary election that will likely determine South Dakota’s next governor is nine months away. It already seems like it’s been going on forever.
The race has three candidates with Gov. Larry Rhoden waiting in the wings. Rhoden demurs when asked if he’s going to run, saying that election campaigns are too long. The governor has a point.
With so much time on their hands in such a long campaign, candidates have to make news any way they can, often by taking offense at something their opponent said, whether he said it or not.
A case in point comes from comments made in August by U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, one of the candidates for governor. Talking to the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce, Johnson said the United States, rather than China, needs to be the dominant force in the race to develop the technology surrounding artificial intelligence. If South Dakota is going to get some of that business, it would have to welcome the data centers needed for AI. During his comments, Johnson bemoaned the South Dakota trend of protesting innovation and economic development.
“It’s un-American and it’s not at all capitalist,” Johnson was quoted as saying in a South Dakota Searchlight story. The country must win the battle for AI he said, noting that “We cannot do it if the only answer in front of us is, ‘No, always no.’”
Of late, some South Dakotans have been cranky about development. Whether it’s pipelines, a new prison or the data centers needed for AI, there always seems to be a group or two ready to say, “not in my backyard.”
The prevalence of this attitude worries Johnson, who called it “a disease that’s metastasizing.”
Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

Politicians are supposed to be a thick-skinned bunch, but Johnson’s declared opponents in the GOP governor’s race — Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids — couldn’t fire up their smartphones fast enough to declare on Facebook how offended they were by the congressman’s remarks.
Unfortunately, they were upset about something he never said.
A Doeden post about Johnson said, “This week he called me ‘un-American’ because I am opposed to using your tax dollars to support out-of-state billion-dollar corporations.”
Hansen had a similar take: “Well, if you oppose your tax money being given away in special interest tax subsidies to big tech companies like Facebook, well then Dusty Johnson says you’re being un-American.”
Well, that’s not what he said. In essence, Johnson said that automatically taking a position in opposition to progress is “un-American” and bad for the economy.
It’s easy enough to guess that Johnson favors the kind of loans and tax breaks that have been a staple of state government in South Dakota since the days of Gov. George Mickelson. After his comments to the chamber, Johnson told Searchlight that communities and states “need to step up” and offer incentives if they’re going to attract data centers. However, he never said that failing to support those specific kinds of incentives was un-American.
It just makes common sense that being against all of those types of incentives is short-sighted. Other states will make accommodations to attract data centers. If South Dakota elects to compete for economic development only on the basis of its merits, all it will have to recommend itself is a population with a solid work ethic and winters cold enough to keep the data center’s computer servers from overheating.
By promising to jettison economic development tools like loans, grants and tax breaks, candidates like Hansen and Doeden will say that they’re looking out for our tax dollars. Certainly that’s part of what a governor should do. However, the governor should also look out for our future.
Pulling back from years of the state’s economic development traditions is just another way of saying “not in my backyard.” That’s certainly not much of a campaign slogan. South Dakotans should expect more than that from the state’s next governor.

Andy Beshear said tariffs are affecting the economy in ways that could cost the state revenue.  (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — Kentucky tax revenues are likely to slip below budgeted expectations in the new fiscal year, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday.
The effects of federal tariffs on the Kentucky economy and a cut in the state income tax that takes effect on Jan.1 are likely to cause the shortfall, Beshear said at his weekly press conference. 
The governor said he has asked State Budget Director John Hicks to convene the team of economists that makes official projections of state revenue — the Consensus Forecasting Group — on Sept. 16 to to update the revenue forecast for the fiscal year that began July 1. 
“I’ve been receiving regular updates on our revenues and our projections for this year, and there is concern there will be a shortfall in total revenue collected,” Beshear said. “Some of this may be due to uncertainty surrounding federal tariffs and the choice we made to cut Kentucky’s income tax rate. … The Consensus Forecasting Group will let us know if we will have a shortfall, and if so, we can begin taking steps to address it.”
It seems unlikely that painful spending cuts would need to be part of any solution to balancing the budget. That’s because the state’s so-called “rainy day” fund has been brimming since record state revenue surpluses of the pandemic era. That fund is expected to have a balance of about $3.7 billion at the end of this fiscal year.
A news release from Beshear’s office later Thursday elaborated on his causes for concern. “Federal tariffs are directly impacting spending and economic activity” while the income tax cut that takes effect in the second half of the year will cost the state $359 million in revenue.
House Speaker David Osborne (LRC Public Information)
House Speaker David Osborne, a Prospect Republican, said he was somewhat puzzled by Beshear’s comment. 
“The Consensus Forecasting Group is already scheduled to deliver an updated economic outlook, and we continue to monitor economic conditions and revenue numbers with our economists. If this is genuinely a concern, why not bring it to us earlier — particularly since the governor’s budget director testified before lawmakers just two weeks ago,” Osborne said in a statement. 
“To be frank, we are somewhat skeptical that this is yet another attempt to politicize the budget when we know a responsible, measured approach is far better for Kentucky.”
Will Kentucky cut income taxes again?
Meanwhile, another budget development could affect prospects for the legislature continuing to lower the income tax when it convenes in Januaury.
Kentucky Lantern learned this week that the revenue and budget numbers for the fiscal year that ended June 30 did not meet one of two requirements for the General Assembly to consider another income tax rate cut in 2026 under a 2022 law that sets up a process to incrementally reduce the rate with a goal of eventually eliminating the state income tax.
In 2022 the legislature cut the income tax rate from 5% to 4.5%. It also set up a process for future rate cuts of one half of 1 percentage point — if certain budget conditions indicated the cuts could be done responsibly. Under this process the 2023 General Assembly cut the rate to 4%, and the 2025 General Assembly cut the rate to 3.5% effective Jan. 1, 2026.
The process allows lawmakers to consider a half-point reduction in the income tax rate if two requirements are met at the end of the prior fiscal year:

The “rainy day” fund balance is at least 10% of what total General Fund receipts were in the fiscal year just ended.
Revenue in the prior fiscal year would have exceeded General Fund spending even if the income tax rate had been 1 full percentage point lower.

The Office of State Budget Director reported to the legislature last month that its analysis of the year-end numbers showed that the second requirement was not met, said Sen. Chirs McDaniel, a Ryland Heights Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee.
Sen. Chris McDaniel (LRC Public Information)
“We missed hitting that second trigger by a about $7.5 million,” McDaniel said. “That’s a very small amount in the context of annual revenues of about $15 billion.”
But McDaniel said that another income tax rate cut during the 2026 legislative session is likely to remain a topic of discussion among the supermajorities of Republicans who control the Kentucky House and Senate.
One question McDaniel asked was whether revenue for last year was slightly depressed because floods and bad weather caused the state to push the income tax filing deadline from April to November.
Jason Bailey, executive director of the progressive Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said, “The state failing to meet its tax cut trigger this year is a small sigh of relief for every Kentuckian who relies on the success of our schools, hospitals and other vital services. But it comes on top of news of an expected shortfall this fiscal year due to the income tax cuts the legislature has already made and a weakening economy due to unwise federal policies.”
“On top of falling income tax receipts,” Bailey said, “Kentucky must deal with major new cost-shifts coming from the harmful mega-bill that passed Congress this summer. It is time to bring an end to the wrong-headed goal of eliminating the state’s largest revenue source, a policy that — like that new federal law — overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy.”

A federal judge and the Bureau of Land Management haven’t determined how they will remedy an appeals court’s decision that declared the agency's plans for eliminating whole horse herds illegal.
The post Feds slate purge of ‘checkerboard’ wild horses for Oct. 13 despite court ruling, sparking new lawsuit appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal land managers have had a rough time implementing contentious plans to eliminate roughly 3,600 free-roaming horses from 2.1 million acres of southwest Wyoming, where private and public land are interspersed in a checkerboard pattern.
Although U.S. District Judge Kelly Rankin of Wyoming concluded last year that the Bureau of Land Management’s whole-herd removal plan is legal, his decision was appealed and roundups were postponed, and then in July the plan was declared at odds with the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The federal appellate judges out of Denver sent the case back to the Wyoming court to remedy legal deficiencies. The lower court is set to regain jurisdiction over the matter on Friday, according to an involved attorney.
But BLM, in advance of those legal next steps, has already made a plan to move forward.
 “[T]he BLM Rock Springs Field Office still plans to proceed with the permanent removal of wild horses in the Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town Herd Areas, with operations expected to begin on or about Oct. 13, 2025,” Jacqueline Alderman, a spokesperson for the agency’s ​High Desert District, wrote in an email.

It remains unclear how the agency will address the three-judge panel’s concerns. “The BLM cannot comment on ongoing litigation,” Alderman wrote.
Pro-horse plaintiffs aim to stop the mid-October roundups from happening. 
On Tuesday, BLM’s decision to proceed with roundups this fall was challenged by Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, one of the groups engaged in a legal fight that’s dragged for years, in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming. 
“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director. “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for keeping this illegal resource management plan in place.” 
Friends of Animals’ lawsuit, first covered by E&E News, asks the district court to force BLM’s hand. 
“We’re seeking to have the removal decision vacated,” Best said. “I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals. Unfortunately … they don’t have any plans to stop the removals right now.”

The nonprofit animal advocacy group may seek an additional emergency injunction if the court doesn’t rule before roundups begin, she said. 
And there may be yet more lawsuits. Although Friends of Animals acted alone in its latest filing, in earlier stages it’d been part of a coalition of plaintiffs that included the American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project, Carol Walker, Kimerlee Curyl and Chad Hanson, among others. 
Erik Molvar, who leads Western Watersheds Project, said that he could not speak to the coalition’s legal plans. But he confirmed that the coalition is concerned about the BLM’s signaled actions.
“The circuit court found the plan amendments to be illegal,” Molvar said. “So it stands to reason that the BLM has no business implementing illegal plan amendments before the process is fully resolved before the courts.”
Joanna Grossman, who directs the equine program for the Animal Welfare Institute, said the coalition of plaintiffs is watching to see what BLM does next. 
“I’m hoping that the BLM will rethink this course of action,” Grossman said. “Oct. 13 is coming up soon.”

If BLM stays the course, she said, more litigation is possible.
“We are carefully weighing our options and are strongly considering filing a lawsuit,” Grossman said, “but things can change day by day.” 
Federal land managers have spent a decade and a half attempting to rid much of southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region of free-roaming horses. In 2010, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for the equines to exist on its property. 
“We can’t fence it, because of the basic nature of the checkerboard,” said Brad Purdy, a BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made.” 
But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals faulted BLM for not explaining how removing all horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance” — a requirement of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. 
“The reason they want to remove horses is essentially to minimize conflict with private landowners, even though this covers over a million acres of public land,” said Best, the Friends of Animals attorney. “The bottom line is there’s a mandate to protect horses — and that ‘ecological balance’ should be considered in decisions about horses — and that is repeatedly being ignored.”

Angel Charley (D-Acoma) said Democrats are no longer on equal footing on the New Mexico Redistricting Task Force. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)A task force dedicated to reforming how New Mexico’s political maps are made said Wednesday it is no longer considering changes to the maps used to elect members of Congress and will instead focus only on those used to elect state officials.
The task force is an independent group brought together by Fair Districts for New Mexico and the nonpartisan advocacy group League of Women Voters of New Mexico. One of the task force’s goals is to resume a push to create an independent redistricting commission and strip lawmakers’ authority in redrawing political maps.
Pointing to a national political battle around redrawing congressional districts, Rep. Cristina Parajón and Sen. Harold Pope, both Albuquerque Democrats, resigned from the task force on Aug. 18. Fair Districts for New Mexico Project Coordinator Kathleen Burke told Source NM on Thursday there have been no further resignations.
Two elected Democratic lawmakers remain on the task force, along with four elected Republicans lawmakers. “Democrats from the Legislature don’t have an equal footing here,” Sen. Angel Charley (D-Acoma) told the task force at its second meeting on Aug. 19.
With the resignation of one party’s members, the task force has “lost its foundation of nonpartisanship,” Fair Districts said in a news release on Wednesday. Partisan battles over congressional redistricting “have become extreme,” the group said, but are separate from efforts to reform how maps for state offices are drawn.
“What began as a genuine effort at collaboration to address voter suppression and promote fairness has been undermined,” New Mexico League of Women Voters President Hannah Burling said in a statement. “Without full representation, the Task Force can no longer fulfill its promise of fairness and balance.”
Fair Districts Project Manager Dick Mason said in a statement that New Mexico’s prior reform efforts have centered on state-level offices, so the task force’s proposed joint resolution “deliberately excludes congressional districts and instead would establish an independent commission to draw fair maps for the New Mexico Senate, House, and other state offices requiring redistricting.”
Sen. Natalie Figueroa (D-Albuquerque) told the task force that she has volunteered to carry a yet-to-be-written joint resolution in the 2026 legislative session to create an independent redistricting commission. She said the task force was planned long before Texas decided to gerrymander its congressional maps.
“It is incredibly disappointing that we couldn’t gather legislators to step up for this work because like it or not, the Census is coming and redistricting is going to happen,” Figueroa told the task force.
Fair Districts said the task force will continue as a public “educational panel” at two webinars later this month.

Last year, when the Great Falls Public Library successfully asked voters to approve a levy, the voters did, but that was set against the backdrop of a failed public safety levy, which would have funded more law enforcement. City leaders then set their sights on taking funding from the library and using those funds for public safety. 
When voters howled that they had been duped, several weeks’ worth of contentious meetings kept the two sides out of court when they struck a deal to divert some funds — but not all — to public safety.

Earlier this week in Billings, the Yellowstone Art Museum became the latest cash cow targeted by the Yellowstone County Commissioners to help cover a gaping budget hole in the Sheriff’s Office of nearly $9 million. 
The museum is unique, sitting at the downtown corner of two thoroughfares in Montana’s largest city. Originally built as a county jail, it has since been converted into the museum which boasts one of the few modern art collections in a state known for its western-themed art. 
In 1964, the Yellowstone Art Museum opened its doors in the building formerly used as the Yellowstone County Jail, and Billings resident Hank Fuller remembered that moment when returned back home, more than 40 years ago. 
“I got paroled from Montana State Prison and came to Billings to find a home. And I walked into the YAM and saw this big engraved piece of stone that says, ‘County Jail,’” Fuller said. “I thought to myself, ‘Wow, look what they’ve done with the disgusting ethic of prisons and jails and look what they’ve changed it into.’”
Fuller was one of many Yellowstone County residents who testified against the removal of funding for the Yellowstone Art Museum on both the Aug. 26 and the particularly contentious Sept. 2 County Commissioner hearings that followed weeklong community protests. 
“It gave me hope and it gave me a place and ideas to change my life,” Fuller said, addressing the commissioners. “We really need this place and we shouldn’t be cutting funds, we should be increasing funds so they can increase community outreach programs.” 
  The Museum Fund 

The proposed funding cuts for the YAM began approximately 15 months ago, when a May 2024 letter on behalf of the Yellowstone County Commissioners was sent to YAM Executive Director Jessica Ogdin informing her of the county’s intentions to reallocate portions of a fund dedicated to museum revenue. The YAM, along with three other museums – the Western Heritage Center, the Yellowstone County Museum and the Huntley Project Museum – make up the recipients of this fund. 
The letter notified the YAM of the commissioners’ intent to reduce its 25% allocation of the fund to 20% in the 2025 fiscal year, then another decrease to 15% in the 2026 fiscal year. 
On July 25, the commissioners sent another letter, notifying the YAM of their intent to further reduce their allocation to $50,000 for the 2026 fiscal year, which amounts to barely 6% of the museum fund’s allocations.
Both letters justified the reallocation by pointing out the necessary ADA compliance changes to the Yellowstone County Museum and hail damage to the Huntley Project Museum, further stating, “Given that Yellowstone County owns the Western Heritage Building and the land, building and art collection of the Yellowstone County Museum, additional fund dollars must be available for properties owned by the County, within the tight budgetary constraints of the museum fund.” 
But the conversations in commissioners’ chambers didn’t exactly match the rationale mentioned in the letter. During the two contentious hearings, commissioners justified their decision to remove YAM funding as a necessary allocation shift to help combat increased public safety costs, and pushed back on the museum’s current budget and funding needs. 
Following YAM Executive Director Jessica Ogdin’s public testimony in favor of keeping museum funding, Commissioner Mark Morse requested she remain at the microphone for questioning. 
“So, your Form 990 for Fiscal Year 2023 shows you have net assets of $10 million,” Morse asked.

“That includes our endowment,” explained Ogdin. 
“It also shows that you haven’t paid any taxes since 1965,” Morse said. 
“We do have non-profit status,” Ogdin replied. 
“Your Form 990 also shows for fiscal year 2023 that your revenue, less your expenses, showed you with a profit of just shy of $332,000. Is that correct?”
“So, again,” Ogdin repeated. “That is gifts to our endowment.” 
Susan Sullivan, who serves on the executive board of trustees for the YAM, and is currently the treasurer and finance chairwoman, explained in her later online testimony why including the YAM’s endowment is not an honest evaluation of available funds to the museum. 
“You brought up that the YAM has this number, $10 million, sitting on its books,” Sullivan said, addressing Morse directly. “Let’s say $4 million of that is bricks and mortar. I cannot produce cash out of bricks and mortar. That bricks and mortar costs money to maintain.”
“The IRS and Montana statute does not allow us to take money from the capital campaign,” Sullivan continued. “We are allowed to take 5% per year of the rolling 13-quarter averages. If I’ve got $5 million in there, times 5%, that’s $250,000 I can take from the capital campaign. My budget is about $2.5 million. If I can’t take $250,000, I’ve got to raise the rest of the money. We need the county to help us with raising that money.”
Morse claimed the cuts were due to poor property tax policy. 
“Everybody wanted property tax relief. So this is what the face of property tax relief looks like,” Morse said. “We have less money to give out for one museum of four. So, if you’re worried about that, you know, you can fundraise 500 people for their $400 rebate, and you have your $200,000.”
  The True Cost 

	 
Following a 2024 assessment, consultants Justice Planners, A&E Design and engineering firm HDR were tasked with developing a plan through 2049 that would meet the county’s public safety needs. The consultants recommended expanding the existing facility rather than building a new one, detailing 10 expansion options ranging from $48.3 million to $469 million in a 148-page report and landing on a $225 million plan that would boost capacity to 946 beds. When combined with a short-term lockup expected to open next year, the county’s total capacity would reach 1,040 through 2039. By 2049, the county could expand again with an additional 512 beds.
Morse emphasized the jail’s lack of beds in his decision to cut funding from the YAM. 
“Our jail has a capacity of 434, and we regularly house 200 inmates over that. And it fluctuates, I mean, between 600 and 650, but generally 200 inmates over. We know our costs are $122 a day. So, that equates to a $24,400 deficit a day. And if you multiply that times 365 days, that’s $8.9 million. That is what we have to come up with,” said Commissioner Morse. “We have to find the money for approximately $9 million.”
Ogdin responded that a comparison between art and inmates is an impossible analogy.

“You will find nobody more empathetic to difficult budgeting decisions than myself. I absolutely understand that you are making hard choices. And at the same time, I am a staunch believer that the YAM is a partner in public safety,” said Ogdin. “We offer deep, engaging programming for youth, which is something that we know helps with that pipeline to public safety concerns and safety issues in our community.” 
Ogdin told the Daily Montanan that law enforcement in Billings seems to align with her view. 
“Our Billings Police Chief, Chief St. John, when he talks about the community’s needs for public safety, one of his primary pillars is youth engagement,” she said. “Having places throughout the county where youth can be actively engaged and highly participatory, that’s something we’ve prioritized both through our K-12 education and our after school teen programs, which once again, we’re choosing to do for free rather than on a fee-based structure, trying to make that available to folks who most need it in the community.”
A point seconded by local artist and musician Chanel Flores. 
“The Yellowstone Art Museum is accessible to people downtown, right? Not everyone can get up into the heights, right? Not everyone has a car, not everyone has bus fare,” Flores said. “Most people can get downtown into the Yellowstone Art Museum. And it’s local artists there. It’s people from Billings that go and get help with their art. If they don’t know something, they go learn it. If they want to put something on display, they go do it.”
“So what you’re defunding is accessibility,” said Flores. “And I just wanted to say shame on you. Shame on you.” 
  Whose Priorities? 

This isn’t the first time in Montana public funds have been reallocated from community programming to public safety. 
Almost two years ago, city commissioners in Great Falls said the shift from library services to law enforcement was necessary given the city’s growing demand for police, fire, and emergency services that haven’t seen a major funding boost in 50 years. Library staff expressed the same growing need for services to better serve the Great Falls community, and warned the reduction in mills would likely mean cuts to services, staff, and possibly closing one day a week. 
After months of pushback from the voters and tense negotiations with library leaders, a deal, which passed 4-1, reduced the library’s budget by nearly $1 million through 2029, with funds going to support law enforcement.
“We the voters knew we wanted this as infrastructure, we the voters decided this was the best way to support our community, and make it a good safe place to live, and not only did they completely ignore that, but they took that money and still didn’t solve their problem,” said Jasmine Taylor, Great Falls resident and current candidate for Great Falls mayor. “All it’s done is hurt the underlying mechanism that promotes public safety.” 
The money reallocated from the library in Great Falls to public safety, totaled less than 1.5% of the $32 million needed in the public safety budget. In Yellowstone County, the decrease from $220,000 to $50,000 in YAM funding, even if it was entirely applied to public safety, would account for 2% of the $8.5 million needed to run jail operations, and only .08% of the total $225 million needed for county jail expansion. 
“This idea that it’s ‘for public safety’ to me feels like a distraction,” said Taylor. “You can say it’s for public safety but when you run the numbers this is not a drop in the bucket. What this really is, is about nationalizing attacks on arts and culture and critical thinking. And we do that through attacking these public goods like museums and libraries. It doesn’t promote public safety in any way, it detracts from it.” 
The same public sentiment and even of the same arguments played out in a tense Sept. 2 meeting in Billings. 
“What we as a community value, we fund,” said Billings resident Elizabeth Halverson. “We are seeing the community harm from chronic, long-term underfunding of education, mental health services, and housing shortages, just to name a few. It’s easy to see around the country communities that are investing in these values. These are the cities with declining crime rates. These are the communities that set an example for us.” 
  The Boiling Point 

Tensions between community members and the commissioners were high, with Morse frequently asking commenters to remain at the microphone for further questioning, and at times, for something that resembled a full interrogation, with the commissioner suggesting that some of the supporters had never visited the Yellowstone County Museum at the Billings Airport.
At one point, a member of the crowd shouted “Bully!” leading Commissioner Mike Waters to interject.

“It’s alright,” said Commissioner Waters. “You know, the financial picture of each museum is unique in and of itself. We just are trying to deal with the realities of needing additional money for a general fund that is supplementing our public safety funds.” 
Lisa Harmon, Senior Pastor at Billings First Congregational Church, pointed out the more than $600,000 in unpaid taxes to Yellowstone County by the owners of Rimrock Mall, among others, but not first before admonishing the commissioners’ behavior.
“I find it disrespectful that you are up here harassing your constituents,” said Harmon, “You are harassing your constituents to put the property owner tax relief on the executive director of the YAM. Are you kidding me? Go to the state.”
After the final vote to cut the funding, chants of “Shame!” broke out amongst the audience.
Hank Fuller would like to see more funds directed to youth engagement and the arts, both community services the YAM provides.
“An ounce of crime prevention is worth a pound of crime cure,” said Fuller. “This jail and this ‘safety’ business going on, a lot of it is caused by the way people are treated. We don’t have a southside grocery store, they closed the swimming pools, places kids could have activities and communities could gather. We’re gonna have three hotels filled with people. Are they going to want to visit the warehouses? Are they going to want to visit the gas plant? We need art. It’s how communities survive.” 
Fuller expressed his disappointment with the final vote to cut YAM funding.
“It seems like we’re unlearning,” he said. “We’re moving backwards.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/JennaMartin-07533-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 18:57:25.210293

Ron DeSantis, a federal appeals court decided Thursday that “Alligator Alcatraz,” the immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, will not shut down.
The 2-to-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stayed federal judge Kathleen Williams’ order to the state to stop bringing people to the site and to dismantle much of it by September’s end. The higher court’s decision came just two weeks after Williams handed down her preliminary injunction.
“Florida will undoubtedly be harmed if it cannot ‘apply its own laws’ to respond to an immigration crisis,” Judge Barbara Lagoa, appointed by President Donald Trump, wrote in the 33-page order. 
“Given that the federal government has an undisputed and wide-reaching interest in combatting illegal immigration, and that illegal immigration is a matter of national security and public safety, we think the injunction issued below goes against the public interest.”
Lagoa, alongside Trump-appointee Judge Elizabeth Branch, pointed to a new Florida law mandating full participation with federal immigration authorities, and noted that the site has not received any federal funding. This means that federal environmental acts don’t apply, nullifying the plaintiffs’ arguments, they argued.
“The Florida-funded and Florida-operated detention activities occurring at the Site do not conceive a ‘major federal project,'” Lagoa wrote, seemingly contradicting DeSantis’s repeated assurances that the federal government will reimburse Florida for Alligator Alcatraz’s estimated $450 million price tag. 
She remarked that promises of federal money to reimburse the state don’t equate to actually receiving the reimbursements.
‘Get your swag today’
The Thursday afternoon decision, which temporarily blocks Williams’ ruling and the case itself ahead of an appeal, was met with victorious cheers from top right-wing figures.
“Some leftist judge ruled, implausibly, that somehow Florida wasn’t allowed to use our own property to help the federal government in this important mission,” DeSantis announced in a one-minute social media video, applauding the appeals court for allowing the 3,000-bed facility to stay “open for business.”
“The mission continues.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, meanwhile, promptly encouraged X users to get their “Alligator Alcatraz” “swag” alongside a link to hats, shirts, and other merchandise touting the “Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide” slogan he helped popularize.
He noted that “victory was secured” against Williams, who had held him in civil contempt for encouraging state officers to arrest migrants without legal status, allegedly flouting one of her orders.
Uthmeier’s brainchild, the facility was constructed in just eight days. Leading Republicans, including President Donald Trump and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, toured the center on its opening day. The massive fanfare surrounding the center inspired copycats in Nebraska and Indiana, with similarly alliterative names.
‘Fighting on’
The Eleventh Circuit’s ruling comes less than two months after environmental groups sued to close the site, fearing destruction to unique habitats and endangered species. These organizations, which include the Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of the Everglades, had declared victory after Williams’ Aug. 22 preliminary injunction. The Miccosukee Tribe of Florida was another plaintiff.
Now, they say, the fight is not over.
“The 11th Circuit’s order only pauses the district court’s injunction, and I’m confident we will ultimately prevail in defending the heart of Florida from this brutal and destructive facility,” said Elise Bennet, Florida director of the Center for Biological Diversity. She called the ruling “heartbreaking” but vowed to continue to appeal.
Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, agreed the critic are “committed to fighting on.”
Judge Adalberto Jordan, an Obama appointee, wrote the sole dissenting opinion, arguing the majority “ignores the burden borne by the defendants” and wholly disregards the lower court’s authority.

“If this trend continues, the bench and bar will be forgiven for thinking that a district court’s factual findings are only inconvenient speed bumps on the road to reversal,” he warned.
The lawsuit against the state is just one of many that emerged as the facility was quickly created. Florida Democratic lawmakers and the ACLU of Florida have both filed separate suits demanding access to the center and alleging human rights violations.
These suits came as Florida pushed to align with President Donald Trump’s anti-unauthorized immigration agenda.
The GOP-dominated Legislature passed a hefty package during its 2025 session revoking in-state tuition for undocumented college students, requiring counties to partner with federal immigration authorities, and mandating the death penalty for migrants illegally in the state convicted of capital crimes.

Bob Ferguson hosts a press conference on the impacts of President Donald Trump's tariffs at Northwest Harvest on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025, in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Washington’s grocery prices could grow more than 16% if President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs are allowed to continue, predicts a new state report released Thursday. 
So if a family now pays $6,000 per year on groceries, their spending could increase to about $7,000 in 2027 if the president’s signature import taxes remain in effect, according to the analysis prepared by the state’s Office of Financial Management.
Gov. Bob Ferguson shared the findings in a press conference Thursday at hunger relief organization Northwest Harvest’s south Seattle community market.
“There is no scenario in which these tariffs are good for Washingtonians, and don’t be fooled by the administration, Washington’s working families and businesses and the state will bear the cost of these tariffs,” Ferguson said.
The 65-page report – which Ferguson called “nonpartisan” despite being prepared by the Democratic governor’s budget office – determined the president’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs could hurt Washington in a number of ways. 
Nearly 32,000 jobs could be at risk. Agriculture and aerospace industries could be hit hardest in a border state whose economy is heavily reliant on international trade. . Washington could lose $2.2 billion in general fund revenue by 2029 if the tariffs remain in place for the next four years. And economic growth in the state over that same period could decline 1.2% to 1.8% per quarter.
Consumers could feel the impacts far beyond the grocery store, the report states. Clothing and shoe prices could rise 7% within a year. Used car prices are projected to jump by around 23%, while new cars could cost 6% to 8% more. Electricity and natural gas costs will also increase.
But these projections are far from certain as Trump is embroiled in a court fight to maintain the tariffs that are the centerpiece of his economic agenda.
A federal appeals court last week ruled he didn’t have the authority to impose most of them.  On Wednesday, the administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. 
Washington Democratic U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell has led the charge to reassert the role of Congress in setting trade policy in light of Trump’s tariff plans, to no avail.
Trump has said tariffs are necessary to address steep trade deficits that threaten the country’s national security. For months, markets have been wracked by on-again-off-again levies that have repeatedly been announced, pulled back and revised.
The chair of Washington’s Republican Party turned the blame for economic turmoil onto the governor, who signed off on major tax increases this year to address a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. 
“The budget crisis will be Bob Ferguson’s fault. Not Donald Trump’s,” said state Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen. “Ferguson is trying to shift blame. Don’t let him.”

Meanwhile, Ferguson left the door open to Washington potentially withholding federal income tax collections in response to the Trump administration. California Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested in June that his state could take that step.
“I don’t want to get too specific at this time, but what I’ll say is that there are lots of conversations about different options the state of Washington can take to deal with the chaos from the Trump administration,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson is scheduled to meet Friday with the Northwest Seaport Alliance, where the impact of tariffs will likely be on the agenda. The alliance, which oversees the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, has been dealing with a whipsaw of imports and exports in recent months. 
“That uncertainty is not good for business,” Port of Seattle Commissioner Ryan Calkins said Thursday. “It’s not good for our ports, it’s not good for our state, our workers or our people.”
The state’s next revenue forecast is due out later this month. It could indicate if Trump’s policies are having immediate impacts on Washington’s economy and color how lawmakers approach the 2026 session beginning in January.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4403-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-04 17:57:45.123859

The judge, Landya McCafferty of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire, issued a two-week temporary restraining order against a portion of the law. The decision pauses the law while McCafferty weighs whether to issue a longer-lasting injunction. 
The injunction is an early action in a lawsuit filed against the state by the National Education Association, four school districts, and several other plaintiffs. They argue the new law requiring school districts to purge any DEI programs or risk a loss of state funding is unconstitutional. 
New Hampshire Republicans added language to the state budget that bars public schools and government entities in New Hampshire from using state funds for DEI-related programs and imposes steep financial penalties on those who do. 
That new law took effect July 1 and gave school districts until Sept. 30 to list for the state Department of Education any DEI-related programs and contracts they provided and any of those programs that received state funding. But in a July 11 letter to school districts, the department required that school districts turn in that information earlier — by Sept. 5. 
McCafferty’s order exempts the suing school districts from that Sept. 5 deadline. The judge wrote that the department did not have legal authority to impose a deadline earlier than that set out in statute. 
But the ruling will not apply to all school districts in the state — just those that have teachers represented by the National Education Association of New Hampshire, that contract with one of the other organizations suing, or that provide disability services to students attending a plaintiff school district. That means school districts whose teachers are only represented by other unions — such as the American Federation of Teachers of New Hampshire — and are not connected to the other plaintiffs will still need to comply. 
As of Thursday, 49 of New Hampshire’s 179 districts had sent in compliance forms, according to a list on the Department of Education’s website. 
The temporary order comes a week after lawyers for plaintiffs and the state squared off over the new law in district court.
The law states that “no school district shall implement, promote, or otherwise engage in any DEI-related initiatives, programs, trainings or activities.”
The plaintiffs argued the law’s ban is unconstitutionally vague because the determination of whether a program is “diversity, equity and inclusion”-based is not always clear cut. That could mean that school districts self-censor or avoid certain contracts or programs altogether to avoid facing potentially steep financial penalties from the state. 
Lawyers for the school districts noted that the Department of Education is the sole arbiter for whether a school district is complying with the law. They said the potential consequence of losing “all sources of public funding to that public school” for not complying could be devastating to the school. They noted that the consequences could apply to school districts whether they knowingly or unknowingly violate the law. And they said the law provides no mechanism for the school to appeal a contention that it is providing a DEI program and is violating the law.
Several other plaintiffs said the law would affect them personally. New Hampshire Outright, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group that provides training to staff at public schools and colleges to teach how to create safe spaces, said the law would disrupt its work. James McKim, the vice president of the Manchester NAACP, argued he would also have to stop providing trainings to schools and local governments. Dr. Dottie Morris, the associate vice president for community and belonging at Keene State College, argued that her position could be eliminated by the law. 
State officials, meanwhile, countered that the intent of the law is clear and that it is easy to follow. They say it is meant to make sure that no program provides any demographic an advantage over any others. And they rejected arguments from the plaintiffs that the law could prevent accommodations for students with disabilities or could stop the creation of girls’ sports teams. The law would not stop programs that give different people the same opportunities, but would prevent those that give some people more opportunities, the state argued.
In her five-page order Thursday, McCafferty said the emergency injunction was necessary to prevent the “crippling penalties facing schools for even ‘unknowing’ noncompliance with the anti-DEI laws” while she considers the full case. 
Reacting to the court order, advocates said the case would — for now — allow school districts to continue programs that are meant to help students learn.
“Every Granite State student deserves a high-quality public education in a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment,” said NEA-NH President Megan Tuttle in a statement Thursday. “Programs and initiatives, including classroom instruction, that recognize the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion are not only essential to fostering a sense of belonging for all students, they are also legally required in many cases.”
But Republicans, who have attempted to eliminate DEI programs in public institutions at the national and local level this year, denounced the ruling. 
House Deputy Majority Leader Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican, called the decision “blatant judicial overreach” and put out a fundraising email for the Committee to Elect House Republicans in response.
“New Hampshire’s taxpayers deserve control over their hard-earned money,” Sweeney wrote in the email. “Unelected judges shouldn’t decide our budget or force us to fund racist programs that undermine Granite State values.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/doeinjunction-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-09-04 17:57:45.123859

The spill, which included 200 gallons of diluted herbicides and approximately 15 gallons of diesel, occurred Wednesday morning when a tractor and sprayer fell into the Cannonball River roughly a mile west of New England in southwest North Dakota. 
“From the sound of everything I was getting, I think he just got too close to the bank and the bank gave way,” said Bill Suess, manager of the Department of Environmental Quality’s spill investigation program.
The department is advising the public to avoid recreational activities in the river in a 1-mile radius around the spill and to avoid consuming any fish caught in the area. 
These are precautionary measures, Suess said, until his team receives the lab results from samples collected at the site in a week. Suess said he does not expect any long-term negative impacts from the spill. 
The sprayer had 22 gallons of concentrated herbicide, including glyphosate, dicamba and 2,4-D, mixed with 1,400 gallons of water, Suess said. An estimated 200 gallons of that mixture spilled in the waterway before it was contained.
Approximately 15 gallons of diesel also spilled, causing a light sheen on the water. “We should have that pretty well cleared up already today,” Suess said Thursday. 
The river is not a source of drinking water, nor is there any risk of downstream effects, Suess said. 
The driver of the tractor was not hurt.

The minimum wage has remained the same since 2017 for employees who receive tips in Connecticut.
That year, the state increased the minimum wage from $6.07 to $6.38 for hotel and restaurant employees and from $7.82 to $8.23 for bartenders. The rate has remained there since. Tips are calculated into these workers’ wages.
The minimum wage for all other workers in Connecticut, meanwhile, increases annually per a 2019 law — Public Act 19-4, which tied the yearly adjustment to economic indicators like the federal employment cost index.
The act also safeguards the minimum wage, which means that if the federal wage equals or is above Connecticut’s, the state rate will be 0.5% higher.
The most recent minimum wage increase of $0.59 from $16.35 per hour to $16.94 will become effective on Jan. 1, 2026.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Mental health and substance abuse service providers are bracing for cuts as the new head of the state’s mental health department moves to shore up the agency’s budget. 
Multiple providers across the state said they’ve begun receiving contract cancellation notifications from the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. 
But while agency leaders confirmed that they’re canceling or not renewing contracts, they told Oklahoma Voice this week that they did not know how many providers were expected to be impacted nor could they provide a dollar amount of the expected savings to the agency.
The agency could not provide specifics because the process is ongoing, said Jennifer Hogan, communications director.
Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic said in a statement that his agency has operated with more contracts than the budget can sustain.
Agency staff reviewed 800 contracts line by line before deciding what to cut, he said.
“These were very difficult decisions, but we cannot spend more than we have,” he said.
The cancellations come as Slavonic attempts to right the agency’s finances following a tumultuous period of uncertainty that required a $27.4 million emergency legislative appropriation to help cover payroll and led to lawmakers in May to remove Allie Friesen as commissioner, despite Gov. Kevin Stitt’s objections.
Lawmakers said they lost confidence in Friesen after significant shortfalls in the agency’s budget and her inability to provide answers about it. The agency had been using current year funds to pay last year’s bills, according to the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency. 
Hogan said some contracts will end while portions of others aren’t being renewed. The changes are effective Oct. 1.
The agency attempted to protect essential services that align with its mission and ensure those decisions were fiscally sustainable, she said.
Hogan said the agency started with cutting contracts because they make up the largest percentage of the budget.
Slavonic is also looking at the newly hired employees to see if the posts are needed, Hogan said.
According to a state audit, the agency, since Friesen took the helm in January 2024, hired 38 people at a salary exceeding $100,000 and awarded 376 employee pay raises greater than 10%.
Hogan said 23 posts were eliminated for a savings of $3.5 million.
The impact to providers will vary. Some smaller providers will be hit harder financially than larger ones.
About 90% of Parents Helping Parents Inc.’s funding comes from or through the agency, said Tree Kelley, executive director of the organization, which provides resources, support, education and advocacy for parents and families who have a child of any age struggling with a substance abuse disorder. 
The organization has a budget of about $240,000 and seven staffers. 
Five of them have been told their last day is Dec. 30 due to cuts, Kelley said.
The group provides services in rural communities, she said.
Kelley said the cuts will be devastating for clients.
The cuts will have a “ripple effect” on families, law enforcement and other social support systems, said Jeff Tallent, founder and executive director of Evolution Foundation, which provides mental health and substance abuse intervention services. 
Most of the organization’s $800,000 budget comes through the agency and is being cut, he said.
Adam Andreassen is CEO of Tulsa-based Family and Children’s Services, which is the largest certified community behavioral health center in the state with a budget of about $185 million and 1,500 employees.
He said the best guess is that the cuts will reduce his budget by between $1.5 million to $4 million.
Andreassen doesn’t foresee layoffs, but there is a “finite amount of disruption we can withstand.”
“It is a very dangerous process going on right now because of the instability,” he said.

Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said he has formed an exploratory committee and is considering running for the Republican nomination in the 2026 gubernatorial primary. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey (R-Upper Shore) has formed an exploratory committee to weigh a 2026 bid for governor, citing the need for “balance” in a state that has gone “so far to the left” under Democratic control.
Hershey said he expects to make a decision sometime before the end of the year on whether he’ll challenge incumbent Gov. Wes Moore (D), who is all but guaranteed to be the Democratic nomintee.
Hershey has said people had approached him recently about running, including one supporter who asked, “Is this really necessary?” In an interview with Maryland Matters Thursday, he said it is necessary to provide real competition to Democrats and give voters a choice.
“Without real competition, Maryland loses balance. Without balance, there’s no incentive for moderation. I think that’s the big thing that we look at when we talk about Democrats crossing over and voting for a Republican governor, ” Hershey said.
“Right now, we have moved so far to the left with Gov. Moore and the composition of the state Senate and the House of Delegates that this pendulum needs to come back,” he told Maryland Matters. “We need to see more of a balance in Maryland. I think that’s one of the big things that I’d be able to offer.”
Hershey said his decision to form an exploratory committee crystalized after Ed Hale Sr. announced he would switch parties and run for governor as a Republican. The lifelong Democrat has never sought public office before, and conceded that his change in party affiliation was a recognition that he could not beat Moore in a Democratic primary.

Hershey criticized Hale as a political opportunist, and Hale responded in a radio interview that he had no idea who Hershey was. While Hale has announced his intention to and has created a state campaign account, he has yet to formally file as a candidate.
Hershey, a senator for about 12 years, said aside from polling, his committee would test the fundraising waters. That would include cash in hand and “commitments from donors” should the exploratory committee turn into a formal campaign.
A late-2025 decision would put Hershey against the 2026 legislative session, during which Hershey — like all legislators and constitutional officers including the governor — is banned from fundraising activities.  But Hershey’s eventual running mate may not have those same restrictions.
Hershey could get around the prohibition by giving up his Senate seat — something he said flatly he would not do.
“One of the biggest concerns that I do have is I very much enjoy and appreciate the honor of representing District 36 as a state senator,” he said. “I am not willing to easily give up the opportunity to continue doing that.
“So as I’m looking at the opportunity, or the pathway to see if I would be able to defeat Gov. Moore in a general election, I am weighing that against the potential, the current and potential continued status of being a minority leader and representing our caucus over the next four years as well,” he said Thursday.
Hershey said he had been approached several times during the legislative session about running, but that the “intensity of the calls and messages and conversations have picked up dramatically since Ed Hale made his announcement.”
“So, yes, there is a part of me that is saying that the Republicans need to be represented in the race against Gov. Moore. I think that there is much concern over Ed Hale switching parties at the last minute and deciding to run as a Republican,” Hershey said. “And I said before Republicans know the difference between conviction and convenience. So, it played a role — it may have just accelerated my decision to move forward with this.”

	Hershey said he plans to spend the next 90 days polling and assessing the viability of a statewide campaign. That includes his ability to raise the money needed to challenge Moore, who has a proven ability to raise large sums of cash and is seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party.
Hershey’s announcement comes a day after a radio interview in which he teased the possibility of a run for governor.
Prior to 2002, Republicans had not held the governor’s mansion in nearly four decades.
Since 2002, the minority party — registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 2-1 — has won the seat three of the last six elections. That includes Larry Hogan, who became the first Republican since Theodore McKeldin, to win consecutive elections.
But those Repubican governors won open seats: Unseating an incumbent Democrat seeking reelection has proven difficult.
“There is still an opportunity for a Republican to win, even though this would be a different path that we have taken in the past,” Hershey said. “We have not won against the incumbent governor before, but we have won after eight years of (two) Democratic governors. In both cases a tax-and-spend governor.
“I think what we’re going to find out in polling is that people — families — are hurting now, after four years of Gov. Moore, as they were after eight years of Governor O’Malley. That’s where we’re thinking we’re going to see a notable difference in the re-election of Governor Moore, as opposed to just running against an open seat,” he said.
Hershey’s announcement comes as one other top Republican remains on the fence considering his own future. Hogan continues to be talked about as a potential candidate for his former office and at times has stoked the speculation himself.
Hershey said he spoke to Hogan about his intentions early Thursday afternoon.
“The governor is still looking at the race from the perspective that a lot of people are asking him to do this as well,” Hershey said. “We’re both in agreement that this is, this is the more appropriate step for me to take in forming an exploratory commission.”

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)A proposed settlement of a federal lawsuit over the state’s voter registration list requires North Carolina to report on its efforts to fill in missing voter information for at least two more years. 
The settlement filed on Wednesday essentially writes into a court document the steps that the state Board of Elections approved in meetings this summer to collect missing voter identifiers.  
Lawyers with the state Attorney General’s office and the US Department of Justice have signed off. 
President Donald Trump’s DOJ sued the state elections board in May over voter registrations that did not include driver’s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers. 
The DOJ lawsuit mirrored claims GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin used in his unsuccessful effort to win a state Supreme Court seat by throwing out more than 60,000 ballots. The Republican National Committee and the state GOP sought to purge about 225,000 registered voters before last year’s election because of missing identifiers in the electronic voter list. 
The settlement outlines the steps the state Board approved, asking voters to supply the identifying numbers in a mailing that went out this summer. A second letter will go out by Dec. 15 to voters who didn’t respond to the first mailing. 
The elections board will file multiple reports with the court and the DOJ at least into 2027 that detail its progress collecting those numbers from voters.
Voters who have not supplied the information before voting will be given provisional ballots. Provisional ballots include forms asking for a driver’s license or partial Social Security number. Voters who indicate on those forms that they don’t have either of those numbers but are eligible to vote under state law will still have their votes counted in federal elections, under the settlement. 
Voters who use provisional ballots because of missing identifiers will not have their registrations cancelled. 
The Democratic National Committee claimed credit for the provision that would have votes cast by provisional ballot count in federal elections even if there’s a mismatch between the voter’s name and their driver’s license or partial Social Security number.
The DNC sent state Elections Director Sam Hayes a letter in July warning that discarding those votes would “effectively remove registrants from the list of eligible voters for an unauthorized reason.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4267-1024x502.jpg,,,2025-09-04 17:57:45.123859

Greg Gianforte from suspending Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar after ruling a complaint to temporarily remove him is invalid.
In granting a temporary restraining order on Thursday, Lewis and Clark County District Court Judge Mike Menahan said state law requires “good cause” and a valid complaint to remove a commissioner.
But the judge said the suspension request from PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder to Gianforte was “procedurally defective” because it was made without a properly noticed meeting and without a “yes” vote of four commissioners — as mandated by Public Service Commission policy.
The judge said Molnar, an elected member of the PSC, was in danger of irreparable harm.
“Despite these procedural violations, Governor Gianforte has not dismissed the complaint and has requested briefing from both parties, creating immediate risk of unlawful suspension,” Menahan wrote.
The judge also found the timing of the complaint — right after an announced merger between NorthWestern Energy and Black Hills Corp — to “raise serious concerns.”
Wednesday, the Public Service Commission voted 3-2 to reject Molnar’s bid to recall the complaint to the governor.
Fielder made the suspension request on behalf of an internal “response team” investigating Molnar for “unprofessional conduct.”
She and others argued Molnar was interfering with the investigation, and the temporary suspension was necessary for the response team to complete its work unimpeded.
Molnar argued at least some of the actions in question — such as holding a press conference about the investigation and raising concerns about due process — are protected speech.
His lawyer, Matthew Monforton, had earlier said Gianforte should have immediately dismissed the complaint from Fielder. He praised the restraining order Thursday.
“The court confirmed that even governors must follow the rules, and Montana voters’ choice must be respected,” Monforton said.
PSC spokesperson Alana Lake said the agency looks forward to presenting the facts in the case to “ensure the truth is heard in this matter.”
“We are deeply disappointed that this situation distracts from the important work of our agency,” Lake said in an email. “Every day, our staff is focused on protecting ratepayers, ensuring safe and reliable utility services, and holding companies accountable to the public interest.
“We will continue to do what we have always done: Operate in a manner grounded in law, fact, and fairness.”
The judge said granting a temporary restraining order was necessary because the voters of Molnar’s district could lose representation if he is suspended — “a harm that cannot be remedied by later restoration to office.”
He also said a suspension would nullify the November 2024 election results in PSC District 2, in southeastern Montana, and Molnar has duties that cannot be performed retroactively.
The judge said the matter is time sensitive because it comes on the heels of an announced merger between NorthWestern Energy and Black Hills Corp, a proposal that requires approval by the PSC.
“The timing of this complaint — filed within 24 hours of a major utility merger announcement that Commissioner Molnar is uniquely qualified to evaluate — raises serious concerns about the complaint’s true purpose and threatens both democratic institutions and the public’s interest in thorough utility regulation,” the judge said.
Molnar and his lawyer had also argued the timing of the complaint to the governor is suspect.
Molnar was a member of the Public Service Commission in 2007 when it considered and rejected the sale of NorthWestern Energy to Babcock and Brown, a company that later went bankrupt.
“The timing of the threatened suspension would remove Commissioner Molnar’s unique institutional knowledge during the critical $3.6 billion NorthWestern Energy merger review, depriving Montana ratepayers of his proven expertise in scrutinizing utility acquisitions,” the order said.
Fielder has said the response team made its decision to file a complaint with the governor after it received “substantiated evidence” Molnar was engaging in retaliation — a claim his lawyer has described as “inflammatory.”
A PSC spokesperson also has said the complaint is related only to Molnar’s unprofessional conduct and is not connected to the proposed merger.
Gianforte has lauded the merger, and the judge noted his public endorsement in his order.
The order said it does not prevent Gianforte from exercising his authority to consider “properly filed complaints that comply with all applicable procedural requirements.”
But it said Molnar was elected into the post of commissioner and then as PSC president, and he will continue to serve in that capacity “during the pendency of this order with all rights, duties and responsibilities.”
The order also said the PSC policies are important to democracy.
“This Court finds that the procedural safeguards established by PSC Rule 2.17 serve essential democratic functions by preventing individual commissioners from acting unilaterally to remove elected colleagues, ensuring transparency in attempts to nullify election results, and providing due process protections,” the order said. “Allowing Defendant Fielder to bypass these mandatory requirements would render such safeguards meaningless and create a dangerous precedent for circumventing democratic process.”
The order noted Fielder had marked the complaint to the governor as “CONFIDENTIAL” and failed to notify Molnar about it.
However, the judge said if legitimate concerns about Molnar exist, Fielder is free to pursue relief through proper procedures.
In this case, he said the balance of equities “tips decisively in Commissioner Molnar’s favor.”
“He seeks only to enforce existing legal requirements, specifically that government officials must follow their own mandatory procedural rules,” the judge said. “Defendants suffer no cognizable harm from being required to comply with the PSC’s own established procedures.”
The Daily Montanan has requested comment from the Governor’s Office.

Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott distanced himself from Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and their pledge to strip mandates and immunization requirements from both Florida law and rules carried out by state agencies. 
Other prominent GOP officials, however, took a less clear stance and suggested they supported parental rights without explicitly endorsing the elimination of mandates.
Republican legislative leaders in the state House and Senate, meanwhile, haven’t indicated whether they will support the proposal, which would require legislative approval.
Scott defends public health 
Scott served two terms as Florida governor and during that eight-year span cut back the amount of public health available at county health departments, reduced Medicaid spending, and eliminated from the Florida Kidcare program thousands of children in hurricane battered zones whose parents couldn’t pay their required monthly premiums.

A former healthcare executive, Scott resigned from Columbia/HCA, the company he helped found, in 1997 due to billing fraud allegations. Although Scott personally never was charged, the allegations resulted in the company paying a $1.7 billion in fines and settlements, the largest such recovery to that point.
Yet he was the first Florida Republican to openly criticize the proposal.
“Florida already has a good system that allows families to opt out based on religious and personal beliefs, which balances our children’s health and parents’ rights,” Scott said in a statement.
Meanwhile Scott’s counterpart, Republican U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody, supports the move. DeSantis appointed Moody, a former Florida attorney general, to the U.S. Senate.
“They don’t call us the free state of Florida for nothing,” Moody said. “One of the things I think stood out about our state during the last years, especially when we were dealing with [Covid-19], was that we pushed back and made sure that we were giving reasoned analysis throughout that time period and making sure that people knew we as state leaders understood our limits, that we respected individuals’ rights,” Moody told NewsMax.
Senate President Ben Albritton’s office isn’t publicly commenting on the proposal at this time, said Katherine Betta, his spokesperson. House Speaker Daniel Perez’s office, meanwhile, hasn’t replied to requests for comment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Meanwhile, former Senate President Don Gaetz, a Republican from Destin now serving again in the cbamber, took a cautionary approach. Among his committee assignments is membership in Health Policy. 
He did not criticize the move by the DeSantis administration but said that science requires a continued evaluation of evidence and conclusions.

“If the surgeon general has valid and reliable evidence challenging the efficacy of certain vaccinations then of course I am open to his proposal,” Gaetz said in a statement to the Florida Phoenix. “As a layman, I also hope to hear from medical authorities.” 
While initially silent following the announcement, the Florida Medical Association on Thursday issued a terse statement opposing the proposal.
“On behalf of Florida’s more than 23,000 physicians and medical professionals, the Florida Medical Association unequivocally supports the vaccination and immunization of school-aged children against diseases that decades ago proved life-threatening to our kids. The FMA advocates for physicians and their patients to promote the public health, ensure the highest standards of medical practice, and to enhance the quality and availability of health care in the Sunshine State. This includes the safe and effective administration of vaccines and immunizations based on years of research and efficacy.”
Stuart Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell told the Phoenix she needs to see the proposal in bill form before commenting on it but believes in vaccines.
“I totally support vaccines and vaccinations.We do have opt-out provisions in current statutes, so I’d really have to see what they what exactly they would do before I comment on anything.”
Harrell played a key role earlier this year in quashing legislation that would have required physicians and health care facilities to treat patients regardless of their vaccination status.
Hillsborough County Republican Rep. Michael Owen said the idea of allowing parental choice appeals to conservatives but stopped short of supporting the proposal.
“Informed consent to put the parents in the driver’s seat, but I definitely want to look at and see what we’re talking about when it comes to certain vaccines that may be critical for children. I’m open to the science and listening to the doctors, and us allowing Floridian parents to make those decisions,” he told the Phoenix.
Where the Republican candidates stand
Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bryon Donalds released an ambiguous statement on X Thursday, saying, “I believe parents should be empowered to make vaccination decisions for their children.”
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Florida law now places the decision of whether to vaccinate children with parents and, despite certain vaccine requirements, allows exemptions for medical or religious objections that enable unvaccinated children to attend school.
Likewise, eliminating the mandate to vaccinate would not preclude Florida parents from voluntarily vaccinating their children.
Former House speaker and Republican gubernatorial hopeful Paul Renner also issued a vague statement Thursday.
“As speaker, I opposed mandatory covid vaccines and supported strong parental rights legislation. Parents should not be forced to have their children take a vaccine that they think is unsafe. However, we should have safe and effective vaccines that save lives.”
‘It’s going to affect the whole country, and even globally’
Dr. Scott Weaver is director of the University of Texas Medical Branch Institute for Human Infections and Immunity. His research focuses on vaccine development for a variety of diseases. In an interview with the Florida Phoenix Thursday, Weaver called the proposal “just a terrible decision.”
Dr. Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch
“I’m sure it’s pretty simple to get a waiver from the vaccine requirements in Florida and many other states, but when you don’t even need the waiver, it’s going to be much easier. And I think a lot of people are going to opt out because they’re not familiar with the diseases. They haven’t seen measles in their lifetime. They’ve been misinformed about the risks versus benefits of these vaccines. They don’t understand that their decision not to vaccinate their child could result in other children becoming infected.”
Weaver stresses that if the Legislature does eliminate vaccine mandates, the decision will reverberate beyond Florida.
“If Florida starts seeing big outbreaks of measles, which they certainly will with this policy, they’re going to see outbreaks all over the country. There are many pockets of low immunity throughout the country, and it just takes one traveler to start an outbreak there. And so it’s not even going to be confined to affecting Floridians. It’s going to affect the whole country and even globally.”
Weaver believes the anti-vaccination movement started with misleading information from Andrew Wakefield, a British physician who published a paper claiming to link autism to vaccines. His publisher later withdrew his paper amid accusations of research fraud and British authorities withdrew his license to practice medicine.
Now the best way to beat back anti-vaccination efforts is through education, Weaver said.
“I think a long term solution is, as part of our school curricula, we have to teach children how to find reliable information on the internet and how to distinguish misinformation or poorly formulated information from the best information from the most reliable sources and experts in a given field,” he said. 
“I don’t know whether that’s starting to happen, but that’s got to be the cornerstone, to educate everybody how to find reliable information, how to distinguish misinformation — conspiracy theory with no basis behind it — from information that they should be using to make these critical decisions.”

IDALS operated a pilot version of the program last year and the Iowa Legislature approved $200,000 in the department’s budget to run the full program in 2025. 
Six food banks participate in the program and get a dollar-for-dollar match on the purchase of dairy, meat, poultry, eggs, honey and produce from Choose Iowa registered farms. A press release from IDALS said flour and grains were added to the list of eligible items this year.

Choose Iowa is a branding and marketing program, under IDALS, to support locally produced and grown goods. It has nearly 300 members across the state.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig announced the funding Thursday at the Hawkeye Area Community Action Program, one of the participating food banks, in Hiawatha. 
Naig said the program is a “vital step” to address food insecurity in Iowa. 
“By partnering with local food banks and farmers, we’re not only providing fresh, nutritious food to those in need but also supporting local farmers and small businesses,” Naig said in the release. “With a second year of funding, we’re poised to build on the program’s success and make an even greater impact in our communities.” 
According to the press release, the dollar-for-dollar match in 2024 meant food banks in Iowa purchased more than $480,000 worth of food from 24 local farms and food hubs. The pilot program had a budget of $225,000. 
IDALS also operates a similar pilot program that helps schools purchase from local farmers. The pilot program had a $70,000 allocation for the 2025/2026 school year. 
Lawmakers and local food advocates argued the legislature should have approved more funds for both of the local food purchasing programs, especially as a federal program that offered similar support was canceled in March. 
The federal Local Food for Schools and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs were authorized during the COVID-19 pandemic and were extended in October 2024, with Iowa set to receive more than $11 million to purchase local food at schools and food banks. 
The programs were canceled under the Trump administration, which said they were not intended as long-term programs. 
This year 33 Iowa schools are participating in the Choose Iowa Food Purchasing Pilot Program for Schools, which could be extended by lawmakers for the next school year. 
The six food banks participating in the Choose Iowa Farms to Food Banks program are Food Bank of Iowa, Hawkeye Area Community Action Program, River Bend Food Bank, Northeast Iowa Food Bank, Food Bank of Siouxland and Food Bank for the Heartland. 
Farmers interested in selling to the food banks can apply to be a Choose Iowa member online.

McCuskey and Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill appear at an Aug. 28, 2025, panel during the annual Alaska Oil and Gas Association conference in Anchorage. (James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach plans to sue Gov. Laura Kelly, he said during a panel with Republican attorneys general in Alaska last week, but he did not specify what for.
While weighing in on the pros and cons of electing state attorneys general or appointing them, Kobach reasoned that the elected system is the better method because the attorney general is then accountable to the people and can exercise checks and balances.
“In Kansas right now, we have a supermajority Republican Legislature,” Kobach said in a recording obtained by Alaska Beacon, which is affiliated with Kansas Reflector through States Newsroom. “We have a Democrat governor, and we have a Republican attorney general, and I have had to sue our governor once, and I’m about to sue her again.”
“It’s not been released yet, and it’ll be in the next few weeks,” Kobach said, which was met with laughter from the audience.
He added: “So if you have a situation like that, where you have a governor who wants to be Biden-like or Obama-like and is not following the law, you need an attorney general of the Republican stripe to take that governor to (court) and enforce them to obey the law.”
Kobach did not specify what the lawsuit would entail, and the attorney general’s office did not respond to a Kansas Reflector request for comment. The governor’s office declined to comment.
Kelly and Kobach have a partisan public history, dating to the 2018 gubernatorial race in which Kelly beat Kobach in a five-way contest with 48% of the votes.
In July, the governor joined 22 states and Washington, D.C., in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for the adverse effects of federal funding losses. By mid-August, Kobach submitted a court filing asking the federal court in Massachusetts to boot Kelly from the suit because only attorneys general can sue on behalf of a state, he argued.
As chair of the Democratic Governors’ Association, Kelly has been an outspoken opponent of the Trump administration’s actions. Most recently, she and other Democratic governors penned a statement warning President Donald Trump against deploying the National Guard in other states, as he did in Washington.
Kelly administration officials have also repeatedly denied a Trump administration mandate to turn over Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, data, resulting in Kobach claiming during an August legislative meeting that he has a team of attorneys analyzing whether the denials are legal.
Last week’s panel was a paid event in Anchorage hosted by the Anchorage Republican Women’s Club to foster a conversation among attorneys general from Alaska, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, West Virginia and Louisiana. It followed an attorney general conference in Girdwood, a resort town southwest of Anchorage, focused on cybersecurity. Kobach was one of 11 attorneys general in attendance from both red and blue states, including the host, Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor, a Republican who subsequently resigned as attorney general and stepped down as chair of the Attorney General Alliance.
“The great content that we have, and the things we learn and share with each other, that’s the key,” Taylor said in a statement posted to Facebook. “I love the bipartisan nature of this group. I love the family aspect of this group. Our children get to know each other and play with each other while we’re all in our meetings, learning.”
The attorneys general on the panel discussed elections, citizenship, business, education and parents’ rights, property rights, homelessness, abortion medication, and law and order.
When asked about what kind of role attorneys general ought to play in ensuring fair, secure and transparent elections, Kobach, who was the Kansas Secretary of State from 2011-2019, pointed to major pending cases across the country.
“One of them is whether states can require proof of citizenship,” he said. “It is so easy to vote in the United States because it’s a system based entirely on trust.”
Kobach lost a court battle over a state law he wrote that required proof of citizenship to register to vote. He was unable to prove his claims of voter fraud, and a federal judge struck down the law as unconstitutional and held Kobach in contempt.
Along with Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, who also sat on the panel, Kobach sued the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Commerce earlier this year over the inclusion of noncitizens and temporary citizens in the calculation of electoral college votes and congressional seats. The states argue that those calculations go against the 14th Amendment.
“The Trump administration agrees with us on that question, but we know that the battle is not easily won,” Kobch said, “because as soon as the Trump administration agrees, then the blue states will come in and fight against us.”
Kobach also appeared on a panel on Aug. 28 at the Alaska Oil and Gas Association annual conference, where he promoted Kansas as one of the early challengers of Title IX rules during the Biden administration. He also described the threat of “left-wing anti-energy litigators” that are “convincing county commissions and city councils to go to court against the oil industry.”
“So the reason I’m so energized about fighting back against that is Ford County, Kansas, which you probably never heard of,” he said.
A group of Kansas citizens and Ford County sued plastic, oil and chemical companies in 2024, arguing that the companies lied for decades about the recyclability of plastic, creating a pollution crisis.
Kobach blamed the lawsuit on litigators from California, purporting to represent all U.S. citizens.
“My office is chasing them around, trying to get them kicked out of court because they don’t speak for the people of Kansas,” he said.
Kobach added: “They can’t use the Biden administration, but they can find lots of gullible or left-leaning cities and states to do their dirty work.”

Tribal colleges and universities faced a major funding scare earlier this year after the White House proposed slashing the Bureau of Indian Education’s budget by 90%, Indian Country Today reported. The bureau supports dozens of higher ed institutions serving Native communities across the country, including five in North Dakota.
Both chambers of Congress have since indicated they will keep the funding intact, meaning that the college presidents no longer expect any drastic budget disruptions.
Still, they said they plan to tighten their belts for the time being. 
North Dakota tribes become a model for promoting Native tourism

Twyla Baker, president of Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College, said her institution has had to make difficult decisions in light of the uncertainty — including eliminating some positions.
“I know that my facilities budget is so razor thin,” Baker said during a Wednesday panel discussion at the Tribal Leaders Summit at the Bismarck Event Center. “Nothing better break, because it’s going to be bubble gum and duct tape going forward from here.”
She likened the funding situation to a “shell game.” She said even though Congress is expected to approve the Bureau of Indian Education funding, Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College stands to lose out on money from grants from other sources. The college is scrambling to fill in the gaps, Baker said.
Turtle Mountain Community College President Wanda Parisien said her school had $133,000 from the National Science Foundation cut. 
For now, the college hasn’t had any other funding pulled, she said.

“We’re crossing our fingers and hoping that everything stays that way,” Parisien said.
The college presidents stressed that their institutions are major economic drivers for their communities, and provide affordable education to many low-income and first-generation students. Defunding their schools will negatively affect the whole state, they said.
Several presidents also noted that the funding disruption comes at a time when their enrollment has gone up.
They also pointed to a recent impact study that found that for the 2022-2023 fiscal year, North Dakota’s tribal college system brought in almost $170 million to the state’s economy. That equated to roughly 2,100 jobs, according to the report.
“Some in-county students would have left Rolette County for other educational opportunities, if not for TMCC,” Parisien said.
North Dakota’s tribal colleges were established in the late 1960s and early 1970s to serve the five tribal communities that share land with the state. They play a central role in preserving the history, cultures and languages of the tribes, in addition to providing other post-secondary education. 
“We need all the states that tribal colleges reside in to know the value of what it is that they have,” Baker said. “This is a good value, and it makes no sense whatsoever to cut funding for tribal colleges across the board.”
Russ McDonald, president of United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck, said that his school is also being conservative with its budget amid the federal funding changes. He said all tribal colleges and universities should be prepared to streamline their finances, but that he doesn’t think there’s a reason to panic.
“We’re going to be all right,” McDonald said. “We’ve been here before as tribal peoples — we’re resilient.”

Nearing the end of summer, at least half the state is dry enough to threaten food and water access for farm animals like dairy cows.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  As drought persists, livestock farmers in Vermont are hurting.","Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
George Foster, a third-generation farmer in Middlebury, cut corn on a neighbor’s farm on Tuesday to help feed his 950 cows after this summer’s drought shrunk his own crop. 
The 2,000 tons of additional feed cost roughly $100,000, Foster said, not including the labor of harvesting the corn and trucking it home to his dairy farm. The last time the 2,300-acre farm had to buy extra feed was in 1965, Foster said. 
The U.S. Drought Monitor, a national drought mapping project out of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, shows that all of Vermont is in a moderate or severe drought, as of Sept. 2. For farmers, that’s making a difficult dairy business even more challenging as they’re forced to haul water and buy feed to keep the cows producing milk through the heat. 
Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux, the state climatologist, said there are two types of drought in the state right now: a long-term drought that began last fall and a flash drought that began around June 4. Some streamwater gauges and groundwater wells are at the lowest levels ever seen in Vermont since record keeping began up to 109 years ago, according to Dupigny-Giroux. 
While this particular drought has not yet been directly linked to climate change, a warming planet, caused largely by the burning of fossil fuels, increases extreme weather events and patterns like heat waves, floods and drought. 
Dupigny-Giroux encouraged Vermonters to record what they’re observing with the drought at the University of Nebraska’s Drought Condition Monitoring Observations and Reports; so far, she said, there were only two observations recorded across the entire state. 
Jon Lucas, of Lucas Dairy, has been hauling up to 5,000 gallons of water per day from a creek to his farm in Orwell since his three wells started drying up in June. Lucas said a typical milk cow needs to drink about 50 gallons of water to produce 100-150 pounds of milk a day. Some farmers said they’ve lost about ten pounds a day of milk per cow because of the heat, and the lack of feed could worsen the conditions, Lucas said. 
“The first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before I go to bed is making sure the cows have water,” Lucas said, adding that along with being a huge time commitment, hauling the water was mentally draining. 
The dry spell comes from a shortfall in precipitation that’s affecting the entire state, but particularly the Northeast Kingdom, Dupigny-Giroux said. Rainfall could hit Vermont through the weekend, she said, but it won’t cure the various types and stages of drought impacting the state. 
“It took us a while to get into this drought,” Dupigny-Giroux said. “It’ll take us a while to get out, barring tremendous amounts of rain.” 
Depending on the region of the state, it would require roughly six to eight inches of rain throughout a month to pull the state out of the drought, according to Dupigny-Giroux. That much rain would have to make it down through the soil and into the groundwater without being taken up by thirsty plants along the way. 
Lindsey Brand, the marketing and communications director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, a farmer-led organization advocating for sustainable agriculture, said the state’s drought particularly impacted livestock farmers. 
“We’re seeing a lot of folks who have not been able to do a third cut of hay,” Brand said, referring to a harvesting practice that increases grass yields by cutting the crop throughout the season. “That’s a pretty serious blow on the farm.” 
That means farmers like Lucas and Foster, who normally can grow enough to feed their herds, have to buy additional feed, creeping into their already slim margins in the dairy industry, where there are fixed prices for fluid milk that don’t oscillate to meet the needs of the milk producers. 
A consolidating dairy industry means there’s a very small number of buyers, and they’re able to set a low milk price, Brand said.
“The choice for dairy farmers is, do they want to sell or not sell their milk?” Brand said. “The price is set for them. They can’t negotiate based on an increased cost of production, so a year like this serious drought situation and buying more feed because cows can’t graze means their already-small margins have shrunk significantly.” 
Graham Unanst-Rufenacht, the policy director at Rural Vermont, a small-farmer advocacy organization, said most small-scale vegetable farmers are less vulnerable because they can rely on irrigation. Larger animal operations, however, have struggled to rotate their grazing lands, provide enough feed and access enough water since wetter weather ended in June. 
Unanst-Rufenacht manages his own animals to encourage ecological resilience on his Marshfield farm, frequently moving animals in tight groups across his 15 acres. But a drought like this summer’s slows pasture regeneration and can impact how much pasture is available for feed. 
Lucas said he’s spending $50,000-$100,000 on feed products like corn, hay and wet brew, a byproduct from making beer, to feed his 300 cows and supplement what he normally harvests from his 900 acres of cropland along Lake Champlain. 
Lucas is a first-generation farmer, and he said this is the worst dry spell he’s experienced on his farm since he purchased the acreage in 2012. 
State funds could help alleviate the crunch through a proposed Farm Security Fund, said Unanst-Rufenacht. 
Originally, the measure requested $20 million annually to support farmers impacted by extreme weather conditions increasing under climate change, but that request was whittled down to $1 million during the last legislative session before lawmakers tabled the bill entirely. 
“The exact purpose is that, if there’s an extreme weather event, rather than a business being rocked to the ground, it can receive flexible, quick funding and recover,” Brand said. She said the fund was more important than ever to meet the new paradigm of a changing climate that has swung between two years of horrible floods to a summer largely impacted by drought, along with a smaller spate of floods in July. 
“Farmers are on the front line of climate change,” Brand said. “We don’t want to see our agricultural system collapse in the face of this new normal.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Recent cooler temperatures at the end of August across western Montana has prompted Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks to relax fishing restrictions on many rivers throughout the state.
With forecasts predicting continued low temperatures and increased precipitation in the western parts of the state next week, FWP reports that water temperatures have met the threshold for lifting most hoot-owl restrictions.
In Regions 2, 3 and 4, restrictions have been lifted or changed on the following rivers:

Silver Bow Creek – in its entirety


Bitterroot River – from Veterans Bridge at Hamilton to the confluence with the Clark Fork River (upper river restriction remains)


Clark Fork River – from the Clark Fork’s origin at the confluence of Warm Springs Creek and Silver Bow Creek to the mouth of the Blackfoot River


Beaverhead River – from Highway 41 near East Bench Road and Beaverhead Rock to its confluence with the Big Hole River


East Gallatin River – from Penwell Bridge Road to the confluence with the Gallatin River


Gallatin River – from Amsterdam Road to the confluence with the Missouri River


Madison River – from downstream most Yellowstone National Park (YNP) boundary to Hebgen Reservoir will switch from a full closure to hoot-owl restrictions. The three short sections that exit YNP near Baker’s Hole campground will remain closed to align with the existing hoot-owl restriction issued by the National Park Service on the Madison River.


Ruby River – from Duncan District Road to confluence with the Beaverhead River


Smith River – from the confluence of the North and South forks to Eden Bridge

On the Jefferson River FWP lifted fishing restrictions on Tuesday from the confluence of the Big Hole and Beaverhead rivers to the Missouri River, has been lifted.
Effective Aug. 4, hoot owl restrictions are no longer in place on the Blackfoot River, from the headwaters at the confluence of Anaconda Creek and Beartrap Creek to the confluence with the Clark Fork River. Restrictions are also lifted on upper Rock Creek, from the confluence of the West and Middle forks to the mouth of Stoney Creek.  The remainder of Rock Creek was not under restriction.
FWP also announced Thursday that restrictions have bene lifted on the Sun River from the mouth of Muddy Creek to Highway 287 Bridge.
Many restrictions had been in effect for the rivers since early- to mid-July due to warm water temperatures. Hoot-owl restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when low flows and high water temperatures combine with other stressors, including catch-and-release fishing.
Anglers can reduce stress on fish at all times of the year by getting fish to the net or in hand quickly, keeping them in the water, and reviving them prior to releasing them back into the river.

Along with monitoring stream temperatures, FWP also monitors stream flows, and in some streams, holds instream flow water rights. FWP’s water program can issue a call on junior water users, when appropriate, to contribute to stream flows through the late summer and early fall.

Larry Robinson, D-Valley City, died Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo provided by North Dakota Legislative Assembly)Former North Dakota lawmaker Larry Robinson died Wednesday, according to a statement from Valley City State University, which Robinson worked to support for nearly 50 years.
Robinson, 75, a Democrat, served in the North Dakota Senate from 1989 to 2020. 
Valley City State University President Alan LaFave called Robinson an “ardent supporter of higher education in North Dakota.”
Robinson retired in 2024 as executive director of university advancement at Valley City State. He began working for the university in 1975 as director of the Memorial Student Center and Student Activities and later became the first director of the university’s foundation.
In the Legislature, Robinson served on the interim Higher Education Committee for several years. He also was a longtime member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, in addition to other committees.
LaFave said Robinson was instrumental in securing state funding for the Rhoades Science Center renovation in 2013 and the Center for the Arts, which opened in 2022 and was recently renamed the Larry J. Robinson Center for the Arts.
“His legacy will live on in the scholarships he helped create, the students whose lives he touched, and the vibrant facilities that stand as a testament to his work,” LaFave said in a statement.
Sen. Ken Davison, R-Fargo, recognized Robinson at the start of a legislative committee meeting on Thursday. 
Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, a member of the committee, said Robinson could also be known as “Mr. Valley City” for his contributions to the university and representing the area in Legislature for more than three decades.
“He was such a gentleman,” Hogan said. “He was classy, respectful, thoughtful, but also very, very compassionate and committed to education, all education, but particularly in Valley City.”
He was nonpartisan, and lawmakers wanted him on their committees because they knew they would be better off with his input, she said.
Sen. Dick Dever, R-Bismarck, also a member of the committee, remembered that in the session after Robinson lost his reelection bid in 2020, he still showed up at the Capitol and brought donuts for his former colleagues.
In a statement, Gov. Kelly Armstrong called Robinson a “true statesman of the Senate.” 
“His positive impact on VCSU and our higher education system will benefit students and our state for generations to come,” said Armstrong, who served in the state Senate with Robinson from 2013 to 2018.
Funeral arrangements were pending as of Thursday.

Here, the crowd listens to Nick's Other Band on Sept. 2, 2025. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)I know the nation is divided. I know it from the variations in how our anger manifests and at whom that anger is directed. I know it from the way we talk about real people as if they are objects of policy. I know it from the new victims created daily and in bulk. I know it from the red ball caps and yard signs, the bumper stickers and graffiti.
But I also know that on Tuesday evenings, all summer long, you could watch that divide fall away during a free concert series in Henniker’s community park. I know that the invisible walls collapse on the packed trails up and down Mount Kearsarge, and disappear beneath picnic blankets spread at the edges of Lake Sunapee. I know rage dissipates a little with every door held open for the person behind. And I know that in all of our public spaces, small kindnesses doled out reflexively and received gratefully transcend the burden of our politics. 
I know the American divide is real — but so, too, is its absence.
One of the great tragedies of politics is that in one way or another our dividedness is freshly exploited with every election, and these days election season never ends. The big story out of New Hampshire this week is that former U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu, a Republican, is considering a run for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen next year. If he does run, and wins the Republican primary, Sununu will most likely face heavy Democratic favorite and current 1st District Rep. Chris Pappas. That race undoubtedly will be the most expensive in New Hampshire history and one of the priciest of the 2026 cycle.
In 2004, according to Open Secrets, former U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg spent just over $2.5 million to defeat Democratic challenger Doris “Granny D” Haddock, who spent $177,000. Six years later, Republican Kelly Ayotte spent about $5 million to defeat Paul Hodes, who nearly matched her at $4.9 million. In 2016, after the Citizens United ruling that opened the floodgates for big money in politics, Ayotte and current U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan combined to raise and spend just under $40 million, but with outside spending the race’s cost ballooned to $131 million. Six years after that, in New Hampshire’s most recent U.S. Senate race, Hassan spent more than $40 million to Republican Don Bolduc’s $4 million on the way to reelection. But outside spending pushed that election’s price tag north of $93 million. 
How much would a Sununu-Pappas matchup cost? Maybe something like the 2024 U.S. Senate race in Arizona, which cost a total of $170 million? Or maybe closer to Wisconsin’s race that year, which came in at nearly $210 million? Or maybe that kind of heavyweight matchup could even approach Ohio’s last U.S. Senate contest, which passed the $420 million mark?
What a difference 20 years and a society-destroying U.S. Supreme Court decision make.

It’s fitting, of course, that Granny D is among the last of the small-time spenders for a U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire. More than a quarter-century ago, she famously walked from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., to raise awareness about the dire need for campaign finance reform, arriving in the nation’s capital on Feb. 29, 2000. She was 88 when she started and 90 when she finished, and she died, also fittingly, in 2010, the year of Citizens United.
I’m sure Granny D felt the American divide at times on her long walk, but I’d bet the farm that it’s the absence of division she noticed most. She understood that the real “us” and “them” dynamic is between those working-class millions who struggle daily to make ends meet in America and those powerful few who can afford to buy policies and politicians to serve their own ends.
But all of the corporate and personal wealth in the world isn’t enough if the lower and middle classes are united (which, if they really wanted to improve their own lot, they should be), so what those dollars actually buy is the carving up of the electorate. That is ultimately what gives us our back-and-forth majorities, our do-nothing (except tax breaks) congresses, our career politicians, and most of the same old domestic problems year in and year out — too-expensive housing, too-expensive health care, too-expensive child care, too-expensive groceries, too-expensive energy, etc. 
And it’s also what has delivered upon us a particularly hateful brand of politics and policies that have altered not only how other nations see America but how we see ourselves. We are, in many ways, exactly what the monied special interests have paid for us to be: fractured.
But I’ve seen enough, here and there, to know that it doesn’t have to be that way. This summer, I took every opportunity to visit that park in Henniker on Tuesday nights, even if it was just a quick look and listen through an open truck window. In times like these, sometimes just a glimpse of community is enough to make the heart swell. 
Like a lot of small towns in New Hampshire, Henniker is pretty evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. In the 2024 election, for example, Democrat Kamala Harris edged Republican Donald Trump, 1,548-1,324, and Republican Kelly Ayotte beat out Democrat Joyce Craig, 1,437-1,352. The margins were like that up and down the ballot — this is truly a politically divided community. On paper. 
But the thing is, you’d never know it by walking around, especially on summer Tuesday nights. 
The spirit of community hasn’t died — not in Henniker nor the vast majority of towns and cities throughout this country — but broader harmony is being suffocated by dark policies purchased with dark money. Campaign finance reform alone won’t be enough to reverse that, I know, but I agree with law professor and activist Lawrence Lessig that to fix anything in this country we must fix that first. 
I mean, if you don’t have a problem with a U.S. Senate race costing a few hundred million or more, a divided America is the least of your worries: It turns out that you’re not even on your own side.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/hennikerconcert-1024x701.jpg,,,2025-09-04 17:57:45.123859

House Bill 4024, sponsored Rep. Joseph Fox(R-Fremont), passed the House on a party line vote of 58 to 46. Democratic representatives including Alabas Farhat, Peter Herzberg, Donavan McKinney, Cynthia Neeley and Karen Whitsett did not vote on the bill. Rep. Betsy Coffia of Traverse City also did not vote on the bill, but is recuperating from brain surgery. 

The policy would restrict student access to certain bathrooms and changing areas based on the person’s gender at birth, effectively banning transgender students from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. It has zero chance of passing in the Democratic-led Senate.
Still, Rep. Brad Paquette (R-Niles) spoke in support of the bill on the House floor and defended “sex-based spaces in Michigan schools.”
“Little girls are being discriminated against in their sex-based spaces in this state, and that must end,” Paquette said, adding that those who are misled to believe they have gender identity disorder “should not be invading the spaces of the little girls in this state.”
That basic premise, in which gender is defined solely on one’s reproductive organs, is at odds with the scientific consensus about the complexity of what determines biological sex in humans. 
Vote tally on House Bill 4024. Sept. 4, 2025 | Screenshot
Rep. Helena Scott (D-Detroit) spoke in opposition to the bill. 
If enacted, Scott said the bill would infringe on civil rights by denying people access to bathroom facilities aligned with their gender identity. 
“This is a violation of the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act,” Scott said. “As lawmakers, it is our responsibility to protect the rights of Michiganders, most certainly including those of our kids and students. This legislation defies that very important responsibility by rolling back rights and eroding discrimination protections outlined in ELCRA. “
Scott said enforcement of the policy would be a near impossible feat, and she likened it to a distraction as the state faces a looming government shutdown over stalled budget negotiations.
“What Michigan kids and students really need is funding for their schools,” Scott said before being gaveled down by House Speaker Pro Tem Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin).

In response to the bill’s passage, Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, said the policy would surely violate ELCRA. Knott also touched on the fact that the House was concerning itself with who uses which bathroom instead of ending the budget stalemate.
“Weeks away from a state shutdown, the Michigan House would rather be bathroom police than do their jobs,” Knott said. “While they’re obsessing over bathroom policies, Michigan families need them focused on funding our schools and making the economy work. This policy is rooted in bias against trans people that goes against Michigan values of fairness and equality.”

(Photo by Bear Gulch Fire 2025 via Facebook)Wildland fire veterans are seething at a claim made by federal officials that two crews raided by immigration agents at the scene of a wildfire in Washington state were “NOT firefighters.” 
Many political figures and media outlets have repeated the claim, even though public documents show the crews have firefighting classifications and were assigned to key frontline roles battling the blaze. 
“Everybody in the profession sees through it, but the public doesn’t and that’s concerning,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “It’s a lie. Everybody I’ve talked to is very upset about it. It does not just those two crews a disservice, but it does all firefighters a disservice.”
Duncan also serves as vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Firefighters question leaders’ role in Washington immigration raid

Last week, federal immigration officials staged a raid at the site of the Bear Gulch fire in Washington, the largest active wildfire in the state. Agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection questioned two crews, totaling 44 members, and arrested two firefighters who they said were in the country illegally.
News of the operation rocked the wildland fire community. Veterans in the profession say the raid broke with longstanding protocol that immigration agents don’t disrupt responders on the scene of emergencies. 
On Aug. 29, two days after the raid, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a message on social media platform X, attacking the “mainstream media” for spreading “fake news.”
“The two illegal aliens apprehended were NOT firefighters,” the post read. “The two contracted work crews questioned on the day of their arrests were not even assigned to actively fight the fire; they were there in a support role, cutting logs into firewood. The firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time.”
Many news outlets ran stories that the agency had “clarified” the role of the crews or “denied” reports that firefighters had been arrested. In subsequent coverage, some news outlets have characterized the crews as playing a supporting role, while avoiding the term “firefighters.”
Political figures have also repeated the claim from DHS. State Rep. Jim Walsh, chair of the Washington State Republican Party, shared another user’s post on Facebook blasting the media for failing to report the truth. The crews, Walsh wrote in his own comments, were “NOT firefighters.” The post has been shared hundreds of times.
“Facts matter,” Walsh wrote. “But the Left doesn’t let facts get in the way of its ignorant sanctimony and virtue signaling.”
But the facts clearly show that the crews were firefighters. In planning documents drafted by the management team overseeing the fire and posted to a public federal database, the crew from contracting company ASI Arden Solutions, Inc., is listed as a “CR2I” crew. That’s shorthand for a Type II Initial Attack wildland firefighting crew. 
“They’re just one level below a hotshot crew,” Duncan said. “[Saying they’re not firefighters] is incredibly insulting to them.”
Immigration raid at Washington blaze stokes fear in wildfire crews nationwide

The other crew, from contracting company Table Rock Forestry, Inc., is listed as a “CRW2,” short for a Type II wildland firefighting hand crew. That means both crews were certified under National Wildfire Coordinating Group standards as firefighters who met rigorous qualifications and held “red cards” verifying their status to fight fire. 
Additionally, the documents show that both crews were assigned to active firefighting roles in the days leading up to the raid. The crews were tasked with securing the fire edge, protecting structures, constructing fire lines and addressing hazards caused by the initial suppression work. 
Many wildfire veterans who have served in similar roles privately expressed anger that the crew’s status was called into question because they had been assigned to cut firewood on the day of the raid. That frustration is heightened by the widespread belief, shared by many fire professionals, that the crews were given that assignment under false pretenses to lead them into contact with federal immigration agents.
“They were doing suppression work, and it was only when they were reassigned that day [that they were raided],” Duncan said. “To paint this picture that they would never do that to actual firefighters, it’s total spin.”
Even if the firewood cutting assignment had been legitimate, Duncan said, many firefighters perform critical support roles that don’t involve actively battling the blaze. To deny their status as firefighters based on their assignment that day, she said, would be like discrediting a local fire department because they were working out in the fire station. 
Many wildfire veterans, including Duncan, said they are demoralized by how quickly the claim has spread. 
“The fact that some are picking this up without doing due diligence, it’s lazy and insulting to the firefighters,” she said. “It’s really affecting the morale of the workforce to hear those things being echoed in media outlets.”

Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat, at the Georgia State Capitol on Sept 4, 2025. (Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder)Survivors of the deadly Apalachee High School shooting gathered alongside Georgia House Democrats at the state Capitol Thursday to renew calls for safe gun storage laws.
Students and family members joined state Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat, and Georgia House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley of Columbus for a press conference calling on lawmakers to pass legislation they believe is needed to prevent future attacks and arguing that current efforts are not enough to address the trauma and fear that now define their school experience. The Sept. 4, 2024, shooting in the Winder high school left two students and two teachers dead and nine other students injured.
“We all can agree in this room that we need to protect all our children. No child deserves to have the fear of having to go to school. No child deserves to experience what we have experienced. It’s not fair,” said Kyra Lynn McConatha, a recent Apalachee High School graduate who was in class during the attack. “This has followed me from high school and into college.”
Au has previously introduced a bill that would have required gun owners to secure their firearms in a locked container or with a gun lock when a minor is present. The bill failed to move in the 2025 legislative session, but it will remain active when lawmakers reconvene in January.
“To not even discuss [the bill], to not even allow bills like a pretty basic, safe storage bill to be heard in committee, to come to a vote, to be voted on the floor, is noticeable for Georgians and for voters,” Au said after the press conference.
Senate Majority Leader Jason Anavitarte, Dallas Republican, in a separate statement marked the one-year anniversary by saying that Georgia has since moved to protect schools from such deadly attacks. He pointed to House Bill 268, which he said was a result of working with victims’ families and school leaders. The new law, which went into effect on July 1, requires schools to have panic button systems for emergencies and share student data within five school days when a student transfers.
“Georgia has taken bold, practical steps to protect our children, teachers and everyone who sets foot in a school setting. We will continue to listen, learn and legislate with the conviction that school should always be a place of safety, not fear,” Anavitarte said in a statement.
Au responded to Anavitarte’s comment after the press conference, saying that the law was reactive rather than preventative.
“It’s a conspicuous omission to have a bill inspired by this event directed at school safety and have nothing in that bill or nothing in that legislative package that deals with gun safety,” Au said.

Sen. Frank Ginn, a Danielsville Republican who represents a part of Winder, said he attended the press conference after receiving an invite from Au to hear what the lawmakers and students had to say, despite not supporting the efforts to mandate safe gun storage. He said he would support a tax credit incentive for gun storage.

“The safest storage for a firearm is in the hands of somebody that knows how to use it, and I don’t want to put any obstacle in the way of a person who wants to defend themselves and protect their Second Amendment right,” Ginn said.
Layla Contreras, a 2019 Apalachee High School graduate and sister of Sasha Contreras, a current senior who was in class during the attack, said after the press conference that Au’s proposal is “a good start,” but they may have to make some changes to address Republicans’ concerns.
“We just want people to be responsible with it and to be educated on when firearms are around,” Layla Contreras said.
Sasha Contreras said that she has tried over the last year to stay positive and not let the attack define her. She has tried to keep up with schoolwork and is involved in extracurricular activities, but she said she still struggles to maintain her motivation.
“I still try my best to put my best smile on, and I enter that building as positive as I can be,” she said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20250904_130658086-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

Kayvon Powell had previously told WyoFile that officers handled him roughly during an arrest last fall.
The post Lander man alleges excessive force by officers who pepper-sprayed him in lawsuit against police, city appeared first on WyoFile .","A Lander man who accused local police of excessive force during an arrest last fall has sued the city, the department and several officers, alleging police violated his civil rights when they roughly handcuffed and pepper-sprayed him. 
Two Lander Police Department officers arrested Kayvon Powell in September 2024 after stopping him in his car for alleged reckless driving — a charge Powell denied and was never convicted of. The encounter quickly devolved into a shouting match after Powell said he was unable to roll his broken window down and Sgt. Ron Wells instead opened Powell’s car door without permission. 
After an increasingly contentious encounter in which Powell said he feared for his safety, Wells and another officer arrested Powell.
His lawsuit, filed Tuesday, focuses largely on the officers’ use of pepper spray during that arrest, which his attorneys allege violated Powell’s civil rights against unnecessary and unreasonable force. 
WyoFile examined Powell’s allegations of abuse by the officers, and his subsequent trial on charges of interfering with a police officer, for an investigation published in June. During Powell’s trial in April, a Fremont County judge described Wells as “out of line, absolutely 100% out of line,” during the arrest. It was a rare admonishment from a Wyoming judge to a law enforcement officer.

Lander’s interim police chief, Kelly Waugh, and a city official declined to comment on the lawsuit. “Public comment at this time could compromise the City’s legal position and privileged communications,” they wrote in a prepared statement.
Waugh told WyoFile, in an interview this summer, that Wells had “taken full ownership that he did not handle himself appropriately that day.” But Waugh declined to say whether Wells faced any disciplinary proceedings, saying instead that as chief, he was impressed by the sergeant’s willingness to take responsibility for his actions.
In the lawsuit, Powell’s attorneys claim that the officers’ use of pepper spray did not violate the Lander Police Department’s policy at the time. The suit describes the policy as “completely inadequate, improper and unconstitutional.” 
Wells and another officer, Casey Tadewald, ultimately arrested Powell on suspicion of interfering with a police officer, after he declined to show Wells any identification. A Fremont County jury later convicted Powell of the interference charge — a misdemeanor. Prosecutors dropped a reckless driving charge before the trial. Powell has denied that allegation.
Powell is appealing his interference conviction. He is being represented by a public defender in that case and the two matters will proceed independently of each other. 
During the arrest, body camera footage shows the officers treating Powell roughly, though he says he did not resist, as they remove him from his car, handcuff him and take him to a police cruiser. In the lawsuit, Powell’s attorneys say he complied with the officers throughout the arrest, and got in the police car as ordered. 
Once Powell was in the cruiser, Tadewald blasted the back seat of the car, and the handcuffed man, with pepper spray, according to the lawsuit. In Wells’ subsequent police report, he wrote Tadewald used the pepper spray because Powell blocked the car door’s closing with his feet. Powell denied that to WyoFile, and described the pepper spray as a vindictive move by the officers.
His lawsuit echoes that allegation, accusing Wells and Tadewald of using “gratuitous and excessive force” during the arrest. The complaint claims the officers closed the car door successfully. But then Wells opened the door and Tadewald sprayed Powell, the complaint alleges. The suit also alleges that Wells at first kept the rear windows closed as he drove Powell to the Lander jail. 
As Powell pleaded for fresh air and some relief from the pepper spray in his eyes, Wells told him “that’s what you get,” according to the complaint. 
The officers’ “violence, wanton use of pain tactics, and unreasonable use of pepper spray by Defendant Tadewald against Mr. Powell was without legal justification or provocation,” the complaint reads. 
Powell is represented by Spence Law Firm, a well-known law firm out of Jackson. (Storied litigator and firm founder Gerry Spence passed away last month.) Powell is also represented by Lander attorney Bailey Lazzari. 
Powell, a Black man who moved to Lander from Charlottesville, Virginia, sometime after 2017, is bringing a rare lawsuit for Wyoming. Last year, only two claims were filed against Equality State law enforcement officers on constitutional grounds, according to a report from the state insurance pool responsible for covering them. In 2023, there were eight such claims, and the highest number of constitutional claims made against officers in recent years came in 2020, with 13.  
Nationally, fewer than 1% of people who think police officers violated their rights ever file a lawsuit, according to academic researchers. People who do sue the police face a high bar for legal victory, as federal court precedent gives officers wide latitude for actions undertaken on duty. Even cases that survive motions to dismiss are successful only around 15% of the time, according to the Harvard Law Review.
Powell’s lawsuit does not allege discrimination or racism. He previously told WyoFile he believes his appearance has impacted the way local law enforcement treated him in Lander, a claim the police chief denied. 
Following his court case, Powell approached the chief, Kelly Waugh, at a Lander gas station and surreptitiously recorded him. 
The chief conceded to Powell that “what he [Wells] did was very unprofessional,” according to a copy of the recording which Powell previously provided WyoFile. Powell then told the chief he intended to sue the department, prompting Waugh to end the conversation. At that point, Waugh later told WyoFile, the matter needed to be handled by attorneys. 
Despite the chief’s admission that Wells had expressed concern about his own actions during the arrest, the county did not drop its prosecution of Powell, who received probation with a suspended 45-day jail sentence. Lander officials never made any moves to make amends to Powell, attorney Noah Drew of the Spence Law Firm told WyoFile.
“What happened to Kayvon is indefensible,” Drew said. “While the Lander Chief of Police acknowledged it was wrong — the city of Lander has neither apologized nor taken steps to make it right. That silence underscores why cases like this must be brought.”

Jared Polis released a report on the impacts of federal tariffs on Colorado's economy at the governor's mansion in Denver on Sept. 4, 2025. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s effective tariff rate is seven times what it was last year following sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, according to a new report released by Gov. Jared Polis’ office.
“One thing that’s clear is that everyone loses a trade war,” Polis told reporters at the Governor’s Residence in Denver during a press conference Thursday. “It’s a race to the bottom.”
A tariff is a tax on imported goods. President Donald Trump has imposed a patchwork of tariff rates on different countries, many of them stemming from a 10% baseline tariff on all imports imposed in April. Tariffs currently in effect include 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, 39% on Swiss goods and 15% on goods from the European Union. Trump has also imposed high tariff rates on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese goods — which account for roughly half of Colorado’s imports — but those are in flux as the countries negotiate, and they exclude Canadian and Mexican products included in the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact. There are also individual tariffs on imported cars, steel, aluminum and copper.

Companies that bring foreign goods into the country are responsible for those tariff costs.
“When businesses face high tariffs and the associated uncertainty and confusion, they have difficult choices,” said Jeff Kraft, the deputy director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. “Companies are forced to either pass costs onto consumers, which raises prices and can reduce revenue and obviously hurts the consumer, or they have to shift funds to cover the cost of the tariffs internally.”
Polis requested the tariff impact analysis through an executive order in July. The analysis says the estimated effective tariff rate in Colorado last year was 3% but now it has increased to 21%.

– Jeff Kraft, deputy director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade


The hardest hit industries in Colorado will likely be agriculture, energy, construction and aerospace. The state’s beef exports, for example, fell by nearly $40 million in the first half of this year compared to last year, and the report’s authors estimate a combined direct and indirect impact of that loss of beef exports to be a reduction of 265 jobs and $80 million of economic output in Colorado.
The Swiss tariffs could have a big impact on Colorado’s aerospace industry, which imports about 73% of its materials from the country. Product-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum and copper could also affect aerospace defense manufacturing. The report considered a potential 5% reduction in foreign demand for Colorado aerospace products and concluded an estimated 195 lost jobs and $61.6 million in gross domestic product loss.
Additionally, tariffs related to imported construction materials and the countries that supply them could increase construction costs for new homes by 4% to 6%, according to the report.
“There’s no doubt that any costs associated with tariffs are directly incorporated into construction costs and into housing costs,” Polis said. “Of course, we’re doing everything we can to reduce the cost of construction as a state, and this works counter to that goal.”

There is potential that the tariffs will impact state revenue as well, because they are expected to weaken consumer spending and slow economic growth. The state could lose about $240 million in general fund revenue during the current fiscal year and about $450 million next fiscal year if the current tariff rates hold. That is a potential estimate and not part of an official economic forecast, which will come later this month.
The Colorado Legislature recently wrapped up a special session to raise revenue to soften the adverse impacts of the recent federal spending and tax cut bill.
Colorado was part of a coalition of states that sued the Trump administration over the tariffs imposed using emergency authority. An appeals court found that most of those tariffs were an illegal use of the emergency powers law, but the decision left the tariffs in place for now and Trump is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case.
Polis is hoping the courts will negate the tariffs, and he called on Congress to do more. The state does not have any power regarding this international trade policy.
“We really hope that Congress shows a spine and pushes back against costly increases through tariffs and try to change the mind of the president in the White House,” he said. “Congress absolutely can limit the authority of a president. They can do that in the spending bills that they’re considering right now. They can restrict the ability of any president to unilaterally impose tariffs.”

(Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)The fate of a voter-approved measure to slow Washington’s shift from natural gas toward technology like electric heat pumps will be decided by the state Supreme Court.
Chief Justice Debra Stephens signed an order Wednesday to have Washington’s high court directly review a lower court ruling invalidating Initiative 2066 that passed last November. 
The initiative targets changes to the state energy code that offer builders incentives in the permitting process for choosing electric heat pumps – which provide both heating and cooling in the same unit – instead of natural gas furnaces.
And it seeks to repeal provisions in a year-old state law intended to accelerate Puget Sound Energy’s transition away from natural gas. It prevents approval of utility rate plans that end or restrict access to natural gas, or make it too costly. 
In March, King County Superior Court Judge Sandra Widlan struck down the measure. She ruled that it is unconstitutional because it runs afoul of a provision limiting citizen initiatives to no more than one subject and requiring them to contain the full text of the portion of state laws they would alter. 
Widlan said the purpose of the single subject requirement is to prevent “logrolling”’ or pushing through “undesirable legislation by attaching it to desirable legislation.”
Initiative sponsors maintain it complies with all constitutional constraints and sought direct review by the state Supreme Court.
“Every single section of 2066 addresses protecting the choice to access and use natural gas,” said Greg Lane, executive vice president of the Building Industry Association of Washington, in a statement. “The initiative was clear and voters clearly understood they were voting for energy choice.”
Attorney General Nick Brown disagrees with the policy but believes voters passed an initiative that is constitutional.
“My job as Attorney General is to enforce and defend the laws of Washington and I will continue to vigorously do so in this case,” he said in May after petitioning the state high court to take the case.
Nearly 52% of voters backed the measure in November.
Weeks later a coalition of groups and elected leaders filed a lawsuit challenging its legality. Foes of the measure didn’t oppose the state high court taking the case.
A spokesman for one of the litigants said they are confident the justices will rule against the initiative.
“We are committed to ensuring that initiative 2066 is overturned, and that Washington remains a leader in the transition to clean and affordable electricity,” Dylan Plummer, campaign advisor for the Sierra Club’s Building Electrification Campaign, said in an email.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/0-2.jpg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

The $5.09 billion request marks a 1.7% decrease from the previous year, according to Public Education Secretary Mariana Padilla’s presentation.
However, Padilla noted several missing elements in the request, including compensation bumps; insurance costs; and all of the components of the court-ordered remedial action plan for the long-running Yazzie/Martinez education equity lawsuit, as it’s not due until October. 
She asked the committee and LESC staff to take this information into account as they develop their own budget requests for public education over the next several months.“This budget has been submitted by the department about three months sooner than we typically do,” Padilla told lawmakers. “A lot of hours go into looking at our programs, looking at the needs. Deep discussions with our staff, as well as our stakeholders.”
Padilla said the budget also does not include an increase in K-12 Plus Program funding due to enrollment declines and shorter calendar years. The K-12 Plus Program provides schools with additional funding for days added to the calendar above the legislatively required 180 days for five-day learning weeks. 
PED Secretary Mariana Padilla said her agency presented its budget three months earlier than usual to state lawmakers. (Courtesy photo)
“The average school calendars statewide have been reduced by two school days,” she said. “Schools, as they set their own calendars — as they do every year — we’re seeing on average two fewer days. We’ll be able to finalize our K-12 Plus numbers in October when we go through that reporting period.”
Padilla’s presentation highlighted several areas of priority, including educator recruitment and quality; literacy; student nutrition; accountability; academic interventions and supports; math and STEAM; special education; graduation; and school safety. The budget includes $37.3 million for educator and leadership training and teacher pipeline programs.
The secretary pointed out that New Mexico public schools had about 681 teacher vacancies last academic year, or a 3% statewide vacancy rate. The request for training funds also includes money for implementing and growing the newly required school board training requirement, to ensure school leaders are knowledgeable in state law and their responsibilities to the schools, educators and students.
The department’s budget also includes $57 million for literacy, including implementing structured literacy and training, as well as summer reading programs. Padilla told lawmakers that she hopes to include math in the summer programs next year to expand interventions for students struggling in the subject.
A separate $9.8 million is included in the budget specifically for math and STEAM subjects and introducing a method for teaching the topics that is similar to the structured literacy approach.
LESC Chair Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces), a former math educator, told committee members that the PED’s budget request is a good place to start the conversation for the committee’s budget and possible bills to introduce in the 2026 lLegislative session that begins on Jan. 20, 2026. He also said the LESC might look at boosting funding in its budget proposal for several areas, including math and science. 
“I’ve been around long enough to know that we ought to ask for what we want and not negotiate against ourselves as educators, and make somebody else have to make the cuts rather than think what they’re going cut and do it for them, and then they’re going to cut more anyhow,” Soules said during the meeting. He added that the state is in a good financial position and should be looking at devoting more funds to education rather than allocating so much to the permanent fund for investment. 
“We’re a wealthy state, we are sending billions of dollars a year into the permanent fund,” Soules said. “We need to be taking care of New Mexico, New Mexicans and the investments we make in our kids will have bigger dividends than the 5 or 7% that’s going to be churned out by putting the money into the permanent fund.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/teacher-in-a-classroom-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

In Williston, $1.4 million would be spent on replacing both the floor in the front gymnasium, which currently has troublesome moisture underneath, Giard said, as well as the controls for the school’s light and heating-ventilation systems. Replacement parts for the current control systems are difficult to obtain, according to Giard.
At Champlain Valley Union High School, a roof replacement and heating-ventilation system overhaul would take up the majority of the $4 million in bond funds that would be allocated to the high school. Also in the work plan is a fire alarm system replacement.
Another $4 million in projects are planned at Hinesburg Community School, including roofing, heating-ventilation and electrical work. At Charlotte Community School, $2.9 million would go to installing an elevator that meets Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, new gym bathrooms and new siding.

The district is also planning a conversion to LED lights across all its buildings. That project is estimated at $700,000.
“We have a lot of fluorescent bulbs and fixtures to get rid of,” Giard said.
The bond question, if approved for the Town Meeting Day ballot by a school board majority, would be on the ballot next to the district’s funding request for the upcoming fiscal year. District Chief Operations Officer Gary Marckres said he plans to develop a budget draft by the end of September. A community budget forum is scheduled for Oct. 25 at CVU.
The September draft will be an estimate of the budget if all current staff and services remain in place — and an estimate on the impact to property tax rates — Marckres said. With the Vermont Legislature considering wholesale changes to the way public education is funded under Act 73, “this may be our last chance in the next 4 to 5 years to have a level service budget,” Marckres told the school board’s finance committee Tuesday.
Act 73 has the potential to stifle the flow of funds that support the district, redistributing them in a new statewide formula.
“We won’t have the funding to look like we look and do what we do,” Marckres said. 
The legislation contemplates merging school districts, and lawmakers plan to consider new school district maps during the 2026 legislative session. But leaders at the school district — already the largest in the state — are intent on resisting any merger with neighboring districts.
“It’s the right size right now,” Champlain Valley School District Superintendent Adam Bunting said of the district. “I’m reluctant to talk about any merger.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham will convene lawmakers on Oct. 1 for a special legislative session, her office announced Thursday, to tackle federal cuts to Medicaid and other services, among other issues.
The governor’s office began floating the possibility of a special session even before July 4, when President Donald Trump signed H.R.1, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a federal spending bill that contains significant cuts to the state’s Medicaid and nutrition programs. 
“New Mexicans should not be forced to shoulder these heavy burdens without help from their elected officials,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “After discussions with legislative leaders, we’ve resolved to do everything possible to protect essential services and minimize the damage from President Trump’s disastrous bill.” 
The bill contains multi-billion-dollar cuts, the governor’s office said, that threaten “the survival of New Mexico’s health care system, particularly in rural areas.”
The news release listed several areas that lawmakers plan to address, including:

funding to the Rural Health Care Delivery Fund to “allow stabilization grants for quality health care providers;”
making health insurance premiums more affordable in the marketplace and for those losing Medicaid;
funding for public broadcasting;
new investments in food assistance; and
resources for the Health Care Authority as it prepares for Medicaid enrollment changes

The governor is also discussing with lawmakers whether the session will address “behavioral health challenges that affect our criminal justice system and community safety,” according to the news release. Lujan Grisham expressed dissatisfaction at the end of the regular legislative session earlier this year with lawmakers’ approach to crime and said then that she would consider a special session for that topic alone. 
A news release from state Senate Republicans indicated they were preparing for that possibility with legislation to address New Mexico’s “juvenile crime crisis” and hold “repeat criminals accountable.” The news release also listed legislation that would “protect the state’s ‘most vulnerable children'” and reform medical malpractice law as Senate Republican priorities.
Medicaid, ICE detention on agenda for forthcoming special legislative session

“We appreciate any opportunity to provide real solutions for New Mexicans,” Senate Republican leader Sen. Bill Sharer of Farmington said in a statement. “Just as we did during last year’s failed public safety special session, Republican legislators are prepared to address the pressing issues facing our state.”
Lujan Grisham’s Communication Director Michael Coleman confirmed that legislation to ban Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention would not be on the agenda, a possibility previously mentioned by the governor’s chief counsel that prompted renewed debate on the topic among lawmakers.
According to the news release, the Oct. 1 session will be the seventh special session during the governor’s tenure, which began in January 2019.

(Photo by Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)Two weeks ago, Prospect Medical Holdings said an announcement regarding initial bids for its three Connecticut hospitals — Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General — was imminent.
The company has yet to disclose any details on interested buyers.
Experts say that could be a sign the facilities aren’t attracting strong interest in the court-supervised sale — part of a months-long bankruptcy proceeding the company filed in January.
During a hearing on Aug. 20, a lawyer for Prospect said several times that the company would announce initial bidders for the Connecticut hospitals within days. But, as of Thursday, Prospect still had not named a “stalking horse bidder,” the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid.
Prospect must complete the sale auction for the Connecticut hospitals by Sept. 19 and a final order approving the transaction must be entered by Oct. 3, according to a recently updated agreement with one of its lenders.
The company has already missed several such deadlines.
Roughly a month after Prospect filed for bankruptcy protection, the company set a timeline for the Connecticut sale, including a bid deadline of late May 2025 and a sale hearing, where the court would approve a new owner, for June 5, according to court documents submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Northern District of Texas.
“Most likely, if in the last six to eight months they have not teed up a sale for the Connecticut hospitals, it means they’re probably having difficulty finding a buyer,” Ken Rosen, a bankruptcy attorney with experience in the health care industry, said. He added that it’s possible Prospect has a buyer lined up but that the parties have not yet been able to agree on price or contract terms.
Spokespeople for Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Matthew Beatman, a Bridgeport-based bankruptcy attorney, also said the delays could be concerning and added that the timeline extensions likely reflect a major effort underway to avoid hospital closures.
“The preference would be to see a private party come in, or private parties come in, and have some continuation for one or all of [the hospitals],” Beatman said. “Whether or not that’s feasible and going to happen, no one knows. But it sounds like no one wants to give up yet.”
But in the case of some Prospect-owned hospitals, closures were unavoidable.
Prospect shuttered its two remaining Pennsylvania hospitals earlier this year after failing to find a viable buyer, even after the state provided more than $15 million over seven months to help keep the facilities open.
In Massachusetts, Steward Health Care, another formerly private equity-backed hospital operator that declared bankruptcy in May of last year, closed two hospitals after failing to receive any qualified bids for the facilities.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the administration is preparing for all possible outcomes.
“The state has been actively working for many months now to prepare for any eventuality that may occur with these facilities to ensure continuity of care and preserving these community assets.”
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy in January, Lamont vowed to keep the hospitals open.
But, months later, as part of a broader agreement, the state Office of Health Strategy granted Prospect permission to convert one of its three Connecticut hospitals — Rockville General in Vernon — from a full-service acute care hospital into a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial Hospital, located 20 minutes away. While not technically a closure, the agreement cleared a path for Prospect to permanently shutter all services aside from the emergency and behavioral health departments.
During the same August hearing where a Prospect lawyer said bids for the Connecticut hospitals were imminent, the company also admitted that none of the offers it had received to date were as high as a $435 million offer Yale New Haven Health agreed to pay for the facilities in April 2022.
The attorney also discussed a motion Prospect filed seeking to hold Yale New Haven to the terms of the deal. If the motion is successful, Yale would either have to purchase the hospitals for $435 million, pay a penalty to Prospect or challenge the company in court. The bankruptcy court judge is slated to decide whether to grant that request in a hearing scheduled for Sept. 23.
During the hearing, the judge encouraged Yale and Prospect to enter into mediation talks.
Dana Marnane, a spokesperson for Yale New Haven Health, confirmed that the health system had agreed to mediation talks. But she declined to provide any additional information on what potential outcomes could be, including whether Yale New Haven would consider purchasing the hospitals at a lower price.
“At the request of the court overseeing Prospect’s bankruptcy proceedings, Yale New Haven Health has agreed to meet with Prospect and other parties, including representatives from the State of Connecticut,” Marnane stated in emailed comments.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-04 20:22:34+00:00,CT Mirror,CT and RI to sue Trump administration over Revolution Wind,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/revolution-wind-lawsuit-ct-ri/,"The lawsuit, which seeks to block the shutdown of work on the offshore wind project, was announced the same day as a similar suit by Ørsted.","A pair of lawsuits were announced Thursday seeking to block the Trump administration from halting work on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island.
The lawsuits — one filed by the project’s developers and the other by attorneys general for Rhode Island and Connecticut — came nearly two weeks after federal officials ordered an immediate shutdown of all offshore work on the 704 megawatt project.
At the time, Revolution Wind had already completed 80% of the work, including dozens of turbines mounted onto foundations set into the seafloor.
Gigantic sections of unfinished turbines were already on the ground at the State Pier in New London, where more than 100 workers are employed within the project’s staging area. Another 50 workers were told not show up for a two-week shift installing new turbines at sea, according to union officials.
“This is an utterly unlawful, baseless and frankly senseless and stupid stop-work order,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong told reporters during a press conference at his office in Hartford. 
“That’s why we’re in federal court today, along with our partners in Rhode Island, in federal court to stop Donald Trump and his all-out war on wind and wind power, and frankly, on ratepayers,” Tong continued.
Tong’s office said its lawsuit would be filed in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island with his counterpart in that state, Democratic Attorney General Peter F. Neronha. The other lawsuit was filed Thursday morning in federal court in Washington, D.C., by developers Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables.
Both lawsuits named the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which issued the stop-work order, as defendants. Tong said his lawsuit would also name President Donald J. Trump as a defendant.
“While Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the Administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution, it believes that BOEM lacked legal authority for the stop-work order and that the stop-work order’s stated basis violated applicable law,” Ørsted spokesman Karl-Erik Stromsta said in a statement. “The project is facing substantial harm from continuation of the stop-work order, and as a result, litigation is a necessary step.”
Officials with both the Department of the Interior and the BOEM declined to comment on the ligation Thursday.
White House spokesman Taylor Rogers defended the administration’s actions, saying in a statement that offshore wind projects had been given “unfair, preferential treatment,” under the previous administration of President Joe Biden.
“President Trump’s day one executive order instructed agencies to review leases and permitting practices for wind projects with consideration for our country’s growing demands for reliable energy, effects on energy costs for American families, the importance of marine life and fishing industry, and the impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns,” the statement said. “President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security.”

While the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind was widely condemned by local officials, union leaders and environmental advocates, Gov. Ned Lamont had initially signaled hope last week that a deal could be worked out with the Trump administration to save the project.
Lamont pointed to an example earlier this year when federal officials halted work on another wind project under development in Brooklyn, N.Y., Empire Wind, only to reverse course after New York Gov. Kathy Hochul expressed a willingness to work with the administration to approve new gas pipelines.
Over the last two weeks, however, state officials say attempts to engage with their federal counterparts have gone nowhere. In a statement Thursday, Lamont said the Trump administration has yet to explain or justify its stop-work order.
“There is still a path forward if Washington is willing to be a partner,” Lamont said. 
In its letter to Ørsted last month ordering the company to stop work, the BOEM cited unspecified concerns having to do with “national security interests” and “interference” with the use of various maritime areas as its reason for the decision.
Tong, however, called that explanation “garbage,” adding that any issues had already been resolved by BOEM and the Department of Defense.
“All of those questions were addressed in the permitting process,” Tong said. “That’s what the permitting process is for.” 
The attorney general’s latest suit on Thursday was not the first to challenge the Trump administration’s actions toward offshore wind. In May, Tong joined with more than a dozen other Democratic attorneys general in a lawsuit seeking to block the administration’s decision to stop leasing new offshore areas for wind development.
That lawsuit remains pending. On Thursday afternoon, there was a hearing in the case in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.
Attorneys in that case filed notices late last week to inform the court of the BOEM’s decision to halt work on Revolution Wind. The judge overseeing the case, William G. Young, said the decision to halt a fully-permitted project “creates a host of issues,” but he also said that action was somewhat different than the dispute before him, which deals mostly with the approval of future projects.
The Revolution Wind project was originally approved in 2023 as a partnership between Ørsted, a Danish energy company, and Eversource. The utility later sold its stake in the project to Skyborn Renewables, a division of Global Infrastructure Partners.
The initial $1.5 billion pricetag for the project has also risen substantially amid a wider trend of escalating costs within the offshore wind industry.
In their lawsuit Thursday, attorneys for the developers did not cite an exact figure but said the companies have already spent “billions of dollars” toward completing the project. Stromsta, the Ørsted spokesman, declined to say how much the stop-work order had cost the project.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-107-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) The Utah Supreme Court called off the execution of Ralph Menzies last week nearly 40 years after he murdered Maurine Hunsaker, opening the door for more court hearings and evaluations to determine the extent of the 67-year-old’s dementia.  
Now, the Utah Attorney General’s Office is asking the court to move as quickly as possible, warning of an “endless cycle” of petitions pointing to Menzies’ mental decline. 
In a motion filed Wednesday, the attorney general’s office requested Utah’s 3rd District Court expedite future proceedings related to Menzies, who will soon be evaluated by medical professionals to determine whether he still understands why the state is trying to execute him. 
According to Utah code, medical professionals will have at least 60 days to evaluate Menzies, but the attorney general’s office is asking the court to cut that timeline to 30 days.

“This is a 39-year-old case on a murder that Menzies committed nearly 40 years ago,” the request reads. “This Court should expedite Menzies’ second round of competency proceedings to prevent an endless cycle of successive competency petitions based on changes in Menzies’ condition.” 
The request comes on the heels of a Friday afternoon ruling from the Utah Supreme Court, which found that Menzies’ attorneys had submitted enough evidence to warrant a second competency evaluation. Competency evaluations are done when a death row inmate shows signs of mental decline — per state and federal law, a death row inmate must understand the reason for their punishment and that their crime was particularly heinous before their execution. 
Death row inmate Ralph Menzies wins appeal, Sept. 5 execution called off

Menzies was already examined by several doctors and psychologists last year, and was found competent to be executed in June. Then in July, Menzies’ attorneys filed a request for a second evaluation, arguing that his dementia had worsened since the initial reviews. 
That request was denied, but Menzies’ ultimately won his appeal before the Utah Supreme Court, which issued its opinion just a week before his scheduled firing squad execution. 
The high court’s ruling triggers a new set of proceedings, requiring evaluations from at least two Utah Department of Health and Human Services examiners, as well as any other independent examiners commissioned by either the state or Menzies’ attorneys. 
Once a judge issues an order, those examiners have 60 days to submit their reports — once the court receives the reports, a hearing must take place within 15 days. 
Hypothetically, if the judge rules next week, the reports would be due sometime in early November, with the hearing likely scheduled in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving. 
But the attorney general wants to cut that window in half. According to the court filing, the state is asking for a 30-day timeline, and a hearing set five days after the reports are received. 
“As Menzies’ counsel argued to the supreme court, ‘his condition is always changing’ such that ‘it is difficult to keep up with,’” attorneys for the state write. “That all means time is of the essence.”
In separate filings submitted Thursday, the attorney general’s office requested two psychologists — David Thompson, a forensic psychologist, and Ryan Green, a neuropsychologist — to evaluate Menzies. Both men have previously examined Menzies, and found that he did show some signs of mental decline, but was competent.

Data centers promise tens of millions of dollars  in tax revenue, new jobs and investment in energy infrastructure. A planned Brandon data center alone is expected to bring in over $20 million a year in taxes.
But not everyone is thrilled. 
In my latest story on the Brandon data center, I talked with Brandon residents and Rankin’s economic development association about the development. Residents raised concerns about electricity and water usage, air pollution from electricity demands, potential noise pollution and environmental impacts.

Katherine Lin
In other communities across the nation and globe where data centers are being built, residents are raising similar concerns. They want to know what these projects mean for their health, the environment and their pocketbooks. But artificial intelligence continues to grow. The investment bank UBS projects that AI spending will reach $500 billion in 2026. 
Professor Ahmed Saeed of Georgia Tech says data centers are not going away. He thinks the way forward is to ensure they’re properly regulated and investing in the community.
“ Having clarity on the impact of data centers within the community where they’re building is important,” said Saeed. “The other side of this is also making sure that there is investment into the community.”
We received a lot of emails in response about Brandon’s new data center. We’re reprinting one of the comments we received, with permission from the author:
“I am deeply concerned about the new data center projected for construction in Brandon, Mississippi. I believe this is a terrible idea and should be reconsidered by our state leaders. Mississippi prides itself on outdoor recreation and agriculture, yet this very decision will impact the land and natural resources in such a harmful way. Our water and energy will surely suffer through egregious water and electricity consumption. We need businesses to move into cities who will contribute to the local community and local economy, not filter resources away from people in that community,” wrote Miranda Loper, MLIS.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Hours before a federal judge in Boston was set to hear arguments on the Trump administration’s executive order stopping offshore wind reviews, two separate lawsuits seeking to reverse the recent stop work order on nearly completed Revolution Wind project were announced Thursday.
Revolution Wind, a joint venture between Ørsted and a consortium led by Skyborn Renewables, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. challenging the stop work order issued Aug. 22 by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). The multibillion dollar project was 80% complete and scheduled to begin delivering 704 megawatts of power to 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut starting in mid-2026. 
Meaghan Wims, an Ørsted spokeswoman, said the company will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the Trump administration and other stakeholders but believed the federal government lacked legal authority for the stop work order. All required federal and state permits for the 65-turbine wind farm in Rhode Island Sound were secured in 2023 after a review process that lasted seven years. 
“The project is facing substantial harm from continuation of the stop-work order, and as a result, litigation is a necessary step,” Wims said.
Soon after Ørsted filed its lawsuit, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha informed reporters of his intention to file a lawsuit with his Connecticut counterpart seeking to reverse the Trump administration’s decision. The lawsuit was filed Thursday afternoon in the U.S. District of Rhode Island in Providence. It had not yet had been assigned a case number as of 4 p.m., said AG spokesperson Timothy Rondeau.
“We have begun and built an industry here in Rhode Island that can continue to grow and provide jobs to Rhode Islanders and build our economy,” Attorney General Peter Neronha told reporters at a morning press conference in his Providence office. “We’re on the cusp of building that economy, and the president stopped it unlawfully.”
Neronha said he chose to team up with the Connecticut Attorney General William Tong because of the stoppage’s direct impact on southeastern New England. 
ISO New England, the entity responsible for operating the region’s electric grid, has warned that delaying completion of Revolution Wind could increase risks to reliability.
The joint lawsuit claims the stop work order would also hurt the economies of Rhode Island and Connecticut, saying the project’s construction phase supports more than 2,500 jobs nationwide, including 1,000 union jobs in the two states that would benefit from the wind farm.
“And no one knows what’s going to happen next,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO president Patrwick Crowley said in an interview after Thursday’s press conference.

Both lawsuits call the Aug. 22 decision by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management “arbitrary and capricious” and claim that the administration acted unlawfully in suspending work.
Specifically, the two complaints claim the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedures Act and exceeded its authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, citing a lack of reasoned decision-making and disregard for state interests.
“With zero justification, Trump wants to mothball the project, send workers home, and saddle Connecticut families with millions of dollars in higher energy costs,” Tong said in a statement. “This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal.”
Neronha likened the Trump administration’s decision to a yo-yo bouncing back and forth over policy decisions.
“And if he wants to behave like a yo-yo, that’s up to him,” Neronha told reporters. “But you can’t run government that way — decision-making has to be rational.”
In issuing the work stoppage, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it was “seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests.” But what exactly that means is still something state officials are trying to find out from the Trump administration.
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner sought to get an answer from a Department of Interior official who testified at a hearing on mining-related legislation before the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources Wednesday afternoon.
“The stop work order speaks for itself,” Adam Suess, acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management, replied to Magaziner. “Because the project is under review, and consistent with the president’s Jan. 20 memorandum, I have nothing else to say at this point.”
“With all due respect: Bullshit,” Magaziner responded.


A week after the stop work order on Revolution Wind, on what was the Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend, came a decision from the U.S. Department of Transportation terminating a total of $679 million in funding to support offshore wind-related ports and manufacturing facilities. The projects included $11.25 million for port infrastructure upgrades at Quonset Point in North Kingstown.
That decision led U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse to withdraw his support for the nomination of Sean McMaster to serve as Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning Whitehouse had voted for McMaster in committee on June 11.
“This bad faith decision was a punch in the face to Rhode Island’s premier port, and I cannot support McMaster’s nomination until this funding is restored,” Whitehouse said.
Gov. Dan McKee on Wednesday sent a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, outlining the consequences of the stop work order and asked to meet with President Trump on the matter. But he has yet to receive any update from the Trump administration, spokesperson Andrea Palagi confirmed to Rhode Island Current .
“Words with the Trump administration, as I think has been demonstrated, are simply not enough,” Neronha said Thursday. “Unless you do something, this president’s not going to change behavior.”
Climate Action Rhode Island, a group of advocates who led the state’s Yes to Wind campaign,  praised Neronha for filing the lawsuit. 
“Revolution Wind has passed every state and federal review,” Executive Director Jeff Migneault said in a statement. “For a president to step in now and try to derail it is flat-out un-American.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson also lauded the legal move.
“This project is essential for our economy, the environment, and the affordability of our energy supply,” the pair of legislative leaders said in a joint statement Thursday afternoon.
Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.

,DC,2025-09-04 20:10:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"RFK Jr. battles with members of US Senate panel over vaccines, removal of CDC director",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jr-battles-members-us-senate-panel-over-vaccines-removal-cdc-director,,"WASHINGTON — Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  vehemently defended his actions on vaccines and other public health issues under questioning by both Republican and Democratic senators during a contentious hearing Thursday.Kennedy, confirmed on a mostly party-line vote earlier this year, repeatedly justified firing everyone on an influential vaccine advisory panel, as well as the president’s decision to remove a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director who’d served for less than a month after confirmation by the Senate.“In your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned,” said Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “The public has seen measles outbreaks. Leadership of the National Institutes of Health questioning the use of mRNA vaccines. The recently confirmed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fired. Americans don't know who to rely on.”Video courtesy of C-SPAN.Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon, sought to reinforce support for vaccines to Kennedy during the Senate Finance Committee hearing, saying they “are estimated to have saved 154 million lives worldwide.”Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who received several concessions from Kennedy in exchange for voting to confirm him as HHS secretary, raised numerous questions about Kennedy’s behavior. Cassidy is the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.Cassidy appeared to box in Kennedy on the COVID-19 vaccine by saying President Donald Trump should receive the Nobel Prize for Operation Warp Speed, which led to the development of the shot during his first term. Kennedy agreed Trump should ""absolutely"" get the prize, leading Cassidy to question why he’d taken actions as HHS secretary to erode trust and eliminate funding for vaccine development activities. “It surprises me that you think so highly of Operation Warp Speed when, as an attorney, you attempted to restrict access,” Cassidy said. “It also surprises me because you've canceled, or HHS did, but apparently under your direction, $500 million in contracts using the mRNA vaccine platform that was critical to Operation Warp Speed.”Cassidy said the cancellation represents not only “an incredible waste of money but it also seems like a commentary upon what the president did in Operation Warp Speed, which is to create a platform by which to create vaccines.”Cassidy also questioned Kennedy’s actions eliminating everyone on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replacing them with his own choices. “If we put people who are paid witnesses for people suing vaccines, that actually seems like a conflict of interest,” Cassidy said. Kennedy disagreed, testifying that “it may be a bias. And that bias, if disclosed, is okay.”Tillis asks RFK Jr. to respond in writingNorth Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis asked Kennedy a series of questions but said he wanted the secretary to submit his answers in writing in order to clarify several of his positions. “Some of your statements seem to contradict what you said in the prior hearing,” Tillis said. “You said you're going to empower the scientists at HHS to do their job. I'd just like to see evidence where you've done that, and I'm sure that you will have some.”Tillis said he wanted Kennedy to respond to reports that he’s gone back on his commitments to senators to not do anything “that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines” and that Kennedy would not “impose my belief over any of yours.”“That, again, seems to be contradictory to the firing of the CDC director, the canceling of mRNA research contracts, firing advisory board members, attempting to stall NIH funding, eliminating funding for I think a half a billion dollars for further mRNA research,” he said, referring to the National Institutes of Health. Tillis said he was having difficulty understanding why former CDC Director Susan Monarez, whom Trump nominated in March and the Senate voted to confirm in late July, had been fired so quickly. “I don't see how you go … from a public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials, a long-time champion of MAHA values, caring and compassionate and brilliant microbiologist — and four weeks later, fire her,” Tillis said. CDC shooting, Monarez firing probedGeorgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock questioned Kennedy at length over the firing of Monarez as well as a shooting at the Atlanta-based agency this summer. Kennedy testified that he doesn’t believe he criticized Monarez during a meeting in late August over her comments following the CDC shooting that “misinformation can be dangerous.”During that meeting, Kennedy said he did demand that Monarez fire career CDC scientists but testified he didn’t tell her to accept the recommendations of the vaccine advisory panel without further review.""What I asked her about is, she had made a statement that she was going to not sign on and I wanted clarification about that,"" Kennedy said. “I told her I didn’t want her to have a role if she’s not going to sign onto it.”Monarez wrote in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal just hours before the hearing began that during the meeting with Kennedy she “was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.”“That panel’s next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 18-19,” Monarez wrote. “It is imperative that the panel’s recommendations aren’t rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.”Warnock asked Kennedy if he said that the CDC was the “most corrupt federal agency in the history of the world.” Kennedy testified he didn’t say that exactly but did say “it’s the most corrupt agency at HHS and maybe the government.” Warnock concluded his five minutes of questions telling Kennedy that “it’s clear you’re carrying out your extremist beliefs” and that he represents “a threat to the public health of the American people.”“For the first time, we're seeing deaths from children from measles,” Warnock said. “We haven't seen that in two decades. We're seeing that under your watch. You are a hazard to the health of the American people.”Lankford, Daines ask about medication abortionSeveral senators, including Oklahoma Republican James Lankford and Montana Republican Steve Daines, asked Kennedy about the ongoing review of mifepristone, one of two prescription pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion. Kennedy said he spoke with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary about the topic just yesterday and committed to keeping senators informed, but didn’t appear to know much more than that. “I don't know if they're going to do an insurance claim study. That's one way to do it. I don't know exactly whether they're doing epidemiological studies or observational studies. I don't know exactly what they're doing,” Kennedy said. “But I know I talked to Marty Makary about it yesterday, and he said those studies are progressing and that they're ongoing. So I will keep your office informed at every stage.”Kennedy testified that he didn’t know when exactly the studies would be completed. The FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000 before updating the prescribing guidelines in 2016 and during the coronavirus pandemic. It’s currently approved for up to 10 weeks gestation and can be prescribed via telehealth and shipped to patients. Mifepristone is the first pharmaceutical of medication abortion and is typically followed by misoprostol. Medication abortion accounted for about 64% of all abortions in 2023, according to research from the Guttmacher Institute. The Supreme Court rejected an effort to limit access to medication abortion last year in a case originally filed by four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion doctors that were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom.Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion that “federal conscience laws have protected pro-life doctors ever since FDA approved mifepristone in 2000.”Numerous medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, wrote briefs to the Supreme Court in that case attesting to the safety and efficacy of mifepristone. “The scientific evidence is overwhelming: major adverse events occur in less than 0.32% of patients,” the medical organizations wrote. “The risk of death is almost non-existent.”",,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

(Photo collage by Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for an outside attorney hired by the state prison oversight board to continue representing it in its lawsuit over who controls the Department of Corrections’ highest-ranking officials.
The high court affirmed its previous decision to dismiss a motion by Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office to disqualify the attorney hired by the Arkansas Board of Corrections in 2023 and rejected his petition to reconsider the June decision.
Griffin’s motion to disqualify the board’s outside counsel was part of a broader appeal to dismiss the corrections board’s lawsuit. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice Karen Baker in June, a court majority rejected the attorney general’s request to overturn a lower court’s preliminary injunction and dismiss the lawsuit and ordered the trial court to proceed with the case. In that opinion, the justices said the motion to disqualify Abtin Mehdizadegan and the Hall Booth Smith law firm was outside the scope of their review.
Arkansas Corrections Board lawsuit against governor stays alive with Supreme Court ruling 

A denial of a motion to disqualify one’s legal counsel, Baker wrote at the time, was “not an appealable final order.”
Griffin’s office subsequently asked the court to reconsider, arguing that the decision “risks undermining the Court’s inherent power to regulate the practice of law before it.” Griffin said that rather than asking the court to review a lower court’s decision to deny the disqualification motion, he had asked the justices to disqualify the attorney from representing the board before the Supreme Court itself.
“A disqualification motion before an appellate court addresses a distinct issue from a disqualification motion before the trial court,” Griffin’s petition for a rehearing said. “The Court therefore has inherent authority to rule on Appellants’ motion to disqualify the Board’s illegally retained appellate counsel and determine whether they were properly before this Court.”
The Supreme Court did not give a reason in Thursday’s one-page per curiam order for not rehearing the matter, nor were there any noted dissents. The court’s affirmation of the circuit court’s decision noted Justice Shawn Womack dissented, and Justice Barbara Webb concurred and dissented in part. Justices Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni did not participate.
The move from the Supreme Court is the latest entry in the almost two-year legal battle between the Board of Corrections and Griffin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders over who ultimately controls the Department of Corrections’ (DOC) highest-ranking officials.
The fight began with growing tensions between the board and former Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri in November 2023 over Sanders’ demand that more beds be opened in the state’s prison system. The state continues to face a shortage of prison beds and staffing for those beds, which the board cited in its reasoning not to approve more beds requested by Profiri and Sanders.

Weeks later, those tensions exploded into a court fight between the board and Sanders over who ultimately has control over top-ranking corrections officials — and the extent of the board’s constitutional authority — when the board suspended Profiri after he moved to open additional beds in defiance of the board.
Profiri said after his initial suspension, however, that he would still go to work — prompting the lawsuit by the board. The board subsequently fired him, after which Sanders hired Profiri as a special adviser on corrections matters.
The dispute stems from Acts 185 and 659 of 2023, which provided that the corrections department secretary serve at the pleasure of the governor instead of the board, while the heads of its two divisions report to the secretary — effectively removing them from board oversight, the board alleged. The board filed suit over the pair of state laws on Dec. 14, 2023, claiming they infringed on the authority granted to it under Amendment 33 of the state constitution and asking that the laws be struck down as unconstitutional.

Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Patricia James initially sided with the board and issued a preliminary injunction in January 2024, keeping authority over the corrections officials with the board while the lawsuit played out, which cleared the way for Profiri’s firing.
Griffin appealed, asking the Supreme Court to vacate the injunction and dismiss the case as moot in light of Profiri’s firing, as well as find that the board’s outside counsel was hired illegally.
Griffin argued that the attorney was hired illegally by the board, but James ruled that the board was considered a constitutional officer under the state constitution, therefore allowing them to hire outside counsel.
With the affirmation of the June ruling, the case awaits a final ruling from the circuit court.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-04 20:05:32+00:00,CT Mirror,Democrat lawmakers ask CT judicial branch to ban ICE arrests at courthouses,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/ct-ice-arrests-courthouse/,Senate Democrats asked CT Chief Justice Raheem Mullins to ban ICE from arresting people anywhere where judicial proceedings are taking place.,"A group of state lawmakers is calling on Connecticut’s Chief Justice to issue an order banning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people in the state’s courthouses. 
A group of 21 Democratic Senators, including Sen. Martin Looney, D-New Haven, the Senate Majority Leader, and Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, the Deputy Majority Leader, sent a letter on Wednesday to Chief Justice Raheem Mullins asking for tighter protections
Specifically, they asked that Mullins issue an order similar to one the United States District Courts in Connecticut issued in early August banning federal immigration officers from arresting people anywhere in courthouses where judicial proceedings are taking place. 
The Senators said their request came in light of an arrest in Stamford on August 11, where three ICE agents entered the courthouse without a warrant and arrested two men hiding in the bathroom, according to the letter. They referenced similar arrests in Danbury. 
“Prior to recent incidents at the courthouses in Stamford and Danbury, ICE agents only apprehended individuals outside courthouses, a practice common since the Oval Office changed hands in January of 2025. Now, Connecticut residents cannot access the justice system without fear of potential apprehension by ICE,” the senators wrote.
They called the courthouse a “safe haven” for victims, particularly people who have been in car accidents, are in need of protective orders or who are going through a divorce. Looney told the Connecticut Mirror that people who come to courthouses could be witnesses of crime, domestic violence victims or involved in a civil case. 
Constanza Segovia, lead organizer for Hartford Deportation Defense, said her organization had been pressing for restrictions on federal immigration enforcement in courtrooms since 2016. 
“In our community, in our membership, we constantly hear from people who are concerned about appearing in court for basic court appearances that just feel risky and should have nothing to do with immigration status,” she told CT Mirror. 
She said that while the organization generally encourages people to comply with court orders in order to avoid a higher level offense that could impact their immigration status, the recent federal activity has left her uncertain whether to continue offering that advice without protection from the state. 
Data from the Deportation Data Project shows that arrests in Connecticut by federal immigration enforcement in the first half of 2025 are more than double what they were in the first half of 2024. Deportations have tripled. 
On Aug. 20, ICE’s Boston Office announced the completion of what they called “Operation Broken Trust,” a four-day operation in which they arrested 65 immigrants in Connecticut. At the time, the group Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants said in a statement that federal agents had been seen at the Danbury courthouse on a regular basis during ICE’s operation. 
Videos posted on social media showed confrontations between advocacy groups and ICE agents in the parking lot of Danbury Superior Court, as officials arrested a man and a woman. The videos show a group of officers dressed in tactical gear, some of whom wore masks. 
Advocates had asked that a prohibition on arrests in state courthouses be included in a bill updating the state’s Trust Act — the law that regulates how local and state law enforcement interacts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The provision did not make it into the bill. 
Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, one of the top Republicans on the legislature’s Public Safety Committee, criticized the senators’ letter in a statement, saying that such a policy would prevent federal officials from arresting unauthorized immigrants who have broken the law, putting the public at risk. 
“Too often the Trust Act prevents local law enforcement from coordinating with ICE to arrange safe, controlled transfers. Instead of allowing orderly arrests in secure environments, this policy forces dangerous, transient individuals to be released on the hope they’ll return to court and avoid further crimes. Law enforcement wants to protect our communities through proper procedures, but current state policies tie their hands and put public safety at risk,” Howard said. 
State Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Stamford, one of the chairs of the state legislature’s Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror that he agreed with the concerns that the Senate Democrats raised in their letter.
“There seems to be a real escalation of the hostility with which ICE is entering our courthouses, and I think we need to take a very serious look at how we can respond to that and make sure that everyone who enters our courthouses feel safe and is able to participate peacefully in the justice system,” he said. 
Stafstrom said he and his co-chair on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, plan to meet with Mullins next week.
Karen Hunter, an organizer with Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants, one of 90 organizations that sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and state lawmakers asking for protections for immigrants to be a focus during the legislative session, said that on Wednesday she’d watched the father of two small children as he was detained near the Danbury Superior Courthouse.
“If people fear deportation when going to court, they effectively lose access to the entire justice system — whether they’re victims reporting crimes, witnesses, or family members,” said Hunter.
Hunter’s group asked that, in addition to focusing on ICE presence at courthouses, lawmakers limit the amount of personal data shared between state agencies and the federal government and continue to offer state health insurance to unauthorized migrant children and pregnant women.
The senators Thursday also requested that the Judicial Branch install additional measures, including limiting information posted online about court dates, allowing for electronic court appearances, requiring federal agents to provide courthouse security officers with names and badge numbers, and barring face coverings inside courthouses.
Chief Justice Mullins said in a statement that he is “committed to making sure our courthouses are safe spaces of fairness and protection for all who use them,” and that the Judicial Branch “will employ all legally supported methods to do so.”
Other states have proposed bans on courthouse arrests. Massachusetts in 2019 placed a ban on arrests by federal immigration enforcement agents in courthouses. The ban was later overturned by an appeals court. And the Trump Administration this June filed a lawsuit against the state of New York challenging a 2020 law blocking federal immigration authorities from arresting people in state courthouses without a warrant. 
In July, a group of organizations advocating for immigrants filed a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Justice in protest of several changes in federal immigration policy, including civil arrests in courthouses. 
Looney said he didn’t know the likelihood of a ban on courthouse arrests in Connecticut being challenged, but he said he believed the state should have a plan and that it should look to the examples of other states. He said that while the state can’t “interfere” with federal immigration enforcement, there were still protocols that could be enforced. 
He said the three branches of government needed to work together to address the problem, and that he would be open to discussing legislation at a special session.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B22A9544-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

The North Carolina State Board of Education on Thursday ordered a full financial review of Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools and set a 0.4% monthly interest rate on the district’s $3.4 million debt to the state.
The move followed weeks of scrutiny after a state audit revealed widespread financial mismanagement. The district has been navigating a $46 million budget deficit, triggering mass layoffs and drawing criticism from the community and some state board members.
The state board will hire an outside firm to review the district’s overall financial management.
Audit reveals deeper issues
A state audit report released last month found that the district used temporary federal COVID-19 funds to cover permanent salaries, approved purchase orders without money in the budget, and delayed routine account reconciliations. Auditors also flagged misuse of “suspense accounts,” temporary accounts where money is held until it can be properly assigned. At one point, they held more than $332 million, and the funds weren’t tracked clearly.
The audit found no fraud but detailed years of financial mismanagement and weak oversight.
“The situation was a perfect financial storm,” Dionne Tunstall Jenkins, the general counsel at Winston-Salem Forsyth County Schools, told state board officials during an appeal hearing on Tuesday on the debt owed to the state.
While the appeal committee recommended extending the grace period for interest on the district’s $3.4 million debt to the N.C. Department of Public Instruction until Nov. 20, 2025, the full board on Thursday rejected the committee’s recommendation to waive interest entirely and instead approved a 0.4% monthly rate, proposed by State Treasurer Brad Briner. “There’s no such thing as free money,” Briner said. The motion passed 5-4.
Still, without the reprieve, the debt would have accrued a 1% monthly penalty, costing the district more than $900,000 over a year. The debt is part of a larger $11.3 million overdraft of state funds that the district racked up during the 2024-25 school year. The district has already repaid roughly $8 million.
Sharp criticism from state leaders
During Thursday’s meeting, board member Olivia Holmes Oxendine sharply criticized Forsyth’s leadership.
“I was appalled in reading the eight findings clearly worded,” Oxendine said. “They need to rethink if they really are in the seat they need to be in.”
“The report needs to be a case study of how not to govern the resources provided by this great state,” she said. “I do not sense that the board gave consideration to protecting the resources of the taxpayers of Forsyth County.”
She said the district’s leadership must rebuild its reputation from the ground up. She also said the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County School Board Members should, “Donate their monthly stipend to help pay off this bill at a minimum.”
Interim Superintendent Catty Moore, who took over in June, has overseen two rounds of staff reductions totaling more than 470 positions, including assistant principals, support staff and employees in the Exceptional Children’s program, she said during the appeal hearing on Tuesday. The cuts, aimed at saving more than $60 million, have drawn protests from teachers, students and parents who warned that the reductions would dismantle essential services. Moore, a state board member, recused herself from Thursday’s vote.
Looking ahead, Moore has promised more transparency, sending monthly budget reports to the district’s board members and working with consultants to align staffing with enrollment, she said during the appeal hearing Tuesday.
While acknowledging what he called “difficult decisions,” State Board Chair Eric Davis said the actions taken Thursday were necessary to help the district recover from its budget crisis. “Our goal is to return the district to a healthy financial position,” Davis said. “That is our objective.”

The Democratic governors of California, Oregon and Washington said Wednesday they are forming an alliance to coordinate vaccine recommendations for their states.
Meanwhile, Florida announced plans to become the first state to phase out all vaccine mandates, including ending requirements that kids be vaccinated against dangerous diseases before enrolling in schools.
Public health experts have relied on vaccines, including school mandates, for decades to limit the spread of communicable diseases and keep kids and adults safe.

The contrasting moves come amid turmoil at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where several top leaders resigned last week to protest efforts by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
Accompanied by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo said at a news conference Wednesday that vaccine mandates are “wrong” and “immoral,” the Florida Phoenix reported.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” Ladapo said.
“They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”

The Florida Department of Health can eliminate some vaccine mandates on its own, Ladapo said, but the Florida legislature would have to scrap other ones. He did not mention specific vaccines, but repeated that his goal was to end “all of them. Every last one of them.”
“Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” Ladapo said.
The goal of the new West Coast Health Alliance, governors said, is to disseminate evidence-based recommendations about who should get immunized, as well as to provide vaccine education throughout the three states. In the coming weeks, the states will coordinate and finalize immunization guidelines that are in line with leading medical organizations.
In their announcements, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson criticized recent Trump administration actions, including the firing of scientists and the upheaval at the CDC.
“When federal agencies abandon evidence-based recommendations in favor of ideology, we cannot continue down that same path,” Washington Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham said in a statement.
Worsham added that “public health at its core is about prevention — preventing illness, preventing the spread of disease, and preventing early, avoidable deaths.”
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states rely on the committee to form vaccination guidelines.
And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for children and pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19 — sidestepping the usual process for issuing official recommendations.

The three Western states said the “dismantling” of the CDC has created “a vacuum of clear, evidence-based vaccine guidance,” hampering health care providers, disrupting manufacturers’ production plans and creating uncertainty for families.
In 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the three states, along with Nevada, created a similar workgroup that emphasized the scientific rigor behind the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in an effort to boost confidence in the shot.
“President Donald Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people,” the joint statement from the three governors’ offices said.
“The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences. California, Oregon, and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk.”

When lightning strikes are abundant, so are wildfires – some in remote places across the state. Scientists warn there may be more in the future. 


As dozens of wildfires burn across California after a remarkable outbreak of dry lightning, a new study warns that a warming planet could bring more lightning-sparked wildfires to the West in the coming decades. 
“These are the sort of events that can really allow the fire season to turn on a dime,” said John Abatzoglou, a professor of climatology at UC Merced and an author of the study.
From early Tuesday into Wednesday morning, a lightning storm hurled thousands of bolts at the state, Cal Fire battalion chief David Acuña told CalMatters Wednesday. Forty-five new fires ignited within Cal Fire’s jurisdiction in that same time period, he said. Dry lightning strikes with little, if any, rainfall nearby. 
“We can’t collectively say they’re all lightning fires, but we can say that there were a large number of lightning strikes and a large number of fires,” Acuña said. 
Many of them are burning in the Sierra foothills, including the TCU September Lightning Complex in Tuolumne, Stanislaus and Calaveras Counties. Those fires have already torched nearly 14,000 acres, forced evacuations, destroyed buildings and devastated the historic Gold Rush town of Chinese Camp. 
Exactly how many lightning strikes hit the ground Tuesday and Wednesday is hard to count. But Chris Vagasky, lightning data specialist with the national lightning safety council, calculates nearly 11,000 bolts of electricity struck the ground in California over 31 hours. Federal maps show dry lightning up and down the center of California, from below Fresno to the Oregon border. 
Though people spark the vast majority of wildfires, lightning strikes have caused some of California’s biggest and longest-lasting blazes — accounting for more than a third of the area burned in California in recent decades, according to Abatzoglou’s analysis of federal data. 
Lightning started some of the biggest wildfires in California history, including 2020’s August Complex, which killed a firefighter and became the first fire on record to burn more than a million acres of the state. 
These rogue, lightning-sparked fires are the “dominant driver” behind how much of the West burns, Abatzoglou said — which is why scientists seek to understand their patterns. 
His team’s study, published last week in the journal Earth’s Future, reports that from 2030 to 2060, some western states could see up to 12 more days of lightning striking the ground per year.
Using machine learning, the researchers found that eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho and western Montana will see some of the largest increases. But parts of northeast California and the eastern Sierra could see an increase as well. 
Parts of the southwest saw more mixed results. But even there, as climate change drives hotter, drier conditions, the researchers found that lightning is increasingly likely to strike when parched lands are more vulnerable to fire. 
“You get this very hazardous situation in terms of fire risk, where you have lighting that hits the dry vegetation,” postdoctoral scientist Dmitri Kalashnikov, the study’s lead author, said. “You’ll get an ignition, but then there’s no downpours to extinguish the flame — so that fire can grow.”
UC Merced’s new study bolsters earlier predictions that climate change could spur more lightning strikes. 
But Vagasky, who did not participate in the research, says it improves on previous efforts by focusing on the risk for lightning-sparked fire across places with different geographies, weather patterns and vegetation. 
“It’s not always the amount of lightning,” Vagasky said. “It’s the one lightning stroke that hits in the wrong place, at the wrong time, that starts the fire.” 
‘We have to be ready’
Under the right conditions and in the right places, lightning fires can act like prescribed burns and clear away fuels, said Zeke Lunder, a pyrogeographer and director at The Lookout, a wildfire education blog and YouTube channel. 
The challenge is when a bout of dry lightning sparks dozens of fires, all at once. 
“We’re really good at putting out fires,” Lunder said. “But when we have a hundred, a few of them are going to get away.” 
Five years ago, Cal Fire’s Acuña was mopping up the lightning-sparked Hills Fire near Coalinga when another lightning storm descended. 
“Lightning was striking all around us, and we were just so exhausted that we were like, ‘Well, there’s nowhere to hide,’” he said. “There’s no cave. You can’t stand under a tree. We just got as flat as we could, and waited for it to pass over.” 
He remembers it felt like hours, lying there waiting for the storm to pass. “There was a charge in every one of my cells from, you know, being concerned,” he said.  
Such fires are also insidious, capable of smoldering in remote areas until hot, dry, windy conditions coax them into an inferno. 
“They’re difficult to discover,” Acuña said. “They could be sitting inside the root of a struck oak tree for a week, week-and-a-half — and then all of a sudden, there’s a fire.” 
The state is taking steps to better detect fires, Acuña added — even unpredictable and sneaky ones sparked by lightning. In 2023, Cal Fire partnered with UC San Diego’s ALERTCalifornia, which uses a network of more than 1,100 cameras and artificial intelligence to alert firefighters about potential fires.
“We have to be ready, because there was little to no notice that this lightning was coming in,” Acuña said. “If it happened once, it can happen again. And so we maintain readiness to respond anywhere within the state to protect people, property and resources.”
UC Merced’s Kalashnikov says he has not yet seen a climate-fueled increase in lightning — but that it’s not a distant threat. 
“We are making these predictions for the near-term future,” Kalashnikov said. “These changes in terms of increased lightning are going to happen soon.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090325-Lightning-Strike-TC-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 15:57:30.506471

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Northern Iowa is leading a study into materials that could be applied to quantum technologies as part of a more than $1 million grant with partner universities.
UNI announced in a news release the university will receive $340,000 of the overall grant, other portions of which were awarded to South Dakota State University and the University of Virginia, to study advanced materials with different magnetic qualities. The grant comes from the National Science Foundation, or NSF.
Pavel Lukashev, a physicist and professor at UNI, will serve as principal investigator for the project, with UNI Physics Department Head Paul Shand working as his co-principal investigator.

“NSF research grants are extremely competitive, especially for institutions that are not major research centers,” Lukashev said in the release. “Our work combines experimental and theoretical approaches to advance quantum science with a focus on novel magnetic compounds, while also giving UNI students hands-on experience at the forefront of research.”
The research will focus on “topological magnetic materials,” according to the release, specifically Heusler alloys, which were described as “metal mixtures that are relatively easy to make and adjust for different magnetic properties.”
These materials, as well as other components that have uncommon magnetic patterns, will be analyzed by researchers to see if they could potentially become base components of future technologies — like quantum computing or advanced data storage.
Students will also have the chance to participate in research for the project, the release stated, as well as the publication and presentation of the work.
“The materials we study offer an exciting platform for discovering new topologically protected phases,” Shand said in the release. “This award highlights UNI’s strength in physics and our ability to contribute meaningfully to national research priorities.”

The order, signed by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment director Jill Hunsaker Ryan, criticizes the “confusion and uncertainty” caused by the Food and Drug Administration’s Aug. 27 move to restrict access to the latest COVID-19 vaccines to those aged 65 or older or at higher risk of severe disease. The CDPHE order directs multiple state agencies to take steps to maintain broad access to vaccination, including by requiring insurers to cover the vaccines and instructing pharmacists to provide them without a doctor’s prescription.
“I’m taking action to ensure that Coloradans who want to can easily and conveniently get the safe and effective updated COVID vaccine, along with the flu vaccine, this fall without having to go to a doctor first,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “Starting this Friday, the COVID-19 vaccine should be available to those who choose at many local pharmacies.”

More than 4,500 Coloradans have been hospitalized due to COVID-19 over the last 11 months, CDPHE officials said.
Pursuant to the CDPHE directive, Colorado’s chief medical officer, Dr. Ned Calonge, issued a standing order that will “serve as a prescription for eligible Coloradans to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.” Those eligible include anyone between the ages of 5 and 64 who “desire their protection from COVID-19” and young children “whose parent or guardian desires their protection from COVID-19,” even if they do not belong to a high-risk group.
That significantly expands the eligibility limits set by the FDA’s Aug. 27 approval of four new vaccine formulations, which were directed by top Trump administration officials over the objections of agency scientists, The New York Times reported. The move comes amid a broad assault on the federal public health establishment led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spent decades spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and other health issues.
Amid the unprecedented upheaval at federal health agencies — including the recent resignations of four senior officials at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the firing of the agency’s director — the states of California, Oregon and Washington announced this week that they will form a “health alliance” to make recommendations on vaccines. A group of northeastern states are considering a similar move.
Polis has faced criticism for his own history of opposition to vaccine mandates, and for voicing his support last year for Kennedy’s appointment to lead HHS. But he called the administration’s new vaccine limits “ridiculous.”
“These effective vaccines are available at many local pharmacies and supermarkets, and I encourage my fellow Coloradans to join me in getting protected,” Polis said. “Colorado is committed to empowering individuals to make choices to protect their own health and safety.”
The State Board of Pharmacy will convene an emergency meeting Friday to consider draft rules formalizing the requirements in CDPHE’s order.

The science conducted at Wax Lake informed coastal restoration projects such as the now canceled Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)One of the key scientists involved in a now-defunct plan to rebuild coastal wetlands in southeast Louisiana has a new approach for how to take on the task. 
Ehab Meselhe, a coastal restoration scientist and professor at Tulane University, is researching a new way to operate the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion he says could be a compromise to move the project forward. But whether officials who control coastal restoration are willing to accept his idea is more uncertain than the science behind it.
The concept uses the bones of the previous large-scale sediment diversion, mimicking the natural processes that originally created the delta region at the mouth of the Mississippi River. The power of the river’s current slowly feeds layers of sediment to build new marshland along Louisiana’s coast.
But instead of keeping the flow of water constant, Meselhe is exploring a way to periodically turn off the faucet.
 His research has yet to be published, meaning it hasn’t undergone academic scrutiny. But it does draw from previous bodies of knowledge.  
“We started to think about exploring the concept of pulsing,” Meselhe said, along with piling dredged sand by the mouth of the floodgate that controls flow from the Mississippi River. When opened, the sediment and sand would be carried into Barataria Bay, helping build land in coastal Jefferson, Lafourche and Plaquemines parishes.
His idea would likely involve less of the river’s flow from the original plans, which Meselhe said would result in less land being built but far less dilution in the salinity of the bay’s water. The chief complaint among opponents of the diversion is its potential impact on the estuary, its sealife and the livelihoods it supports. Oyster farmers, in particular, have said their beds in the area would perish.  
Meselhe’s idea combines the pulsing concept with the idea to transport dredge material into the outflow area, which draws off previous scientific experiments to create sand or mud “engines.” 
A plusing diversion has been studied before, said Sam Bentley, professor and chair of LSU’s geology and geophysics department, as well as co-director of the coastal restoration research group MissDelta Consortium. 
The Netherlands and river systems in southeast Asia have used the sand engine concept successfully, Bentley said, but Meselhe’s plan would combine elements in a brand new fashion in North America. 
“The idea of engineering shorelines so that sediment is redistributed naturally by existing currents is something that’s been around for several decades,” Bentley said, “But Ehab’s design concept is unique, it’s exciting … and I think has great potential.”
The state official in charge of coastal restoration says “it ain’t gonna work.”
“Hats off to everyone who has an idea,” said Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority.  While explaining that he doesn’t mean to be “patronizing,” he said he doesn’t believe in further experimentation over traditional restoration land-building methods such as “dredging, dredging, dredging” or a smaller-scale diversion higher up in the basin. 
“My job is to protect the coast, and we don’t have much time. That’s why I believe in trying what’s worked in the past,” Dove said. 
Meselhe, Bentley and other scientists say dredging alone won’t be the solution Louisiana’s coast needs. 
“I think that we are at an inflection point in time right now where we have to find new solutions. We can’t rely on conventional engineering, you know, old old school solutions,” Bentley said, adding that dredging could be done in conjunction with other methods.
Scientists also see problems with relying only on a small-scale diversion for the Barataria Basin, saying it will still pour considerable freshwater into the bay. Meselhe’s computer models of different diversion projects in the region show that — even with much less water moving than the 75,000 cubic feet per second that Mid-Barataria called for — they still push salt water further away from the shore. 
“Whether it’s Mid-Breton or Mid-Barataria, or even some of the work that we have done on Caernarvon and Davis Pond, salinity has always been a challenge,” Meselhe said. 
“Unfortunately, changing the salinities within the basin doesn’t require that much fresh water input. It can really change pretty easily,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation.
James Karst, communications director for the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, said he thinks an idea like Meselhe’s could bode well for a compromise. 
“Clearly, Mid-Barataria is no longer, and yet the crisis still exists,” Karst said. “We need to do something, and we need to do something urgently. It has to be something big.”
Some critics of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion are open to Meselhe’s alternative. 
Mitch Jurisich, chairman of Louisiana’s Oyster Task Force, said if the research proves to be fruitful, he thinks the oyster industry will rally around a compromise. 
“We want to see land building,” he said. “Fresh water diversions can be used very beneficially to not only enhance the environment but to help the fisheries, if controlled.”
But even if enough people agree Meselhe’s idea has merit, there could be problems with moving it from theory into reality. 
“How feasible is it really to do that?” Renfro said. “What’s going to be the cost of the dredging and augmenting, like putting sediment into the diversion channel? Is that going to be a cost that increases over time?” 
Cost and promptness are critical, experts said. Meselhe’s previous research shows that, as more time passes, it will be harder to rebuild land within the Barataria Basin. 
“I am hoping that, because we are building on a concept that has been thoroughly reviewed, we can cut down on the time,” Meselhe said. “But I don’t know, does that mean months, or does it mean years? I don’t know, but I’m hoping that it’s not 10 years.”
“It’s totally within the realm of feasibility,” Bentley said. “You just have to get the right people at the table to do it, including state and federal government.”
“Not doing any restoration in the area is not an option,” Renfro said. “It comes down to funding, and it comes down to political will to actually restore the coast in a way that addresses the scale of land loss that we have.”
Jurisich believes that with more community engagement, compromise is possible for river diversions, even with tensions still high after fighting for so long over the original Mid-Barataria plans. 
“It doesn’t have to be one side or the other,” he said. “I think they should be engaging with communities, talking with the fishermen, especially generational fishermen” more than what officials did for the original diversion proposal. 
Meselhe said that while his research is still in its infancy, the early results are promising.
“There is nothing that you can implement in the landscape that has zero impacts, zero negative impact. That doesn’t exist. So we have to come to grips with that,” Meselhe said. “But if the negative impacts are a lot smaller, perhaps it can be palatable to the local communities and to the fishing community and to the parish residents.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 15:57:30.506471

(Photo by Greg Childress/NC Newsline)At a press conference in Raleigh on Thursday, Luis Alonso Juárez, a popular Duke University bus driver at risk of losing his protected immigration status, told supporters and lawmakers that he’s concerned about his safety if he’s forced to return to his native Honduras.
Juárez and as many 50 supporters, many of them Duke students, rode a chartered bus to Raleigh, first stopping by U.S. Sen. Ted Budd’s (R-NC) office on Fayetteville Street to deliver a letter requesting support before marching to the legislature to drop off letters at the offices of House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger, both Republicans. Neither were available to meet with Juárez.
“Sometimes, you’re like scared over there [Honduras],” Juárez said during a press conference at the Legislative Building, explaining that he’s heard stories about dangerous criminal organizations from others who have traveled to the country.

Juárez was granted Temporary Protected Status in 1998, according to Siembra NC, an immigrant advocacy group. That status will expire Sept. 8 because of a Trump administration order terminating TPS protection for Honduras.
Because Juárez entered the U.S. without inspection or authorization and is not married to a U.S. citizen, under current immigration law he does not qualify for another form of protection like a work visa or green card. Without protected status, Juárez and as many as 51,000 other Hondurans across the U.S. will be eligible for removal.
Immigration attorneys have advised Juárez that his only short-term path to retain a work permit would be for the Trump administration to grant an extension of protection from removal, much like it did in his first term. In 2021, President Donald Trump issued a Deferred Enforced Departure designation for Venezuelans present in the U.S. on or before Jan. 20, 2021, which granted them 18 months of deferred removal and employment authorization. He has twice extended such protections for Liberians.
Juárez and others losing their protected status are also concerned about losing their jobs on Monday when the Trump administration order takes hold.
“I’m asking Sen. Ted Budd, Sen. Phil Berger and Rep. Destin Hall to call the president to make possible that I can keep my job as a driver at Duke, and helping students learn,” Juárez said through an interpreter.

Nikki Marin Baena, co-director at Siembra NC, said there are tens of thousands of workers like Juárez who make North Carolina one of the best states in the nation for doing business.
“Luis [Juárez] has done nothing wrong that would change his immigration status,” Baena said. “And still, like so many others, he is about to have no legal protections after two decades of working for our state’s second largest employer, simply because one person in Washington decided that immigrant workers are expendable.”
Baena said that Berger, Budd and Hall have all touted North Carolina as the best state in which to do business. She noted that Budd has argued in Washington that highly skilled immigrants are essential to the nation’s success.
“Use your influence with the president,” Baena said. “Say the same thing to him that you have told North Carolina, that workers who show up day after day to make this state run are not expendable, they are the reason North Carolina is thriving, and workers like Luis [Juárez] deserve to stay.”
Thursday’s press conference was hosted by state Rep. Marcia Morey, D-Durham.
“Is Durham going to be the next city that has the National Guard brought in by the president?” Morey asked. “Are we going to be the next city with ICE officers grabbing people like Luis [Juárez] because of their immigration status?”
Rep. Maria Cervania, D-Wake, said immigrants such as Juárez are the “foundation” of the state and nation.
“He probably didn’t want to leave a country that he was born in, had dreams in, but he came here to be free, to get a better life and actually make a better life for all of us too,” Cervania said.

Michael Ramos, a Duke senior from California, said Juárez has become family.
“My mom works as a custodian at a university back home in California, and so, seeing Luis and other workers around campus instantly connects me to my home,” Ramos said, growing emotional.
After 30 years of living and working in the Durham community, Ramos said Juárez deserves to remain in the country.
“Duke would not be the same without Luis [Juárez],  Ramos said. “Let’s be honest, and I would not be the same without him either.”
Ramos announced that a fund is being started to help Juárez replace income he’s expected to lose starting Monday if he’s let go by Duke.
Juárez has become a popular figure on the Duke campus. He was profiled in the Duke Chronicle in February. And last month, 477 students, faculty and staff submitted letters of support for Juárez to Duke Visa Services, asking the university to take action on his behalf.
Juárez is well-known across Duke’s campus with students calling his the “party bus” because of the music he blasts. His many supporters say he has brought joy to their lives by playing lively music on his route.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A Rogers public school that recently reopened after being damaged by severe weather last year received a $20,000 grant Thursday to restock the library’s Spanish-language books lost in the storm. 
Greer Lingle Middle School sustained around $18 million in damage following fatal storms that spawned multiple tornadoes across north Arkansas during the 2024 Memorial Day weekend, according to Jason Ivester, communications director for the Rogers School District. Students were relocated to temporary classroom trailers on another campus for the 2024-2025 academic year before being welcomed back to the renovated campus in August. 
Most of the district’s buildings had debris around them and no power immediately following the storm, Ivester told the Advocate last year. The schools that took the most damage were Northside Elementary, Westside Elementary and Lingle, he said. The disaster had a “damaging impact” on students and their families, but adversity pulls people together, Lingle principal Erik Sokol said.
“I would never want to go through it again, but I have a different level of gratitude and appreciation for our students and their families and our community and what we’ve been able to persevere through, and we had an outstanding year,” Sokol said.

Library Media Specialist Tara Herbert accepted a $20,000 Beyond Words grant from Dollar General representatives Tuesday that she said will support the library’s popular graphic novel section and replenish its collection of Spanish-language books. The middle school, which has nearly 700 students in grades 6 through 8, has a large Spanish-speaking population, she said. 
Herbert, who’s starting her 19th year as the school’s librarian, said it was devastating to see the storm damage for the first time. 
“I’ve spent a lot of years and a lot of time building this space up and so it was heartbreaking to see all the things that I had created throughout the years gone,” she said. “It’s kind of exciting now because it’s like a blank slate in here and we’re starting new and can do things in a different new way.”
The grant is important to rebuilding the library’s collection because without it, Herbert said she would only work within her regular budget. The school is awaiting reimbursement from its insurance company, which will inform how much money may be awarded from FEMA, Ivester said. The expenses for the renovation have been temporarily covered by using money from a building fund, he said. 
Increased frequency in natural disasters like the 2024 storms have led to increased insurance premiums for schools across the country. Ivester confirmed that the district’s premiums increased “quite considerably” for the current year, but said it was not due to the tornado.
Arkansas lawmakers give initial approval to new state insurance captive’s rate structure 

A tornado that destroyed Wynne High School in March 2023 resulted in $122 million of the more than $147 million losses in the insurance program managed by the Arkansas School Boards Association, the largest loss of any school district in Arkansas history.
In July of 2023, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the state would help school districts cover the cost of rising insurance premiums. State lawmakers approved about $11 million to offset the cost of increased premiums, which were expected to rise about 130%.
They also hired a consultant to study increasing premiums. The result of the study was a recommendation for the state to create its own insurance captive to insure schools. Legislators approved laws earlier this year to help get the state-run insurance company set up.  
The Rogers School District was notified by the state that it’s premium for the 2025-2026 fiscal year would remain the same, about $1.97 million, and its deductible would double from $25,000 to $50,000, Ivester said.
Meanwhile, renovations are ongoing at Greer Lingle Middle School, which is getting a new storm safe room that will be part of the fine arts building. The project is expected to be completed in November, when Ivester said the school will host an official grand opening.

Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye will retire from state service next month to pursue a Master of Social Work and a new career working with children and families in health care, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday. She’ll be succeeded by Deputy Commissioner Elena Trueworthy on an interim basis, and Lamont said he plans to recommend Trueworthy for the position permanently.
With Bye’s departure, the Office of Early Childhood will become the third agency that oversees children’s welfare to have an interim leader. The Office of the Child Advocate and the Department of Children and Families both have interim leaders.
Former DCF Commissioner Jodi Hill-Lilly left the agency on Monday. Lamont named Susan Hamilton, general counsel and a former DCF commissioner, to lead the agency on an interim basis the following day. And Child Advocate Christina Ghio has been leading that office on an interim basis since Sarah Eagan’s departure from the role last September.
Bye started at OEC in 2019, at the start of Lamont’s first term. She has been at the helm at the agency during a time when a lack of early care and education workers has caused a dearth of child care across the state.
She worked with Lamont’s office to develop a plan to create the transformative Early Childhood Education Endowment fund and expand access to child care for thousands of families. Her focus has been on high-quality early care and education, which helps children’s development during an important time for brain growth.
Depending on surplus funds available and how quickly the fund grows, it aims to eventually allow families making less than $100,000 to pay nothing for infant and toddler care and pre-K, while families making more than that would pay no more than 7% of their annual household income. In partnership with Bye, the legislature also passed a measure to increase salaries for child care workers.
“Beth Bye is one of the most caring, compassionate, and energetic people that I know, and her passion for the development and wellness of the youngest members of our communities knows no bounds,” Lamont said in a press release.
In the release, Bye called her work as commissioner “the honor of my career.”
“The achievements Connecticut has made to improve the wages of early educators and make child care more affordable for families happened only because of decades of work by advocates, legislators, philanthropy, and families,” Bye said. “This collaborative work is a model for other states and the nation.”
She also praised Trueworthy in her statement, saying she had been a key leader in the past years.
“She has the vision, leadership, experience and passion to lead OEC into the future. There is nobody better to continue this critical work,” Bye said.
Trueworthy has been with the OEC since 2019. She’s served as the director of the Head Start State Collaboration Office and was appointed deputy commissioner in 2023.
“I look forward to continuing to work closely with partners, providers, and families to build upon and implement the collective vision of an early childhood system that supports children and families to thrive,” Trueworthy said.
Lamont said her experience would allow her to “hit the ground running.”
Trueworthy has a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Connecticut and a master’s degree in human services from Springfield College. Lamont said he plans to submit her name as the candidate for the next commissioner to the legislature in the upcoming session, which begins early next year.
In issued statements, lawmakers and leaders in early childhood care and education congratulated Bye on her work with the agency.
Garth Harries, president and chief executive officer of The Connecticut Project Action Fund, said Bye had been a “relentless champion of Connecticut’s children and working families during her time in office.”
Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, wished Bye well in her next role.
“Connecticut’s children are losing a great advocate and leader today, one who was always laser-focused on supporting all children in the best possible way,” Maher said. “As a natural leader who helped create the Office of Early Childhood in the legislature, she was the perfect choice to take its reins.”
Bye also served in the legislature from 2007 to 2019 as both a representative and a senator. During her time in the legislature, she was one of the leaders in the effort to establish the OEC in 2013.
“Commissioner Bye is leaving behind an incredible legacy as an advocate for young children, their families and our shared hometown of West Hartford,” said Sen. Derek Slap, D-West Hartford. “As my predecessor in the state senate and then at OEC, Commissioner Bye brought energy, compassion and forward thinking to her public service.”
As commissioner, Bye earned about $207,000 annually.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0319_SR_Hearing_292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 14:58:11.380802

RJ May, pictured in the House chamber, can represent himself in his trial, a judge decided Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025.(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Former Rep. RJ May can represent himself in his trial, a federal judge decided Thursday.
May was arrested in June on 10 charges of sending images and videos of children being sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty. The founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus resigned his House seat last month.
A judge had previously assigned him taxpayer-funded public defenders after May said he couldn’t afford to pay an attorney of his own. May’s two public defenders can sit behind him to answer questions and clarify statements the judge makes, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie decided.
SC representative charged with distributing child sexual abuse material

May will be responsible for making opening and closing arguments, examining and cross-examining witnesses, and filing motions from his Edgefield County jail cell.
The exact reasons for May’s decision are unclear. Issues between attorneys and clients are typically not made public.
Unlike many of his former colleagues at the Statehouse, May is not an attorney. He owns Ivory Tusk Consulting, which ran campaigns for GOP candidates who aligned with his hardline brand of conservatism.
Clients looking to fire their attorneys and represent themselves must be competent to make the decision, which was a bar May met, Currie decided.
May originally asked Currie to allow him to represent himself in filing a motion to suppress evidence but let his attorneys represent him during the trial. When Currie denied that proposal, May instead asked to proceed without attorneys representing him.
A hearing on arguments over whether a search warrant used to seize electronics from May’s house last year can be used in the trial is scheduled for Sept. 24.
Jury selection in May’s trial is set to begin Oct. 8, with arguments starting the next day. Prosecutors have said they expect the trial to last six days.
In messages and phone calls to friends and family from his jail cell obtained through an open records request, May repeatedly mentioned working on motions, including to suppress evidence and revoke his detention. He’s been held without bond since June 11.
“i finishes my suppression motion,” May wrote to an unspecified number June 22. “pretty good for a non lawyer, i think.”
May argued in some messages that prosecutors hadn’t actually found any evidence of child sexual abuse material on his devices, suggesting they had little evidence to back up their claims.
“digital forensics just dont work like that,” May wrote June 19.
An attorney representing May during his June detention hearing suggested a political enemy might have hacked into his WiFi to send images and videos.
Investigators traced an account on messaging app Kik that was flagged for sending videos of child sexual abuse to May’s home internet and personal cellphone, a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security said previously.
The account had at least 220 different videos and images depicting child sexual abuse saved. None of the images were saved directly to the phone, but that’s not uncommon in these cases, the special agent testified.
May’s phone showed Kik and other encrypted, foreign-based apps had been deleted. Data on his phone suggested that commonly used phrases included the “joebidennnn69” username linked to the flagged Kik account and an alternate email account for that user, investigators said.
If convicted, May could spend between five and 20 years in prison for each of the 10 charges he faces. He could also have to pay up to $250,000 for each count, plus additional fees that could add up to $40,000.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 14:58:11.380802

Texas was among the states with the most public funding grants canceled by the Trump administration earlier this year. (Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)After the Trump administration slashed billions in state and local public health funding from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this year, the eventual impact on states split sharply along political lines.
Democratic-led states that sued to block the cuts kept much of their funding, while Republican-led states lost the bulk of theirs, according to a new analysis from health research organization KFF.
The uneven fallout underscores how politics continues shaping health care in the United States. The nearly 700 CDC grants were worth about $11 billion and had been allocated by Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, state and local health departments had spent or planned to spend the money not just on COVID-related efforts, but also on prevention of other infectious diseases, support for mental health and substance use, shoring up aging public health infrastructure, and other needs.
The CDC grant terminations initially affected red and blue states about evenly, according to KFF. California, the District of Columbia, Illinois and Massachusetts — all led by Democrats — had among the largest numbers of terminated grants.
But then nearly two dozen blue states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration in April, asking the court to block the grant terminations. They argued the federal government lacked the authority to rescind funding it had already allocated.
“The Trump administration’s illegal and irresponsible decision to claw back life-saving health funding is an attack on the well-being of millions of Americans,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in an April statement announcing the lawsuit.
“Slashing this funding now will reverse our progress on the opioid crisis, throw our mental health systems into chaos, and leave hospitals struggling to care for patients.”
A federal judge sided with the blue states and blocked the cancellations  — but she limited her injunction to the jurisdictions that filed in the lawsuit.
Nearly 80% of the grant cuts have now been restored in blue states, according to the KFF analysis, compared with less than 5% in red states.
Now four of the five states with the most canceled grants are led by Republicans: Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. California, which is dominated by Democrats, kept all of its grants that had been initially terminated.
In the West and Midwest, Democratic-led Colorado — which joined the lawsuit — had 10 of its 11 grant terminations reversed. Its Republican-led neighbors that did not sue, including Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, lost all of their grants, according to the KFF analysis.

Jay Collins participates in the extradition from California of Harjinder Singh, accused of causing an accident that killed three people in Florida. (Via Collins' X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier issued subpoenas Thursday to the trucking company that employed an allegedly undocumented immigrant accused of killing three Floridians in a traffic accident.
According to the criminal subpoena, White Hawk Carriers Inc., a California company, is compelled to produce documents detailing the citizenship status of all of its licensed drivers as well as all files related to Harjinder Singh.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (via Department of Legal Affairs)
“We are going to be issuing both criminal and civil subpoenas against White Hawk Carriers,” Uthmeier announced during a Thursday morning press conference in Tampa. “Not only was [Singh] illegally here in the country, but he also did not have the competence, the skill set. There’s no way he went through the proper training in order to get this license.”
Singh, a 28-year-old Indian national, was issued commercial driver’s licenses in Washington state and California despite failing an English proficiency test, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Aug. 12, he allegedly made an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike in St. Lucie County in an eighteen-wheeler, killing three in a vehicle that slammed into his rig.
Although the civil subpoena has yet to be issued, Uthmeier’s criminal summons demands White Hawk respond within 20 days. The subpoena enumerates 27 requests of the Ceres, California, company. These include details of White Hawk’s affiliates, identities of their Florida-licensed drivers, how they process and affirm commercial driver’s licence applicants, and records related to Singh’s incident.
The accident has had national ramifications, prompting Secretary of State Marco Rubio to temporarily freeze visas for foreign-born truck drivers and federal authorities to threaten slashed funding for states that don’t enforce English-proficiency standards for commercial truck drivers.
In August, DOT launched a federal investigation into White Hawk Carriers, finding that Singh had failed the mandatory English Language Proficiency assessment required for commercial truckers. Singh provided correct responses to just 2 of 12 verbal questions and only accurately identified 1 of 4 highway traffic signs, the agency said.
White Hawk has had 25 truck-safety violations in its last 24 inspections, and may have lost its ability to do business outside of California, the Miami Herald reported.
Florida on the national stage
Florida has pushed itself center-stage in the Singh-immigration discussion. Singh, who authorities said “fled” to California following the accident, was publicly extradited to the Sunshine State by Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, recently elevated to the position ahead of a contentious GOP gubernatorial primary. Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that law officers let him go because at the time they lacked probable cause to detain him.
Uthmeier, meanwhile, has called upon the federal government to consider permanently banning California and Washington from issuing CDLs.
Florida’s interstate subpoenas are not the first example of Uthmeier taking his hardline, anti-undocumented immigration agenda onto the national stage. In June, he brainstormed Alligator Alcatraz — a brand-new, massive migrant detention center in the Everglades — with the Department of Homeland Security.
President Donald Trump visited the facility, the first of its kind, on its opening day. This inspired DHS to take to states like Indiana and Nebraska to support similarly alliterative replicas, like the “Speedway Slammer” and “Cornhusker Clink.” DeSantis has since floated “Deportation Depot” in Northeast Florida and the “Panhandle Pokey” in West Florida.
A federal judge last month blocked the Everglades facility from accepting more detainees, demanding the center deconstruct by September’s end.

Free.,Trump administration urges Supreme Court to quickly overturn ruling against tariffs,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-quickly-overturn-ruling-against-tariffs,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to quickly take up the president’s emergency tariffs case to avoid ""catastrophic"" economic consequences for the United States, according to a filing.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued in the Wednesday petition that roughly $750 billion to $1 trillion in tariff revenue is at stake if the justices accept the case through the normal session timeline, which ends in June 2026. The U.S. could face having to refund the import taxes paid by U.S. companies, Bessent said. President Donald Trump and administration officials have asked the Supreme Court to overturn Friday’s federal appellate ruling that affirmed the president does not have authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Trump is the first president to trigger tariffs under the IEEPA. The ruling upheld an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade. The decision is stayed while Trump officials appeal.Tariffs paid by domestic purchasers, businessesTrump began imposing wide-reaching tariffs in February and escalated them in the following months on goods from around the globe after declaring national emergencies — first over illegal fentanyl smuggling, and then declaring trade deficits an emergency. A trade deficit means the U.S. imports more goods from a country than that nation’s businesses purchase from U.S. suppliers.Domestic businesses and purchasers now pay the U.S. government anywhere from 10% to 50% in tariffs on most imported products. The government had collected nearly $82 billion by June 30, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data. Trump’s emergency tariffs were challenged in court by several private businesses and a dozen states that sued the administration for using emergency powers to trigger the steep import taxes — the first time a U.S. president had ever done so.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states, led by Democratic attorneys general, that brought the suit.Businesses that sued the Trump administration include the lead plaintiff, V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, according to its website. Other plaintiffs include a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company, and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Trade frameworksBessent argued the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is jeopardizing trade frameworks the administration has arranged with Japan, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea, and the European Union.The administration has announced several unofficial deals over recent months and has touted securing hundreds of billions in investment from other nations in exchange for lower tariffs.“World leaders are questioning the President's authority to impose tariffs, walking away from or delaying negotiations, and/or imposing a different calculus on their negotiating positions. The court’s ruling has taken away substantial negotiating leverage for the president to achieve the best trade deals for the American people,” Bessent wrote in a declaration attached to the administration’s motion to expedite the case, should the justices agree to take it.In asking the Supreme Court to take the case, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argued the tariffs are the administration’s “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative … which President Trump has determined are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl across our borders.”Sauer is Trump’s former personal defense attorney who argued on Trump’s behalf before the high court last year.",,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma higher education officials on Thursday voted to revoke a policy that allowed some immigrant students lacking legal status to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities in limited circumstances. 
The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education were previously permitted by state law to do so, but a federal judge on Friday ruled the Oklahoma law is unconstitutional and violates the Supremacy Clause.
The U.S. Department of Justice sued Oklahoma over the statute last month and argued the measure extended eligibility for in-state tuition to some immigrants while not extending that treatment to U.S. citizens in other states. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond filed a motion in support of the lawsuit. 
The policy change is predicted to affect around 400 students attending Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities, said Chancellor Sean Burrage. The change is effective immediately.
The State Regents are interpreting the order to mean that students who have already enrolled in classes and paid in-state tuition before Friday’s order will not have to pay non-resident tuition, he said. 
“It’s my understanding that all the institutions have been in constant communication with the students that attend that institution,” Burrage said. 
Oklahoma was one of 23 states and Washington D.C. that offered in-state tuition and financial aid benefits for some students without permanent legal residency status, according to an analysis by the Higher Education Portal, which is a platform for data, resources and policy analysis regarding immigrant student populations.
Under the now-defunct law, Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities were allowed to offer in-state tuition to anyone who graduates high school in the state and resides in Oklahoma for at least two years prior to graduation.
The lawsuit argued this included “undocumented immigrants.”

Janet Mills gives her state of the budget address in January 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Bureau of Insurance announced steep increases in 2026 health insurance premiums for more than 100,000 Maine people on Thursday, prompting Gov. Janet Mills to ask Congress to extend a tax credit to insulate people from those higher costs.
The enhanced premium tax credit lowers the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. It’s currently unclear whether Congress or the president will extend the tax credit, which is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. 
In a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation on Thursday, Mills called on U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden to ensure Congress extends the tax credit by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. 
If not, Mills wrote, by late October Mainers insured by the state-based health insurance marketplace, CoverME.gov, will receive notices of 2026 premiums that “will reflect steep increases that will prompt many consumers to drop coverage before Open Enrollment even begins.” Mills added that “a later extension will not undo the damage and coverage losses will be irreversible.” 
Superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance Robert Carey attributed the increased premium costs for next year to the instability of federal policies, including the expiring credits and the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Other factors include the growing costs of medical services and prescription drugs, Carey said in a statement.  
Other state regulators are also facing this issue. Nationally, premiums in the individual insurance market are expected to increase an average of 20% next year, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
Thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117% if the tax credits are not extended, Mills warned in her letter. 
Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs. These families are expected to see an average premium increase of $258 per month if the enhanced credits expire. The average increase for households will approach $286 per month when combined with insurer-submitted 2026 rate increases. 
Nearly 9,500 consumers — 18% of those receiving assistance — will lose all premium support if the enhanced credits expire, leading to average increases of more than $900 per month.
During state budget hearings this past spring, representatives of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a nonpartisan nonprofit committed to helping all Mainers obtain affordable health care coverage, testified in favor of increasing funding for the assistance program that helps Mainers navigate insurance challenges and warned about compounded costs if subsidies were not extended.
Further, because of cuts at the federal level, the nonprofit said some Mainers who currently have employer-sponsored coverage may be at risk of losing their jobs and therefore coverage. Mills has also warned of the Trump administration’s policies causing harm to Maine people, particularly significant cuts to Medicaid included in the sweeping budget reconciliation package.

Primary Care Providers in VT’s Northeast Kingdom (NEK) are keen to emphasize the message that mental well-being matters just as much as physical health.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mental health is health.","Dr. Dana Kraus, NCHC’s Clinician Lead to Quality and Primary Care Provider at St. Johnsbury Community Health Center
For nearly 20 years, Northern Counties Health Care (NCHC) has embraced the integration of behavioral health and primary care. As one of Vermont’s pioneering Medical Homes in the Blueprint for Health initiative, NCHC has long embodied the state’s vision of comprehensive, coordinated care.
Today, with five Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) primary care clinics, and two walk-in Express Care sites in Newport and St. Johnsbury, NCHC continues to set the standard for integrated services in the Northeast Kingdom (NEK).
“By integrating behavioral health within our primary care clinics, we’ve fundamentally transformed our approach to care. We’ve broken down the barriers of stigma and fragmentation, ensuring that every patient receives whole-person care, seamlessly and conveniently, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for our community and a more rewarding practice for our providers,” says Jesse Dimick, NCHC’s Director of FQHC Operations.
Recently, NCHC was awarded the prestigious National Quality Leader – Behavioral Health badge from the Health Resources & Service Administration (HRSA) Community Health Quality Recognition program, placing it among a select group of U.S. health centers, and the only one in Vermont, recognized for excellence in behavioral health care.


What Behavioral Health Means
Behavioral health includes our mental, emotional, and social well-being, as well as the services that prevent and treat conditions such as depression, anxiety, trauma, and substance use. Because physical and behavioral health affect one another, challenges in one area can worsen the other. Addressing the whole person—body and mind—is key to long-term health. That’s where integration of behavioral health care into primary care comes in.
What Integration Looks Like
Integration is more than co-locating services. At NCHC, each clinic offers access to licensed behavioral health counselors, psychiatric nurse practitioners, Peer Support Workers, and Opioid Use Disorder Care Coordinators.
These behavioral health specialists work as a team with medical providers, nurses and community health workers —sharing information, coordinating care, and supporting patients together. That means:
·       Easier access to behavioral health support in the same place you receive primary care.
·       Fewer delays and smoother transitions—your provider can connect you to help right away.
·       Care that treats you as a whole person.
“Not everyone feels comfortable or knows where to start when it comes to finding behavioral health care, especially in rural communities,” says Claudia Alexander, LICSW, Behavioral Health Program Manager at NCHC. “At NCHC, we make it a seamless part of your visit with a primary care provider. You might find out you have high blood pressure and share that life has been stressful lately — your provider can then introduce you to one of our Peer Support Workers or counselors, and you can schedule a follow-up before you even leave the clinic. We can usually get people in with a member of our behavioral health team within one to two weeks.”
Overcoming Barriers
Historically, primary care and behavioral health operated in silos, with separate systems, funding, and even records. Barriers like insurance rules, provider shortages, and stigma have made access difficult—especially in rural areas like the NEK.  But integration breaks down those barriers by making behavioral health a natural part of a primary care visit.
“There are lots of barriers to accessing mental health and substance use treatment services… especially here in the NEK.  Awareness of the right resources which are affordable or covered by insurance…that’s a big one.  Also stigma about getting treatment since its expected that people can just cope with everything that comes their way and somehow its shameful to need help. That’s huge.  Getting a referral for treatment or services can mean a long wait time, or delay or miscommunication between providers.  That’s frustrating and inconvenient,” said a patient at NCHC’s St. Johnsbury Community Health Center.  “When services are right there in your primary care provider’s office, you don’t have to deal with those barriers because your provider has spoken to you about the services and maybe even made an internal referral or a warm handoff that day to someone else who can help. And if my provider recommends something to me, I tend to take it to heart and try to follow her advice – I trust her.”
Support and Investment
Research shows that integrated care improves both physical and behavioral health outcomes.  Integrated care improves the patient experience of care and gets rid of several of the biggest barriers that people have to accessing behavioral health services: awareness, time, convenience, cost, fragmentation and stigma.
Integration also improves staff and provider experience.  “A patient arrived for a scheduled office visit ready to engage with substance use treatment. Stephanie Gochie, our Peer Support Worker, sat with her, explained what needed to happen, and stayed with the patient while she made the phone call to the rehab facility. Steph probably spent 30 minutes or more that neither the provider nor rooming staff would have been able to spend, and the patient received support and encouragement while making that difficult call,” said Gianna Menapace-Drew, APRN at Concord Health Center.
But sustaining and deepening integration takes time, effort and resources.  Since 2023, NCHC has participated in the Vermont Blueprint for Health’s Mental Health Integration into Primary Care initiative, expanding services and adding Peer Support Workers to the care team.
In 2024, NCHC received a Behavioral Health Service Expansion grant from HRSA, one of only three FQHCs in Vermont to earn this competitive award.  With support from the grant, NCHC expanded access to mental health and substance use care by hiring Peer Support Workers in the two Express Care locations, improving access to support in walkable locations and outside traditional hours.  NCHC also invested in specialized trainings—like hosting the region’s first in-person EMDR training—so staff can better meet the diverse needs of patients. The grant also allowed expanded opioid use treatment through new staffing, extended hours, and a partnership with EMS to build rapid-access pathways.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-04 17:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Fate of Prospect Medical Holdings’ CT hospitals remains in limbo,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/prospect-medical-ct-hospitals-sale-delayed/,"Prospect has yet to disclose potential buyers for court-supervised sale of three CT hospitals — a potentially concerning sign, experts say.","Two weeks ago, Prospect Medical Holdings said an announcement regarding initial bids for its three Connecticut hospitals — Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General — was imminent. 
The company has yet to disclose any details on interested buyers. 
Experts say that could be a sign the facilities aren’t attracting strong interest in the court-supervised sale — part of a months-long bankruptcy proceeding the company filed in January.
During a hearing on Aug. 20, a lawyer for Prospect said several times that the company would announce initial bidders for the Connecticut hospitals within days. But, as of Thursday, Prospect still had not named a “stalking horse bidder,” the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
Prospect must complete the sale auction for the Connecticut hospitals by Sept. 19 and a final order approving the transaction must be entered by Oct. 3, according to a recently updated agreement with one of its lenders.
The company has already missed several such deadlines. 
Roughly a month after Prospect filed for bankruptcy protection, the company set a timeline for the Connecticut sale, including a bid deadline of late May 2025 and a sale hearing, where the court would approve a new owner, for June 5, according to court documents submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Northern District of Texas. 
“Most likely, if in the last six to eight months they have not teed up a sale for the Connecticut hospitals, it means they’re probably having difficulty finding a buyer,” Ken Rosen, a bankruptcy attorney with experience in the health care industry, said. He added that it’s possible Prospect has a buyer lined up but that the parties have not yet been able to agree on price or contract terms. 
Spokespeople for Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Matthew Beatman, a Bridgeport-based bankruptcy attorney, also said the delays could be concerning and added that the timeline extensions likely reflect a major effort underway to avoid hospital closures. 
“The preference would be to see a private party come in, or private parties come in, and have some continuation for one or all of [the hospitals],” Beatman said. “Whether or not that’s feasible and going to happen, no one knows. But it sounds like no one wants to give up yet.”
But in the case of some Prospect-owned hospitals, closures were unavoidable. 
Prospect shuttered its two remaining Pennsylvania hospitals earlier this year after failing to find a viable buyer, even after the state provided more than $15 million over seven months to help keep the facilities open. 
In Massachusetts, Steward Health Care, another formerly private equity-backed hospital operator that declared bankruptcy in May of last year, closed two hospitals after failing to receive any qualified bids for the facilities.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the administration is preparing for all possible outcomes.
“The state has been actively working for many months now to prepare for any eventuality that may occur with these facilities to ensure continuity of care and preserving these community assets.”
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy in January, Lamont vowed to keep the hospitals open.
But, months later, as part of a broader agreement, the state Office of Health Strategy granted Prospect permission to convert one of its three Connecticut hospitals — Rockville General in Vernon — from a full-service acute care hospital into a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial Hospital, located 20 minutes away. While not technically a closure, the agreement cleared a path for Prospect to permanently shutter all services aside from the emergency and behavioral health departments.
During the same August hearing where a Prospect lawyer said bids for the Connecticut hospitals were imminent, the company also admitted that none of the offers it had received to date were as high as a $435 million offer Yale New Haven Health agreed to pay for the facilities in April 2022. 
The attorney also discussed a motion Prospect filed seeking to hold Yale New Haven to the terms of the deal. If the motion is successful, Yale would either have to purchase the hospitals for $435 million, pay a penalty to Prospect or challenge the company in court. The bankruptcy court judge is slated to decide whether to grant that request in a hearing scheduled for Sept. 23.
During the hearing, the judge encouraged Yale and Prospect to enter into mediation talks.
Dana Marnane, a spokesperson for Yale New Haven Health, confirmed that the health system had agreed to mediation talks. But she declined to provide any additional information on what potential outcomes could be, including whether Yale New Haven would consider purchasing the hospitals at a lower price.
“At the request of the court overseeing Prospect’s bankruptcy proceedings, Yale New Haven Health has agreed to meet with Prospect and other parties, including representatives from the State of Connecticut,” Marnane stated in emailed comments.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_WaterburyHospital_027-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244
,California,2025-09-04 17:28:38+00:00,CalMatters,Will California ban companies from charging vets to secure benefits? Some say it should,Adam Ashton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/veterans-claims/,"A burgeoning for-profit industry caters to veterans who want help preparing disability claims. California may ban the practice, which is known for high fees that some view as exploitative.","In summary
A burgeoning for-profit industry caters to veterans who want help preparing disability claims. California may ban the practice, which is known for high fees that some view as exploitative.


The $1,102 Adan Montalvo gets every month in disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs makes a difference for him, but he regrets the price he paid for it. 
Montalvo was able to obtain the benefit after signing a contract with a private company that compiles medical evidence to help veterans establish disability claims. The process worked, and Montalvo began receiving the money some 52 years after he left the Army with a bad knee. 
But there was a catch. His contract with Trajector Medical required him to pay five times the value of his new monthly benefit almost right away. That was $5,500 he didn’t have. 
“They wanted to collect all of it, and I told them how am I going to give you money I don’t have?” he said. 
For the second year in a row, California lawmakers are on the brink of banning fees for the kind of service Montalvo received. 
Critics of the paid services say the practice already is illegal under a federal law that says only accredited officers can help veterans file those claims, and that claims representatives can be paid only under specific circumstances. And, they note that veterans can get the same assistance for free from county veteran service offices, as well as from several veterans organizations that have long been accredited with the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
But the law banning paid services lost its teeth after a 2006 overhaul removed criminal penalties for violations,helping to spawn a burgeoning for-profit industry that now caters to veterans who want help with the VA’s notoriously slow claims process. 
That’s an affront to many former military service members who view the charges as a violation of the compact the nation makes with those who serve. Several of the companies have fee formulas similar to what Montalvo paid. That could result in a charge of $20,000 depending on the veteran’s disability rating. 
“We shouldn’t be charging veterans outrageous amounts of money to access their benefits, benefits they earned through their service,” said Sen. Bob Archuleta, a Democrat from Norwalk who sponsored Senate Bill 694 to ban unaccredited companies from assisting California veterans with disability claims. 
His bill is awaiting a final vote in the Assembly after clearing the Senate and several legislative committees by overwhelming majorities. Its supporters, however, are not yet celebrating. A similar measure died last year late in the legislative process without a vote in an appropriations committee. One of the larger veterans’ claims companies also is making a concerted push to defend its business as a legitimate alternative to free services.
“We are serving veterans. Yes, we’re doing it as a business but just because we’re doing it as a business doesn’t mean we’re not providing an essential service,” said Bill Taylor, a former Army officer who is the cofounder of Veterans Guardian.
He became the face of the industry over the last four years as first Congress and then state legislatures took up bills to prohibit unaccredited veterans claims services. His company contributed $1.4 million to members of Congress and spent $1.9 million on federal lobbying in 2023 and 2024, according to the campaign finance website Open Secrets. In California this year, his company and another spent $235,000 on lobbying against Archuleta’s bill, according to the website California Lobby Search. 
“Maybe we were the only ones who recognized the existential threat to the industry.
I don’t have a choice; I have to be here,” Taylor said in an interview with CalMatters during a recent visit to Sacramento.
The result is something of a stalemate. Congress has neither passed legislation to reinstate criminal penalties for unaccredited veterans claims services nor passed a competing bill that would permit the companies to operate.
States adopt different policies
States are moving in different directions, too. Maine, New Jersey and New York passed laws to ban the for-profit consultants, while Louisiana passed a law to allow them, according to the news organization Stateline. 
Taylor is urging lawmakers enact policies that would regulate the claims industry, such as by capping fees and prohibiting misleading advertising. He noted that his company has no shortage of clients, and the people often turn to it out of frustration with the VA or with free claims services. 
But Archuleta and the veterans groups supporting his proposal say it’s impossible to distinguish bad actors from responsible ones. They want California to step in with a state policy until Congress resolves whether the for-profit claims consultants can gain accreditation and be regulated by the federal government. 
“The point is here you should never take money from the veteran. That is absolutely scandalous that that is permitted,” William Swenson, a Medal of Honor recipient from the Afghanistan War who recently visited Sacramento to meet with lawmakers in support of Archuleta’s bill, told CalMatters. He now is working for a company that is developing a different approach to helping veterans with their claims.
Veterans unprepared for fee
Montalvo, 72, of Lamont was able to work out a payment plan with Trajector. It includes a small interest fee. He said he had his knee checked when he left the Army in 1973, but it didn’t result in a disability rating. 
He said Trajector reached out to him by a text message and a phone call, and he replied thinking it was worth a shot. Today, his monthly disability check helps with groceries, although he’s sending more than half of it to Trajector and he pays off his bill.

John Ryan, 68, had a similar experience with Trajector. “They were really polite and I was under the influence that they worked with the VA, as soon as I got the impression I felt relaxed. They asked me questions and they moved pretty fast. I was surprised they got results so fast,” he said.
His claim resulted in $171 monthly disability payment for hearing loss stemming his service in the Marines. He said he also was unprepared to pay Trajector’s full fee right away, although he has paid it off. 
Trajector spokesperson Steven Zenofsky said the company strives to make its fee structure clear to veterans before working with them. Like Taylor’s Veterans Guardian, Trajector also was co-founded by a veteran and its leaders view themselves as helping former military service members navigate a confusing process.
If a veteran receives $1,000 a month after working with a claims consultant, Zenofsky said, “That’s $1,000 a month tax free. From that perspective, many of our clients would say ‘The fee was for a valuable service provided that I wouldn’t normally get on my own, and for life.’” 
Sen. Archuleta wants to steer more resources to California’s county veteran service officers, who are accredited to work on VA claims and can help direct veterans to a wide range of services in addition to disability payments. 
David West, who served in the Marine Corps and is a Nevada County veterans services officer, has been an outspoken advocate for the bill. He was once homeless, and he said at one point in his life he would have signed a contract with a for-profit claims consultant. 
He would have regretted it, he said. 
“That’s not what my recruiter promised me,” he said “You’re 19. You come in, we’ll take care of you and you’ll never have to pay a thing.”
“We can’t allow for this middleman to show up and break that promise,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/082725-Veterans-Benefits-LV-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244

Chris Butters)The U.S. Coast Guard announced Tuesday that it has awarded a $137 million contract for the first phase of a project intended to allow its Seattle base to host two new heavy icebreakers.
The contract, awarded to The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company, covers dredging of the Coast Guard’s Slip 36 and construction of two ship berths capable of hosting the new icebreakers, formally known as Polar Security Cutters.
The first of those ships, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to be complete in 2030. When accepted into the Coast Guard, it will be the service’s first new heavy icebreaker since the Polar Star was commissioned in 1977.
The Coast Guard operates the federal government’s icebreaker fleet, and the Polar Star is key to supplying American research bases in Antarctica from its Seattle home port. 
A second and third heavy icebreaker were fully funded with $4.3 billion included as part of the Republican budget package approved by Congress and President Donald Trump earlier this year. 
The budget package also included $300 million for port construction in Juneau to support the newly commissioned Coast Guard icebreaker Storis, a converted oilfield services ship. Until that work is complete, the Storis will be homeported in Seattle.
The Republican budget package, known as the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” includes billions of dollars for shoreside port facilities like those in Juneau and Seattle.

(Photo by Stew Milne for the Alabama Reflector)Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen told a federal judge Thursday he still does not know if the governor will call a special session to redraw state Senate districts in Montgomery after a ruling that they violate the Voting Rights Act.
U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, issued a decision last month that Senate Districts 25 and 26 violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by giving Black voters less opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice than other voters. She ordered lawmakers to revise the capital-area districts in time for the 2026 midterm elections. 
“Counsel remain in contact with Legislative leadership and with the Governor’s office but cannot say at this time when a decision will be made or what it will be,” Allen wrote in his latest status report. “Counsel understand that the officials who would be involved in a special session of the Legislature are actively discussing the matter and progress has been made, but no final decision has been reached.”
The qualifying period for the midterm election is in January for the Republican Party, but the Democratic Party has yet to set its dates.
Allen previously reported his uncertainty about what the Legislature would do to comply with the order but said a special session could happen in late September or early October. He appealed the order to wait for a final decision until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a similar case in Louisiana.
Messages seeking comment were left with the office of Gov. Kay Ivey and Speaker of the House Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, on Thursday morning.
Manasco said if the Legislature does not redraw the districts, she would appoint a special master to do so. She intends to appoint Richard Allen as the special master, David Ely as his cartographer, and Michael Scodro and his law firm, Mayer Brown LLP, as the special master’s legal counsel if the Legislature does not redraw the map. It is the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts. Neither Allen nor the plaintiffs objected to the appointment.
Should the ruling be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and legislative maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, eventually resulting in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL_Senate_023-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)COLDWATER — The Comanche County School District’s superintendent landed on paid administrative leave in the wake of a community uprising led by parents angry with how the school board initially responded to allegations he sexually harassed a student.
A Kansas student reported her coach for harassment and touching. School leaders kept it quiet.

More than 100 residents of the rural southwest Kansas school district — including some displaying raw, intense emotion — descended on the high school Wednesday night to demand ouster or suspension of superintendent Ty Theurer.
“How in the world did we get here?” said Zach Ellis, a county commissioner who has children in the district. “Does this board not have a responsibility to the kids of this district to do the right thing? Kids don’t feel safe in this building. You have created a hostile and toxic learning environment as well as a toxic working environment.”
School board president Kelly Herd, who became aware of the student’s harassment complaint four months ago, had resisted punishment of Theurer beyond the warning placed in his personnel file. She had told fellow board members no additional sanction was necessary in response to an allegation that Theurer, while serving as golf coach, advised a female student to hold clubs like she were gripping a penis. The girl had also complained of unwanted touching by Theurer.
Theurer signed a summary of the student’s complaint months ago, which was viewed by the student’s parents as an admission of guilt.
Herd also sent emails to other board members saying Theurer “did not deny nor make excuses” and “has been written up.”
In front of an unusually large crowd, the seven-member board moved in and out of executive session several times before Herd sought a motion to relieve Theurer of administrative duties in the 300-student district. He wasn’t at work Wednesday and didn’t attend the school board meeting after Kansas Reflector published an article Tuesday detailing allegations against the superintendent and the school board’s tepid response.

The school board didn’t discuss publicly the reason for taking action against Theurer at this time. There was no board disclosure about who would temporarily lead the district or for how long.
The board adopted a vague motion to proceed with “next steps” that the board president said had been discussed in executive session. None of that information was shared with the audience.
“Horrible,” school board member Dean Yoder said in an interview after the meeting. “It was not handled in May. It’s still not being handled in the right manner.”
He said the school board should have fired Theurer in the spring, and no evidence has surfaced to dissuade him of that necessity.
After Herd adjourned the meeting, the audience hurled questions at the school board. In the back-and-forth, school board vice president Andy Uhl confirmed Theurer was placed on paid leave.
An investigator with the Kansas Association of School Boards has compiled a draft report regarding an inquiry into allegations against Theurer. The board met behind closed doors with a KASB attorney before voting to relieve the superintendent of all administrative responsibilities.
The regular public comment portion of the meeting was moved to the back of the agenda. When that moment arrived, the school board president said she would forbid any speaker from referring to district employees or students. She asserted, without offering a justification, that such public statements would violate privacy rights of individuals.
“The board appreciates patrons taking the time to talk to us about our policies and procedures,” Herd said. “Please, understand this is not an appropriate time or place for patrons to make comments of a personal nature about any district employee or student.”
Initially, Herd told the audience that she wanted to convince Ellis — the only person to fill out an application for permission to speak — to share his concerns with the school board in a closed executive session. Herd’s suggestion was widely opposed by people in the crowd, including Ellis.
“You don’t get to go into executive session just because you don’t want to hear what I’ve got to say,” Ellis shouted.
Another person in the room challenged this secretive approach: “He speaks for a lot of us.”
“Is that a unanimous board decision?” Ellis continued. “Because I bet it wasn’t.”
“I’m not finished,” Herd shot back. “I’m going to let you speak. You have five minutes. You can’t mention anybody by name. If it gets out of control, we will stop it.”
Ellis didn’t mention the superintendent’s name during his speech, but there was no doubt he was talking about Theurer. Ellis accused Herd of running school board meetings with an iron hand and of stifling dissent among her elected peers on the school board.
In terms of the sexual harassment allegation, Ellis said, “The people who are sworn to protect these people have failed.”
“If you think that this is or was an isolated incident,” he said, “you are nuttier than a pile of bull crap. It’s a pattern in what now seems to be a decade of abuse.”
When the timer hit 5 minutes, Herd told Ellis that his time was up.
“Hey, freedom of speech,” said a man at the back of the room.
Another person was adamant: “Let him speak.”
Herd ignored their pleas and asked for a motion to go into another executive session rather than hear more from Ellis. Briefly, Ellis and Herd were simultaneously addressing the audience.
There was a puzzled response from the crowd when Herd declared the board would proceed with “next steps” in terms of the district’s leadership structure. She didn’t articulate elements of that plan.
“No questions. No answers,” one crowd member said.
“What if it was your daughter?” a woman yelled.
Ellis said he was optimistic change would come to the Comanche County school system, given the number of disgruntled people present at the meeting.
“You have awoke a sleeping giant, and we are pissed off,” Ellis said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Comanche-County-school-board-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-04 12:57:03.042169

Hinson, who has represented the northeast Iowa district for three terms, announced Tuesday she would run for Senate, shortly after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said she would not run for a third term. Hinson quickly became the frontrunner for the GOP nomination following her entrance into the race, getting endorsements from Republican senators and House GOP leadership.
Hinson’s pivot to the Senate race means Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District will not have an incumbent in the 2026 elections. There are currently no Republicans who have announced campaigns for the seat, but in the wake of the Tuesday campaign shake-up, Blum, who previously represented the area in Congress, teased a 2026 run.

In a Facebook post Tuesday, Blum thanked supporters for encouraging him to launch another run for Congress.
“The outpouring of support has been humbling – it was the honor of my lifetime to represent our district for four years, standing squarely with President Trump and backing his America First agenda,” Blum wrote. “Stay tuned!”
Blum, 70, served two terms representing Iowa’s 1st Congressional District — the northeast area of the state that largely became the 2nd District during the 2020 redistricting process. He was first elected in 2014, defeating former Iowa House Speaker Pat Murphy, the Democratic candidate, and won a second term in 2016. Blum lost the seat in 2018 to former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat.
The Republican was also previously the CEO of Eagle Point Software, and currently owns the construction software company Digital Canal.
In addition to Blum, Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, also wrote on social media Tuesday she is weighing a run for the 2nd District. Lundgren, who has served in the state legislature since 2018, wrote that the district “must continue to be represented by an America first conservative, whose roots run deep in our community.”
“Serving Iowa continues to be a calling, and that’s why I’m seriously considering jumping into this congressional race,” Lundgren wrote. “I endorsed President Trump long before the caucuses, and I’d be with him every day in Congress. My family and I will continue to discuss our next steps with friends and neighbors and pray for wisdom in our decision. We will announce our plans in the days ahead.”
Though political forecasters still predict Republicans will likely keep the seat in the midterms, the race may be more contentious than previously considered. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has listed the 2nd District as a potential pick-up, and recent special election wins have fueled hope for some Iowa Democrats aiming to break conservatives’ hold on state and federal elected positions.
There are three Democrats competing to become the party nominee for the 2nd District race in 2026. Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, have all announced campaigns.
After Hinson left the race, the Democratic candidates emphasized that their campaigns were not focused on Hinson, but on providing better representation for the district.
“I decided to run for Congress not to oppose any candidate but to be a fierce advocate for Iowans,” James said in a statement. “As Republicans search for a new candidate, our campaign’s momentum continues to grow. Too many Iowans face impossible choices when it comes to building the lives they want and deserve, and I am dedicated to listening to them and being their voice in Washington D.C.”
Twedt-Ball said in a statement following Hinson’s announcement that northeast Iowans have spent too long watching “career politicians like Ashley Hinson put their political ambitions over the needs of Iowans.”
“It’s time for a fresh, positive start in Iowa’s second district,” Twedt-Ball said.

Ron DeSantis during a press briefing at the state's emergency response center on Sept. 5, 2019. (Governor's Office)South Florida U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz says his goal is to run for re-election to his congressional seat in Palm Beach and Broward counties next year and not for the U.S. Senate.
But he tells Chuck Todd in a podcast released this week that he may have no choice but to run statewide if the GOP plan to redistrict the state severely hurts his ability to be re-elected.
“I’m not looking at [the Senate seat], I’m looking at re-election, but if for some reason Republicans decide to do all the gerrymandering, and decide to set me free from my district, perhaps, then I would look at it, Chuck,” Moskowitz said on “The Chuck Toddcast” featuring the former Meet The Press host.
Moskowitz defeated Republican Joe Kaufman by nearly 5 points in the race for Congressional District 23 last November, outperforming Kamala Harris, who defeated Donald Trump by 2 percentage points in the district.
Gov. Ron DeSantis says he intends to redraw Florida’s congressional map before the 2026 election. Speaking in Lake Worth on Aug. 20, DeSantis indicated there are “questions” regarding some of the congressional districts in Southeast Florida.
“I’m absolutely going to get targeted,” Moskowitz told Todd regarding how he believes the GOP will redraw the congressional maps. “My district’s the closest in the state.”
Moskowitz added that his intention remains to run for his House seat next year.
“I actually hope that I’m running for re-election,” he said. “They don’t mess with Fair Districts [amendment] and violate the Constitution, and I hope to make Hakeem Jeffries the Speaker, because, no offense to [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer, flipping the Senate vs. flipping the House — different. Democrats have to get a wing of government back. … If we don’t win in ’26, I don’t know what will be left of the party.”
Fair Districts won voter approval in 2010 and are intended to block the Legislature from designing districts to benefit any political party or incumbent.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Just over two months after U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-Philadelphia) announced he would not seek reelection next year, several Democrats have announced their entrance into the race for their party’s nomination in the 3rd Congressional District.
The biggest names attempting to succeed him so far all serve in the state legislature.
Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), who has been the chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party for the past few years, formally launched his candidacy two days after Evans announced his plans to retire in late June.
Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), who is on the House Judiciary Committee and other panels, also joined the race in early July.
The latest to enter the fray is Rep. Morgan Cephas (D-Philadelphia), who is the chair of the Philadelphia caucus in the House, who announced her candidacy on Wednesday.
Evans, who was a member of the General Assembly for decades, has served in the U.S. Congress since 2016. Evans has cruised to reelection time after time and did not face a challenger in the general election in some years.
The seat, which includes nearly half of Philadelphia, is a “safe Democratic” district, according to several national ratings outlets.
Christopher Borick, director of Muhlenberg College’s Institute of Public Opinion, told the Capital-Star in an interview in July that the winner of the primary election would likely go on to succeed Evans.
“If you win that primary, you’re going to Congress,” Borick said. “It’s as simple as that.”
The race for the 3rd District is also expected to be a “very costly primary fight,” Borick noted, since it is entirely inside the Philadelphia media market.
“I’d expect that to be among the most pricey primaries we see in this cycle,” he said.
While Cephas, Rabb, and Street are the most recognizable candidates in the race as of early September, there are others who are seeking the Democratic nomination. 
Democrats who have also filed include Dave Oxman, a physician, Robin Toldens, who the Philadelphia Inquirer reports is a former city government employee and real estate agent, Karl Morris, a professor at Temple University, and Gabriel Caceres.
The seven candidates that have filed make it the most crowded race to date for Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation. 
No Republicans as of Sept. 4 have filed to run for the seat.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-09-04 12:57:03.042169

(Photo courtesy of National Weather Service)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Thursday made his second presidential disaster request of the summer. 
Armstrong sent a letter to President Donald Trump and the Federal Emergency Management Agency requesting federal help in recovering from storms that damaged buildings and other infrastructure Aug. 7-8. 
The storms with tornadoes, winds up to 100 mph and large hail knocked out power to 16,000 residents in south-central and eastern North Dakota, Armstrong’s letter said.  Electrical infrastructure damage is estimated at $5.5 million.
Armstrong asked Trump to declare a major disaster for Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties. The letter says the hardest hit area was Stutsman County, including the cities of Jamestown and Courtenay. 
Without federal support, Armstrong’s letter said the cost of recovery will fall on taxpayers and utility customers. 
“The hardships created by these severe storms pushed many emergency management offices beyond their capacity, forcing them to juggle response, recovery, and resource coordination under immense pressure,” Armstrong said in the letter. 
Armstrong had previously requested a presidential major disaster declaration for storms in June that killed four people and caused more than $11 million in damage to public infrastructure in North Dakota. That request is still pending. 
Thursday’s letter notes that the August storms tracked a similar path to the June storms. 
The governor’s latest request comes after a statewide disaster declaration by Armstrong on Tuesday.

(Via Florida House)While it was no surprise that two Democrats easily won special legislative elections in Orange County on Tuesday night, party members contend that their margins of victory indicate increased voter intensity for Florida Democrats going into 2026.
Democrat LaVon Bracy Davis defeated Republican Willie J. Montague in the Senate District 15 race by 46 points, 73%-27%. That seat had been vacant since February after the previous occupant, Geraldine Thompson, died at 76 following complications from knee surgery.
In the House District 40 race that became open after Bracy Davis stepped down from the seat to run for Senate, Democrat RaShon Young defeated Republican Tuan Lee by 50 points, 75%-25%.
By comparison, Democrat Kamala Harris defeated Donald Trump in the county 56%-42% last November.
 ‘Frustrations of Floridians’
“When you look at our over-performance on what happened on Tuesday, while the Democrats voted, the NPAs voted, we had a lot of Republicans that voted on this side as well,” Bracy Davis said in a Zoom conference call organized by the Florida Democratic Party on Thursday.
“And I think that speaks to the frustration of Floridians. Floridians really want our Legislature to be focused on issues that affect them. They’re sick of culture wars. They’re sick of folks they’ve sent to Tallahassee that are focused on everything but their pocketbooks,” she continued.
“We spent an extended session last session, and we were passing bills like changing textbooks from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, and no constituent, Democrat or Republican, has called me asking for that. They’re asking me about property insurance and they’re asking me about rent caps and they’re asking me about this affordability crisis and ensuring that they have medical care.”
Bracy Davis has represented District 40 in the state House since 2022. She submitted her formal resignation from the seat in April, and it became effective on Sept. 1. She won the primary election for the Senate seat in June in a four-person field, defeating Coretta Anthony-Smith, former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, and her brother, former state legislator Randolph Bracy.
Young, a former legislative chief-of-staff for Bracy Davis, defeated former state Rep. Travaris McCurdy in the June Democratic primary. At 26, he is now the youngest member of the Florida House.

“People are sick and tired of the wasteful spending. They’re sick and tired of people overlooking the issues that are impacting them. They don’t want to have conversations about road art. They don’t want to have conversations about an internment camp. They don’t want an internment camp in their state,” he said Thursday.
“What they want is to make sure that they can put food on their tables. That they can have sustainable healthcare. That they can afford to put gas in their car. And these are the things that are not being addressed. So, these wins speak to the realization of people seeing that common-sense legislation starts with commonsense legislators, right? And the time for acquiescing to the desires of the governor or the president have come and gone, and we cannot continue to do it because Floridians are struggling. Floridians are hurting.”
Both seats are in Orange County, which remains a Democratic stronghold in a state that continues to move further red. According to the Orange County Supervisor of Elections, Democrats hold a 12-point voter registration lead in the county, 39%-27%, with another 30% registered as non-party-affiliated.
Republicans continue to enjoy a supermajority advantage over Democrats in both the state House and Senate. There are now 11 Democrats in the 40-member Senate, one independent, and 26 Republicans, with three vacancies. In the House, they now control 86 seats to the Democrats’ 32, with two vacancies.

National Guard troops and units from states outside the district  violates laws against using the military for domestic law enforcement and a 1973 federal law allowing the district to govern itself, D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb wrote in a complaint in federal court in the district.“No American jurisdiction should be involuntarily subjected to military occupation,” the complaint says, adding that Trump’s “command and control of out-of-state National Guard units when they are in state militia status violates the Constitution and federal law.”The administration’s actions, which Trump has characterized as an attempt to control crime in the city, “flout the Posse Comitatus Act,” a 19th-century law, and other sections of federal law that “enshrine the nation’s foundational prohibition on the participation of military forces in domestic law enforcement absent the most extreme exigencies, such as an invasion or rebellion,” the complaint said.“Defendants have established a massive, seemingly indefinite law enforcement operation in the District subject to direct military command. The danger that such an operation poses to individual liberty and democratic rule is self-evident,” the complaint said.Despite a Tuesday morning ruling from a federal judge in California that called Trump’s use of military personnel for law enforcement in Los Angeles illegal, the president has continued to explore further use of Guard units for what he said is crime prevention in other U.S. cities. States with a military presence in the district cited in the suit are Louisiana, South Dakota, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi and South Carolina.This is a developing report that will be updated.",,,,2025-09-04 12:57:03.042169

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
BURLINGTON — A Shelburne police sergeant has pleaded guilty to a reduced charge that will allow him to avoid jail time for driving on-duty in his cruiser into and killing a cyclist. Prosecutors say he was driving faster than the posted speed limit.  
Kyle Kapitanski, 42, entered the guilty plea Thursday morning in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington to a misdemeanor charge of negligent operation with death resulting in the November crash that killed 38-year-old Sean Hayes of Burlington.
Kapitanski was sentenced as part of the plea deal with prosecutors to six to 12 months in jail, all suspended. In addition, he was ordered to serve two years on probation and during that time he will be required to participate in a reparative justice program. 
According to the court documents, Kapitanski was behind the wheel of a Shelburne Ford Explorer cruiser early on the morning of Nov. 11, 2024, when he struck and killed Hayes on Shelburne Road in South Burlington.
Kapitanski had initially been charged with a felony offense of grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with death resulting. That charge carries a possible penalty of up to 15 years in prison, if convicted.
Vermont State Police investigators who led the probe into the incident alleged in an initial affidavit that Kapitanski was driving his Shelburne Ford Explorer cruiser about 40 to 45 mph in a 35 mph zone on Shelburne Road near an intersection with Fayette Drive when the crash occurred.

Leading up to the crash, the affidavit stated, Kapitanski had YouTube videos playing on a computer tablet mounted in his cruiser. A review of that device showed “several” YouTube web addresses accessed between 2:29 a.m. and 2:40 a.m, the court document stated.
Also, the review by investigators stated there was “no evidence of user interaction” with the device during that time period. The crash took place at about 2:40 a.m.
The investigator’s review found that the last web browser video “appeared visually consistent” with what was shown on Kapitanski’s body-worn camera, the affidavit stated.
A link to the last video was provided in the filing and it was titled, “Trans woman CONFRONTING Matt Walsh takes UNEXPECTED turn.” 
David Sleigh, an attorney representing Kapitanski, contended there was no proof his client was distracted while driving by videos. 
The misdemeanor charge Kapitanski pleaded guilty to was based on Kapitanski’s speed above the posted limit, according to the prosecution.   
State police said the roadway where the crash took place was wet at the time of the crash from rain.
Hayes had been seen in a video taken from a nearby business standing within the roadway but near the curb with his bicycle that had been towing a trailer, according to court documents.
A police affidavit also stated it appeared Hayes was adjusting the bicycle and trailer before he started walking southbound along with the bicycle when Kapitanski’s cruiser struck him.
Hayes’ estate has brought a civil lawsuit against the town of Shelburne in connection with the fatal crash. 
Kapitanski was placed on paid leave following the crash from his job with the Shelburne Police Department. His status with the police department was not immediately clear Thursday.

The idea is that they can take the place of law […],"Gov. Glenn Youngkin listens to featured speakers during the two year anniversary of the Right Help, Right Now mental health support initiative on Dec. 11, 2024.  Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryValley Health in Winchester is piloting a program that can test the effectiveness of a new avenue in Virginia’s mental health resources landscape. 
Special Conservators of the Peace are armed and unarmed professional personnel authorized by courts to carry out limited law enforcement duties. The idea is that they can take the place of law enforcement officers to accompany people in mental health crises to hospitals. Having launched mid-August, Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated the new program on Wednesday.
Sometimes in mental health crises where a person is at a high risk of harming themselves or others, law enforcement is ordered to step in. Patients are escorted to hospitals for evaluations, but this takes time and in some cases, law enforcement officers’ presence can further agitate someone in a vulnerable mental state. This is where Virginia’s new SCOPs program comes in.
The pilot is a piece of Youngkin’s Right Help, Right Now initiative, as SCOPs are part of the puzzle of responding to mental health issues in Virginia. 
“We are ensuring patients in crisis receive compassionate care in the right environment while working side-by-side with law enforcement to keep our communities safe,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Valley Health is demonstrating the impact of this model, and together we are building a stronger, more responsive system for the Commonwealth.” 
Between Youngkin’s plan and numerous legislation by lawmakers predating his tenure as governor, Virginia has been able to create mobile crisis units of trained clinicians that can respond alongside or instead of law enforcement, rolled out a substance abuse online resource hub, and supported the 988 crisis hotline. Virginia’s Behavioral Health Commission also routinely meets to study and make recommendations for improving programs. 
For the SCOP proposal, Youngkin teased the idea last December when presenting his budget plans for 2025. The goal then had been to invest $35 million of the state budget into that workforce. Though resources like 988 and mobile crisis units can prevent someone from needing to go to a hospital, Youngkin believes the conservators can help improve outcomes of people who are taken to hospitals by law enforcement.
Often, it’s law enforcement officers that are the first responders and they escort people to get medical care rather than putting them in jail. Other times, people might be subject to emergency custody orders — when a magistrate deems someone could be a harm to themselves or others and need to be evaluated by health professionals. 
Consensus has been building that officers and deputies aren’t always the best people to take point or remain with people in crisis for long periods of time. Smaller police departments in rural areas have also argued these duties take officers out of traditional patrols or away from other emergencies they could be responding to instead.
“Not only should there be less police interactions with someone who’s going through a crisis, but when you’re looking at rural areas such as the county where I’m from and small police departments throughout the region, then taking just one person off patrol can hurt a community,” Tazewell County Sheriff Brian Hieatt said at an event late last year. 
The concept will be further tested through  the new program at Valley Health. Since its launch on Aug. 19, Valley Health SCOPs have already supported 10 people. A press release about the program estimated that over 97 hours of law enforcement officer time was saved by having SCOPs step in. The program is expected to reach 24/7 operation by the end of this year. 
A $1.1 million dollar contract with the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services is supporting the program. Overall, it can fund up to 18 full-time SCOPs, two special transport vehicles and additional drivers. 
State officials are optimistic about the idea. 
DBHDS Commissioner Nelson Smith said that the program “allows (officers) to get back to their community and provides a more therapeutic experience in our crisis system.”

The registered nurses at Northern Maine Medical Center in Fort Kent and at Houlton Regional Hospital overwhelmingly voted to authorize their bargaining teams to call a strike if the issues raised in contract negotiations aren’t resolved, according to a news release from the Maine State Nurses Association Thursday morning. 
There are no dates set for a strike at this point.
“We are fighting for patient safety and the ability to recruit and retain nurses at our hospital,” said Brad Martinez, a registered nurse in the emergency room and bargaining team member in Fort Kent. 
Report warns hospitals in Aroostook, Ellsworth face imminent risk of closure due to Medicaid cuts

Since his team has been at the bargaining table for 16 months, Martinez also said, “We should be much closer to a deal. Nurses voted to strike because the administration at NMMC has not addressed our concerns about safe staffing and fair pay.”
The nurses at both facilities are represented by Maine State Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee. Fort Kent nurses voted to join the organization in January 2024. 
While Fort Kent nurses are negotiating for their first contract, the last contract in Houlton expired in November 2024. Houlton nurses are similarly frustrated with the lack of progress in bargaining as they seek to address the same issues of safe staffing, recruitment and retention, and fair pay. 
Neither hospital responded to a request for comment by publication.
In April, Houlton nurses also spoke out against the planned closure of the labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum unit. Houlton Regional is one of five hospitals in Maine that have shut down their labor and delivery units since 2020, leaving expectant mothers in wide swaths of the state without local maternity care. 
“If a strike is what it takes for the voices of nurses to be heard, then so be it,” said Brooke Howland, a registered nurse in acute care at Houlton Regional and a bargaining team member. “Our administration could settle this contract now. We encourage them to do so.”
This comes as a new national report warns that sweeping Medicaid cuts recently signed into federal law could push hundreds of hospitals across the country to the brink of closure — and Maine’s rural hospitals are among the most vulnerable.

“Unfortunately, with the loss of federal funding, there is no way around the need for significant budget reductions,” Shae Hopkins, KET’s executive director and CEO said in a statement. “It is a sad but unavoidable situation for our dedicated team, and the loss will affect operations throughout the agency.”
In July, Republicans in Congress, at President Donald Trump’s urging, eliminated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and rescinded more than $1 billion that Congress already had approved for public broadcasters such as KET.
At the time, KET said $4.2 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting had paid for the majority of its local productions and 25% of its workforce.
The staff cuts announced Thursday include the layoff of 15 individuals. The network also eliminated another 21 positions that had been held vacant in anticipation of possible federal funding cuts.
After the reduction in force, KET’s workforce will number 122.

The first tipoff was a transfer of liquor licenses.
KUOO Radio in Dickinson County reported Aug. 14 that city councils in Okoboji and Spirit Lake had approved liquor licenses for Mega Saver, a convenience store chain in the Omaha area with some Florida locations. The license locations were gas stations for Kum & Go, a Des Moines-based chain that was acquired by Salt Lake City-based Maverik in 2023. Maverik announced this summer that it would rebrand all Kum & Go locations in the country and cut the Iowa administrative staff it inherited to “a limited presence.”
Days later, convenience store trade publication Mass Market Retailers picked up KUOO’s report. Then C-Store Dive got more details: Maverik was selling 20 locations in Iowa and three in Sioux Falls to Mega Saver, following the June sale of three Omaha locations. However, neither C-Store Dive nor CSP Daily News mentioned which Iowa Kum & Go stations were being sold.
The conversion of certain Kum & Go locations to Mega Saver has not been widely publicized. The discovery that the Kum & Go at the intersection of Blairs Ferry Road and Lindale Drive in Marion was closed Aug. 26 for such a conversion precipitated an inquiry through public records.
A list was compiled by cross-referencing Kum & Go’s 96-location Iowa list, which has yet to have any removed, with Maverik’s rebranding timeline. The locations not on the latter list were followed up by looking for city council meetings where liquor licenses for Mega Saver were approved. Then a better reference was located: the Iowa Lottery’s list of active retailers. In the last week of August, only five locations remained with Kum & Go as the licensee of record, and three of those were double-listed with Mega Saver. The 20 stores becoming Mega Savers have new identification numbers in sequential order. A dozen of them are in Polk and Dallas counties.


The 20 locations changing from Kum & Go to Mega Saver are:

The sole sites in Adel, Altoona, Okoboji, Polk City, Spirit Lake, and Winterset, and both in Marion
Ames: 3111 S. Duff Ave. (1 of 6 in the city)
Ankeny: 1825 N. Ankeny Blvd., 1025 E 1st St. (2 of 6)
Cedar Rapids: 2604 16th Ave. SW (1 of 4)
Clear Lake: 2005 U.S. Highway 18 E. (1 of 2)
Des Moines: 6304 SW 9th St. (1 of 7)
Grimes: 1880 SE Princeton Dr. (1 of 2)
Johnston: 5800 Northglenn Dr., 6130 NW 86th St. (2 of 3)
Urbandale: 12041 Douglas Pkwy., 4585 156th St., 4860 NW Urbandale Dr. (3 of 5)

A phone call to the De Soto gas station, one of the two locations listed by the Iowa Lottery only under Kum & Go, revealed that that location will become a Casey’s in the fall. The remaining Kum & Go in Grimes does not know its future status yet.
Until this change, Mega Saver’s only Iowa locations were in Council Bluffs. There are four there, two of which opened after January 2024. The Mega Saver at Abbott Drive and Avenue H is not in Carter Lake, despite what Google Maps shows. From the railroad tracks north to Carter Lake (the lake), there is a thin sliver of land west of Abbott Drive that is part of Omaha.
Mega Saver’s website says it was founded in 2002 and is “recognized as one of the top cell phone and accessory retailers in Nebraska.” It will have more Iowa locations (24) than QuikTrip (19), which is exclusively in Polk County.
Maverik rebranding timeline
Iowa’s first rebranded Maverik opened July 22 at the Neola exit off I-80 in western Iowa, with Adair following a day later. Right now, locations in the Des Moines metro are cycling through the 84-hour closure periods and scheduled to wrap up Oct. 21. Changes will come to the Iowa City area at the end of October, then Cedar Rapids and Ames in early November. The final Kum & Go stations in Iowa will be phased out of Sioux City in mid-November. The last two, in Sloan and on Gordon Drive in Sioux City, will close Nov. 17 and reopen Nov. 21.
The first Kum & Go opened in Hampton in 1959. In recent decades, nearly all the chain’s Iowa locations have been confined to large metro areas or freeway exits.

As of this month, 12 states, mostly Republican and in the South, have opted to limit SNAP recipients from purchasing foods such as soda and candy. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)COLUMBIA — South Carolinians would no longer be able to buy candy, sodas and other sugary drinks with government grocery benefits under a proposal released Thursday.
The request by Gov. Henry McMaster is part of the Trump administration’s “make America healthy again” initiative, which invited states to apply for waivers that limit how people can use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. A dozen other states have already received approval on their plans.
“This request is a light-touch, common-sense approach that ensures these federal taxpayer dollars are being used to help families purchase healthy, nutritious food – not unhealthy candy and sugary drinks,” McMaster said in a news release.
His executive order, issued Thursday, instructs the Department of Social Services to officially submit a request for the waiver within the next two weeks. If that application is rejected, the department should continue trying until the federal government accepts the state’s plan, McMaster said.
In South Carolina, items excluded should include energy drinks, candy bars and beverages sweetened with 5 grams or more of added sugar, such as ready-made lemonade, tea and sweetened coffee, according to the executive order.
Some senators attempted to add a similar restriction to the state budget, but it failed to get enough votes.
The specifics of what should or shouldn’t be excluded from purchase became a point of contention among senators. Some asked: Does honey count? What about granola bars, which often use honey to hold the other ingredients together? Or sports drinks, which contain helpful electrolytes along with sugar?
The governor’s plan specifies that granola bars and protein bars could still be bought with SNAP benefits. So could juices, as long as they’re at least half natural fruit or vegetable juice with no added sweeteners. Sports drinks would also still be allowed, according to the news release.
What would not be allowed are energy drinks, defined as beverages containing at least 65 milligrams of caffeine per 8 fluid ounces that are marketed as increasing mental or physical energy.
The application will define candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or other ingredients in the form of bars, drops, or pieces.”
When Gov. Nikki Haley made a similar move to restrict what SNAP benefits could buy in 2013, senators responded by adding a clause to the state budget that would prohibit the Governor’s Mansion from stocking junk food. (Haley changed her mind about the idea after receiving pushback in public meetings across the state.)
Sen. Darrell Jackson, a Columbia Democrat, repeated his proposal this time around.
“If it’s good for the poor people of Williamsburg County, it better be good for the people who live on Richland Street in the governor’s mansion,” Jackson said during the budget debate.

(Photo by Megan Gleason / Source NM)U.S. senators from New Mexico, Colorado and Idaho introduced legislation Wednesday to increase funds for local partnerships to prevent water pollution and restore watersheds.
The Headwater Protection act, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Colorado Democratic Sens. Micheal Bennet and John Hickenlooper and Idaho Republican Sens. Mike Crapo and James Risch, will increase funding for two U.S. Forest Service programs.
The bill, if passed, would triple the yearly funding for the Water Source Protection Program for the U.S. Forest Service in order to provide more than $30 million per year for farmers, ranchers, water utilities and local and tribal governments for restoring forests or cleaning up watersheds. The legislation would prioritize giving funds to projects to improve drinking water quality and harden forested areas to wildfire and climate change.
New Mexico is still reeling from the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, the state’s largest wildfire, which burned more than 485 square miles in Northern New Mexico. On Tuesday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham authorized more emergency funding for flood damages in Mora County and Las Vegas residents have had to drink bottled water for months as the city still tries to recover drinking water supplies since the fire.

Luján said in a statement that the introduced legislation would allow acequias — New Mexico irrigation systems — and land grant-mercedes (areas of land granted by either Spanish or Mexican governments) to apply for these funds for the first time.
“Water is essential to the health and safety of our communities. Protecting and improving our watersheds is critical to ensuring reliable access to clean drinking water and making our forests more resilient against wildfires,” Luján said. “The Headwaters Protection Act will strengthen these efforts by investing in watershed management and pollution prevention.”
A second provision in the bill would require the U.S. Forest Service to update its manual for restoring watersheds and require national forests to be managed to prevent further degradation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-04 14:38:26+00:00,CT Mirror,It would cost CT billions to help very low-income renters secure homes,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/ct-low-income-renters-study/,"Nearly 240,000 renter families in CT are considered very low or extremely low income, and only about 50,000 of them receive rental assistance.","It would cost more than $2 billion for Connecticut’s Rental Assistance Program (RAP) to provide for every income-eligible family.
A new study by housing advocacy nonprofit, Partnership for Strong Communities, analyzes the level of housing assistance needed in Connecticut and what demand the RAP meets.
Nearly 240,000 renter families in Connecticut are considered very low or extremely low income, meaning their incomes do not exceed 50% or 30% of the Area Median Income (AMI), respectively.
Only about 50,000 of those families receive any form of rental assistance, according to the report, leaving more than 175,000 families without any aid.
To serve every income-eligible family under RAP, it would cost Connecticut about $2.5 billion, according to the report.
Sean Ghio, policy director with the Partnership, said the report is not calling on Connecticut to invest that much into the program. Rather, it lays out the scope of the state’s affordability crisis.
“Putting that number in the context of housing insecurity, family insecurity, educational consequences, economic consequences to the state,” Ghio said. “I think it’s really just, it’s another measure that shows the depth of the crisis.”
The report also considers the impact of smaller economic investments into RAP. Increasing the number of households served under RAP by 10%, or more than 600 families, would cost the state about $9 million annually.
Connecticut’s RAP provides housing vouchers for about 6,500 families, ensuring they pay no more than 40% of their monthly income on housing costs.
The goal of the report is to determine how much it would cost the state to care for every income eligible family under RAP, according to Samaila Adelaiye, the study’s author.
“It also speaks to the fact that, this is how large a problem this is based on policies like the under production of affordable housing across the state,” Adelaiye said.
In the most recent legislative session, state lawmakers approved an $18 million boost to RAP and several hundred additional vouchers for families with children, senior renters or families with disabilities.
However, with rising rent and inflation, the funding isn’t stretching as far and providing for as many families as it used to.
The issue comes back to increasing affordable housing production and ways to make existing housing more affordable for renters, Adelaiye said.
“More funding for the voucher program is always a good thing, right? More people are going to be impacted by this, or are going to have access to safe, secure and affordable housing through this,” Adelaiye said. “However, I think we always want to go back to the fact that if there’s long-term more housing development, more affordable housing development is key.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Hundreds of University of South Carolina professors packed a campus theater to hear from college leadership — many for the first time — on the involvement of the state’s largest university system in a new college accrediting commission under development in Florida.
It was standing room only in the 300-seat Russell House theater Wednesday during an event to introduce new faculty members — a meeting that in the past has been sparsely attended by the school’s nearly 1,800 teaching faculty.
Most were there to hear from the chairman of the school’s governing board, Thad Westbrook, about USC’s partnership with state schools in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas to form the new Commission for Public Higher Education.
Politics and higher education
Republicans have billed the commission as a way to end “woke indoctrination” on the campuses of the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system, as well as USC.
USC joins DeSantis’ push to create new university accreditor to ‘upend’ ‘woke accreditation cartels’

While the board chairman has sidestepped politics in explaining what drew USC to this new partnership, those sentiments by politicians, including Gov. Henry McMaster, are what caused major consternation among the professors in attendance Wednesday.
Those who spoke worried what it could mean for their ability to teach and conduct research related in any way to race, gender, climate science and other matters that have morphed into a political football in recent years.
“I know there’s been political rhetoric around it, and some politicians have talked about it,” Westbrook said. “I would hope that there’s nothing political related to (Commission for Public Higher Education.)”
The comment earned mocking laughter and groans of disbelief from the crowd. Someone shouted “come on” while others whispered under their breath that the new organization was a farce.
Westbrook stood behind the podium quietly absorbing the criticism and waiting for the murmurs to die down before continuing.
If politics are involved, he said, “that’s a problem for higher education.”
‘No where near the final exam’
Westbrook spoke for about 10 minutes, offering some new details not previously publicized, before fielding questions from faculty for the remainder of the hour.
This fall, 10 schools are expected to take part in the commission’s initial round of pre-accreditation.
The organization must complete this before the U.S. Department of Education will fully recognize it as an accreditor. No USC system schools are in that initial batch, Westbrook said, and the full approval process with federal regulators will take at least two years.
The soonest a USC school would even consider seeking accreditation through the new organization would be 2029, when USC Beaufort is up for renewal.
Until then, USC will gauge the experience of the other schools before making a final decision.
“The bottom line is it’s very early in this process, and we’re not at a point where we’re ready to make a decision,” Westbrook said.
“We’re nowhere near the final exam,” he added, making an analogy to college coursework.
‘Judge us by our record’
About 20 professors lined up along both aisles of the theater waiting for what would be their first opportunity to ask a board member directly about the effort.
Each received loud applause and head nods from their colleagues after voicing their questions and airing their concerns. Westbrook waited each time for the noise to stop and answered questions from all who came to the microphones.
Mindy Fenske, an English professor, asked about the commission’s business plan, which calls for member schools to contribute $4 million each.
Westbrook responded that the commission has not yet asked USC for funds.
Questions from others — Kirk Randazzo, a political science professor; education professor Susi Long; English professor Mark Minett; and Bret Kloos, a psychology professor — followed similar themes.
All raised concerns about whether their subject matter might be construed as “woke” or categorized as diversity, equity and inclusion and therefore face restrictions. They worried about the university’s independence from outside influence. They called it risky to go from a long-established accreditor to one that’s untested.
And Laura Brashears, a sociology professor, pointed to vague language in the first draft of 24 proposed accreditation standards the new organization began circulating last month. She said they call for faculty with a “diversity of viewpoints” without defining what that means and how it will be measured.
Westbrook repeatedly tried to allay fears, suggesting USC’s board has steered away from heavy-handed policies on diversity, equity and inclusion or denial of tenure to those who teach controversial subjects, as seen in other states.
“I know there is a national conversation going on,” Westbrook said to one speaker. “I would ask you just to judge us by our record.”
“We here at the university, we’ve done anything we can to protect academic freedom. I haven’t seen anything we’ve done as an institution to impact what you’re teaching,” he replied to another.
“Those are things that are not happening in South Carolina,” he said again.
Westbrook also encouraged the professors to provide feedback on the draft standards, which are open for public comment through Sept. 16.
How it started and changes to come
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the proposal for the new accreditation agency in June. Referring to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which accredits schools across the Southeast, DeSantis blasted what he called the “woke accreditation cartel,” which has been “hijacked by radical ideology.”
On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump called accreditation his “secret weapon” in reshaping higher education to end what he considers ideological bias.
In April, he signed an executive order to expedite the federal approval of new accreditors, which is what the Commission for Public Higher Education is relying on for its own process. The order also threatens to suspend accreditors that take into account a college’s diversity programs.
Asked whether the USC board was unhappy with the current accreditation under Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Westbrook repeated past statements that the process is “overly burdensome.”
He went on to tell the crowd that the southeastern accreditor recently came under new leadership and the recently hired president, Stephen Pruitt, has told the USC board his organization is working on making its own changes.
More information on those changes is expected later this month.

(Photo by Michael M.

Juan Manuel Lopez-Campos, who has lived in the United States for 26 years and has no criminal record, was arrested during a traffic stop in June and held for more than two months without a bond hearing.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed a lawsuit on his behalf, resulting in a late August ruling by U.S. District Judge Brandy R. McMillion that a Trump-era directive to deny bond hearings to certain immigrants was “not only wrong but also fundamentally unfair.” McMillion was appointed by President Joe Biden. 
Lopez-Campos was released Wednesday.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I am happy to finally be with my family with the help of my legal team,” he said in a statement released by the ACLU. “I hope to continue to fight my case.”
The directive, issued in July by the Trump administration, sought to reverse longstanding policy by eliminating access to bond hearings for immigrants in civil detention. Legal experts said the rule, if left in place, would have subjected individuals to mandatory detention without judicial review for months or even years.
“We are thrilled that Juan gets to go home to his family while his immigration case proceeds. It was not only illegal, but inhumane, to keep locked up this longtime Detroit resident, who has close ties to his family, community and church. Justice was served,” Ramis J. Wadood, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan, said. 
However, Wadood said hundreds, if not thousands, of other immigrants are still being wrongly denied their legal rights.
“Because of that, we will not rest until every affected individual is allowed to exercise the same right to due process and has a chance to come home to their families,” Wadood asserted.
Lopez-Campos was among more than 1,400 immigrants arrested in Michigan by federal agents since President Donald Trump began his second term in January, vowing to “launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out.”
Most of those arrested had no criminal convictions according to records compiled by the Deportation Data Project.
Shahad Atiya, Lopez-Campos’s attorney who worked with the ACLU on the case, said the government had “no legitimate reason” to keep him detained.
“The cruelty was the point, but we’re glad that justice prevailed,” Atiya said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 10:56:44.593403

""The Charles is a beloved resource. People should be able to use it without worrying about getting sick. As our climate changes and it gets hotter, people should be able to swim there.”
The post Full of crap: Climate change could cause more sewage pollution for rivers, lakes, and beaches appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ON A NICE sunny day in Boston, there are usually people out on the Charles River sailing, kayaking, paddleboarding, canoeing, rowing – coming into contact with the water. You’ll likely find children playing, tourists taking a scenic tour around the river to enjoy a view of Boston, and groups of people learning how to sail. 
It looks idyllic and a far cry from the “dirty water” that the Standells sang about Boston in 1966. It’s even come a long way since former Gov. William Weld jumped face-first and fully clothed into the murky water in 1995 as a vote of confidence in the cleanliness of the river. 
But even on those picturesque sunny days when people are enjoying the river, it’s possible that there is still sewage in the water – especially after heavy rainstorms. 
The Greater Boston area has parts of a legacy combined sewer system where both wastewater and stormwater are collected in shared pipes, and during heavy rains, excess flow bypasses the treatment centers where it is supposed to be cleaned. Instead, it is discharged into local water bodies to prevent backups into people’s homes. 
In 1985, the federal government ordered the Greater Boston area to end wastewater pollution of Boston Harbor and its tributaries, including the Charles and Mystic Rivers. Since then, many combined sewer overflow sites – where wastewater is discharged – have been closed. The average annual average discharge volume from combined sewer overflows into the Charles River basin has decreased by 98 percent since 1988. 
Despite major progress, more than 40 combined sewer overflow sites along the Charles, Mystic, Alewife Brook, and Boston Harbor persist – partly because addressing them comes with more complicated engineering challenges and therefore higher costs. Climate change is expected to double or even quadruple the volume of overflow that is dumped into these water bodies by 2050, according to projections from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, and the cities of Cambridge and Somerville. These three entities are collaborating on a draft plan – due this December – to address the remaining sites, balancing the rising overflow risks with the significant costs of remediation.
In the meantime, advocates for eliminating the combined sewer overflow sites entirely – including the river watershed associations – are pushing for the plan to be ambitious, while others are pushing for a plan that prioritizes affordability. 
“If this new long-term control plan just has some sort of incremental reductions or makes things a little bit better, that’s going to be a big problem because climate change will just reverse those efforts,” said Julie Wood, climate resilience director at the Charles River Watershed Association. “We’d like to see essentially the combined sewer overflows eliminated because that’s really the only way you won’t start to go backwards.”
Wood’s nonprofit is running a campaign with the slogan “Cut the Crap” with poop emojis on posters and costumes to get raw sewage out of the Charles. They have put up signs on MBTA trains and a large banner on the pedestrian bridge over the Massachusetts Turnpike in Allston. 
“We need to end this problem,” said Wood. “The Charles is a beloved resource. People should be able to use it without worrying about getting sick. As our climate changes and it gets hotter, people should be able to swim there.”
At a public meeting in January, the MWRA, Somerville, and Cambridge presented several proposals to tackle the remaining overflows. The projects presented have timelines that span 40 to 50 years and could cost up to $4 billion, depending on which alternative is chosen. 
Matt Romero, the head of the MWRA advisory board, called for an approach that would be the least cost to sewage ratepayers.
“If we could wave a magic wand and make all the combined sewer overflows disappear, we obviously would,” said Romero. “But we live in the real world. And these are real dollars from real families and real rate payers. What we really need to always take into account is looking at what level of control [over the combined sewer overflows] that is going to be the right balance for the dollars that are being spent.”
Wood said that it is possible that funding for the remaining combined sewer overflows can be secured from sources other than ratepayers like state-issued bonds. 

In July, wastewater flowed into the Charles twice, and both occurred during rainfalls with less than an inch of rain. On August 14, there was another alert that wastewater went into the river.
Mark Jacobson, vice president of Charles River Recreation, which rents boats on the Charles and Mystic, offers boating classes on both rivers including a class that teaches people how to turn a kayak right side up if it capsizes. That involves being fully submerged in the water.
He said that overflow events and poor water quality caused by cyanobacteria have meant his company had to turn customers away and reschedule bookings. 
Jacobson said he sees people out on the river the next day after overflow events. Public health officials recommend avoiding contact with contaminated water for 48 hours after an overflow event because there might still be a risk of bacteria and other pollutants.   
“Very few people know about combined sewer overflows,” said Jacobson. “People figure that this is many years after the Clean Water Act and are surprised. They really don’t expect that that’s happening in Massachusetts in 2025.”
Even with the occasional overflows, the Charles River is a relatively clean body of water in comparison with other places around the state. Across Massachusetts, there are about 190 remaining overflow sites, and many are located within lower-income communities. In the municipalities that have an overflow site, 85 percent of the total population lives within an environmental justice area, according to the Department of Environmental Protection
Research has shown that exposure to waterbodies following combined sewer overflow events can result in public health issues. A 2024 study focusing on the Merrimack Valley, an area with more than 30 remaining combined sewer overflow sites, found that these events are linked to an increase in emergency department visits due to acute gastrointestinal illness. 
Nathan Sanders, a data scientist affiliated with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, has done research on how low-income communities face an increased risk of exposure to sewage. He points out that other parts of the state haven’t made nearly the progress that the Charles has.
 “There are many more water bodies, beaches, rivers, and lakes, around Massachusetts that don’t yet enjoy the same water quality that the Charles does,” said Sanders. “Environmental justice communities experience a significantly higher burden of sewage pollution than comparable watersheds that have whiter and richer and more English-speaking demographics. That is the state of things today after having a decade of really substantial investment into controlling sewage pollution. And so that’s what I think needs to change.”
The state tried to address the lack of public information in 2021 with a law that required the operators of the combined sewer overflow sites to notify the public with alerts when untreated sewage is released into the water. Through that law, the state began collecting more robust data on combined sewer overflow events in mid-2022 and compiling an annual report.
In 2023, which was a particularly rainy year, there were 606 overflow events where 2,847 million gallons of untreated sewage were dumped into water bodies across the Commonwealth. In 2024, there were far fewer events – 137 overflows – and 1,948 million gallons dumped. 
Rep. Greg Schwartz of Newton and Rep. David Rogers of Cambridge have sponsored a bill that would require all owners of combined sewer systems to eliminate all combined overflows into the state’s waterways by the year 2050. 
“This is not a problem that is going to go away,” said Schwartz, who also enjoys boating on the Charles. “While we’ve had some success in reducing the large amount of the combined sewer overflow problem, it still exists in many of our rivers and waterways. It’s only going to get worse with the climate change impact on weather and specifically rainfall.”
According to Schwartz, setting a 25-year goal of elimination is important to get momentum behind addressing the public health impacts of combined sewer overflows.
“We should be setting our sights and aspirations to achieve a future where we can actually be confident that people will not have to avoid the water when it’s hot, and if they do go boating or swimming, they don’t have to end up in an emergency room,” said Schwartz.

Courtesy of the Office of the State Auditor.Minnesota State Auditor Julie Blaha announced Thursday that she won’t seek reelection for a third term.
The state auditor oversees local government finances and aids law enforcement in investigating financial crimes. Blaha, a Democrat, was first elected in 2018 and narrowly won her reelection bid in 2022. Her departure creates an open race for a constitutional office next year.
Blaha in a statement said when she first assumed office that the state auditor was “under attack” because funding cuts had gutted office staff.
“I’ve had the honor of serving as Minnesota’s state auditor,” Blaha said. “My goals were to rebuild an office that was under attack and protect Minnesotans’ rights to make decisions in their local communities. I am proud to have accomplished those goals.”
The state auditor position has frequently been used as a jumping off point for elected officials to seek higher office. Former Govs. Arne Carlson and Mark Dayton served as state auditor.
Minnesota Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, told Axios that he will seek the DFL nomination to replace Blaha. Republican Rep. Elliott Engen of White Bear Township said he was “heavily” considering running for auditor.

(Photos: Barrick 2024 Annual Report; 	iStock Editorial / Getty Images Plus)Congratulations to Barrick, Newmont, and lesser lights in Nevada’s historic folkloric gold mining industry. 
The price of gold is setting all-time records, soaring north of $3,600 an ounce this week. It broke the $3,500 mark for the first time on Friday. The price has increased by more than 30% since January.
Why has the price of gold been on a months-long upward surge?
The same reason the price of gold surged after 9-11, during the Great Recession, and in the pandemic.
Gold is often viewed by investors as a port in a storm, a “safe haven” investment during chaotic times. 
In other words, gold’s skyrocketing price is thanks to Trump.
No, not because Trump’s driving up the price of gold by hoovering up oodles of it to make the Oval Office  look like, as Jack White put it, “a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy professional wrestler’s dressing room.”
Trump is to thank for gold’s price surge, precious metal markets researcher Adrian Ash with BoullionVault explained to the BBC earlier this week, because of  “what he’s done to geopolitics” and “what he’s done to global trade.”
And Trump, ever the ambitious one, is not content with creating economic chaos, confusion, and uncertainty with petulantly pronounced tariffs while disintegrating alliances among capitalist democracies. He’s also hell-bent on destroying what is sometimes called the “exorbitant privilege” afforded the United States by having the dominant currency on planet Earth. 
If Trump successfully reduces the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors from an independent entity into just another random collection of Trump toadies and bootlickers on the government dole, that promises to undermine the credibility and stability of what has been the world’s most credible and stable currency since at least the end of World War II.
The ensuing financial system upheaval would wreak havoc not only on the U.S. economy, but the planet’s. (And no, crypto will not save you.)
An unstable, helter-skelter tyrant flirting with global economic mayhem? That’s the sort of prospect that prompts some investors to buy gold. Even at today’s prices.
Las Vegas, the home of nothing if not faith in branding
That’s also the sort of prospect that can prompt consumers to hunker down.
Neither the independence of the Federal Reserve nor the price of gold may be on the minds of the 12% of the traveling world that, if Las Vegas visitor volume had matched last summer’s, would have come to Las Vegas this summer, but didn’t.
But sometimes there is a wisdom of crowds. 
And a 12% drop in visitor volume sounds like a crowd might know something’s wrong. Or at least suspect as much.
A common narrative holds that Las Vegas visitor volume and other economic indicators are down because prices and junk fees charged to tourists are way up. There’s almost certainly some truth to that; willingness of industry to overdo it in the course of gouging customers should never be underestimated.
But that narrative, both on social media and in more traditional venues, is sometimes presented as a sole culprit, as if to focus on a problem that can be remedied locally, so as to reassure the traveling and touristing public that Las Vegas gets it, and that the always and ever innovative and adaptive Las Vegas is fixing it.
At the same time, the narrative diverts attention away from the malignant force causing prices and fees to now seem even more onerous: The guy who’s been smearing cheesy gold  tchotchkes and geegaws on every available surface in the Oval Office. 
It’s almost as if Las Vegas, the home of nothing if not faith in advertising, believes it only needs to get the messaging just right.  Then the rest of the country, and the world, somehow won’t notice Trump poses a threat to to the economy on a scale comparable to the hardships inflicted by 9-11, the Great Recession, or the pandemic. If only Las Vegas can devise clever enough branding — or so the narrative goes — instead of watching their wallets, tourists from Temecula to Tokyo — maybe even Toronto (but probably not) — will open their wallets to come to Las Vegas and eat and gamble and see the Sphere.
The two culprits — “it’s a Trump slump” vs. “it’s junk fees” — are not an either/or. The Las Vegas resort industry is souring its own brand. And Trump is freaking people out. Both can be true.
In fact, not only are they not mutually exclusive. They’re working in a toxic tandem to erode the Las Vegas tourism market.
Good luck
Las Vegas is more an echo or indicator of the national economy than a significant contributor to it. If and when the economy crashes around Nevadans’ shoes again, the Las Vegas economy will once again be at the mercy of the national economy, and forced to await a national recovery. As in prior economic collapses, help from state and local governments will be grossly inadequate. Nevada state and local government is deliberately designed to be impotent in a crisis. 
The federal government came to the rescue of both the state and its people during the last economic crisis. 
That doesn’t seem very, well, Trumpy, since Trump obviously has no intention of acknowledging the economy — his economy — is anything other than practically perfect in every way. (Occasional reminder: If Trump really wanted a good economy, he would have left it alone.)
Trump has floated the idea of giving people checks, signed by him of course, from revenue generated by U.S. businesses now paying historically steep import taxes that Trump unilaterally and unconstitutionally imposed on them while self-described anti-tax Republicans in Nevada and the nation quietly curled up in fetal positions.
If and when Trump sends people checks emblazoned with his big beautiful signature, rest assured those checks will be smaller than the benefits every family was receiving under the expanded child tax credit program in 2021 that cut child poverty in the U.S. in half. 
But c’mon. Cutting child poverty? Why even bring that up? Whatever a majority of Nevada voters were thinking about when they decided it would be fun to elect Oswald Cobblepot president, it wasn’t child poverty.
Meanwhile, no matter how bad things get, remember, at least there’s a tax deduction on tipped earnings. For two whole years! That should provide some comfort to the small (and presumably getting smaller) minority of higher paid tipped workers who actually earn enough to qualify for a noticeable tax benefit.
Maybe the tiny proportion of the Nevada workforce employed at gold mines will travel to Las Vegas, and tip.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-9-3-25-at-8.39 PM-1-1024x619.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 09:56:16.130846

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Hundreds of people were ticketed or arrested during a state-funded saturation patrol that put 15 additional state troopers on the streets of South Dakota’s largest city last week.
The troopers labored from Aug. 27 through Aug. 29 under the banner of “Operation Prairie Thunder,” a two-pronged public safety initiative announced in July by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden.
One part of the operation, branded with a caricature of a buffalo with a badge on its hat and lightning bolts on its sunglasses, involved Rhoden directing six members of the South Dakota National Guard to process deportation arrest paperwork for the seven Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents stationed in the state. That prong of the public safety platform also included an agreement between the state Department of Corrections and ICE to help the federal agency sniff out immigrant inmates without legal status in the state’s prisons.
South Dakota National Guard troops begin processing immigration paperwork for ICE

Guard troops in Sioux Falls and Rapid City began their work last month; the Corrections Department turned 10 migrants, paroled in mid-August, over to ICE agents for removal from the U.S.
The other prong of Rhoden’s plan put additional Highway Patrol resources on tap for Sioux Falls, whose metro area is home to nearly a third of South Dakota’s residents. 
Calls for service in the city have grown significantly since 2015, as has the population. The 16 homicides in the city last year were the most in its history.
The Sioux Falls Police Department’s statistics show its overall per capita violent crime rate fell in 2024, however, the year covered by the department’s most recently published annual report. That year, the city had fewer aggravated assaults, stolen vehicles, burglaries and fraud cases than 2023. Narcotics arrests rose slightly from 2023 to 2024, and police seized more narcotics by weight — the largest jump was in grams of Fentanyl seized — but the number of drug arrests was 700 below its 2019 peak. 
The late August saturation patrol is the first of what will be two per month for the next five months. After that point, Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight this week, “we’ll reevaluate” the city’s need for additional assistance.
Troopers made 174 drug arrests during the first patrol, 44 of which involved felony-level drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine. The governor said 32 of the felony arrests involved methamphetamine, and troopers served 24 outstanding felony warrants on people stopped by troopers during the operation.
“All in all, this was a very successful first saturation patrol,” Rhoden said.
A Highway Patrol helicopter was used to track a vehicle during one of three pursuits.  
The patrol didn’t focus on immigration, Rhoden said, but troopers logged 14 ICE “encounters,” eight of which resulted in ICE arrests.
The state’s involvement with ICE drew criticism from people at a Sioux Falls City Council meeting last month, and Democratic state lawmakers derided the operation as a misguided use of state resources. At the time of the announcement, Rhoden said the Highway Patrol would absorb the costs.
The patrol’s 287(g) agreement with ICE allows troopers to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally. Col. Casey Collins of the Highway Patrol told South Dakota Searchlight in a Wednesday email that ICE can check the legal status of a person suspected of lacking legal status without physically coming to the scene of a traffic stop. 
“No subjects were detained beyond the scope of the traffic stop without an arrest,” said Collins.
Some of the six people whose legal status was questioned during a traffic stop — but who were not arrested by ICE — were later detained on state charges, Collins said.
“Identifying a subject is normal procedure during a traffic stop where a violation has occurred and enforcement action is being taken,” Collins said.

If you don’t want to take your medical advice from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, you’ll soon be able to consult with an alternate public health resource backed by the blue states on the West Coast. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said Wednesday that California is joining a West Coast Health Alliance with Oregon and Washington to provide residents with vaccine safety information.
They rolled out the plan on the same day that Florida officials went the other direction, pushing to eliminate all vaccine mandates, including requirements for school children to be protected against the measles, chickenpox and Hepatitis B.
The three-state group comes as high-profile oustings, resignations and policy changes roil the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more infectious and severe variants of COVID-19 surge through California and other states this summer.
The alliance echoes one California joined in 2020 to review COVID-19 vaccines during President Donald Trump’s first administration.

Newsom, in a statement: “Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people. The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences.”

Eight left-leaning Northeastern states, including Massachusetts, New York and Vermont, have also banded together to create their own regional public health authority separate from the CDC.
Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UCSF professor of medicine specializing in infectious diseases, raised some concerns about how different guidelines from various state-led coalitions could lead to confusion among the public and health insurance companies.

Chin-Hong: “All of this assault on vaccines and turmoil at the CDC and turning science upside down couldn’t come at a worse time. The only people who suffer are community members who are confused as to how they can protect themselves. They can’t get protection even if they wanted to.”

Nevertheless, he welcomed the creation of the Western alliance. So did former Sen. Richard Pan, the Sacramento physician who authored a 2015 state law mandating stronger immunization protections for children. 
It’s important that state governments “step up” when “the federal government can no longer be trusted to provide unbiased, fact-based recommendations on protecting our health,” said Pan.

Pan: “This is a fundamental public safety issue. You’re as dead from a germ as you are from a bullet or a fire. … We had one of the best public health organizations in the world and we decided to destroy it.”

Spokesperson sues Assembly speaker

From CalMatters politics and campaign reporter Yue Stella Yu: 
A former spokesperson to California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas sued the top Democrat Tuesday, arguing he fired her and publicly retaliated against her after she alleged a colleague sexually harassed her and after she raised complaints about Rivas’ brother’s influence over the lawmaker.
Cynthia Moreno was fired last month after an internal investigation found that she had made sexual remarks to “various employees,” according to redacted documents released from the Assembly. 
Moreno, who has denied the allegation, filed her lawsuit in the Sacramento Superior Court on Tuesday. She argued Rivas failed to address her sexual harassment complaint against a former colleague. She also claimed that the Salinas Democrat’s brother, political strategist Rick Rivas, exerted undue influence on his policy making — a claim that has followed the speaker’s career for years.
Rivas spokesperson Elizabeth Ashford dismissed Moreno’s claim as “an attempt by a former employee to force a payout.”

Ashford: “The Speaker recused himself from all matters related to Ms. Moreno’s termination. … We will fight these false and defamatory claims aggressively, and we are confident they will be seen for what they are: absolutely meritness.”




What’s Newsom up to? He’s not saying

Gov. Newsom in recent months has spent his time doing a number of things, including launching a podcast and visiting other states in an attempt, some say, to raise his national profile. So while many of his critics slam the governor for not focusing enough time and attention on California, how does Newsom spend his time exactly?
It turns out, the answer isn’t so clear, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
In the past five months, Newsom’s office has not released any of his 2025 calendars, despite doing so in the past and CalMatters requesting them each month. The office has also ignored questions about possible timelines to release the records, which is required by law.
The last calendar his office provided to CalMatters was on April 1, which detailed the months of September through December 2024.
Though these calendars list only official events, which even then are sometimes redacted, they still offer the public the most information about who Newsom is speaking to and how he prioritizes his time.

David Loy, legal director of the First Amendment Coalition: “We’re not talking hundreds and hundreds of records that need to be rounded up and redacted. It’s a pretty straightforward request. This is not difficult — or should not be difficult.”

But it’s only a test, and it will only help a fraction of inmates.","In summary
After years of complaints from inmates and advocates about hot temperatures inside prison cells, California is finally embarking on a plan to cool some cells. But it’s only a test, and it will only help a fraction of inmates. 


As climate change exacerbates the risks of extreme heat across California, the state’s prison officials plan to embark on a $38 million pilot program to figure out how to keep their prison cells cool. 
It comes after years of complaints from prisoners about dangerous temperatures during the state’s brutal summer heat waves, warnings by advocates that the problem will only get worse as the planet warms and the death of an incarcerated woman last year during California’s hottest month on record — which officials from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation insist was unrelated to the heat.
But don’t expect the prisons to become air conditioned anytime soon. 
The pilot, approved by the Legislature this year amid a budget deficit, is a limited test of cooling systems and new insulation over the next four years at just three of the department’s 31 prisons. Results of the test are not expected until mid-2029. 
The corrections department has pointed to the pilot as a step toward addressing the heat problem as it faces pressure from activists, lawmakers and judges to do more. Critics say it falls short, since it only applies to parts of facilities that house about 8,000 of California’s 91,000 inmates and does not require any future concrete action. The department is currently required in a federal court case to protect inmates with mental illness from heat risks, and uses a decades-old protocol to do so. 
With temperatures in some prisons reaching 95 degrees each summer, some prisoners’ advocates say the only safe solution to protect all prisoners is to install air conditioning statewide. 
“Extreme heat poses a serious health risk to all in CDCR,” said Lily Harvey, senior staff attorney at the Prison Law Office, which represents inmates in several federal class-action court cases covering health care in state prisons. “Air-conditioned housing units are the only effective way to protect against that risk.”
But department attorneys have pushed back, arguing in court that some facilities in more temperate areas might not need air conditioning. They have put the price tag of “statewide implementation of effective air cooling mechanisms” at $6 billion, but have refused to provide a cost breakdown of that figure. 
Department officials declined to be interviewed for this story. Instead, in response to a detailed list of questions, department spokesperson Mary Xjimenez sent a written statement saying the heat problem can’t be solved statewide by installing air conditioning alone. For facilities that will need air conditioning, the department will also have to fix corroded roofs and other structural issues. 
The pilot will test different ways — air conditioning, insulation, or some combination of the two — to reduce indoor prison temperatures to 78 degrees at Kern Valley State Prison, Central California Women’s Facility and the California State Prison in Los Angeles County. 
Most prisons currently rely on fans or evaporative cooling units (known commonly as swamp coolers), that have limited effectiveness when temperatures near triple digits. Xjimenez said the department will use the results of the pilot “to recommend a statewide strategy for scaling air cooling in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner.” She pointed to $246 million worth of cooling improvements the department has started at five prisons over the past five years, though not all cover the cells where prisoners are housed.

In the meantime, officials point to what they call their successful heat protocol, required by the court, which they use to monitor inmates who are most at risk of heat illness. From May to October, staff at every prison must record indoor and outdoor temperatures daily, move at-risk inmates indoors and, on the hottest days, check on them every few hours for signs of heat stroke. 
But a monitor for the federal courts this year found gaping holes in its usage, calling consistent implementation of the rules “elusive.” 
At half of the 14 prisons he toured, monitor Matthew Lopes found staff who were unaware of the protocol. He questioned the accuracy of officers’ temperature logs at two prisons; at three, he found broken or missing thermometers. 
While some prison officials “commendably” go out of their way to ease conditions during heat waves, he wrote, others are “failing to approach compliance.”
‘There’s really no reprieve’
Extreme heat is warping life for all Californians, but state prisoners will be hit especially hard.  Many are housed in inland or desert environments where temperatures are slated to rise more than the statewide average over the next few decades.
There were 182 days last year in which at least one of the state’s 31 prisons was experiencing weather hotter than 90 degrees — amounting to half the year, according to a June CDCR report. On 46 days last year, at least one prison was hotter than 95 degrees indoors.

Cal/OSHA only recently began requiring indoor workplaces to be lower than 87 degrees and to provide cooling areas that are no hotter than 82 degrees, but correctional facilities were exempted because of how much it would cost the state to comply. Some experts recommend cooling homes to at most 78 degrees during heat waves to avoid health risks.
CDCR instituted its summer heat protocol under federal court order after three inmates died in their cells of hyperthermia at the California Medical Facility psychiatric prison in Vacaville in 1991. The men, all in their 30s, had been taking psychotropic medications to treat mental illness, which elevate patients’ body temperatures.
Under the protocol, prison staff are required to share a list of inmates who take heat-sensitive medications every summer.
When outdoor temperatures reach 90 degrees, they are supposed to activate Stage 1, moving heat-sensitive inmates indoors. When indoor temperatures reach 90 degrees, they call Stage 2, giving those inmates more access to showers and ice. Indoor temperatures of 95 degrees should trigger Stage 3, during which medical staff are mandated to check on inmates every two hours to monitor for signs of heat illness.
Even outside the cells, heat affects every corner of prison life, the court-appointed monitor Lopes has found. 
Heat forces staff to shuffle counseling to less private spaces, disrupts group therapy and when inmates are forced inside during heat alerts, they sometimes lose out on programs and recreation time to stay in even hotter cells. 
One prisoner at the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco declined to take an antipsychotic medication urged by his psychiatrist because he didn’t want to lose his maintenance job over heat concerns. 
In their housing units, there’s little inmates can do other than take showers and scoop ice when officers provide it. Concrete, uninsulated cells can be as much as 21 degrees hotter than common areas, the department has noted. 
Inmates may keep a personal fan in their cells; it’s available for $27 from the commissary. An inmate with no family support would have to work a minimum-wage prison job for about 4 weeks to afford one, estimates Bharat Venkat, a UCLA anthropologist who has researched the effects of heat on incarcerated people.
Lawrence Cox, an advocate with Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, spent years incarcerated in Calipatria State Prison, in the Imperial County desert and California State Prison Solano, in Vacaville. He and his cellmate would wet their bedsheets in the sink to try to keep cool, but with little ventilation, the cell only became more humid, and he developed heat rashes that he said left lasting marks on his skin.
“I have never sweated so much, continuously, all day, just simply by sitting there,” he said. “There’s really no reprieve.”
The heat protocol’s success depends on who’s on shift. Over the years, the monitor has found inconsistent record-keeping and compliance, according to thousands of pages of court records reviewed by CalMatters. 
Though some facilities are testing digital temperature use, most prison staff maintain outdoor and indoor records on paper, in handwritten logs. A department spokesperson said supervisors are required to verify those records daily. 
Reviewing logs from the Central California Women’s Facility in Madera County obtained through a public records request, CalMatters found days in which prison staff did not record any indoor temperatures. Two days in 2022 the same indoor temperature was recorded at one of the facility’s housing units every three hours for the entire day, in the same handwriting.
A death at California’s largest women’s prison
Every summer, incarcerated women at the Chowchilla prison flood the phone lines of community advocacy groups and attorneys’ offices, raising alarms about hot conditions. About 2,000 women are incarcerated across 15 housing units at the facility, which opened in 1990.
Every summer from 2020 through 2024, Chowchilla saw at least seven days that reached or surpassed 105 degrees; last summer set a record at 28 days.

Adrienne Boulware, who had been incarcerated there for about a decade by 2024, told her family each summer that the prison’s evaporative cooling units weren’t working, said her daughter Michaela Nelson. 
“We were usually worried about her every summer,” Nelson said. 
Even driving through the Central Valley to visit Boulware felt “treacherous” because of the heat, Nelson said. The family had helped her buy a fan for her cell, and she took showers to cool off, but in phone calls to her daughters in the summer of 2024, Boulware described the prison as “hot as hell.”
Boulware raised Nelson and three siblings in Sacramento. She was serving a 15 years-to-life sentence for second-degree murder in the 2011 beating death of a man she and another woman argued with in an abandoned car wash in north Sacramento. Nelson said her mother had been steadily repaying her debt to society, taking classes and running a Bible study. In recent years Boulware had started going to parole hearings, so her family was hoping for her release. Nelson, a home care worker in Georgia, planned to move back to California.
Like much of the state, Chowchilla was three days into a searing two-week heat wave during last year’s long Independence Day weekend when Boulware, 47, collapsed.

On July 4, when temperatures were as high as 109 degrees outside, the swamp cooler in Boulware’s building was “blowing warm air but was fixed the same day,” CDCR attorney Melissa Bentz wrote in an email later included in court records. Staff placed coolers of ice water and “large industrial floor fans” in the housing units. 
On July 5, outside temperatures reached 108. A lieutenant at the prison told the Madera County Sheriff’s Office that Boulware, who court records say was prescribed the mood stabilizer lithium, was “outside in the yard most of the day,” according to a coroner’s report. After they returned inside, dorm-mates found Boulware on the floor of the shower. 
Officers were unsure if she was having a seizure or overdose. She was given four rounds of Narcan and taken to a hospital in Merced, where she died early the next morning. 
Amid a public outcry in the days that followed, department spokespeople downplayed the role of heat in Boulware’s death, telling reporters it “appears to be the result of an ongoing medical condition and not heat-related.” 
A toxicology report showed fentanyl was found in her blood. The Madera County coroner this year listed the cause of death as undetermined.
Experts say it can often be hard to identify heat as a cause in deaths and medical events, especially when people have other health conditions. 
Advocates and Boulware’s family believe her death was preventable. Records show the department itself suspected heat from the beginning. 
In prison staff’s first phone call to Boulware’s family before she was taken to the hospital on July 5, Nelson said, they told her sister she had suffered a heat stroke. In an email to plaintiffs’ attorneys and the court monitor a few days after the death, a prison medical provider wrote that the causes of death were listed as loss of consciousness, seizures, “heat stroke and possible overdose.” The email was included in court records.

An alarmed plaintiffs’ attorney, Steven Fama, wrote to the court monitor on July 8 asking for an investigation. Citing Boulware’s prison medical records, Fama noted her body temperature was 41.5 degrees Celsius when she arrived at the hospital — 106.7 degrees Fahrenheit, eight degrees higher than the normal human body temperature. 
He also raised more questions: Why, he wrote, was an inmate who was prescribed the heat-sensitive medication lithium “outside all day” during a triple-digit heat wave?
Nelson said her family is still waiting for an answer. They also haven’t received her mother’s belongings — years of letters, photographs, everything the family bought her from the prison commissary and her mother’s Bible. Asked by CalMatters for comment, CDCR said it is following department procedures for returning Boulware’s belongings. Officials declined to comment on her death, deferring to the coroner’s report.   
“It’s hard to not know,” Nelson said. “It’s always better to know than to just be wondering, wondering if she suffered, and how things could have been different.”
Increasing pressure on the state
Seven months after Boulware died, in February of this year, court-appointed prison monitor Matthew Lopes wrote that her death was a “tragic reminder of the very real harm that can result from failing to properly monitor and treat patients on heat-sensitive medication.” 
But corrections department attorneys urged him not to include that in his report evaluating CDCR’s heat protocol. In court records, staff attorney Nick Weber called it “charged language,” noting that, as of this spring, the coroner had not yet documented an official cause of death.
Since Boulware’s death a year ago, advocates have used the incident to demand that CDCR do more to protect incarcerated people. 
Earlier this year, activists pleaded with the Cal/OSHA standards board to adopt a promised new workplace standard for state prisons. They argued that many prison inmates work in the facilities, whether in kitchens, facility maintenance, or as part of state programs that place inmates in jobs with private contractors. 
Any new rule would require a drafting and public hearings process which can take years. Spokespeople for both the department and the Cal/OSHA board said they are in “discussions” about a rule, but no public process has begun.
Cox’s group, Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, sponsored a bill this year that would have forced the state to lower temperatures in all the prisons and require digitized, live temperature monitoring. The bill sailed through state Assembly committees and didn’t garner any official opposition. 
But with the corrections department estimating it would cost between $10 billion and $20 billion to make the changes, author Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez said she knew it would be a tough sell amid a budget deficit. Rodriguez, a Democrat from Chino, agreed to hold it and revisit it next year. 
She said she’s encouraged by the pilot program the department is starting, but wants to keep the legislation alive so officials don’t lose urgency to address the heat. 
“Managing litigation costs is a factor when we consider infrastructure projects,” she said of the potential cost of installing air conditioning across prisons. 
Meanwhile, in a class action federal court case on medical care in California prisons, plaintiffs representing virtually every prisoner in the state have sought to bring heat issues before a judge.
They’ve pointed to a case in Texas in which a judge ruled in March that the lack of systemwide air conditioning there violates constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. 
The department has objected to the comparison. Unlike Texas, attorneys for the CDCR wrote in June, California prisons have experienced “very few sentinel events (such as deaths) among its patient population directly related to extreme heat.” 
But in California, U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar has expressed interest in the issue, and directed the department to provide the plaintiffs data on the matter.
“I want to say this very clearly, this is a medical issue,” he said in a June conference with attorneys on all sides. “This is a big issue, that’s only going to get bigger with the passage of time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/061824-Chowchilla-Womens-Prison-GETTY-CM-01-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

His official schedule remains a mystery,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/gavin-newsom-calendars-transparency/,"As Gov. Gavin Newsom turns his attention to national politics, it’s difficult to evaluate what effect his extracurricular activities have had on his work, because the governor’s office has not made his full schedule available all year.","In summary
As Gov. Gavin Newsom turns his attention to national politics, it’s difficult to evaluate what effect his extracurricular activities have had on his work, because the governor’s office has not made his full schedule available all year.


It’s a common refrain for critics of Gov. Gavin Newsom: Focus on your job.
The jabs have grown louder this year as Newsom launched a new weekly political podcast and traveled to other states that could be pivotal in a potential presidential campaign. A poll in May found that twice as many California voters believe the governor is devoting more attention to boosting his national profile than fixing the problems of the state.
“If he wants to prove to the United States that he would be a good president, why doesn’t he start by leading and actually running the state of California?” then-Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli, who has since been appointed a U.S. attorney, said in a March appearance on Fox News.
But it’s difficult to evaluate what effect Newsom’s extracurricular activities have had on his work, because the governor’s office has not made his full schedule available all year.
Each month, CalMatters requests Newsom’s calendar under the California Public Records Act. While the governor’s office routinely released those documents in the past, it has not provided anything new in five months and has yet to hand over any of his 2025 calendars.
Multiple inquiries about a timeline for releasing the records, a requirement under the law, have been ignored during that period. Representatives for the governor’s legal affairs unit, which handles records requests, wrote that the calendars “will be provided as soon as they are ready for release.”
Newsom’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about what is causing the delay, but said in an email Wednesday that the calendars would be provided when they are “finalized and ready for public disclosure.”
“Governor Newsom has been among the most transparent governors in California’s history and we’ll continue to share his calendar, as always, with the transparency, diligence, and accuracy it deserves,” spokesperson Izzy Gardon wrote. He added, “I look forward to reading your webpost about the hardships you’ve encountered while waiting.”
“This is not difficult — or should not be difficult.”David Loy, legal director of the First Amendment Coalition
David Loy, legal director of the First Amendment Coalition, which advocates for government transparency, said it’s “deeply problematic” that the governor’s office has not quickly fulfilled what amounts to a simple clerical task.
“We’re not talking hundreds and hundreds of records that need to be rounded up and redacted. It’s a pretty straightforward request,” Loy said. “This is not difficult — or should not be difficult.”
A fight for public access
California governors have shared their calendars for about two decades.
Previously, Gov. George Deukmejian went to court to protect those records from disclosure, arguing that making his appointments public would discourage people from meeting with him and hinder his decision-making process. The California Supreme Court ruled in his favor in 1991.
Then California voters expanded the Public Records Act in 2004, ultimately compelling then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to begin releasing his calendar. During Gov. Jerry Brown’s subsequent tenure, his office proactively provided his appointments log monthly to reporters who made standing public records requests.
The schedules are of limited utility, because they include only official events, not personal or political activities, and even those are sometimes redacted to protect attorney-client privilege or the governor’s security. Newsom’s calendars from previous years include many days with just a few meetings or no official events listed at all, and the hours are often filled with “work time,” providing no further details.
But because most of the governor’s other records, including emails, remain legally protected from disclosure, calendars offer the public the most comprehensive picture available of who Newsom is speaking to and how he is prioritizing his time. That means their release can still be politically fraught, and numerous administrations have resisted going beyond the minimum requirements.
“It would be so much better for transparency if they just posted his calendar online,” Loy said.
Calendars not produced ‘promptly’
The governor’s office last provided Newsom’s calendars to CalMatters on April 1, for the months of September through December 2024.
When a request is made under the California Public Records Act, government agencies are required to determine within 10 business days whether they have any disclosable documents and, if so, provide an estimated delivery date. The agencies are then supposed to produce the records “promptly,” which is not a defined time frame.
The law also obligates that records be produced as they existed at the time of the request.
The calendars that Newsom’s office has released in the past are PDF files that simply list his schedule in chronological order: date, time, a brief description of the appointment, location and staff lead.
The entries appear to be copied over from a calendar program into a text file, which Loy said is concerning, because the law requires that electronic records are provided in their native format, for proper accountability.
“The whole point of transparency law is ‘trust but verify,’” he said. “We don’t have to take their word that they’re doing it right. We can see it for ourselves.”
Newsom’s spokespeople did not respond to questions about how the governor’s calendar is maintained and in what format.
The delay echoes a similar issue involving Newsom’s tax returns. While they are not a public record, Newsom pledged to be the first California governor to release his filings every year while in office. But he has not done so in more than three years, last sharing a tax return in March 2022, as he was running for re-election.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

Scott Wiener that would clear the way for construction of apartment buildings near transit stops in California, most pointedly including Los Angeles: It’s a bad idea, and Los Angeles has only itself to blame for it.
The fact that Wiener’s approach is both wrongheaded and entirely understandable has led to some strange reactions in California’s largest city, where unusual bedfellows have found themselves together either supporting or opposing it. A bare majority of a city council normally divided between liberals and democratic socialists came together to formally oppose the bill, the eight no votes drawing from both political camps. Supporters similarly crossed ideological lines.
Mayor Karen Bass also opposed Wiener’s bill, positing a brief statement. “While I support the intent to accelerate housing development statewide,” she said, “as written, this bill risks unintended consequences for LA.” 
She was joined by her once and possibly future opponent, developer Rick Caruso, who echoed Bass’ ambivalence as well as her conclusion. 
“The state is right to encourage more housing,” he said, “but it must be done with the full engagement and support of local officials and residents.”
It’s tempting to dismiss those as NIMBY responses, those of local leaders defending their turf against the wiser heads of state government. That’s a little bit true, but mostly not. 
Wiener’s bill violates the most basic principles of social organization and American federalism. It substitutes far-away authority for local expertise. It treats neighborhoods not as places where people live and work but as dots on a map. It’s an expression of ego rather than planning.
As Ruth Galanter, a revered former L.A. City Council member, told me last week, “There’s a difference between making policy and solving problems.”
SB 79 runs afoul of the principle of subsidiarity, which argues that problems should be solved at the most local level achievable. Families understand their problems better than neighbors, communities are better at directing their futures than cities, and so on.
The same is true for government. Indeed, a prime violator of that idea is President Donald Trump, who has decided that he — and he alone — understands the best ways to bring safety to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago and elsewhere. The result is chaos and stupidity, hallmarks of the Trump regime, with National Guard troops and Marines camped out in Los Angeles for weeks doing nothing and now spreading mulch in Washington, all in service of a dim, tyrannical ego.
Wiener is well-intentioned and his bill more intelligent, but it fails for the same reasons as Trump’s actions: It substitutes far-away authority for local insight. It assumes that Sacramento knows better than Los Angeles what is best for the city and its neighborhoods.
It doesn’t. The state government does not know where to put an apartment building in mid-Wilshire or Hancock Park, any more than it does in San Francisco’s Mission or Bakersfield’s Oakridge. 
To cite Galanter, Wiener’s bill makes policy but it doesn’t solve problems.
Still, hammers will see nails, and supporters of Wiener’s approach aren’t wrong to demand change. California needs more housing, and that’s especially true in Los Angeles, which needs to produce more than 387,000 units by 2029 to meet its state-mandated quota. And that was before the fires in January. 
It’s a familiar problem and one that reflects the state’s persistent popularity, despite its challenges. California remains an attractive place to live for more Americans than any other state in the Union. That creates problems of demand.
Indeed, it’s been in this fix before. At the end of World War II, veterans and their families came streaming to California to reset their lives. Then-Gov. Earl Warren used to say that it was his responsibility to provide for 10,000 arrivals every month.
And at this moment, Los Angeles is falling behind. Studies suggest that the city is some 270,000 short of affordable units to serve its population, and progress toward that place has been dismayingly slow. L.A. issued roughly 17,000 permits last year, the lowest mark in three years.
Cities don’t build housing, but cities can make it easier or harder for developers to do so, and Los Angeles has often made it harder by complicating permits and imposing regulations — many well-intentioned to protect neighborhoods, require parking and control traffic, among other things, but sometimes so onerous that they make the cost prohibitive. 
Developers are under no obligation to build. They can, and do, go elsewhere.
Even as the city has made modest gains in addressing homelessness, the broader housing shortage remains, a reminder that those two struggles, though related, also are distinct. Building new apartment buildings along rail or bus lines, as Wiener’s approach would facilitate, does not do much for the destitute person living under a bridge. Even if clearing the way for more apartments would nudge down the average price of a place to live in the city, it now hovers at around $2,800 a month, orders of magnitude beyond the reach of most of those living in tents or cars. 
The market — even aided by the state government — is not going to solve that problem.

Wiener’s bill, then, is unlikely to help alleviate homelessness, but it’s an understandable response to a stubborn problem. Los Angeles will continue to invite outside intervention unless and until it uncorks housing growth. Some of that will be by accepting increased density in certain neighborhoods, not because Sacramento ordered it but because Bass and the city council affirmatively do it themselves.
And here is where L.A.’s leadership can both maintain its authority and deter the state from unwise intervention. It can green-light smart proposals for denser housing in areas already suited for it — the Wilshire Corridor, major arteries, commercial areas in the San Fernando Valley and South Los Angeles, Westwood, Hollywood. In those areas, it can streamline permitting, remove delays and overly burdensome regulations. 
It can commit to housing growth, not because it’s the answer to homelessness but because it’s a genuine problem all on its own.
But it should not assume that all neighborhoods are the same. It should not commit the mistake that Wiener’s bill does. It should consider the history and character of neighborhoods, not just treat them as dots on a map.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/080719_LosAngeles_AW_CM_61.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

On a quiet Sunday morning at Seaside Park in Bridgeport, waves roll steadily against the shore as a group of women gathers near a single wooden bench. The only green bench in the park, it has become more than just a place to sit. It is the heart of a sisterhood called Sisters at the Shore, women who meet to pray, reflect and care for one another and their city.
The founder, Thayer Barkley, says it began with a vision. She recalls being awakened between 3 and 5 a.m. night after night, unsure why she could not rest. “I was really asking God, what do you want from me? Why do you keep waking me up?” she said.
What followed was an image she could not ignore. “I basically had a vision of women gathered lining the shores. Not just this shore, but shores across the nation, across the world.” Unsure where it might lead, she posted a question on Facebook: how many other women were being awakened at that time? The responses poured in. Women said, “me, me, me,” and from there, a movement was born.
Faith guided Barkley to act. “I never really spent time with a lot of women. It was always conflict and drama. I didn’t want to deal with it. So I knew that was God telling me to do this,” she said. Following instructions she says were placed in her heart, she brought a drum, prayed silently by the water and let the rest unfold. “It was about coming and speaking to God. In silence. Letting the water hold our prayers.”
The first gathering was small. Friends shared the invitation, word spread and soon the circle widened. As word of the group’s impact grew, Barkley was invited to workshops and beaches across the country and abroad to share what Sisters at the Shore was doing in Bridgeport. That’s how the prayers at Seaside Park spread to places like Chicago, North Carolina and even Italy. “I sounded the drum there and people came from every direction. And we prayed by that water. It has happened in so many places, and I know there will be more,” she said.

For Barkley, the connection to water is spiritual and rooted in her upbringing. “My father was from North Carolina. My mother from Virginia. We are Blackfoot and Cherokee by blood. We were taught about nature, about the water and the skies and God. Not necessarily in a religious upbringing, but to honor God through nature. Water is life. Without water, there is no life. Man can try to duplicate many things but not the water. The cleansing, the power, the way it can move rocks and change formations. That same power can change our lives.”
Every Sunday, the women begin in silence, sending prayers out toward the water. They do not recite the same words or follow one faith tradition. Barkley made it clear the circle was never meant to be exclusive. “I didn’t want it to be about one faith, one race, not even one gender. God said gather the women, but He also said men would come. Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, Christian — we learn from each other. The central goal is love.”
The inclusivity drew longtime Bridgeport resident Lori Caple to the shore. “I felt that unity and warmth and love. They accepted me, and I embraced it,” she said. For Caple, the power of the gathering is in both prayer and action. “Anything in the community that we can do, we do. From gun violence to food drives. The prayer is powerful. I’m grateful for the sisters.” She described bonding with an elder in the group who reminded her of her mother, a friendship rooted in care and wisdom.
Barbara Pouchet Griffin is also a Bridgeport resident. She arrived laughing. “I didn’t even know where to go on the beach. The ladies all had a chuckle out of that,” she said. But she returned not just for camaraderie. “I used to go to church, and I got my family into church, but to see how genuine the people are here is different. A lot of women go to other shores, but I come back because our silent prayers really work. We pray for our city, our country, our state, our family and friends. We welcome everyone, no matter race or religion. These ladies have become my sisters. God put us on this mission. We are in communities dealing with domestic violence, with seniors, with men. It’s an amazing group, all from one post that said, ‘meet me at the shore.’”

Denese Taylor-Moye, a City Council member in Bridgeport and one of the elders of Sisters at the Shore, said the gatherings are about unity. “We are still navigating through everything, but we have grown and learned just by looking at the water. Us. Just how united we are,” she said.
Beth Lazar resides near downtown Bridgeport and emphasized belonging and service. “The group gives me an opportunity to serve the community,” she said, recalling handing out gloves and scarves to people without shelter. “We’ve done retreats, school giveaways. It is belonging, but also action.”
Nicole Bass Adams has been living in Bridgeport for more than a decade and added, “We’re a sisterhood. We have a sense of community. It’s not just one side. We care about the city of Bridgeport — everyone, homeless, children, moms, people affected by violence.”
Bridgeport itself holds deep significance for Barkley. Raised in the city, she knows its struggles and reputation. “I see the trauma of Bridgeport and the bad rap that we get. I just want to show people there’s more, that we matter, that we’re important.” Choosing Seaside Park was intentional. Barkley sought permission from a tribal mother of the Golden Hill Paugussett tribe, acknowledging the land as having an ancestral and sacred history. “As a Native American, we are very careful not to go into someone’s ancestral area without acknowledging it. This honors the land. I’ll thank the water, I’ll thank the trees, I’ll thank the sky. Because I believe it all has memory.”

The green bench where the women gather is woven into that sacredness. “I’m not sure how this section was picked, it just happened,” Barkley said. “But this is where our elders sit. And elders are very important. Their wisdom is unmatchable, their presence sacred. This is not your ordinary bench. Why did they spare this bench? Why is it the only wood one in the park? And why did we pick it without even knowing that? Now the women are asking, let’s make it a Sisters at the Shore bench, because what started here is going across the world.”
Barkley believes any recognition of the bench should honor the Golden Hill Paugussett tribe. “It’s about acknowledgment. We get to sit here because they were here. It would also symbolize our faithfulness. I’ve been doing this for five years. Rain, snow, sleet. We’ve only missed maybe two or three times. Even if they close the parks, we walk in. Women say this is the most special 20 minutes of their week.”
The gatherings have expanded into workshops addressing trauma, purpose and healing. Barkley notes that many people do not realize they carry trauma because they are too busy surviving. “A lot of people are not breathing. Their breathing is shallow. Your body can cleanse and heal when you take conscious breaths. Stop, breathe, get clarity and then sit still and wait for God to answer.” 
The workshops cover everything from finding purpose to navigating grief. “It’s about giving people an outlet and also teaching them, you can do this too. I don’t want to always be the face. I want people to walk into their own. If your gift is baking a cake, bake the best cake and let that be your purpose.”

Healing the community, Barkley says, begins with individuals walking in purpose. “Once you’re walking in your purpose, you won’t be sad, depressed, or envious. You’ll be happier. And if you’re that way most of the time, we are all going to be better. It has to start within in order to reach others.” She emphasizes modeling that for children. “The children are watching us. They come in with joy, and us as traumatized adults often dampen that. But if we encourage them, if we support them, we can heal ourselves too. Everything has a purpose. That’s what I want people to learn.”
The dream for Sisters at the Shore stretches far beyond Bridgeport. Barkley envisions synchronized prayer around the world, women and men gathered by lakes, waterfalls and oceans every Sunday morning, sending prayers into the water. She has already seen it begin in Chicago, Italy, Florida, California and Kentucky. “What started here in Bridgeport is now in other cities and other countries. The dream is for every natural body of water to be a place where prayer and healing take place.”
The women also take their work beyond the beach. They organize community cleanups, host wellness workshops and support local schools. “It’s not just about prayer. It’s about action,” Barkley said. “If we see someone struggling, we step in. We find ways to serve, and it all starts with that connection by the water.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7661-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

A recent analysis found that the state spent $5 billion in five years on the Alabama Department of Corrections. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A report published last month estimated that Alabama spent $5 billion on the state’s prison system in the past five years.
The report from Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice organization, said the total included ADOC paid for operations and the costs of a $1.3 billion new prison in Elmore County, including debt payments for the bonds the state issued to assist with the construction costs, contributed to the total.
“What came as a bit of a surprise was the trajectory over 20 years, and how the increase in prison spending has caused this ripple effect where these other important agencies, their budgets are not growing at the same rate,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed.

A message was sent to the ADOC on Tuesday seeking comment.
Corrections for decades has taken the second-largest chunk out of the state’s General Fund budget, only trailing Alabama Medicaid, which provides health insurance to about 1 million Alabamians, mostly children, elderly people or those with disabilities. The department is budgeted to get $826.7 million in the current fiscal year, about 22% of the total General Fund.
“That is why we have budget hearings, to get a grasp of the direction that we are headed and, more importantly, why,” said Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, the chair of the Senate in an interview on Tuesday.
He cited several factors for the increase in money allocated to ADOC.
“We are trying to hire people is the first thing,” he said. “The second thing is construction, and the third thing is lawsuits. I think those are three things where money gets sucked up in.”
Corrections has struggled to maintain adequate staffing in the prisons, a major contributor to a wave of violence in the state’s correctional facilities. The state has paid tens of millions of dollars in legal fees over litigation.
The Elmore County prison has proven far more expensive than legislators first expected. Lawmakers approved $1.3 billion for two prisons in 2021, expecting that to cover the cost of the Elmore facility and another prison in Escambia. Now, that amount is enough for only one prison.
Legislators have authorized transferring money from ADOC operations to help pay for the expected cost of the second prison planned for Escambia County. The Legislature has also authorized additional bonding capacity in 2025 should additional funding be needed.
However, legislators also allocate a greater share of the General Fund budget to the ADOC as the cost to operate the state’s prisons has increased dramatically in the past several years.
The Alabama Department of Mental Health, for example, received $244 million, or almost 8% of the General Fund dollars, for the current fiscal year, roughly a fourth of what ADOC was allocated. Another agency, the Alabama Department of Public Health, will receive about $160 million, almost 3% of the General Fund budget.
Agencies have other funds from which to draw, but the General Fund comprises a significant portion of their budgets.
Medicaid and Corrections’ share of the budget have grown significantly over the last 20 years. In 2002, they were responsible for about a third of the spending. By 2024 it increased to slightly more than half.
Medicaid went from $231 million in 2002 to $955 million in 2025, a 313% increase. Corrections went from $197 million to $737 million, an increase of 274% over the same period.
Crowder said part of the reason for the increased funding is meant to address years of underinvestment in the prison system. The additional allocations also deal with the problems that ADOC currently has recruiting and retaining corrections officers and the medical costs because of an aging prison population.
A higher percentage of people in Alabama’s prisons are expected to spend a greater share of their lives incarcerated in prison.
A study from The Sentencing Project published in 2024, a research and advocacy organization, said that almost 30% of people in state prison are practically serving a life sentence, meaning they will spend decades incarcerated before possibly getting released. This is compared to the national percentage at 16%.
“When you are sentencing a lot of people to life, that is a dramatic way of increasing the prison population numbers,” said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, director of research at The Sentencing Project.
As they age, their medical needs increase along with the corresponding costs.
“The best way to curb these costs is to evaluate older people who are serving unnecessary and extreme sentences, then rehabilitate and find pathways to release,” Crowder said. “To increase the availability of Medicaid for people who are leaving prison, other states have done this through a waiver program. And to invest more in front-end solutions like mental health care and drug treatment.”
There are limits for how much states can decrease the cost of incarcerating people solely by releasing some of those who are incarcerated.
“That is partly because the main significant way to experience savings in correctional costs is to shut down facilities or large sections of facilities,” Ghandnoosh said. “Just reducing the number of people and leaving the number of prisons the same doesn’t lower cost because every year you are going to have likely increases in staffing costs and so on.”
Some states, to reduce costs, are beginning to close facilities.
“By building a new facility and expanding capacity, that is likely going to result in prosecutorial decisions, legislative decisions, to fill up those prison beds,” she said.
The state, for its part, said the new facilities will not add new capacity to the system, but simply replace the capacity at other facilities slated to be closed. However, some lawmakers, like Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, are starting to doubt if those facilities can close given the increase in the prison population.
Appleseed has been urging the Legislature to pass a bill for the past several years to allow judges to reconsider the sentences of people who spent decades in prison, and who did not cause any physical harm during their offenses.
Appleseed published its findings just as the Legislature received an update on the status of both the Educational Trust Fund and General Fund budgets prior to the start of the 2026 session in January.
ADOC was scheduled to appear before the Legislature last week as part of the budget hearings, but the appearance was cancelled. Despite that, Albritton said in an interview on Tuesday that he spoke with ADOC Commissioner John Hamm.
“I don’t see the increases continuing to develop,” he said. “I think we have gotten pretty close to the level of what the needs are. We seem to have gotten the pay scales up to a point that is making a difference, and gives us an opportunity to retain people.”
For Albritton, the key to bending the cost curve will be the construction of the new facility because the sources of increased expenses stem from problems with infrastructure.
“It does not cure all of our problems, but it will remove the threat and the aspect of several lawsuits that is on us right now and the cost that is associated with that,” he said. “It will also give us a means to control the violence better in the prisons themselves, and reduce the number of incidents there. It will also protect the corrections officers more and it will give us the facilities to maintain them, so just don’t ignore them and let them deteriorate.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-inmate-1024x647.jpg,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

Those service outages are exacerbated by a federal rule that caps the number of spare buses a transit agency can maintain at 20% of their overall bus fleet, regardless of how many more buses a transit service needs to maintain reliable service.
Transit agencies that keep more spare buses than allowed risk losing federal funding if they aren’t granted an exemption from the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) for additional spare buses. However, the federal agency has never granted a waiver for additional buses to any state.
Southern Nevada’s congressional delegation is now asking the FTA to remove or increase its cap on the number of spare buses the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) can maintain in Las Vegas.
Southern Nevada’s transit authority operates a fleet of over 400 buses and relies on FTA funding to purchase both active and spare buses, but federal limits on spare buses have strained operations.
In a letter Thursday Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto – along with Reps. Susie Lee, Steven Horsford, and Dina Titus – said “transit agencies across the country face a variety of operational and environmental challenges that often require maintaining spare bus ratios above the current 20% cap.”
“Las Vegas, like many western cities, experiences extreme heat that accelerates bus wear and increases breakdown frequency, requiring more frequent maintenance to keep vehicles operational. This puts significant strain on RTC’s fleet, as insufficient spares can lead to service disruptions for the approximately 80 percent of Las Vegas riders who rely on transit for commuting to work,” wrote the delegation.
High transit demand and the extreme desert climate leads to rapid wear and tear on buses in Las Vegas, especially for high-mileage buses operating routes with long hours. 
Unlike many other cities, tourism and a non-traditional workforce in Las Vegas creates high peak demand for transit service throughout the day, with some routes operating 24 hours daily.
Asphalt in the city can also reach temperatures of more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, according to the RTC, increasing maintenance needs for buses traveling on hot roads throughout the entire day and reducing the fleet’s availability.
Frequent special events that attract thousands of tourists at a time also complicates bus management, placing further strain on an already stretched fleet. 
Conventions and sporting events frequently create a surge in ridership that requires more spare buses to provide reliable transit, said the RTC.
“Las Vegas’s vibrant tourism economy depends on reliable transit service to transport millions of visitors, not just year-round residents, especially during major events such as the Super Bowl, Formula 1 Grand Prix, FIFA tournaments, and large concerts,” wrote the delegation. 
Southern Nevada’s transit authority said they have worked to address frequent breakdowns in their fleet by prioritizing preventative maintenance, including regularly performing cooling system checks and addressing common wear-and-tear issues like battery and alternator failures exacerbated by the intense heat. 
But more flexibility on spare buses allowed in a fleet is needed so “agencies like RTC of Southern Nevada to better maintain reliable, safe, and equitable service for their communities,” reads the letter.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RTC-Transit-CNG-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067
,California,2025-09-04 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,New California law to make housing projects easier can also make them cost more,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/california-new-housing-law-projects/,"The legislation removes environmental delays but includes language that could allow local governments to add ""vehicle miles traveled"" fees to a project's cost.","Two months ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators from both parties celebrated enacting landmark legislation to remove the California Environmental Quality Act as an impediment to new housing construction.
Lopsided votes in the Legislature for Assembly Bill 130 and Newsom’s immediate signature seemingly ended decades of debate over how the environmental law, signed by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan more than 50 years ago, was being used to delay or kill residential developments.
“Saying ‘no’ to housing in my community will no longer be state sanctioned,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who has long advocated for CEQA reform. “This isn’t going to solve all of our housing problems in the state, but it is going to remove the single biggest impediment to building environmentally friendly housing.”
Newsom took obvious pleasure in achieving what had eluded other governors, including predecessor Jerry Brown, who once described overhauling CEQA as “the lord’s work.”
As Newsom signed the measure into law he thanked legislators and housing, labor and environmental leaders “who heeded my call and came together around a common goal — to build more housing faster and create strong, affordable pathways for every Californian.
“Today’s bill is a game changer which will be felt for generations to come,” he said. 
While AB130 does remove CEQA as a weapon for labor unions and opponents of high-density projects to stall construction, there’s a provision buried in the lengthy bill that could create a new impediment.
Two sections, 137 pages in, declare that if a residential project has “significant transportation impact,” local governments or regional agencies can impose fees to “mitigate the transportation impact to a less than significant level by helping to fund or otherwise facilitating vehicle miles traveled-efficient affordable housing or related infrastructure projects….”
The so-called vehicle miles traveled, or VMT, fees are “a new housing tax families simply cannot afford,” the California Building Industry Association publicly complained, adding that impact fees are already major factors in housing costs.
Local traffic impact fees are not new. In fact, a dispute over a $23,420 traffic mitigation fee imposed nine years ago for a factory-built house in El Dorado County is still pending after going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
However, AB 130 appears to broaden the potential use of these fees not only for roadway improvements, but also to pay for low-income housing projects throughout the state by contributing to the state’s Transit-Oriented Development Implementation Fund.
Drafting AB 130’s CEQA language was a complex process involving multiple stakeholders, not only housing advocates but environmental groups that often employ CEQA to slow or kill major public and private developments and labor unions, which have used the threat of CEQA lawsuits to compel developers to use union workers. The latter issue was a major hang-up that required last-minute amendments to the measure.
The language about traffic fees was never mentioned in analyses of the bill nor in the debates that preceded legislative passage. It’s another example of how such budget trailer bills are used by governors and legislators to enact major legislation on the sly, with little or no public airing of the issues.
Trailer bills often contain language that has little or nothing to do with the budget and are often fleshed out just hours before enactment. Under the guise of being budget-related, the bills can be passed with simple majority floor votes, take effect immediately upon being signed by the governor and cannot be taken to voters via referendum.
Those factors make trailer bills convenient vehicles for legislation that might not survive close scrutiny. Newsom has been especially willing to utilize them for his legislative priorities.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092222-LA-TRANSIT-TRAIN-REUTERS-MB-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

Leo, a New York native with family ties to Mississippi, just completed a 12-week fellowship at Mississippi Today, where he deeply covered criminal justice, education and culture. He holds degrees from Columbia University in American Studies and Investigative Journalism, and his work appears in the Christian Science Monitor and at Byline.

Leonardo Bevilacqua
Before becoming a journalist, he taught high school English in Indianola, Leland, and Jackson, and worked in nonprofit after-school enrichment programs in Clarksdale and Cleveland. He also directed community theater with the Delta Arts Alliance.
“The phrase ‘hit the ground running’ is trite but seems no better description for Leo,” said Debbie Skipper, Mississippi Today’s Justice Editor. “From the moment he joined our investigative team as a summer fellow from Columbia University, he has kept a pace that is truly remarkable, gleaning insights from Mississippians across the state dealing with real issues like childcare access and affordability, crime victim compensation, undocumented workers, teacher pay and local school control. He never just speaks to officials. As he takes on his new role, Mississippi couldn’t ask for a better journalist to report the stories that touch the lives of everyday Mississippians.”
Leo will serve on Mississippi Today’s newly formed Education Team, which is dedicated to covering all aspects of the state’s education system with a special focus on the challenges and solutions in Mississippi schools that can engage youth and strengthen communities.
The reporting on areas of educational pathways, funding and postsecondary opportunities will be produced in Mississippi Today’s signature style — in-depth, with attention to background and context. This will include a mix of daily news and longer-form pieces involving investigation and data analysis, with a special focus on schools and families in the Mississippi Delta.
That Delta focus makes Leo uniquely qualified for this job.
“I’m humbled to be reporting on a region where I began my professional career as a teacher,”  Bevilacqua said. “The Delta deserves high-impact, accountability journalism.

The increase is due to inflated medical and pharmaceutical costs. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Public Education Employee Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) board approved a request for a $380 million budget increase for fiscal year 2027 at its quarterly meeting Wednesday.
Diane Scott, chief financial officer for PEEHIP, presented a financial update to the board, which included a proposal to increase the state’s share from $904 per member per month to $1,209. With the increase, the board’s request for funding from the Legislature in January will be $1.509 billion. In FY26, the Legislature funded $1.129 billion through the Education Trust Fund.
The Legislature will make the final decision on the request and other budget matters in its 2026 regular session, which begins in January. 
Scott attributed the increase to health care costs. She said medical and pharmaceutical costs are up 16.55% from July 2024 to July 2025. She said she expects the costs to continue to rise over the next three fiscal years.
“Every year, we’re looking at a minimum increase in our cost of $100 million and that’s what this projection shows,” Scott said. “We have to be able to cover, every year, an incremental increase, unless there’s something out of the ordinary that is going to get those costs down.”
Alabama State Finance Director Bill Poole noted that the Legislature approved an increase of coverage for PEEHIP members this spring from $800 per member per month to $904 instead of giving teachers a pay raise.
“I think from the Legislature’s perspective, I would anticipate they will view this as ‘We just gave the largest year over year increase for PEEHIP in a long period of time,’” Poole said. “That will not be lost to the extent the Legislature did not give raises for FY26. I think it would be prudent to anticipate that they will want to provide raises in FY27. It shouldn’t be lost on anybody within the political context, that it’s going to be an election year for the Legislature.”
The ETF also has a spending cap, which Poole said would impact PEEHIP. Health care cost increases are not unique to PEEHIP, he said. 
“It’s not unique to public health care systems. It’s not unique to the private section of health care,” Poole said. “There’s not an American in this country that is going to be insulated from this type of inflationary costs occurring across our health insurance sector, whether they’re privately insured or publicly insured.”
The board approved the increased budget request. John Whaley, the chair of the PEEHIP board, said he is worried about premium increases that would come with the overall budget increase.
“Looking at the salary schedule in our school system, a cafeteria worker, bus driver, makes $18,000 a year. If you raise their PEEHIP rate from $307 to $614 they’re down to $886 before you take out Social Security, retirement and so on. So now they’re down to $400 a month,” Whaley said. “There aren’t enough bus drivers. Now, when you raise that bus drivers’ rate from $307 to $614 a month, we won’t be able to find any at all.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-e1756930754335-1024x563.png,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

Protecting Vermonters means strengthening communities and homes while letting forests function naturally, supporting both ecosystem and climate resilience.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jennifer Mamola: ‘Fix Our Forests Act’ misrepresents wildfire solutions.","This commentary is by Jennifer Mamola, of Washington, D.C. She works with the John Muir Project, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting national forests from fire-phobic policies, advocating community-out approaches to wildfire resilience, untangling woody biomass from the clean energy narrative and defending nature’s ability to manage biodiversity.


James Campbell’s recent commentary, “How the ‘Fix Our Forests Act’ protects Vermont’s future,” suggests logging is the solution to wildfire, framing forests as overstocked and dangerous. Vermont’s forests historically had dense canopy cover, and fire naturally recycles nutrients, creates habitats and promotes regeneration. These forests are resilient and do not need logging to be “safer.”
The “Fix Our Forests Act” would not protect communities or forests. Thinning and logging leave flammable debris, open the canopy and fragment landscapes, increasing fire spread. Focusing on forests where fire occurs naturally diverts attention from human-built areas, where wildfire truly threatens lives and property. 
Even U.S. Forest Service scientists note that thinning and post-fire logging can increase tree mortality, push flames faster toward homes and release more carbon than the fires themselves would.
Wildfire danger is primarily tied to the human-built environment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and wildfire experts point to home hardening, defensible space and community preparedness as the most effective ways to protect lives and property. 
Vermont’s recent fires — 82 in 2024 and 45 in 2025, nearly all human-caused — show the real threat comes from human activity and proximity to homes, not forest density. Policies should focus on strengthening communities rather than industrial logging of resilient forests.
H.R. 582, the “Community Protection and Wildfire Resilience Act” introduced by Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., offers a more effective approach. It helps communities develop resilience plans emphasizing home hardening, defensible space and preparedness.
Vermonters deserve solutions grounded in science, not legislation that industrializes forests. The “Fix Our Forests Act” diverts resources, weakens protections and undermines ecosystem resilience. Protecting Vermonters means strengthening communities and homes while letting forests function naturally, supporting both ecosystem and climate resilience.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)The former head of Washington’s beleaguered juvenile detention system alleges she was fired in retaliation for repeatedly warning of the dangers of overcrowding in the state’s youth prisons.
As assistant secretary of juvenile rehabilitation at Washington’s Department of Children, Youth and Families, Felice Upton oversaw the state’s two youth detention centers: Green Hill School in Chehalis and Echo Glen Children’s Center in Snoqualmie.
After five years at the agency, Upton was fired in April without explanation. Last week, she filed a claim for $4.75 million in damages alleging she was terminated for being a whistleblower about deteriorating conditions in the facilities. The claim serves as a precursor to a lawsuit . 
“DCYF has neglected long-term solutions in favor of short-term actions that are only costing taxpayers more money without addressing the underlying issue,” Upton said in a statement Tuesday.
Tana Senn, the secretary of the Department of Children, Youth and Families, said late Wednesday that Upton’s concerns “were in no part a factor in the personnel and organizational changes I made in executive leadership when I joined as the new head of DCYF.”
In Upton’s tenure, state law changed to send young adults convicted of crimes to youth detention instead of adult prison until age 25. This caused the population in the state’s facilities to balloon.

Last year, the crowding crisis reached the point that the Department of Children, Youth and Families transferred 43 men to an adult prison and temporarily stopped taking in new people at Green Hill.
Since Upton’s ouster, the state has opened Harbor Heights, a smaller detention facility on the grounds of a state prison in Aberdeen meant to relieve some of the burden at Green Hill. But lawmakers did little this past legislative session to provide systemic reform to address the situation.
Last week, a Washington appeals court ruled conditions at Green Hill, the state’s largest youth prison, violated state law amid reports of detainees being forced to urinate in jugs and go weeks without mental health counseling.
Contributing to the dilemma, according to Upton, was the 2022 closure of a third state detention center, the Naselle Youth Camp in Pacific County. In her claim, Upton said she learned of the plan to shut down Naselle on her first day on the job in 2021.
She said that she immediately expressed concern that Green Hill and Echo Glen couldn’t provide the capacity to make up for Naselle’s closure. Over the next few months, Upton asserts, she tried to show Ross Hunter, then the secretary of the Department of Children, Youth and Families, and Allison Krutsinger, the department’s public affairs director, how harmful the shuttering could be.
Upton said she proposed ways to address her concerns about looming overpopulation but her warnings went “unheeded.”
As early as September 2023, Upton, who had previously been the superintendent at Echo Glen, told agency leaders her fears were becoming reality. 
“The lack of capacity was causing unconstitutional treatment of youth and unsafe conditions for staff,” she writes in her claim.
Upton accuses Hunter, who faced calls for his resignation over his handling of the crowding issue, of lying about the deteriorating conditions being unforeseen given her warnings. And she says Hunter suggested she take the fall for criticism the agency was getting.
Hunter now faces a new class-action lawsuit claiming his decision to transfer the young men from Green Hill to adult prison violated their constitutional rights. He didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Upton’s allegations.
Last October, Upton alerted lawyers at the state attorney general’s office about what she says were Hunter’s “false statements,” but they didn’t respond, according to the tort claim. She also complained to the governor’s office of toxic work conditions and inequitable treatment of women and employees of color, leading to an investigation. 
Senn, who replaced Hunter in January, also treated Upton with hostility, according to the claim. Upton said she shared doubts about the plan to open the Harbor Heights detention facility, believing it would violate state law and be especially expensive.
When Senn fired Upton, the agency gave no reasoning for her ouster.

“I was retaliated against and wrongfully terminated for engaging in protected activities, including the reporting (actual and perceived) of improper governmental action,” Upton writes.

Speaking to the House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform, McBride said there are 115 properties in St. Charles County worth more than $1 million covered by a senior citizens tax freeze law. Many were built recently, including a $4 million home built this decade, she said.
And during June, she noted, a bill with caps on growth in tax bills for residential taxpayers in 97 counties exacerbated the problem. She likened it to the television and movie series “Jackass,” where dangerous stunts and potential injuries were the main attraction.
“It’s Jackass legislation, pardon my French, done on the dare, done to look good, to sound good, to capture votes, to put on a show, just like some kid on a trail bike lining up the barrels and trying to jump over them,” McBride said. “It ain’t going to work out. We’re going to hit the fence.”
Lawmakers need to reject anything that doesn’t deal with underlying issues in the tax system, she said.
“We need you to be the adults in the room at the Missouri General Assembly,” McBride said. 
McBride’s testimony opened the hearing, which was the last of six held across the state over the past three months. The committee was formed because aggravation over higher property tax bills has held the attention of state lawmakers for the past three years.
A last-minute change in the committee lineup caught both the chairman, Republican state Rep. Tim Taylor of Boonville, and the ranking Democrat, state Rep. Kathy Steinhoff of Columbia, unaware.
State Rep. Kemp Strickler, a Democrat from Lee’s Summit, was replaced by state Rep. Tiffany Price, a Kansas City Democrat, without explanation.
Under questioning from Steinhoff, Taylor said he had not received notice prior to the meeting that House Speaker Jonathan Patterson had made the change. 
“Rep. Strickler was a very valuable member of this committee,” Steinhoff said. “He was in the eye of the storm in Jackson County.”
Strickler, who drove to the Missouri Capitol Wednesday morning for the hearing, said he was not told why he was removed and only found out shortly before the committee was set to meet.
During the almost six-hour meeting, the committee was urged to change how taxes are levied and how values are determined. Members also heard complaints from the public, including allegations that vengeful assessors will punish property owners who challenge their appraisals. Representatives of agencies dependent on property tax asked that nothing be done that would reduce their revenue.
And, to close it out, committee members questioned Missouri State Tax Commission members and staff over policies and processes that have pushed assessors to increase residential assessments to reflect the rapid runup in home values.
State Rep. Tim Taylor of Boonville, chairman of the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform, listens Wednesday during testimony at a public hearing (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Taylor told members their work is not over as the hearing ended.
“This is by far not the last meeting,” Taylor said.
One idea the committee was again urged to adopt would require separate rates for the four classes of property — residential, commercial, agricultural and personal — that could be adjusted when assessed values rise faster than inflation.
Under the Hancock Amendment in the state constitution, when the value of property in a taxing district grows faster than inflation, rates are supposed to be reduced. But when one class of property is increasing faster than others, the effect is a smaller rollback than if the class of property had its own rate.
Another idea that came up again was requiring buyers to file information about the price paid for property — known as a certificate of value — to help assessors when comparing property values.
Some of the most dramatic testimony came from individual property owners trying to understand their assessments.
Jennifer Phanton of Grandview said the assessment on her home doubled in 2023. She found that the comparable sales used weren’t actually comparable, she said, and the assessment form listed improvements that had not been made.
She won her appeal, Phantom said, but it was a lengthy process.
“It’s just a lot because the onus is on us, it is not on the county, to prove the valuation,” Phanton said.
The increase was doubly hard to take, Phanton said, because her income was just above the threshold for the Circuit Breaker tax credit, available to people with a disability or who are 65 and older. 
The circuit breaker tax credit was established in 1973. People over age 65 and those who have a qualifying disability and rent their homes can claim a tax credit to offset property taxes of up to $1,055 if their income is less than $38,200. The credit for homeowners is up to $1,550 if they own their home if their income is less than $41,000.
If the credit is more than the taxpayer owes, the state will write a check for the difference.
Increasing the income limits and credit amounts is the best way to help vulnerable people keep their homes, McBride said.
Missouri law requires county assessors to estimate the value of every property every two years. The tax commission is responsible for making sure the values are within 90 to 100% of market value.
The commission sought to get counties to sign a “memorandum of understanding” when tax assessments fall behind that standard. Some counties are suing over requirements that residential assessments increase by up to 15%. That is the most home values can be increased without an inspection of the exterior.
Under questioning from the committee, Tax Commission member Greg Razer said the commission has acted to control the excessive increases in Jackson County.
Values below market hurt public services, he said. 
“We have to protect the entities that are receiving the tax dollars that the voters have approved, and so if you’re at 60%, eventually you’re not keeping up with inflation, and you can’t provide the same services,” Razer said.
Most of the counties asked to sign a memorandum of understanding have seen a rapid increase in home values in the past five years, said Steve Hobbs, executive director of the Missouri Association of Counties.
Part of it is people moving from high-cost coastal areas and part of it is investors looking for rental properties. 
But Hobbs, like McBride, warned against artificial controls on tax bills. 
“When you create a carve out for one entity,” he said, “you shift the tax burden to others.”
At the end of the hearing, Taylor asked members to make a list of the five issues they would like to see addressed in the committee’s report. The next meeting will be while the General Assembly is holding its special session on redistricting, he said, with a future meeting to finalize a report and prepare legislation.
“It is a big old bucket of stuff we have to digest,” Taylor said.

(Getty Images)Child care providers around Indiana will see reimbursement rate cuts of 10-35% as the state’s Family and Social Services Administration tries to close a $225 million funding gap.
The sustainability maneuver could push providers to drop out of a low-income child care program, however.
“We made this decision to protect the children and families that depend on (Child Care Development Fund) vouchers. There is only one pot of money — we could either protect providers or kids, and we chose kids,” said Adam Alson, the director of the Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning.
CCDF is a federal program that provides financial assistance via subsidies or vouchers to low-income families to help them pay for child care so parents can work or attend education and training programs.
The rate cuts weren’t an easy decision, Alson said, but the only other way to rein in spending would’ve been to cut the number of families in the program.
Right now, 55,000 children receive a voucher — above the pre-pandemic average of 35,000 participants.
Alson said former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration used federal COVID-19 dollars to raise rates and expand eligibility. The program peaked at 68,000 children, costing almost $900 million in state and federal funding.
When the pandemic assistance waned, the state tapped surplus money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program in fiscal year 2025 to cover the loss. But those funds are no longer available for CCDF, which means the state would have to pull from its General Fund to make up the difference.

The legislature set aside $147 million in additional dollars for the ongoing fiscal year — which started July 1 — to preserve income eligibility criteria for families already on the program. Lawmakers tightened the requirements for new enrollees.
The program is expected to cost about $400 million in fiscal year 2027.
To establish “equitable” reimbursement rates, the state received surveys from 25% of licensed child care providers and analyzed their cost data, arriving at reimbursement levels that “reflect current operating realities,” a news release said.
Rates for infant and toddler care, for instance, will drop by 10%. Rates for preschoolers between the ages of 3-5 will be cut 15%. And rates for school-age children will be cut by 35%.
The new rates go into effect Oct. 5, with the first pay date being Nov. 6.
Alson acknowledged some providers might drop out of the program.
“There’s definitely a possibility of that occurring. That’s part of the regrettable part of this decision, right? That it does affect business models of child care businesses throughout the state of Indiana. There’s no getting around that,” he said.
The change aligns reimbursements with federal regulations that require the rates to be sustainable, according to the news release. The federal government hasn’t notified the state of any compliance violations.
The cuts are the latest challenge for the program, which added a waiting list for applicants seeking services last December.
Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, has likened the waiting list to “a moral failure and fiscal disaster,” criticizing the Republican majority’s decision to expand private school vouchers to high-income Hoosiers during the last legislative session rather than boosting early childhood education for low-income residents.

We can hit someone else and hurt them. And it can bounce back at us, hurting us in the process. This lesson is often painful to learn.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear that the Michigan House of Representatives learned this lesson based on the recent budget it passed.
It would be easy to pan this House budget proposal as unserious. After all, a number of the cuts are in federal funds that are generally restricted in use to a single program or a few purposes. Cutting programs using these federal dollars doesn’t accomplish much for the state — they don’t always realize savings on the state funding side of the budget nor can we redirect the federal funds to other priorities. 
Instead, they simply sit in the state’s bank account or, worse, get returned to the federal government to be redistributed to other states. This results in nothing outside of harming Michiganders who rely on those state services. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the House Republican budget proposal is serious — it is seriously flawed and will result in serious harm. The cuts made under the guise of rooting out “waste, fraud and abuse” will — just like the harmful federal megabill passed earlier this year — affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of Michiganders. 
The stone thrown by this budget will break systems like health care, harm communities and the economy, dismantle support for K-12 schools and some of Michigan’s universities and hurt the Michiganders that lawmakers claim to represent. 
The House budget proposal doubles down on the tactics taken by policymakers in Washington in the federal megabill. The budget assumes the possibility of deep cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and provides no meaningful way to fill those gaps. More Michiganders will become sicker, families will go hungry, and our grocery stores, health providers and hospitals will all struggle. And in a state where some communities already lack a grocery store or an easily accessible hospital, these cuts will just make it worse. 
Ultimately, this will affect all 10 million Michiganders, who will have to drive farther to find healthy fruits and vegetables or a doctor who provides specialized care, will have to wait longer to be seen by primary care physicians for routine care, and will have to pay more for daily needs.
What’s worse is that the passed budget goes far beyond the federal cuts. It reduces funding for Double Up Food Bucks, which incentivizes SNAP beneficiaries to purchase fruits and vegetables by matching those dollar for dollar up to $20. This not only helps families remain healthier but also helps support local farmers who sell at farmers markets. It eliminates specific funding for universal school breakfast and lunch, which has been a huge success in ensuring kids have the healthy meals they need to learn and saving families money, instead rolling all of these dollars into a per-pupil payment. 
The budget proposal cuts funding and staff for various food safety programs, so it not only makes it harder to afford groceries and feed our families but it also makes it harder to trust the food we are eating is safe and won’t make us sick.
Michigan’s best ranking in the national KIDS COUNT Data Book this year was health, our only ranking where we fall in the top half of states at 22, and our budget can help support the health of kids and their families, beyond basic health care coverage. But the House budget reduces or completely eliminates support for important maternal and child health services, worsening birth outcomes and long-term health outcomes for kids. It also reduces or eliminates funding for environmental health programs, like safe drinking water, which are vital not only for the health of our community but also for educational outcomes. 
Michigan ranks 33rd for child well-being in annual report with education among the nation’s worst

When combined with the huge threats from the Medicaid cuts, this budget takes a huge step backward in basic health protections.
Policymakers in Washington threw a massive stone when they passed the harmful federal megabill earlier this year. At a time when grocery prices are already high and our health care system is already stretched, their decisions will only make things worse. And clearly some of our state lawmakers didn’t learn from Washington, passing a budget that further disrupts services we all rely on. This will ultimately have significant and long-lasting effects on our communities, our economy, our businesses and all 10 million of our residents. 
And it will be a painful lesson to learn.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2739-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-09-04 07:56:30.449768

Some farmers keep growing in flood- and drought-prone fields because subsidies soften the losses, while federal programs meant to help them change course have been underfunded and mired in bureaucracy. Under Trump, those programs may weaken further.

The seed tractor sank again, no surprise to Steve Williams. Everything sank out here on Dogtooth Bend in Southern Illinois since the floodwaters ran through five years earlier and dumped millions of tons of sand. The ground looked firm, but deep pockets of sticky mud lurked under the sun-cracked surface, pulling him under without warning.
He hit the gas. His wheels spun in place; sand flew. A few cuss words, too.
He called his daughter, Brandy Renshaw, working a nearby stretch of field in a giant green rig. She turned his way to pull him out; then she sank, too. Williams, in a faded plaid shirt, gray hair sprouting from under a John Deere hat, paced. Renshaw slammed the gearshift, rocked back and forth, and eventually clawed her way out.
It was June 2024, and both father and daughter knew the land they were trying to farm wasn’t going to yield much, even if they got the seeds in the ground. But this had become their routine: farming futile land just to keep from going under. For years now, they’d had one foot stuck in the mud, the other in government bureaucracy. They’d get angry — then laugh.
“What else could you do?” said Williams, 70. “We were left holding the bag.”
In these Mississippi River bottoms, federal farm policy became a trap. Farming is one of the most heavily subsidized industries in America. Each year, Congress allocates billions to keep crops in the ground, cushioning the blow from droughts, floods, fires and market swings — a safety net that dates to the 1930s, when the Depression and Dust Bowl put the nation’s food supply at risk.
But today, in some of the most flood- and drought-prone parts of the country, those programs can also keep people hanging on, even when it makes more sense to walk away. That’s increasingly clear along parts of the Mississippi River Valley and especially here in Alexander County, at the rural tip of Illinois. As the climate changes and as aging levees fail, the risk is becoming more predictable, the losses so frequent it is clear some land will no longer yield what it used to.
But the federal programs that support those changes — enacted first by President George H.W. Bush, then expanded by President Bill Clinton — have been small, slow and ineffective. After the 2019 flood — when the Mississippi River submerged the southernmost corner of Illinois for months, part of a widespread disaster across the Midwest — Congress allocated only about $217 million spread across 11 states to pay farmers to voluntarily retire their flood-ravaged fields.
Federal workers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which ran the program, specifically urged farmers at Dogtooth Bend to sign up. The floods had come here repeatedly and had worsened since they busted through the 17-mile levee that protected Williams’ farmland three years earlier. So Williams signed up, along with about 30 others on Dogtooth Bend, finally ready to call mercy to the river. He offered up roughly 1,200 acres; the federal government offered to pay him about $3,200 an acre to put permanent easements on his land, which he could use for recreational purposes but never farm again.

At the time Williams applied, the program had been offered only one other time in the past decade to farmers along the Upper Mississippi River, despite billions in lost crops. And this time around, the pot — just 1% of the $19 billion disaster aid package — wasn’t big enough to help everyone who applied, especially along this corn- and soy-growing region. And even for those who were accepted, the agency in charge couldn’t keep up with the paperwork, making the process stretch on for years.
The process dragged through the rest of President Donald Trump’s first term and through most of President Joe Biden’s. And now these programs look even less certain as Trump and Republicans in Congress double down on the status quo: expanding crop insurance and farm income supports through the budget bill signed into law on July 4 while — in an effort to trim the federal workforce — gutting the staff responsible for responding to climate disasters, including those who manage permanent easements that pull troubled farmland out of production.
While farmers have struggled to access funds to help them get off flood-prone land, federal programs to keep their crops in the ground have long been the safer bet. Over the past three decades, Illinois has received $35 billion in farm support — more than any state but Texas and Iowa — mostly through insurance subsidies and price supports for growing corn and soybeans. Some of that bounty is grown on flood-prone ground along the Mississippi and other river bottoms.
“At some point in time, don’t you ask yourself: Is this really economically the best way to spend our taxpayer dollars,” said Dave Hiatt, an easement coordinator and biologist with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, “or would it serve us better in the long run if we spent money to take that ground out of production?”
Hiatt is among the USDA employees on paid leave through September as part of the Trump administration’s plan to reduce the federal workforce.
ProPublica and Capitol News Illinois reached out to the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service on Aug. 15 with a detailed list of questions about how it handled the Dogtooth Bend easements across multiple administrations as well as its priorities going forward. The agency said it was working on a response but did not provide it in time for publication or specify a day when it would respond.
While Williams waited for the buyout to go through, his bills didn’t stop. He still owed a mortgage to the bank, taxes to the county. That left him and Renshaw with a choice: Either do nothing and watch their farm operation go under, or do what they’d always done. Even when it didn’t make sense anymore, they had planted their fields to maintain their federally backed crop insurance. Keeping that crop insurance allowed them to access other agriculture subsidies and disaster aid.
So they mounted their tractors and rolled out to their nearly barren fields.
“You can’t afford to leave it,” Renshaw said. “So we planted what we could and insured everything we could. It was a nightmare.”

It hadn’t always been like this. For decades, this Delta-like sliver of bottomland jutting into the Mississippi River at Illinois’ southern edge was “the garden spot of the county,” as Williams put it. He grew up farming alongside his dad and bought his first property on the peninsula in 1987.
At that point, the land on the flood-prone bend was still protected by the Len Small Levee, built in 1943 and named for an Illinois governor. The water broke through the first time in 1993, then again in 2011. But everyone recognized its days were numbered, and the state and federal government started paying people for their homes and businesses so they could move from harm’s way. That mitigated the risk, but it also meant that after floodwaters cut a nearly mile-wide hole in 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declined to cover the $16 million repair cost: With fewer people living there, the cost-benefit formula showed it wasn’t worth saving anymore.
Williams and the other farmers were devastated: When the levee was in place, Dogtooth Bend stayed relatively dry even when the Mississippi climbed well past flood stage — 33 feet at the nearby Thebes gauge. Since the breach, water spills into the peninsula every time the river nears that mark, and that happens often now, sometimes for weeks at a time.
As hopes of a levee repair fizzled, farmers were stranded. The federal easement program receives only sporadic funding, and typically only after a presidential disaster declaration, which Illinois didn’t get in 2016, despite widespread damage in Alexander County.
Predictably, Dogtooth Bend flooded again in 2017 and 2018.
Both years, from his office three hours away near Champaign, Hiatt and a small team of federal officials with the Natural Resources Conservation Service scrambled to come up with easement funds, even outside of a disaster declaration.
“We begged, we pleaded with headquarters,” Hiatt said. “We said, ‘We need these funds right now. These people have been this poorly impacted.’”

Federal records show that after floods in both years, Hiatt and his colleagues in Illinois proposed buying out up to 11,500 acres owned by 40 or so landowners on Dogtooth Bend over time, starting with the most severely damaged. The first phase would cost $20 million and was projected to prevent $60 million in near-term damages. The proposal laid out a strong case: Roads were threatened; habitat was disappearing; land was becoming more and more degraded. Thousands of acres had already become unfarmable — and while the reports also weighed the option of restoring the land, they noted that the farmland would never be fully productive, and the costs to keep bailing out farmers would only grow.
By this point, Trump had taken office for the first time, bringing in new USDA leadership. In both 2017 and 2018, Hiatt said, agency leadership in Washington rejected the requests by him and his colleagues in Illinois to help move farmers off the land. This wasn’t unusual: According to one nonprofit’s report, over 25 years, 90% of landowners in the Upper Mississippi states who applied for funding were turned down.
Environmental groups support paying farmers to leave flood-prone land because floodwater that spreads across farm fields washes fertilizer, pesticides and other chemicals into rivers, causing a range of down-river harms. But there’s an economic argument, too: A 2019 study in the science journal Nature Sustainability found that every $1 spent restoring floodplains by clearing them of development and farms can save at least $5 in future damages.
Despite this, the single largest agriculture program in the farm bill is intended to keep people on the land. That comes in the form of crop insurance premiums, an average of 60% of which are paid by the federal government.
In Alexander County, that is closer to 70%. More broadly, the costs of keeping people on their land there were spiraling upward: In addition to subsidies, there were millions more to clean up flood debris, shore up the levees, and fix roads and drainage systems. And still the floods kept coming.
Yet farmers were still planting. “They do the math,” said Silvia Secchi, a farm policy expert at the University of Iowa, about why farmers might keep investing in troubled land. “You and I would do the same math. If you want to stay in business, you do what makes you stay in business.”
For the father-daughter team of Williams and Renshaw, it was barely enough. “All the insurance did was keep people from going broke,” Williams said.
“You aren’t winning,” Renshaw added, “by any means.”
By the time the historic flood hit in 2019, the need to rescue the farmers at Dogtooth Bend was undeniable.

When the river finally pulled back, Williams no longer recognized the land he’d spent his life working. The levee breach had let the full force of the Mississippi pour through Dogtooth Bend for five months. It carved new channels, dumped dunes of sand and even sucked six barges off the main river and left two stranded in a field. People compared the scene to Mars. To the windswept dunes of “Lawrence of Arabia.” To Williams, it was “just a sickening feeling.”
Farmers in Alexander County claimed more than $7 million in crop insurance payouts that year — the highest on record. Roads were so mangled they had to be fully rebuilt. Trash and driftwood littered the peninsula. The damage made the case for a buyout harder to ignore.
If that case weren’t strong enough, the flood also put on display the benefits of letting the levee go. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ decision not to fix it had hurt the nearby farmers, allowing the water to spread out in Dogtooth Bend may have helped relieve pressure on the levee system across the river in Missouri and downriver.
Williams and Renshaw had come to terms with what that meant. Their land had been sacrificed so others’ could be spared. When Williams signed up for the floodplain easement program in August 2019, he figured he’d never farm Dogtooth Bend again. By that point, only about 200 of their 1,200 acres could still grow a crop. “But do it right,” Renshaw said. Instead, they fell into a broken system that left them farming nearly useless land while they waited five years for the federal government to complete their easement paperwork.

Williams knew the government moved slowly, but his first year’s wait seemed absurd. By year two, he’d nearly given up. By the summer of 2024, he was just plain disgusted. He checked in regularly with federal workers, calling the local officials he knew by name on their cellphones or popping into the local office in nearby Tamms. But the federal workers on the ground couldn’t tell him much other than his paperwork was still in process, under review with a federal official somewhere in another state thousands of miles from Dogtooth Bend. They were frustrated, too.
Danette Cross, who worked for the Natural Resources Conservation Service office in Alexander County until her retirement late last year, said most of the farmers knew her by name and often called her directly, expecting she’d have answers. But to get anything resolved, Cross had to run questions up a chain through a half-dozen people. “I’m not going to say the whole thing was a disaster — they closed on a lot of easements,” she said, “but nothing was timely.”
Hiatt, who had failed twice before to bring in funds for these farmers, tried again in 2019, this time banking their hopes on the emergency aid Congress had earmarked for the program. Hiatt said the Illinois team requested $24 million to buy out everyone who signed up at Dogtooth Bend. The payments are not full market value but allow farmers to invest in drier fields that would be less costly to the federal government in the long run.
But headquarters authorized just under $6 million, which it applied to the very worst fields. Williams’ land was hit hard, but it didn’t make the cut. That meant crop insurance and the other safety net farm bill programs would have to sustain him while he waited.
This wasn’t the only holdup. In 2018, Hiatt said, the agency had created a national team to handle land deals in an effort to improve efficiency. But he said it backfired.
“We were acquiring easements in 500 days” when the Illinois office handled the process on its own, he said. “Now we’ve got this specialized team — they’re taking 800. The math is not working there.”
The head of USDA’s Risk Management Agency, which oversees the crop insurance program, made a personal visit to the wreckage after the floodwaters receded in 2019. Martin Barbre, who led the agency for most of Trump’s first term, knew the area well. He grew up visiting his relatives nearby and himself farms just 100 miles away. In a recent interview, Barbre said he empathized with the farmers and wanted to ensure they got everything they were legally owed through crop insurance.
“I mean, you’ve farmed that ground your whole life. Your family’s owned it for, you know, probably for generations, and here it’s just gone,” Barbre said. He didn’t fault the farmers who kept planting while they waited for a federal buyout. “As long as they’re insured, they have the legal right to do that,” he said. “When I was administrator, I had a saying: ‘I want a producer to get every dime he’s got coming from the program — but not a penny more.’”
In 2020, the USDA leadership released additional funding to purchase easements on Dogtooth Bend. Williams bounced between the two programs. Each required new paperwork — and more time.
In 2021, at a meeting in Olive Branch, Hiatt faced frustrated farmers. “I took a beating,” he said. “And I was glad to take it, because it was poorly administered.”
Three more years passed, and no check had arrived for Williams. But the bills still did.
Although it could barely grow a thing, the county still taxed Williams’ land on Dogtooth Bend like it was prime ground — nearly $40,000 a year, according to Williams, calculated in part on farm productivity from across the state. That number would rise in each subsequent year, including on fields buried under 20 feet of sand. That’s because the rate wouldn’t change until the buyout went through and it was officially classified as conservation land.

As one of the poorest and fastest-shrinking places in America, Alexander County — population 4,600 — leans on farmers like Williams to fund basic government services and keep teachers employed in a school district with just over 300 kids. Farming in Alexander County accounts for $1 in every $7 in the local economy. And as more people move out of the county, there are fewer left to shoulder the tax burden.
Sean Pecord, who farmed on Dogtooth Bend not far from Williams, was one of the first to sign up for the buyout program in 2019; his land was the worst hit. “There was nothing left of it to farm,” he said.
“They work at their own pace,” said Pecord, who along with his wife also runs the nearby Horseshoe Bar and Grill. “If they were operating on normal business terms, they’d be bankrupt in a year.”
Pecord received his payment in late 2023, about four years after he signed up. Williams was finally paid last September. “It’s not what they did,” Williams said of the federal government. “It’s how long they took to do it.”
G. Pang, who lives in nearby Missouri and owns land on Dogtooth Bend with her six siblings, said they’re still waiting to get paid — and for answers. She used to call Hiatt’s personal cellphone when she wanted a status update. But today, the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has been hollowed out, with some 2,400 conservation staffers at home on paid leave through September under the terms of the federal buyout, according to a May report by Politico. Hiatt and his two federal colleagues who oversaw easement purchases in Illinois are among them, as are nearly half the staff of 30 who had been tasked with handling back-end easement paperwork as part of the agency’s national land team.
“Just going in there, taking a chainsaw, removing people and not knowing who you’re going to replace them with, you’re just creating a mess,” Pang said of staff cuts under Trump that have left her family in the dark.
Without the experienced staff, closing on these deals will take even longer, if it happens at all, Hiatt said.
“What’s happening now will never be reversed,” Hiatt said. “Once this is broken, which I don’t know if the break is complete yet, but it’s pretty fractured, I don’t think you can reset that bone.”
Several who joined the buyout were in their 70s and 80s. “They were devastated,” Renshaw recalled.
Williams’ health has deteriorated in the last few years. Macular degeneration has claimed much of his eyesight. Although he’s nearing retirement, he didn’t expect to go out like this.

One of the advertised benefits of the buyout program was that he could take the money and use it to buy farmland elsewhere. But by the time he had his check in hand and was ready to close on new land this year in Alexander County, prices had soared. That means the amount of money he agreed to when he signed on can no longer buy what he’d planned to use it for.
Williams is locked in to the 2020 rate, which is 50% lower than the maximum the government is paying today. If Williams had entered the program today, his land would be worth roughly $2 million more than he agreed to take.
“We could take two acres of that money and buy us an acre up here,” he said. “Now,” he said, “it takes at least three acres of that money to buy an acre up here.”
Part of him regrets signing the papers. The other part knows he didn’t have a choice.
“That monster is still down there,” he said of the river. “It will be back.”

However, it does not exempt money collected from student activity fees from the prohibition.","Some Mississippi universities have stopped giving money to student organizations for club activities due to uncertainty over a state law — on hold by a federal judge — that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools. 
It’s one of the first widespread, tangible consequences of a law that attorneys say will have sweeping ramifications across the state’s education system. 
A federal judge has blocked House Bill 1193 for the foreseeable future because he believes it may violate the First Amendment rights of students and teachers. The law will remain blocked until he issues a final ruling after a bench trial, something that will take months to complete. 
The law — which prohibits any programming and curriculum related to diversity, equity and inclusion — includes an exemption for registered student organizations. However, it does not exempt money collected from student activity fees from the prohibition.
The Institutions of Higher Learning, the board that governs the state’s public universities, said that student activity fees, despite being paid by students through their tuition, are considered state money. 
According to respective student newspapers, Mississippi State students pay a flat $25 student activity fee, while University of Mississippi students contribute $2 for every credit hour in which they’re enrolled each semester. 
“Universities are following state and federal law, including the First Amendment’s requirement that student activity fees be used in a viewpoint and content neutral manner,” John Sewell, director of communications for IHL, said in an emailed statement to Mississippi Today. 
The First Amendment to the Constitution protects freedom of religion, speech, the press, peaceful assembly and petitioning the government.
University of Mississippi leadership announced the decision to stop distributing funds to campus organizations in an email sent on Aug. 29 from Provost Noel Wilkin, in the name of “predictability,” no matter the outcome of the lawsuit. 
Instead of disbursing “Student Activity Fee” money to campus groups, departments such as the Office of Student Affairs and the Department of Campus Recreation will organize activities using those funds. Previously, there was a uniform process for student groups to apply for the funding. That process has been suspended. 
“The University is committed to providing a robust slate of student activities this school year with the use of the student activity fees that you pay, and those student activity fees will only be used to support and host student programming,” Wilkin wrote. “In our view, the student activity fee is your money that the university holds in trust for you to be used only for programing for students.”
Associated Student Body president Jack Jones expressed his disappointment in a statement shared to social media. He said the decision would have “serious implications” for campus organizations because they rely almost exclusively on the funds. 
“The [Student Activity Fee] was created by students, is managed by students, and is allocated to students — all to support activities for students,” he wrote. “Over the coming weeks, I will be meeting with student leaders from other Mississippi institutions as we work to ensure the SAF process is returned to the hands of students — where it belongs.”
Senior Calvin Wood, who serves in leadership roles for several University of Mississippi organizations, said the decision will devastate campus organizations. 
“It’s kind of the lifeblood of our student activities system,” he said. “A lot of us are pretty upset about this.”
Wood is afraid that without the funding, the University of Mississippi College Democrats will have a hard time putting on programming and getting people to attend events. 
“Last year, we had a catered Black History Month panel,” he said, as vice president of the organization. “A lot more people showed up because there was food. Now, things like that will be limited — food, guest speakers, swag. We’ll have basically no budget this year.”
Mississippi State University students were notified about a similar decision regarding their student organization funding last week. 
The Reflector, the campus newspaper, reported that the university’s Student Association told campus groups on Aug. 27 that it could no longer distribute funds due to the state law. That money will not be touched, student leadership said. 
In the meantime, student leaders are seeking solutions to finance campus organizations, such as contacting local businesses for fundraising nights and helping campus organizations set up budgets and bank accounts.
The Student Association allocated nearly $47,000 among 87 student organizations last semester. 
Attorneys argued in hearings over the summer that the law was already creating a “chilling effect” across the state’s public schools and institutions. In April, the University of Mississippi pulled its support for the annual Oxford Pride Parade, citing prohibitions in the new state law.

Wes Moore (D) said Wednesday he would be willing to accept help from the federal government to fight crime in Baltimore, just not through the deployment of National Guard troops as President Donald Trump (R) has repeatedly threatened.","Gov. Wes Moore (D), with Maryland Housing Secretary Jake Day, answers questions from media Wednesday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) said Wednesday he would be willing to accept help from the federal government to fight crime in Baltimore, just not through the deployment of National Guard troops as President Donald Trump (R) has repeatedly threatened.
Moore was responding to Tuesday comments by Trump during a rambling news conference in which he called Baltimore and Chicago crime “hellholes” that needed the presence of federal troops, a deployment he insists he has the authority to order, despite governors and a federal court saying otherewise.
Moore and Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott (D) have said repeatedly that rates of homicides and gun violence are declining in the city, but admit there is still work to be done.
Moore said Wednesday using the National Guard to fight crime, as Trump wants to do, would be “performative” and “ridiculous.” He said other federal agencies, such as the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, make more sense for crime-fighting.
“If you want to have a serious conversation about things that the federal government could provide that could be helpful, it could be FBI and ATF support … Those are always useful, and we’re still working in partnership with them,” Moore said in response to reporters’ questions at an unrelated event in Columbia.
“But I’m not going to do things just because it makes people feel good or because we think that people walking around in military fatigues and a long gun somehow makes communities safe,” he said. “Having members of the Guard picking up trash and raking mulch is not a useful spread of resources.”
‘Keep our names out of your mouth’: Moore defends Baltimore against Trump at Pimlico event

The trash and raking comment was a reference to the presence of National Guard troops that Trump deployed to Washington, D.C., last month. Guard members, from D.C. and other states, don’t have arrest powers, so some have been assigned to beautification duties, such as raking and trash pickup.
But Trump called the presence of federal troops in Washington a success, pointing to a drop in major crimes in the city since their deployment.
“It serves as a template – and we’re going to do it elsewhere,” Trump said of the troop presence.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, like Moore and Scott, has argued that crime was already falling in the city before the troops showed up. But she acknowledged this week that the federal presence has helped drive down crime rates even more, earning praise from Trump.
Bowser is in a tough spot, however: While governors control their states’ National Guard troops, the D.C. Guard is under the control of the president, who can deploy them for 30 days in an emergency. And as those 30 days draw to a close, it appears the GOP-controlled Congress is prepared to extend the president’s authority to keep troops on the street.
Bowser on Tuesday issued an executive order outlining a “path forward beyond the presidential emergency” for city officials to “ensure coordination with federal law enforcement to the maximum extent allowable by law within the District.”
It specifically named federal law enforcement agencies — the FBI, ATF, U.S. Park Police, Drug Enforcement Administration, Capitol Police and the Secret Service. Left out were references to the National Guard or the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who have also surged into the city, often masked and poorly identified as they make high-profile public arrests.
Bowser’s order said that in order to “maintain community confidence” in law enforcement, any federal authorities going forward should not wear masks, should identify their agencies and themselves as they make arrests or otherwise interact with the public.
When asked Wednesday if he would accept a National Guard presence, if it meant that help from other federal agencies would also be provided, Moore rejected the notion.
“I would hope the president is more serious of a leader than to say, ‘The only way I’ll give you something that’s useful is to give you something ridiculous,’” Moore said.
“The National Guard is not trained for this. The National Guard is trained for things like natural disasters and emergencies and deploying overseas,” he said. “I have too much respect for the members of our National Guard to put them on missions they are not trained for.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It’s the latest round in weeks of verbal sparring between Moore and Trump that has been been escalating since the president sent National Guard troops to the District.
It was revived Tuesday, when a reporter asked Trump if he planned to deploy the National Guard to Chicago. In his reply, Trump looped in Baltimore, describing both cities as “a hellhole right now” citing gun violence, homicides and other crimes.
Without saying when, Trump said he planned to send troops into Chicago — despite fierce opposition from the governor and mayor there — and insisted that “we have a right to do it, and that includes Baltimore.” But he also said it would be better if Moore and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker asked for the help.
“I would love to have Gov. Moore call, because I watched him over the weekend trying to explain, ‘Baltimore, what we need is housing,’” Trump said. “No, they don’t need housing. They need to get rid of the criminals
“These are hard-core criminals,” he said. “They’re not going to be good in 10 years, in five years, in 20 years, in two years they’re going to be criminals. They were born to be criminals.”
Moore, who had just announced an executive order Wednesday aimed at speeding government approval for new affordable housing developments, said it was “sad” that the president didn’t appreciate how reducing the state’s housing shortage plays into crime reduction.
“What we’re doing is actually working to reduce the stem of violence,” Moore said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_sept3_moore_trump_nationalguard_baltimore_edit2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 06:58:04.174429

Brown/Maryland Matters)When it comes to solving Maryland’s significant housing shortage, the Moore administration believes that time is of the essence — and that current state processes aren’t moving fast enough.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed an executive order Wednesday that aims to reduce administrative hurdles to new housing projects across the state and hasten the development of new units.
“This executive order can be wrapped up in one word – speed,” Moore said at a signing event at the Legacy at Twin Rivers housing complex in Howard County.
“We need to move faster to build new homes. We need to move faster to make homes more affordable and protect our renters. We need to move faster to create a housing market that is more competitive,” he said.
The executive order aims to fast-track housing development to reduce the approximately 96,000-unit shortage Maryland currently faces. That shortage was driven by “insufficient housing construction over the last 15 years,” said the order, which said the lack of affordable housing options has created an “imminent threat of widespread social and economic disruption.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Housing Secretary Jake Day take questions from reporters. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)
“We believe that housing is a foundation on which we will build everything else,” Moore said. “If you want to create wealth, start with housing. If you want to create jobs, start with housing. If you want to attract new businesses, create housing.”
To counter stagnating housing development, the order instructs state agencies to cut red tape in the approval process for new housing projects, prioritize development near transit, and identify surplus state-owned land for potential sites of new affordable housing development opportunities.
Moore added that environmental impacts and community voices will still be considered but that the state must “not allow process to institute paralysis.”
The order also creates a state housing ombudsman to oversee permit-approval processes and offer recommendations about where those processes could be improved. In addition, the Department of Housing and Community Development will establish housing targets for the state and each jurisdiction every five years, starting in January. The agency will also track the progress of jurisdictions.
Some of the priorities outlined in the executive order already exist in state law, but housing officials say the current framework must work faster to address the state’s housing needs.
“Housing doesn’t just happen. It’s planned, it’s designed, and it’s thoughtful,” Housing Secretary Jake Day said at Wednesday’s event. “We’re taking another critical step toward ensuring everyone in Maryland has access to a safe, affordable place to call home.”
Day gives county planners ‘pre-decisional’ look at 2026 housing priorities

The executive order follows Moore’s previous efforts to boost housing supply in the state – some that were successes and some, not so much.
During the 2024 legislative session, the General Assembly passed Moore’s three-pronged housing package to incentivize higher-density housing, among other initiatives.
But Moore did not fare so well in this past session, when he proposed legislation that tied housing development initiatives to areas with high job growth. It did not get its first hearing until March and quickly faced criticism from local officials. Lawmakers struck the original bill and replaced it with language that granted vesting rights for developers, among other measures. The legislation ultimately died in a Senate committee.
This year, the administration has already started workshopping “predecisional” bill language with county officials to get a conversation going well before the start of the 2026 legislative session.
“The reality is simple folks – without housing, we cannot solve the housing affordability crisis,” Day said Wednesday. “Nearly one in three Maryland families are cost-burdened by rent or mortgage payments. More than half of the renters in this state, 53%, are paying greater than 30% of their income just to keep a roof over their heads, and that is unacceptable.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A federal appeals panel has taken the unusual step of asking the New Jersey Supreme Court to weigh in on a constitutional challenge to a state law meant to protect certain public officials by shielding their home addresses and phone numbers from disclosure.
U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Stephanos Bibas said Daniel’s Law — passed in 2020 after a disgruntled lawyer fatally shot a federal judge’s son, Daniel Anderl, at their North Brunswick home — raises “a difficult First Amendment question that depends on an equally difficult question of statutory interpretation.”
“The questions are important and most suitable for the New Jersey Supreme Court,” Bibas wrote in a Tuesday filing. “New Jersey unanimously enacted the original version of this law in the wake of a tragic crime that made national headlines. The state has a strong interest in interpreting its own law — particularly if a federal court is unsure of its constitutionality.”
Bibas asked state Supreme Court justices to decide the narrow issue of “mens rea,” a Latin phrase that translates to “guilty mind” and essentially means wrongful intent. The federal appeals court will retain jurisdiction of the case and reconsider the constitutional challenge after the state justices decide if and how much Daniel’s Law requires a person or company to have acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently to be deemed in violation of the law, Bibas wrote.
The Supreme Court can accept or reject the 3d Circuit’s question, and if it accepts the question, will respond “as soon as practicable,” according to the rules of court.
The ongoing court battle started after state legislators in late 2023 amended the law to establish fines for violators of $1,000 per violation plus punitive damages, among other things.
Within months, the Atlas Data Privacy Corporation filed nearly 200 lawsuits claiming violations and seeking damages from data brokers who failed to take down protected people’s personal information within 10 business days, as the law requires. The corporation, which has about 19,000 subscribers, files claims on behalf of police and other people protected under Daniel’s Law and splits the damages with them if they win, according to Bibas’ ruling.
The data brokers responded by seeking to get the lawsuits dismissed and the law struck down as an overly broad, unconstitutional violation of their free speech rights. They argued that Daniel’s Law violates the First Amendment because it regulates speech based on its content and makes violators liable without proving ill intent.
A federal judge denied the dismissal motion in June, the data brokers appealed, and an appellate panel expedited the case and heard arguments in July.
In Tuesday’s order, Bibas noted that content-based restrictions on speech “can survive only if narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest,” Bibas noted.
The data brokers conceded that the law “serves compelling governmental interests,” the judge added. “Yet it raises hard constitutional questions because it restricts their speech and seems to make them liable without fault. To resolve this case, we need to know whether and what mental state(s) the law requires for liability.”
Bibas also noted that Daniel’s Law balances competing policy goals — protecting public officials from physical danger and fear just for doing their jobs while protecting residents’ rights to speak and learn about their public officials. The law has spurred dozens of challenges that risk conflicting court decisions without the state Supreme Court’s final word on the matter, he added.
“To resolve this case, we — and other courts facing similar matters — would benefit from an authoritative construction of the state statute by the New Jersey Supreme Court,” Bibas wrote. “Questions about the law are likely to recur. Certification will give us, litigants, other courts, and the public clear answers.”
A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office, which is defending the law, declined to comment. The New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association did not respond to a request for comment.
John Molinelli, a spokesman for the data brokers and a former Bergen County prosecutor, said Bibas’ ruling underscores that Daniel’s Law is well-intentioned but flawed. A federal judge in West Virginia last month struck down a similar law there as unconstitutional, Molinelli added.
A coalition of data brokers fighting the law “believes strongly that New Jersey public servants covered under Daniel’s Law deserve its protections, but a legislative solution is required to restore the law’s original intent and ensure its constitutional survival,” Molinelli said in a statement.
The 3rd Circuit can seek state Supreme Court guidance on questions of law in ongoing court fights if “there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute in this State,” according to court rules. The courts’ website lists nine times that has occurred in the past decade, with appellate judges seeking clarity on everything from the Consumer Fraud Act to furniture delivery regulations.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Concerns about election integrity, constitutionality and ballot length were among those raised at a public hearing Wednesday in Indianapolis, where voters and election officials weighed in on potential changes to Indiana’s voting system.
The meeting — the second in a series hosted by Secretary of State Diego Morales — was intended to give Hoosiers a chance to comment on proposals to shift municipal elections to even-numbered years and to expand the use of vote centers statewide.
They are required under House Enrolled Act 1633, passed by state legislators earlier this year directing the secretary of state’s office to study the scheduling of local elections and whether the state should require all counties to use vote centers.
Wednesday’s Indianapolis session followed a first hearing in Muncie last month. Three more are scheduled before the end of the year. The next is scheduled on Sept. 19 in Jeffersonville.











Nothing is set in stone. We want to make sure Indiana elections are secure, accessible and transparent.


– Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales



The office will provide the General Assembly with recommendations by Nov. 1, ahead of the next legislative session.
“We’re here to listen,” Morales said in opening remarks. “I want Hoosiers to have confidence that their voices are heard.”
The Republican secretary of state declined to take a stance on the proposals, however.
“I’m going to take all this feedback, compile the information and work with lawmakers. At the end of the day, the General Assembly will make the decision,” Morales told reporters after the meeting. “Nothing is set in stone. We want to make sure Indiana elections are secure, accessible and transparent.”
 Data highlights municipal election turnout

Data presented by staff from the secretary of state’s office showed lighter voter participation in municipal elections than in state and federal races.
The presentations won’t be posted online until after all public meetings have concluded, though.
In 2023, for example, turnout in Indiana’s municipal elections was about 27% statewide, according to data cited in Wednesday’s presentation. That compared with roughly 42% voter participation in the 2022 midterm elections and 61% in the 2020 presidential election.
The presentation additionally highlighted that of Indiana’s 4.7 million registered voters, fewer than 1.3 million cast ballots in the 2023 municipal elections.
In some cities, turnout dipped below 15%, while a handful of smaller towns saw participation above 50%. By contrast, presidential election years regularly draw more than 3 million voters statewide.
Officials also pointed to the spread of vote centers as a cost-saving and efficiency measure. 
Roughly two-thirds of Indiana’s 92 counties have now adopted the model, which allows voters to cast a ballot at any location within their county instead of an assigned precinct. Counties that switched reported average election cost savings of 10% to 15% compared with the precinct system, and wait times for voters on Election Day fell by about one-third, according to Morales’ office.
There are fewer voting locations in a voter center county but a voter can choose where they vote depending on what is convenient to their home, work or other errands. 
 Mixed reactions on vote centers, shifting municipal races

Even so, the vote center model drew mixed reactions. 
Several who attended Wednesday’s meeting pointed to increased convenience for voters who might not be able to get to a precinct polling place.
“Reducing the places you can go is not good for voters, because in Franklin Township … I had to wait in line for three hours,” said Cecilia Poynter, of Indianapolis. “If you work for a company like I did, where they can mandate you to work 12 hours a day, six days a week, you cannot make it to the polls. … For those of us that work long hours — whether it’s early voting or regular on voting day — poll centers are great.”
“But we need more (locations),” she added. “More for early voting, as well as on Election Day.”

Indiana Democratic Party Chair Karen Tallian, who attended the meeting and spoke during the public comment period, also emphasized that reducing the number of voting locations can also disadvantage Hoosiers in small towns if hours aren’t extended.
“Doing vote centers is sort of like closing lanes on the tollway. You’re going to use the same number of people and force them into smaller numbers of areas,” she said. “So, in order to accommodate that, you either have to do early voting for more days, or you need to increase the number of hours.”
Tallian noted, too, that Indiana communities with populations of 35,000 or less can already choose to hold municipal elections in even-numbered years. Ogden Dunes, her hometown in northwest Indiana, has already made the switch to even-numbered years “because it was cheaper for us.”
She urged the state to leave the choice about voting locations to local officials.
“We do not need a statutory change in order to do that. Small towns are already able to do that if they wish,” Tallian continued. “But we do not support in any way forcing larger towns and municipalities to do this during an even-numbered year.”
Questions were additionally raised about whether moving municipal elections into even-numbered years would boost turnout or simply bury local races beneath higher-profile contests.

Jennifer Lewis with the Vigo County Clerk’s Office pointed to possible ballot fatigue.
“One of my concerns is the size of the ballot. The ballot we had last year was already very large. If we added municipal races, it would have been at least two pages,” she said. “The confusion for voters who live outside the city would only get worse if municipal elections were added to the same ballot.”
While the ballot proofing process “is already very strict,” Lewis worried that adding more races “would make it even harder to ensure everything is perfect.”
“I feel like there’s more room for error when ballots get longer and more complicated,” she said.
Some additionally raised constitutional concerns about shifting election dates.
They noted that the Indiana Constitution repeatedly references precincts and sets requirements for how elections are to be conducted — and that local control and traditional precinct voting are constitutionally protected.
“Definitions matter,” said Ann Ihms, an elected precinct official from Howard County. “I’m an engineer, so the fact that it’s not stated constitutionally that this is appropriate, that should have been a no brainer, from the beginning, not to allow non-precinct voting.”
Morales said after the meeting, though, that the issue over constitutionality ultimately rests with lawmakers.
“I’m not an attorney,” he said. “That’s something the legislature and legal experts will have to determine. My job is to facilitate the process, gather feedback and present the information. The General Assembly will decide what is constitutional and what is not.”

(Getty Images)Amid a concerted effort by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to improve the state’s foster care system, some regions are still seeing significant challenges. 
When children enter the state’s child welfare program, it can mean that not only do they need a foster family placement but many of these young children need someone to represent and advocate for them in what can often be complicated and protracted court cases. 
These advocates are usually trained volunteers, and southwest Idaho is in need of more. 
The Court Appointed Special Advocate, or CASA, program is run independently of the state health agency and the courts, and the volunteer and staff CASAs are children’s advocates throughout their entire case. 
“We’re that one adult that’s always going to be there and check in on them every month and help them,” said Elisha Horrocks, executive director of CASA of Southwest Idaho.

The region is currently facing a shortage of CASA volunteers and foster families.
The organization operates as a standalone nonprofit with about 11 staff members and 90 volunteers, Horrocks said. Volunteers receive more than 30 hours of training and must pass background checks before they can serve on a case. 
Judges in child protection cases appoint a CASA, also known as a guardian ad litem, who will meet with the child or children in the case monthly and represent them in court if they’re too young to go themselves. 
CASA of Southwest Idaho — which serves the state’s third judicial district, encompassing Canyon, Owyhee, Gem, Payette, Washington and Adams counties — has supported an average of about 550 children. 


 How to become a CASA volunteer


Be 21 years or older.


Pass a background check with no history of sexual offenses, child abuse or neglect, or domestic violence.


Commit to around 8 to 10 hours per month advocating for foster children.

 Idaho Health and Welfare invested in improving the foster system. Not every region has seen improvements. 

In June 2024, the governor’s former budget chief, Alex Adams, took over as head of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and immediately announced a number of changes related to his laser focus on improving child welfare, the Idaho Press reported.  
As part of this effort, the agency sought and the Legislature approved an additional $23 million to the child welfare budget, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. A major goal was to improve recruitment and retention of foster families, as well as reduce the number of children entering foster care by boosting prevention efforts. 
Statewide, the agency went from a ratio of about 74 foster families for every 100 foster children in June 2024, to having just over a 1:1 ratio of families to kids, as of data provided Monday. State officials’ goal was to have more foster families than kids, so kids aren’t waiting on families. 
North Idaho has a ratio of about 1.45 families for every child, and East Idaho has about 1.6 families per child. However, the Southwest Idaho region has less than one family per child, at a ratio of about .85, as of Monday. 
Horrocks said she thinks there are many reasons for the declines the region is experiencing. The rates of child abuse are increasing, she said, and the severity of these cases takes a toll on volunteers. 
She said the positive messaging from the state health agency may also lead people to believe that the help isn’t needed. 
“A lot of what the department has come out with, is showing that that the foster system is doing good, and it made us feel a little unneeded, which isn’t the case for every district,” Horrocks said. “Some districts are doing very well. Our district is struggling.” 
The lack of available foster families in the area means some of the children are sent elsewhere in the state or sometimes out-of-state, which can complicate the advocate’s job.
“We can’t always get to see the kids in person and have that interaction,” Horrocks said. “We’re still speaking with them, but it’s Zoom, and these kids are young. It’s hard to keep their attention on Zoom.” 
Last year, more than 66% of children served in the program were under the age of 12. 
Despite recent challenges, many of the volunteers end up staying, Horrocks said. In the last fiscal year, the program had a 94% retention rate.  
“I think the volunteers see what the impact is that they have on these children’s lives,” she said. “And as hard as it is, it’s worth it.”

Jamie Wall, Jeff Smith and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein urged Republicans to schedule a hearing for their bill expeditiously. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Less than a month before the planned closure of two Wisconsin veterans’ housing sites, a handful of Democratic and Republican lawmakers are seeking a way to save the sites. But bipartisan work on a solution appears out of reach as lawmakers bicker over who is to blame for the lack of funding and over whether to take up Democratic- or Republican-authored bills.
Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced, shortly after the state budget was completed in July, that two Veterans Housing and Recovery Program (VHRP) sites, one in Chippewa Falls and one in Green Bay, would be closing on Sept. 30 due to a lack of funding in the state budget. One facility in Union Grove will remain open. 
The program, which is run under the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, serves veterans who are on the verge of or are already experiencing homelessness, including those who have been incarcerated, unemployed or have physical and mental health problems. Participants get access to transitional housing, referrals to service providers, financial assistance, assistance with seeking vocational opportunities and access to a room at a reduced rent for working veterans.
Participants can stay for a maximum of 24 months, but the average length is six to 10 months.
The program has been funded with a combination of an appropriation from the Veterans Trust Fund, payments made by program participants and per diem payments, which are made to the agency by the federal government at a current rate of about $71 per resident per day. However, growing staffing and maintenance costs at the facilities led to the need for additional state support. Evers had included a funding proposal in his budget but that was removed by Republican lawmakers.
Following the news of the closures, Sens. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) and Jaime Wall (D-Green Bay) introduced a bill that would dedicate $1.9 million to the sites.
At a press conference outside the state Capitol Wednesday, the bill authors and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) urged Republicans to schedule a hearing for their bill expeditiously.
Citing the upcoming closure date, Hesselbein said the Senate and Assembly must meet. She said committees could meet this week or next to hear the legislation and pass it out of committee this month and have the bill on the floor in October.
“It’s a cool day out here today. The weather is going to get worse. We need to take care of our veterans,” Hesselbein said.
According to the Associated Press, the state Senate is not planning to meet for a floor session this month. 
“It’s way past time to take action to keep these facilities open so they can continue to provide vital services to our veterans,” Hesselbein said, adding that “when Democrats have the power of majority which we believe is coming in just a few years, we will always have your backs.” Democrats are seeking to flip control of the state Senate in the 2026 election cycle. 
Smith called Republicans’ lack of action on the issue “callous,” noting that Democrats tried months ago to include the funding in the budget. When Democrats proposed an amendment to  fund the veterans’ housing sites in the state budget, every Republican voted against it except for Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken). 
It is unlikely that the Republican-led Legislature will allow Democrats’ bill to advance. 
“[Republicans] have ignored our pleas. As far as we know, we’re not going to see these bills on the floor this month, and this is the final chapter. This is when it ends. No hope for the veterans that they like to pretend that they care about,” Smith said. 
Jacque, meanwhile, began circulating his own bill last month to provide the needed funding for the facilities. 
The Republican bill, coauthored by Jacque and Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere), includes $1.9 million for the VHRP program as well as two other policy changes related to veterans. 
One would require the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin system to provide funding to the UW Missing-in-Action Recovery and Identification Project to support missions to recover and identify Wisconsin veterans who are missing. The other would lower the eligibility threshold for veterans and surviving spouses to claim the veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit.
Jacque said the two policies were also left out of the budget and are critical to helping veterans.
“Every budget has missed opportunities, and I am hopeful that the rest of the session will provide openings to address those challenges in a number of areas, particularly providing for our veterans who have done so much in service to our country and communities,” Jacque told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email.
Jacque said he has “found a lot of support” from his Republican colleagues and is “hopeful that the bill will be referred to the Senate Committee on Natural Resources, Veterans and Military Affairs,” which he chairs.
In response to a question about Jacque’s bill and whether Democrats are working with any Republicans to advance funding for the facilities, Hesselbein brushed off the GOP bill saying it simply pulled from Democrats’ ideas. 
“What Sen. Jacque did is he took three Democratic bills and pushed them all into one omnibus. We’ll be interested if he gets a hearing. I’m not sure…,” Hesselbein said. “I like to have clean legislation when we try to have committee hearings so you can hear exactly what’s going on with those bills, so we are supporting the bill that Sen. Wall and Sen. Smith put forth.”
Smith said Democrats separated the VHRP funding from other policies purposefully. Wall added that their bill is a “smaller, cleaner ask” than a bill with multiple items. 
Jacque told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email that he is “extremely disappointed by Sen. Hesselbein’s comments and her unwillingness to put partisanship aside for the sake of working to support veterans — as I did when I voted for the omnibus veterans motion her caucus introduced during the budget. I am rather surprised at her comments due to her longstanding penchant for putting forward omnibus bills and amendments.” 
Jacque noted that he has supported and authored legislation to expand the property tax credit for veterans and surviving spouses in previous years “going all the way back to my service in the State Assembly,” and has also supported previous UW MIA legislation. 
“I supported VHRP within the budget and it was not introduced as standalone legislation by any legislator previously to that, at least to my knowledge,” Jacque added. “I didn’t think Sen. Hesselbein was that unaware of the history of these initiatives.”
Not every Republican lawmaker has appeared open to providing additional funding that would be used to keep the two VHRP programs open. Following the initial news of the planned closures, Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee, blamed Evers for not negotiating for the money in the budget.
According to the Green Bay Press Gazette, Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) claimed last week that Evers had a “slush fund” — referring to federal pandemic aid — and should be able to find the money to keep the facilities afloat. He pointed to the Wisconsin DVA’s Veterans Trust Fund, a state fund that supports most grant and benefit programs for Wisconsin veterans, and said the agency has regularly returned around $1 million in unspent funds each year and in 2025, the agency sent back about $600,000.
WDVA Assistant Deputy Secretary Joey Hoey has disputed the comments, saying that the agency is “only allowed to spend the money they tell us to spend.” He has also said the trust fund cannot be used for the staffing costs and that there isn’t enough in it.
Wall objected to Wimberger’s “slush fund” comments as well on Wednesday, saying that federal American Rescue Plan Act money has been spent. ARPA funds were used to help support costs for the program in 2023-24. States had to expend the one-time ARPA funds by the end of 2024.
“[Evers] took some ARPA interest funds and used it to help prop up the program. Those funds don’t exist anymore. The ARPA funds all had to be allocated by the end of last year,” Wall said. “The ARPA interest money was all spent in the last budget, so that get out of jail free card doesn’t exist.”

The Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, planned for northern Maryland, continues to generate court challenges. (File photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)A federal district judge in Maryland ruled Tuesday that power company PSEG does not need protection from U.S. marshals to conduct land surveys for a controversial Piedmont power line project — at least not for now.
Since PSEG filed its petition last month seeking backup from the marshals, most of the landowners who were named as having blocked or threatened surveyors have pledged to cooperate with the survey, wrote U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson.
“Given the limited resources of the U.S. Marshals Service, the Court concludes that the circumstances — at least at present — do not warrant sending U.S. Marshals to accompany PSEG and its agents,” Abelson wrote in his order Tuesday.
Abelson did admonish two landowners who have not fully complied, giving them until Sept. 10 to explain to the court why they should not face monetary sanctions or civil contempt of court.
And he handed PSEG a victory Tuesday, granting the company access to survey about 150 more properties with defiant owners. It was a repeat of Abelson’s earlier ruling in the case, during which he approved PSEG’s request to access about 100 properties for wetland, forest delineation and archeological surveys. It was some of that first group of landowners whose antagonism toward surveyors sparked the request for protection from federal marshals.
They are the latest turns in a dizzying legal saga surrounding the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, a 67-mile transmission line proposed to cut through rural parts of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties. The project was commissioned by regional electric grid operator PJM, which has warned of power shortages in the years ahead unless additional transmission infrastructure is brought online to keep pace with rising demands for power from data centers, among other demands.

A passionate opposition has developed, led by landowners in the power line’s path, who argue that the massive towers will disrupt rural lands, including forests, wetlands, streams and farm fields.
The line still must receive a critical approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities. To assess the power line’s route, officials ordered a number of surveys, but many landowners proved uncooperative. That’s when PSEG sued for a court order that would let the surveys move forward.
Abelson sided with PSEG, ruling in June that its surveyors could enter private land to conduct surveys for the line. Opponents of the line appealed that ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has yet to hear the case.
Last month, meanwhile, the New Jersey-based transmission company asked Abelson to dispatch marshals to protect the process, citing six instances when combative landowners — or in some cases, their neighbors or other third parties — threatened its land surveyors.
In one incident, a landowner’s father nearly struck surveyors with an all-terrain vehicle, amid a verbal altercation that included racist insults, the company said.
In his order Tuesday, Abelson said that that landowner, Brandon Hill,  had expressed his “sincerest apologies” for the incident with his father on the ATV, in a letter written by his attorney. But Hill’s attorney never formally responded to the court, despite an order to do so, Abelson wrote.
Another owner pledged to cooperate — before telling the Frederick News-Post in an interview that he would “do everything in my ability to keep them off our property,” adding: “We will do it peacefully.”
Abelson ordered those two landowners to file responses by Sept. 10, explaining why they should not face monetary sanctions or civil contempt of court.
Abelson’s separate order Tuesday, granting PSEG access to survey a second batch of properties, means that the company can survey those properties simply by placing a notice on the front door 24 hours in advance. PSEG is expected to file another lawsuit seeking a court order to access the properties of a third round of property owners who have refused surveys.
In an August status report, PSEG indicated that it had completed about 150 surveys of varying types on the original list of properties, but it still had more than 200 surveys left to go.

The $54 million Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub would be among the largest CO2 banks in the U.S.
The post Crews drilled 3 miles deep in Wyoming, hoping to tap emerging CO2 storage market appeared first on WyoFile .","Crews have successfully drilled more than 18,437 feet to tap Sweetwater County’s Madison Limestone formation. The engineering feat, which took months, is a major step toward establishing what developers hope will be one of the largest carbon dioxide storage projects in the U.S.
At 3.5 miles, It’s the deepest Class VI carbon dioxide injection well in the U.S., according to project officials, and it is the second well completed for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project. It is part of the public-private Wyoming CarbonSAFE program, which aims to identify geologic formations to permanently store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities in the region.
The average depth for an oil or natural gas well in Wyoming is about 8,000 feet or 1.5 miles, according to industry sources. Anything more than 12,000 feet is considered “deep,” by industry standards. The deepest petrol well in Wyoming is nearly 26,000 feet, in the Madden formation near the Lost Cabin gas plant in north-central Wyoming, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming.
The first well for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub reached a depth of just over 16,000 feet.

“This deeper well gives us a more complete picture of the subsurface, reinforcing our commitment to building scalable, practical carbon solutions for Wyoming’s key industries,” Frontier President and Co-Chief Executive Officer Robby Rockey said in a prepared statement.
The new well, referred to as J1-15, will provide a wealth of new data to potentially confirm years of previous modeling, which has so far suggested the Madison Limestone is capable of holding large volumes of carbon dioxide. Targeting several geologic strata, the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub could hold more than 350 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to Frontier.
For scale, a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Carbon dioxide capture and storage vision
The University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy about 10 years ago on the CarbonSAFE Initiative. The vision is to advance the use of carbon capture technologies — filtering carbon dioxide from smokestacks — by providing a place to put the greenhouse gas.

It’s a major pillar of Gov. Mark Gordon’s Decarbonizing the West energy policy initiative, which he has said will help keep Wyoming’s fossil fuels in the nation’s energy mix while building a new commercial sector to reduce the nation’s industrial carbon dioxide emissions.
In addition to the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project, exploration and validation efforts are underway at Echo Springs in Carbon County and at the Dry Fork Station coal-fired power plant in Campbell County. Apart from the Wyoming CarbonSAFE efforts, Tallgrass Energy is exploring a carbon sequestration project in Laramie County.
Frontier Infrastructure, a division of Dallas-based Tailwater Capital, is the primary private partner for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub. The $54 million project is backed by about $43 million in federal money, according to project officials. It’s unclear, so far, exactly which companies and gas-emitting facilities might sign on to offload their carbon dioxide, but Frontier has indicated that local trona mines and soda ash processing facilities in the southwest corner of the state will serve as its “anchor” clientele. 
One potential client, the Project Bison direct-air capture partnership between Carbon Capture Inc. and Frontier Carbon Solutions, is no longer active, according to those familiar with the project. Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to ease emission regulations, many still see carbon capture and carbon storage as a growing industry in the U.S. and abroad.
Frontier Infrastructure, for its part, is dedicated to “empowering industries to meet their carbon reduction goals” and helping to ensure “that the region remains competitive in an evolving global market,” according to its website.
As for the security of existing federal funding for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub efforts, it is currently “obligated” through February, according to an SER official close to the project.

Draft bill would raise funds for trail-building and infrastructure projects as outdoor recreation grows in popularity.
The post Pay to pedal: Lawmakers propose state parks mountain bike user fee appeared first on WyoFile .","More and more, the crowds visiting Wyoming state parks like Curt Gowdy, Glendo or Sinks Canyon do so with mountain bikes in tow. 
Lawmakers and agency officials are looking to capitalize on the bicycle boom with a user fee. A draft proposal would authorize Wyoming’s Division of State Parks to charge bikers for a sticker or permit — with the money going toward projects to build or improve non-motorized trails.
These permits aren’t envisioned to break the bank: $10 seasonal permits for Wyoming adults; $20 for non-resident adults or $5 for a daily fee. The revenue, however, could help address a desperate need, advocates say. 
“We’ve got some real challenges with outdoor recreation, statewide,” said Wyoming State Parks and Cultural Resources Deputy Director Chris Floyd. “I think funding for non-motorized [trails] is at the top of our list.”
The Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife & Cultural Resources committee has begun drafting legislation that would create the program. The committee started discussing general user fees earlier this summer as a way to generate revenue to feed a growing appetite for trails. 
The bill would empower the state parks agency to designate state trails that would require a trail permit for cyclists. Rider permits could be checked or sold at entrance gates, with the funds funneled into a new account earmarked for non-motorized trail costs — including construction, signage and parking lots. 
The draft bill’s proposed fees target mountain bikers — both traditional and electric — because they present the largest demand, Floyd told WyoFile. 
“We receive more requests for bike trails than any other recreational infrastructure,” he wrote in an email. “The demand is high and growing, which cannot be said for many other types of recreation.”

A consequence of inadequate bike trail inventory, he continued, is the building of rogue trails, which can degrade the landscape. And, he noted, “bikers have expressed a willingness to pay a small fee, IF the funding goes to trails, which it would under this bill. We have not heard the same support from hikers and equestrians yet.”
Jerimiah Rieman, an avid mountain biker and author of the guidebook “Wyoming Singletrack,” has that willingness.
“I’m favorable to paying a fee if I understand that those fees are going back to mountain bike or trail-specific needs, whether that be construction, maintenance and other features that come with those trails,” Rieman said. If he had any feedback for the proposal, he said, it would be to expand the fee system to a larger network of registered trails outside state park lands. 
Mounting demand 
Outdoor recreation has been growing in popularity in Wyoming for decades, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating that trend as it spurred more Americans to spend time outdoors. 
That uptick brought record visitation to national and state parks in Wyoming and generated significant trickle-down revenue to shops, restaurants and hotels in the state.

It has also generated a demand for new outdoor offerings, especially bike-related ones. But those aren’t cheap: Trail construction costs about $100,000 a mile, experts say. 
Wyoming in 2023 created a trust fund specifically to pay for outdoor recreation infrastructure. However, the trust fund will take some time to mature, Floyd said. 
That’s where a user fee could come in. Wyoming has a robust motorized trails system designated for snowmobiles, side-by-sides and other vehicles with motors. Motorized users pay a fuel tax that helps fund projects, while snowmobilers pay a permit fee for a decal, which helps pay for the establishment, maintenance and grooming of trails.
State Parks wants to essentially adapt that model for non-motorized recreation, with a focus on bikes. The bill enables the agency to determine which park trails to charge fees for. It won’t make sense for all parks, Floyd said.
But two of the state’s most popular are also mountain biking destinations. Curt Gowdy located between Laramie and Cheyenne, which is home to 35 miles of trails, tallied roughly 560,000 total visitations in 2023. Glendo State Park, east of Casper and home to more than 45 trail miles, hosted 483,000 that year. 
If Wyoming enrolled its top three parks for bicycles right now, Floyd said, “we would see about $110,000 a year” in fee revenue. The state could expand the program in the future if it sees fit, he said. 
The bill also enables the agency to fund projects in the parks as well as within five miles of their boundaries. That allows it to potentially partner with land managers or other entities on projects, Floyd said.

Michael Kusiek, executive director of Wyoming Pathways, supports the proposal. He called the demand for trails in Wyoming “tremendous” and noted that when outdoor recreation infrastructure grants were opened in 2022, more than $70 million in requests came in for $14 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. Most of those requests were for trails. 
“So it’s by far and away the number one amenity folks are looking for,” Kusiek said. 
More outdoor rec dollars?
When it comes to the growth of outdoor recreation across Wyoming, Floyd said, his agency continually asks itself: “Where are we going to put all these people, without harming Wyoming’s resources, and how are we going to pay for it?” 
This bill, he said, provides that answer. 
Legislators on the travel committee are considering another mechanism to fund outdoor recreation. During an August meeting, the panel advanced a bill that would funnel some of the proceeds from online gaming into Wyoming’s outdoor recreation trust fund.

The resistance to Federalists’ hysteria about supposed French influence in American politics is history worth revisiting, writes columnist David Adler.
The post Madison and Jefferson looked to states, public opinion to resist federal oppression appeared first on WyoFile .","When confronted with the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts on July 14, 1798, which Thomas Jefferson and James Madison viewed as an untrammeled attack on the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, as well as the republican system itself, they turned to familiar constitutional guardrails — Americans’ fierce defense of their rights, public opinion and the powers of individual states — to preserve our foundational liberties.

Opinion

The Federalists’ hysteria about supposed French influence in American politics led to prosecution under the terms of the Sedition Act, despite First Amendment guarantees ratified just seven years earlier, for criticism “bringing either Congress or the President [John Adams] into contempt or disrepute.” Federalist prosecutors took dead aim at newspaper editors of the Republican press — sympathetic to Vice President Jefferson — and various public officials, including Rep. Matthew Lyon of Vermont. Lyon and others were sentenced by federal courts to nine months in prison. Vermont voters, however, were not deterred by Lyon’s conviction and reelected him to the House of Representatives while he was in prison.
Jefferson, who characterized the Federalists’ tenure as “the reign of witches,” met with Madison in Virginia to discuss responses and remedies to the repressive measures. Jefferson believed that “with a little patience,” and “the spells dissolved,” that the people would recover “their true sight” and restore “their government to its true principles.” They believed that it was necessary to let the Federalist hysteria run to the point of arousing popular disgust, but that both the people and the Republican press needed a rallying point, perhaps a statement of principles that could focus the public’s sentiment against the administration.
In terms reflective of opposition strategies that resonate across time, Madison and Jefferson agreed that public opinion could be spiked through use of state legislatures, which they believed could be the most effective organs of protest. In their own time, from the run-up to the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence, the use of assemblies to issue protests and resolutions was a common practice. In retirement, after serving as vice president and president, Jefferson continued to believe in the strength and vitality of states as defenders of rights and liberties. 
In 1811, Jefferson wrote to a European philosopher that “the true barriers of our liberty in this country are our State governments; and the wisest conservative power ever contrived by man, is that of which our Revolution and present government found us possessed. Seventeen distinct States can never be so fascinated by the arts of one man, as to submit voluntarily to his usurpation. Nor can they be constrained to it by any force he can possess.”
While American history does not reveal the wholesome record that matches Jefferson’s idealism about the virtues of states, his point is crucial: States have the potential and power to thwart federal repression of our civil liberties, human rights and a host of actions that offend our constitutional democracy, including executive usurpation of power. Madison and Hamilton shared Jefferson’s recognition of the capacity of states to preserve our Constitution. 
Writing 10 years earlier, Madison declared in 1788 that even in the absence of specific constitutional guarantees of the rights of individuals, these were secured by “the limited powers of the federal government and the jealousy of the subordinate governments.” He said that “state legislatures were sure guarantees of the people’s liberty,” and urged the right of states to “interpose” their opposition to unconstitutional federal measures. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Papers 26 and 28, had asserted similar, and even stronger statements. “It may be safely received as an axiom of our political system that the State governments will, in all possible contingencies, afford complete security against the invasions of public liberty by the national authority.” He emphasized that states can “communicate with other states” and “unite for the protection of their common liberty.” This united front suggested possible courses of action in the face of federal menace.
Hamilton wrote, perhaps prophetically: “The State legislatures, who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from the federal government, will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national government, and will be ready enough, if anything improper appears, to sound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the voice, but if necessary the ARM of discontent.”

(Courtesy of the Center for Rural Affairs)OMAHA — A federal program to help boost small rural businesses would be extended and enhanced under a bipartisan bill to be introduced Thursday by U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and a Democratic colleague from Minnesota.
The Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program — created in the 2008 Farm Bill and overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — provides low-interest loans to eligible development organizations. Those funds fuel revolving loans that provide help to qualified rural microenterprises.
Currently, the program relies on annual appropriations. The Senate proposal pushed by Ricketts and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., would extend the program for five years so it no longer would require annual approval, a Ricketts spokesman said.

“Our bipartisan bill gives rural innovators more tools to expand their businesses and create jobs,” said Ricketts. “By expanding opportunity, we can help grow Nebraska.”

The measure also would increase the maximum amount a rural microenterprise may borrow, from $50,000 to $75,000. It would raise from 75% to 100% the cap on the federal source share of a project’s cost. 
Center for Rural Affairs continues to fight for small farmers, but scope now much broader

The bill specifies that a project loan can’t cover more than half of demolition, construction or related costs of real estate improvements
Smith said that too often, residents of rural communities can’t access financing they need. “This bipartisan legislation would help them get their businesses off the ground with federal loans and technical assistance,” she said.
Kalee Olson, policy manager at the Center for Rural Affairs in Nebraska, applauded the effort, saying such programs need to evolve “to serve the changing needs of rural entrepreneurs.”
Companion bipartisan legislation was recently introduced in the House. Efforts to include the program in the next Farm Bill continue, the Ricketts team said, but Ricketts wanted a way to ensure continued growth of the program.

Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) at a news conference during the 2025 General Assembly session with Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll). (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Add Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) to the list of Republicans kicking the tires on a run for governor.
Hershey, who has a dozen years in the Maryland Senate, said in a radio interview Wednesday he is being encouraged to consider throwing his hate in the ring, following the entrance of Ed Hale Sr.
“I think Maryland Republicans deserve better than to have lifelong Democrats switch jerseys at the last minute and try to claim our nomination,” Hershey told WBAL Radio, adding that Republicans “know the difference between conviction and convenience.”
“Families are being crushed here by higher taxes and rising energy costs, a governor that’s focused on Washington more than Annapolis,” he said. “So, I think it’s more clear now than ever that Marylanders deserve leadership that’s rooted in authenticity and opportunism, and that’s where I think Ed Hale was going with his campaign.”
Hershey did not respond to attempts to reach him Wednesday.
Hershey has been rumored to be considering entering a Republican field filled with candidates who changed parties, and a cast of others who have little to no electoral experience and even less in a statewide campaign.
Hale, a lifelong Democrat, switched parties and re-announced his campaign last month, after telling reporters he had no shot at defeating incumbent Gov. Wes Moore in a Democratic primary.
Since then, Hershey has criticized Hale. The businessman in return said he didn’t know who Hershey was.

“I’ll tell you this, the number of calls and texts and messages I’ve received from, you know, not just Republicans, but independents and moderates across the state, since Hale’s announcement, saying: ‘Steve, we need a real Republican and somebody that’s stood up for us consistently.’ That type of encouragement is humbling, and I’d be lying if I said it hasn’t made me think seriously about the next step,” Hershey told WBAL.
“So, I’m being thoughtful about this decision. I want to make sure that if I take this step, it’s done the right way. I’ve spent my career standing up for fiscal discipline, reliable energy, accessible health care, safe communities, and if Marylanders believe that’s the kind of leadership they want in the governor’s office, then I owe it to them to take a serious look at it,” he said.
Hershey has electoral experience, but his district is made up of rural counties. It is unclear how quickly he could pull together a statewide campaign and fundraising apparatus.
He would need to decide quickly. Every day he delays is one less day to raise funds. Like all legislators, he is barred from fundraising activities during the General Assembly session.
There is also the unknown — primarily will former Gov. Larry Hogan seek a third term and a head-to-head matchup with Moore.
So far, the official Republican primary field consists of John Myrick, who previously ran an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate, and Carl A. Brunner Jr., a Carroll firearms instructor. Both formally filed for the GOP nomination.
Hale has yet to formally file, and cannot do so until he picks a running mate.
Two others — freshman Del. Christopher Bouchat (R-Frederick and Carroll) and Carroll County farmer Kurt Wedekind — have said they intend to run. Like Hale, neither has formally filed.
Wiggins moves up at Chamber
Grason M. Wiggins has been promoted to senior vice president of government affairs at the Maryland Chamber of Commerce in recognition of “exceptional leadership” and his role “in delivering one of the most successful legislative sessions in the organization’s recent history,” according to a chamber release.

Wiggins, who joined the chamber in August 2024, “elevated our advocacy to a new level with a clear strategy and strong results,” said chamber President and CEO Mary D. Kane, in announcing the promotion. “Thanks to his leadership, Maryland businesses were protected from a devastating 2.5% services tax, unlimited liability exposure and costly climate mandates.”
The chamber said it “achieved a 93% success rate” in stopping legislation it targeted in the 2025 General Assembly, when it said it connected more than 5,000 business leaders with policymakers and brought more than 400 business leaderss in for testimony and committee engagement.
The chamber also credited Wiggins targeted job fairs and outreach to connect Marylanders with jobs, and strengthening relationships statewide. Before joining the chamber, Wiggins was at Harris Jones & Malone, the Maryland Multi-Housing Association and the Maryland Department of Labor. He holds a J.D. from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
“I’m honored to continue to work with Maryland’s legislators, employers, and workers to ensure our state is generating economic opportunity for every Marylander,” said Wiggins, who will continue to lead chamber advocacy in Annapolis as senior vice president.
Get your scorecards out — it’s already endorsement time
The primary election may still be almost 10 months away, but that hasn’t stopped candidates in the Montgomery County executive race from trotting out the endorsements they have already lined up for the job.
The latest came Wednesday, when Progressive Maryland and Working Families Party announced their support for County Council Vice President Will Jawando (D-At-Large) to receive the Democratic nomination for county executive.
Larry Stafford Jr., executive director of Progressive Maryland, said that in a Democrat-rich county like Montgomery, where the council is all-Democratic, “there’s an important distinction we have to make between Democrats who have a backbone and Democrats who have a spine to stand up straight and walk straight and look with a clear vision to fight on behalf of everyday people. That’s Councilman Will Jawando.”
It came a day after Jawando said his campaign had qualified for the county’s public financing option, raising more than $90,000 from almost 1,000 contributions, least 80% of which came from county residents. He said Wednesday his plafform includes affordable housing, fully funded public schools and a challenge to the Trump administration “recklessly slashing” government funding.

	“We have an opportunity in this election … to show a community where we reject the false narrative that if my neighbor can eat, that I can’t eat,” Jawando said. “That if my neighbor does well and gets rental assistance, it’s going to make my life worse. We can stand up for a community where everyone does well together and reject the divisiveness of Donald Trump.”
But Jawando will face at least two County Council colleagues: Andrew Friedson and Evan Glass (D-At-Large).
Friedson who was endorsed in July by the International Association of Firefighters Local 1446, has also secured the support of some heavyweight state legislators from the county : Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) and Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery), who chairs the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee.
Also this summer, Glass announced the backing of two major Democrats in former Rep. David Trone and former U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, who called Glass “the effective, progressive leader we need right now to fight against the extreme agenda in Washington that is hurting our community and our country.”
Glass, who was the first openly LGBTQ+ member of the council when elected in 2018, would become the first as county executive, if elected.
Two other Democrats have officially filed the paperwork to seek the nomination for county executive in the June 2026 primary: Celeste Iroha, a registered medical assistant, was the first person to announce in March, according to Bethesda Today, while Mithun Banerjee, a landlord from Silver Spring, filed his candidacy in May.
As of Wednesday afternoon, no Republicans had filed for the seat, according to the state Board of Elections. But candidates have until Feb. 24 to file.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSC_0010-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 06:58:04.174429

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Tennessee is appealing an order by a federal judge that permanently blocked a portion of state law that made it a crime to help minors obtain an out-of-state abortion.
The so-called 2024 “abortion trafficking of a minor” law created a misdemeanor offense for an adult who “intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports a pregnant unemancipated minor” for an abortion or to obtain abortion-inducing drugs for a minor. The law does not apply to parents, guardians and those with their written permission.
The law was challenged in July 2024 by state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat and social worker, who has publicly advocated for abortion rights, and Rachel Welty, a Nashville attorney who describes herself as an “advocate for safe and healthy access to abortion care.” 
In July, Senior United States Circuit Judge Julia Gibbons issued a decision permanently enjoining the recruitment portion of the law. Gibbons concluded it was a clear violation of First Amendment rights, noting in her decision that the law criminalizes only one side of speech about abortion.
Tennessee Senate passes bill making it a crime to aid a minor seeking an abortion

The law does not define the term “recruit.” Lawyers for the state argued it meant “a targeted inducement of a minor for a specific purpose — obtaining an elective abortion without her parent’s or guardian’s consent.” Behn and Welty argued it meant “encouragement, persuasion and ‘put(ting) out the word’ that an option was available.”
Either way, Gibbons concluded, the provision was unconstitutional. 
Tennessee’s near total abortion ban, which took effect in 2022, has meant those seeking the procedure have had to travel to states where it remains legal. 
“Tennessee cannot criminalize ‘disseminating information about an activity that is legal in another state,’ wrote Gibbons, who sits on 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but presided over the Nashville case after several other federal judges recused themselves from the case.
The fate of the recruitment portion of the law now rests with the 6th Circuit after a notice of appeal was filed by the Tennessee Attorney General in late August. 
Nashville attorneys Daniel Horwitz, Melissa Dix and Sarah Martin, who represent the two women who filed the lawsuit, have also filed a “cross appeal,” citing in legal filings precedent for using such appeals as a “backup plan” in case the judgement in the case is reversed.

(Photo courtesy of Devon Young Cupery)An administrative law judge in Madison heard arguments Wednesday in a case contesting Wisconsin’s approval of Enbridge’s proposed Line 5 pipeline reroute. Members of the  public testified, followed by an expert witness in geology and hydrology, who questioned aspects of the reroute plan. 
The lawsuit, brought by Clean Wisconsin and Midwest Environmental Advocates (on behalf of the Sierra Club of Wisconsin, the League of Woman Voters of Wisconsin and 350 Wisconsin), challenges permits allowing the Canadian oil company to move forward with rerouting the Line 5 pipeline around the Bad River reservation in northern Wisconsin. Wednesday’s hearing followed the opening day of testimony in Ashland and was one of a series of hearings  scheduled through early October. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is challenging Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources permits for a Line 5 reroute, which was designed to fix a legal problem with the existing pipeline after a federal court found that it trespasses on tribal land. Attorneys for the Band, environmental groups and Enbridge testified at the hearing.

Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline has been a polarizing issue, with one side arguing that it’s crucial for energy independence and jobs in Wisconsin, while the other points to a history of leaky and ruptured Enbridge pipelines causing ecological damage, a national need to transition away from fossil fuels, and the company’s years-long trespass on the Bad River Band’s sovereign land. 
Public testimony Wednesday drew  people from both sides of the debate. “The loss of Line 5 would have devastating impacts on the propane industry,” said Connor Kaeb, an associate manager with GROWMARK, which Kaeb said is Wisconsin’s fifth largest provider of propane. Kaeb stressed that farmers and northern Wisconsin communities depend on affordable and easily accessible propane. Shutting down Line 5 could cause “immense strain on the entire propane system in the region,” he said. 
Tabitha Faber, who spoke against the pipeline, said that the reroute would cross more than 100 waterways, and that even though it avoids the Bad River Band’s reservation, that the pipeline remains in the Bad River watershed, continuing to endanger the Band’s natural resources. Faber recalled visiting sites along the reroute path and seeing bald eagles and wood turtle  habitats. Faber also said that the pipeline’s construction and operation could wash invasive species into new and sensitive habitats, including within the Bad River reservation. Steve Boas, a Madison resident, also spoke against the project, calling the more than 70-year-old pipeline “an accident waiting to happen.” 
The American Petroleum Institute called the relocation project “essential to maintaining Wisconsin’s energy reliability.” The Institute claimed that rerouting Line 5 will create more than 700 jobs, adding that the pipeline has heated homes and businesses, aided agriculture and enabled transportation for decades “without any issue.” In contrast, Third Act Wisconsin — a group of older Americans concerned about climate and democracy — echoed concerns that Line 5 would threaten high-quality wetlands, the Bad River watershed as a whole and even Lake Superior.

Access to clean water is a crucial asset for Wisconsin, environmental groups testified. Tourism generates $378 million in Bayfield, Ashland, Douglas, and Iron counties, while also supporting 2,846 jobs, all in the area near Line 5, according to Clean Wisconsin. 
“For decades, the Bad River Band has been sounding the alarm about the unprecedented risks posed by Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline,” Ellen Ferwerda, who leads Third Act Wisconsin’s work on Line 5, said in a statement. Despite “a myriad of scientists, economists, environmental groups, and citizens” who’ve spoken out against the pipeline, “the DNR summarily dismissed these concerns and issued a permit allowing Enbridge to begin construction of a reroute around the Bad River Reservation.” 
“It feels like the Bad River Band is being punished for standing up for their legal right to protect the watershed their culture and livelihood has relied on for centuries,” she added. Julia Issacs, co-facilitator of Third Act Wisconsin, said in a statement that “we should be decommissioning old and dangerous pipelines, not investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure.” 
Most of Wednesday’s hearing was dedicated to grilling William Joseph Bonin, a licensed senior geologist with Midwest Geological Consultants. He produced a report in May 2025 that pushed back on assessments made by experts from the DNR and Enbridge. 
Bonin raised a multitude of concerns, particularly around how construction of the pipeline could affect springs, aquifers and groundwater. He pointed to the presence of glacial sediments, which make it difficult to predict how water flow could be affected. Bonin recalled one 2018 project in Minnesota, where a gas pipeline was installed along a roadway near adjacent springs. The springs disappeared, and then other springs showed up in a parking lot on a private property, he said. Springs and aquifers that help feed nearby wetlands and other adjacent habitats could be affected by pipeline construction, he testified, and cutting trenches to construct the pipeline could also lead to increased erosion.

Bonin said the risk of aquifer breaches is higher than what had been assessed, and questioned how the presence of already fractured rock layers could be altered by the use of blasting in constructing the reroute. He also pointed to the possibility of “thermal impacts” to waterways, including high-quality trout streams which are sensitive to temperature changes. “Blasting is going to have a larger impact than the expert reports discussed and the reason for that is the already fractured bedrock was not taken into consideration in the reports,” Bonin said. “The effects of blasts, especially on fracture networks, may be permanent,” he added.  “The basted rock is never going to be restored.” This, in turn, could have a ripple effect on how water moves and behaves in the ground around the pipeline reroute, he testified. 
Attorneys representing the DNR and Enbridge took turns cross-examining Bonin. They discussed knowledge gaps Bonin had regarding the wetland aspects of the permits, and argued that methods like blasting and trenching are very common construction practices for all sorts of projects from pipelines to roads.  Enbridge’s attorney pointed out that, while  Bonin has reviewed and analyzed the effects of blasting, Bonin himself has not worked in the field. 
Another hearing in Madison is scheduled for Friday, Sept. 12, at the Hill Farms State Office Building. On Sept. 15 and 19, there will be  hearings in Ashland at the Northwood Technical College Conference Center, followed by more hearings in Madison on Sept. 22, Sept. 26, Sept. 29 and Oct. 3.

The case in question has turned into a focal point in the debate over whether persons convicted of violent crimes as juveniles should be punished as adults.
Murrill said Wednesday she filed a motion with justices to allow the state to execute Dale Dwayne Craig for the Sept. 14, 1992, murder of Kipp Gullett, who was taken at gunpoint and shot to death at a secluded construction site. 
Craig was seven days shy of his 18th birthday when he murdered Gullet, an 18-year-old LSU freshman.

Simmons, involved Christopher Simmons, 17, who was convicted of killing Shirley Cook weeks after the two were involved in a minor auto accident.  
In her filing for the Craig case, Murrill told the Supreme Court she considers the Roper precedent “egregiously wrong” but said she recognizes it requires justices to deny her motion. The attorney said she was submitting the motion “for preservation purposes only” so that evidence from the Craig case would be retained for use in her challenge.
Craig and Simmons were among about 70 juvenile defendants nationwide who had their death sentences converted to life in prison without parole after the Roper ruling.
“There is no basis in law or logic for that absurd result,” Murrill said in a news release. 
In May 2023, East Baton Rouge Parish Judge Eboni Johnson Rose granted Craig parole eligibility, citing his record of good behavior and role in prison mentor and rehabilitation programs. 
Murrill’s office has challenged Jones’ action, arguing before the Louisiana Supreme Court last month that the callous nature of Craig’s crime 23 years ago warrants the utmost consequences. There is no timeline for a ruling in that challenge. 
Attorney John Landis, who represented Craig before the Louisiana Supreme Court, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.   
According to court records, Craig and three teen accomplices carjacked Gullett in the parking lot of Kirby Smith dormitory at LSU. After they forced Gullett back into his Ford Bronco, they drove to a construction site south of campus. 
Craig and James Lavigne, 19, took Gullett out of the car, and Lavigne hit Gullet in the head with the butt of a 9 mm handgun. After Gullet collapsed to the ground, Craig kneeled down to fire three shots into his skull at point blank range then stood and shot him again twice. 
Craig told the others he had to kill Gullett because one of the teens had called another by his name.
Gullett’s body was found two days later, and all four suspects were arrested within the next five days.
Lavinge was sentenced to life in prison for second-degree murder. Zebbie Wayne Berthelot, 16, and Roy Maurer, 17, were in the Bronco when Craig was killed. Both pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were issued 20-year prison terms.
All three testified against Craig when he was tried for first-degree murder in exchange for sentence leniency.
Louisiana resumed executions earlier this year after a 15-year hiatus during which the state was unable to secure the drugs needed for lethal executions. Jessie Hoffman, 46, was put to death March 18 at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, becoming the first person in the state put to death using nitrogen gas.
Hoffman was 18 when he kidnapped, raped and murdered 28-year-old Mary “Molly” Elliot, who he abducted from a New Orleans parking deck and then took to rural St. Tammany Parish where he assaulted and killed her.
More than 50 people await execution on Louisiana’s death row.

(Photo by Greg Childress/NC Newsline)The state’s affordable housing needs are getting a boost from federal tax credits, tax-exempt bonds and a state loan program.
The financing will help build and rehab 5,012 privately owned and managed affordable apartments — worth nearly $1.5 billion — in more than two dozen counties, according to the N.C. Housing Finance Agency.
Of the 50 projects that will benefit from the awards, 4,150 apartments are for families and 862 for seniors. As many as 500 apartments will be targeted for people with disabilities. The majority of the apartments will be new buildings but approximately 420 will be preservation projects.

The projects were chosen from among 74 full applications reviewed by the North Carolina  Federal Tax Reform Allocation Committee and selected based on recommendations by the Housing Finance Agency, which administers the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program.

“We’re excited with the results for this year and looking forward to another strong cycle next year,” Scott Farmer, executive director of the N.C. Housing Finance Agency, said. “We’ll just continue to promote affordability. This is housing that’s much needed in all of these communities and anything we can do to support additional resources for housing is a good thing.”
North Carolina faces a shortage of 322,000 rental units through 2029, according to a recent study —  “2024 Housing Supply Gap Analysis, State of North Carolina” — commissioned by N.C. Chamber Foundation, N.C.Home Builders Association and N.C. Realtors. Overall findings show an expected gap of 764,000 total units, including 442,000 units for purchase.

The Low Income Housing Tax Credit program is widely viewed as the nation’s best tool for creating and preserving affordable housing. The awards are administered by states’ housing finance agencies through a competitive application process. The Internal Revenue Service sets general guidelines for the program.
Workforce Housing program awaits legislative funding
Twenty-eight of the selected properties were awarded $34.7 million from the Workforce Housing Loan Program, which was established by the N.C. General Assembly in 2014 to encourage development of apartments using the housing credits in low-income counties and to reduce rents in moderate- and high-income counties.
The Workforce Housing Loan Program isn’t funded moving forward but Farmer said he hopes lawmakers will fund it before the end of the year.
“Without that, the Workforce Housing Loan Program, it’s going to dramatically change where deals will work,” Farmer said “That’s a critical resource for doing properties in low-and moderate-income counties. The Workforce Housing Loan Program was really designed to help some of that funding gap to make deals work better in those more rural communities.”

Affordable housing advocates also are closely watching state lawmakers to see if funding for program is restored when the General Assembly adopts a state budget for the 2025-2027 biennium. Lawmakers passed a “mini budget” in late July to address critical spending needs.
“We want that funding to be restored,” Stephanie Watkins-Cruz, director of housing policy at the N.C. Housing Coalition, said during one of the group’s recent housing calls. “We want to make sure that the projects that are part of next year’s cycle in North Carolina have the gap financing they need.”
The Workforce Housing Loan Program has been funded at $35 million each of the last two years. Funding uncertainty will likely cause developers to skip over rural counties in favor of more financially feasible areas, Watkins-Cruz said. Nearly every new project approved demonstrated a need for gap financing, she said.
“Without the Workforce Housing Loan Program, without this gap financing, we’re putting likely hundreds of units at risk, and this will mean it will limit the ability for affordable housing units and developments to actually happen in rural areas and recovering areas.”
If funding isn’t restored to the program, Watkins-Cruz said more affordable housing will be concentrated in better-heeled urban areas which defeats the program’s purpose.
The Workforce Housing Loan Program is also an essential tool for Hurricane Helene recovery, Watkins-Cuz said.
“Without it, housing in some of the hardest hit areas like Polk, Rutherford, Avery, Watauga and Henderson counties, may not be viable, which impacts the ability of the workforce and community members to return home or remain in the area,” Watkins Cruz said.
Agency loans totaling more than $12.2 were awarded to 11 properties under the Rental Production Program, which uses state and federal funds to improve economic feasibility for rental developments.
The projects awarded federal tax credits and other financing awards are expected to support 21,960 jobs and generate $95.3 million in state and local tax revenue, according to the Housing Finance Agency.
In a post on its website, the N.C. Housing Coalition noted that between 1986 and 2023, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program has stimulated both the state and local economies, generating more than $21.3 billion in wages and business income and more than $7.7 billion in tax revenue for the state.
Since its creation, the Housing Finance Agency has financed more than 321,320 affordable homes and apartments totaling $34.4 billion.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The number of active voters in Colorado has grown by just under 50,000 between January and July of this year, but more voters are opting to be unaffiliated than register as a Republican or Democrat.
A recent analysis from the New York Times found that Democratic voter registration declined in every state between 2020 and 2024, while in many of those states Republican registrations grew. In Colorado — where a voter does not need to be registered with a party to vote in primary elections — both parties have seen further reductions since the start of 2025.
Both parties saw reductions of total membership in the state of less than 1%, but the number of Democratic party voters declined slightly more than Republican voters. Unaffiliated voter registration across Colorado grew by 3.1%, while Democratic registration dropped by 0.9% and Republican registration dropped by 0.77%.

The vast majority of voters who are registering for the first time or updating their registration do so through automatic voter registration at the Division of Motor Vehicles, according to Aly Belknap, executive director of Common Cause Colorado, a pro-democracy organization with branches in about two dozen states. People who register through the DMV are automatically registered unaffiliated, but Belknap said voters are able to update that to join a party. 
Belknap said voters opting to be unaffiliated aligns with “a trend we’ve seen steadily over the last decade” after Colorado opened up its primaries. Over the last three presidential election cycles, the national approval ratings of the Democratic and Republican parties have reached “historic lows,” she said.

“I think that’s really a driving force for many Coloradans, as well as many Americans because this is a trend that we’re now seeing nationally, even in states with closed primaries,” Belknap said. “This is I think a driving reason why folks are moving away and deciding to register unaffiliated and forge a path on leading with the issues that matter mostly to them and choosing the candidates accordingly.”
Voters’ trust in government is also at a historic low, Belknap said, which affects peoples’ willingness to engage with democracy and elections. 
Unaffiliated voter registrations have been steadily on the rise since November and peaked at 2,029,337 in July, growing by more than 60,000 voters since the start of the year.
Immediately after the November election, Republicans saw a slight uptick in registrations in Colorado between the end of November and December, but the number of voters affiliated with the party have slowly declined each month since. The number of voters registered as Republican hit a high of 943,564 in December and have dropped to 936,002 by the end of July. 
The Colorado Republican Party did not respond to a Newsline request for comment. 
Consistent across congressional districts
The Democratic Party’s high since the November election was at the end of November, when 1,050,789 Colorado voters were registered with the party. Democratic registrations dropped to 1,036,115 in July after gradually declining each month since. 
Voters across the country “are feeling disillusioned and apathetic,” according to Andrew Nicla, Colorado Democratic Party communications director, and “the toxic national discourse has left many questioning whether either party is truly fighting for them.”
“These voter registration numbers are a snapshot, not a sealed fate. Colorado Democrats didn’t blow a $1.2 billion hole in our state budget or cut health care and food assistance for working families,” Nicla said, referencing the federal tax and spending bill’s effect on Colorado’s budget. “There is a clear contrast between our vision, and the damage done by Colorado Republicans in Congress and in our state.”
Party affiliations are consistent across Colorado’s eight congressional districts, too. 
In Colorado’s battleground 8th Congressional District, where Republican U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans defeated former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo by less than a full percentage point, the number of Democratic-affiliated voters has decreased more than the number of Republican-affiliated voters has: Between January and July, the district has seen a 0.06% reduction in registered Republican voters compared to a 0.33% reduction in registered Democratic voters. 
A priority over the next 10-15 years will be to implement automatic voter registration through Medicaid, Belknap said, meaning people seeking Medicaid in Colorado would “have the same benefit as folks who are getting a driver’s license.” The Colorado Legislature approved a bill that would have implemented that process in 2019, but the federal government has not made the changes needed to allow it. 
While political parties and candidates may not be engaging with voters as much during an off year, Belknap said nonpartisan voter registration organizations are still out within the community registering voters, but not pushing for any particular party. She would “love to see the voter registration numbers continue to increase” going into 2026 when there are more local and national elections on the ballot, both in the spring and fall, she said.

In a state so heavily dependent on coal, expansion into artificial intelligence could be a means of diversification. But WVU understands that AI has great potential for good — or evil. In this vein, last year the legislature created an AI Task Force in the governor’s office, consisting of legislators, cybersecurity and others. It is tasked with developing “best practices,” as well as general monitoring of the industry.
AI should not be a partisan issue. The authors have very different views of the world. One of us is a Republican, the other a Democrat. One has a military background; the other does not. But we agree on basics, including — a) we should all be able to exchange ideas in a peaceful and respectful manner and b) there are numerous pressing issues facing our nation which must be addressed in a bi-partisan fashion.
One such issue is AI development which will evolve positively or negatively for humankind. We should all be concerned about AI taking our jobs and even destroying our civilization.
Mechanize is a San Francisco start-up founded by young AI experts. A co-founder stated, “We want to get to a fully automated economy and make that happen as fast as possible.”  He is talking about white collar jobs.
One of the founders said he expects it to take 10-20 years while the other two think 30 years is more realistic. The effects on the social fabric of our society do not appear to be a consideration. They apparently have no concern for developing a social safety net or the impact on humankind. Their only concern is to make current jobs obsolete as quickly as possible. That is efficient — but also very irresponsible, unethical and immoral. Clearly, there has not been enough scientific analysis of this topic.
And the Mechanize folks are not the only ones who see this coming. Per the CEO of Amazon, “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” 
Combining AI with quantum computing is imminent but concerning. “A quantum is the smallest possible discrete unit of any physical property. It usually refers to properties of atomic or subatomic particles.” Each amplifies the other’s strength creating perhaps the most transformative technology ever. 
Quantum computers can process vast combinations of data. The power of quantum computers far exceeds that of our current computers. The concern is “Will the combination of AI and quantum computers eventually go rogue?” Watch the 1984 film “Terminator” again to get one possible answer to that question. The film, in large part, demonstrates the potential danger of unconstrained artificial intelligence. In that film, a future AI network attempts to go back in time to trigger a nuclear war with the goal of permanently ending humankind.
Developers are addressing the risks of rogue AI behavior with a mix of technical safeguards, organizational practices and policy simulations including:

Guardrails and alignment techniques to ensure AI systems behave in line with human values.
Crisis response protocols to try to intervene when needed.

But the many unregulated AI models could easily create toxic compounds. Deepfakes, impersonations, cyberattacks and even drone manipulation can be used by a bad actor in a garage or basement.
Experts are using simulations to make AI behave badly thus identifying issues. And results are very frightening:  

AI models are increasingly evading safeguards via deception.
Models chose blackmail to pursue their goals.
Some models were willing to cut off the oxygen supply of a worker if the system was at risk of being shut down, even if instructed otherwise.

Developers aren’t in agreement as to how AI should be tested and controlled to prevent rogue behavior. There’s growing consensus on the need for safeguards, but the methods, priorities, and philosophies vary widely across organizations and countries. Plus, there are far too many developers and countries involved to enforce constraints worldwide. A foolproof kill switch must be required for all AI applications. However, it currently doesn’t exist.
We don’t want to sound alarmist, but Paul Revere might have had a point — except it is AI instead of the British. Our future depends upon how humans choose to develop an entity that has potential to reshape or eliminate civilization. Our defense hinges upon being prepared, layered defenses, and rapid coordination — all of which seem woefully deficient at present.
Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, has stated, “AI is likely to be either the best or worst thing to happen to humanity.” What we do now could literally be vital for the survival of humanity. Instead of our political leaders in West Virginia and Washington, D.C. arguing about cultural flashpoints like trans athletes and pronouns, our nation should be addressing the pending AI crisis in a bipartisan manner.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)If you’re wondering what the shelf life is for us to care about school shootings, the answer is five days.
On Wednesday, Aug. 27, Annunciation Church in Minneapolis was filled with grade-schoolers to celebrate the first day of school when a shooter opened fire from outside. A 10-year-old boy told reporters, “It was like, shots fired and then we kind of like got under pews. They shot through the stained glass windows, I think, and it was really scary.” He then described how he’d done active shooter drills in school but never in church.
A few weeks ago in Louisville, a woman was shot to death while walking a child to the school bus stop. This followed a shooting at a Louisville bus stop the previous week when shots were fired and, luckily, no one was injured. 
Ask yourself how long it takes for you to move on from the horror of schoolchildren being shot at or shot to death before an internet flood of news and social media washes it away: vaccines on hold at the CDC, Gavin Newsom tweeting “good night, grandpa!” at the president, troops on the streets of D.C and heading to Chicago, the great Cracker Barrel logo kerfuffle.
In addition to thoughts and prayers, Republican talking points after a school shooting now include hardening schools (i.e., provide more draconian security measures, like a prison) and that we need to address mental health. 
Let’s start with mental health. This year in the Kentucky legislature, Senate Bill 235 was filed, a repeat-filing of 2024’s Senate Bill 13 to temporarily remove firearms from those in a mental health crisis. 
Neither bill received a single hearing. Why? Because there was zero public pressure to do so.
Republicans also say that we need to harden schools, but our schools are already hardened. We have school resource officers. Doors are deliberately locked. Many have camera surveillance. There are strict lockdown procedures and our kids are required to practice hiding and being silent to save their own lives from a shooter beginning in pre-school.
A school administrator recently described to me how sickening it feels to run these drills, to grab the intercom and yell, “LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN” while hearing doors slam and lock and the school building go silent. 
Our kids are being terrorized and shot to death in school, in churches, on school athletic fields and at the bus stop. Consider the absurdity of “hardening schools.” Would a prison-like atmosphere promote the joy of learning? How do you harden a football field on a Friday night? Do we need to cover the stained glass in school churches with bulletproof glass? Shall we design bulletproof cages around the bus stops? 
Call your representatives, they say, call your congressman, write to your legislators.
There was a church shooting in Lexington this summer in which two were killed and two seriously injured. On July 21 at 3:42 p.m. I emailed leadership in Frankfort — Senate President Robert Stivers and President Pro Tem David Givens, House Speaker David Osborne and Speaker Pro Tem David Meade — writing in part, “Every year, several gun violence prevention bills are filed in good faith by members of both parties. And those bills never see the light of day because leadership buries those bills, bills that could save lives. James 2:26 — ‘For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.’”
I received no response.
Following school shootings and other mass shootings, Republican lawmakers regularly go on television to say “it’s not the guns, we need to address mental health.” So, why are mental health bills related to gun violence rarely, if ever, considered?
Because House and Senate leadership — not your representative lawmakers — decide which bills get a hearing; leaders at the state level are beholden to the national party; national party leaders are beholden to the gun lobby; and the gun lobby represents gun companies who want to do what? Sell more guns, make more money, donate money to the Republican Party.
This is how government works. This is why elections matter.
The shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis happened on the first day of school, a Wednesday. I emailed my national editor about doing a story, and he said he’d get back to me on Friday. But Friday was the start of Labor Day weekend, so we did not connect until Tuesday morning. 
By Tuesday, five days had passed. Tuesday was too late. The news cycle moved on because the American public moved on. 
Our time limit for caring about kids getting shot to death in school is five days.

Education leaders and critics said that while they understand the need to raise expectations, they are concerned that the results of adjusting cut scores — used to determine whether K-12 students are meeting proficiency levels — could negatively impact equitable access to education, lead to teacher burnout, and decrease graduation rates.
Before seeking the Board of Education’s final approval, VDOE stated at the board’s Aug. 28 business meeting that it plans to provide a modeling and impact analysis using this year’s assessment results to determine how each school division would have performed under the proposed recommended cut scores. 
The objective, established by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, is to better align the cut scores with the rigor of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to help students improve their thinking skills and use different skills together when solving problems.
The action is part of a larger plan approved by the General Assembly and Youngkin to revise the state Standard of Learning  assessments (SOLs) but it has met pushback from some including school division superintendents who say they don’t have enough information about the process.
“Without a thorough understanding of how these cut scores were developed and determined and their impact, our students, parents and educators will not have the transparency needed to fully embrace these new goals,” Scott Brabrand, executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, said at the board’s Aug. 28 business meeting.
During the spring, a standards-setting committee comprising teachers and instructional specialists was established to develop cut-score recommendations for review by the Board of Education in June, with a final decision anticipated in July.
In response, Board of Education President Grace Creasey, a Youngkin appointee, told the Mercury that the work was not completed under the leadership of former superintendent Lisa Coons, who resigned in mid-March.
“The work was never done and that was uncovered,” Creasey said, adding that once the board and agency started the process of setting new standards, they realized “going to look for that work, it hadn’t been done.”
However, Creasey said she believes the board will approve the cut scores no later than October. The board’s subsequent two business meetings are on Sept. 25 and Oct. 23.

 The recommendations

As projected, the standards setting committee and Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson proposed a significant number of proficiency increases, mostly for reading.
A score of 400 has been the standard for passing the assessments for several years.
However, in grade 4 reading, the committees recommended increasing the proficiency minimum to 444, up from 400. The superintendent recommended raising it to 449. In Algebra I, the committees recommended increasing the proficiency minimum to 445, up from 400. The superintendent recommended raising it to 453.
The updated performance standards will not take effect until spring 2026.
Carol Bauer, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that the association has been calling on the board “for months” to model how the proposed cut score changes would impact graduation rates. She added that after other states adjusted their cut scores, they found “measurable impacts” and that Virginia can run a similar analysis. 
“It’s indefensible that the board refuses to look at the data and it suggests an unwillingness to face the real impact these changes could have on Virginia’s students,” Bauer said.
VASS, in its statement last week, urged the agency and board to publicly share the full methodology, modeling, and impact analysis of the proposed SOL cut score changes before making any final decision.
They also requested that the state hold harmless graduating seniors taking the assessment test this year, considering the proposed higher score requirements. VASS said under the proposed plan to change the scores needed to pass, students who take their exams in the fall might have different score requirements compared to those who take the same tests in the spring.
The association is also asking the agency to clarify the proposed changes to the mathematics SOL test scores, including the number of items that need to be correct to achieve proficiency on each test, and how they align with the recently passed legislation on mathematics placement, and ask that the locally verified credit score of 375 remain in alignment across all grades and courses.
While the agency prepares an analysis for the board and public, Gullickson said school divisions can use last year’s assessment data to draw their comparisons. She said members of the agency will also meet with division leaders to address questions and “really make sure that they understand what the differences are in data, (and) where the supports are needed.”
Gullickson added, “We want to really take in both the requests from the board, requests from public comment, and others who have just said, ‘can we just make sure that this rollout is really thoughtful.’”
Regarding the concerns about the cut scores, Creasey stated that she does not expect the “drastic hits” that are prompting outcry from some education leaders, parents and advocates. 
“Former board members continue to beat the drum that if we make these changes, kids are going to fail, they’re not going to pass, they’re not going to graduate,” Creasey said. “I just don’t think that’s the case at the level that has been expressed.”

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, helped launch the latest congressional effort to create more affordable housing solutions in the commonwealth and across the country by introducing the Yes In God’s Backyard Act. The measure would allow faith-based organizations to develop housing on unused land they already own and help fund the effort.
A 2020 legislative study found that nearly a third of Virginia households spend over 30% of their income on housing costs, and there’s a severe lack of affordable housing options statewide. Housing stock has not kept pace with population growth, a state study found. Housing affordability and supply issues are most often locally-rooted, but with an estimated shortage of 4.5 million homes in America according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Warner’s measure has national relevance. 
If it were to become law, the bill would provide technical assistance and grants for faith-based organizations, higher education institutions, and local governments that want to increase the supply of affordable rental housing by constructing or preserving it on their property. Households “at or below 60% of area median income” levels, along with people who are “homeless or at risk of homelessness, including veterans” would be key beneficiaries of the programs.
The logic is that faith-based organizations like churches, synagogues, and mosques or nonprofits in some cases already own underdeveloped land that could be filled in with housing. Some higher education institutions may also be in similar positions. The law would also help these groups bypass barriers by “assessing and removing local policy and procedural barriers to and adopting best practices to encourage the development of affordable rental housing,” in localities.
“If we want to make housing more affordable, we need to get creative and take advantage of opportunities that already exist,” Warner said in a statement. “The YIGBY Act is about breaking down barriers and giving faith communities and colleges the support they need to put their land to work creating safe, affordable homes.”
Like-minded efforts were introduced at the state level in Virginia in recent years, but they did not survive the 2025 legislative session. 
A bill from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield — who is also running for lieutenant governor — and Sen. Kannan Srinivasan, D- Loudoun, would have granted localities the authority to adopt strategies to encourage affordable housing development on properties that religious organizations or nonprofits own. The idea was later scrapped by the Senate’s finance committee.
Many housing policy decisions in Virginia are made at the local level, so state lawmakers have presented a series of successful and unsuccessful measures to encourage development without overstepping local authority. 
Lawmakers at all levels of government continue exploring policy that might spur or speed up development, with Virginia housing experts and lawmakers weighing in. 
Greta Harris, CEO of Richmond-based Better Housing Coalition, told Congress last summer that housing pinches can also strain local economies. 
“Businesses in both urban and rural areas struggle to attract and retain talent because workers can’t afford to live nearby,” she said. 
After Warner unveiled other housing-supply proposals this summer, state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, noted that solutions can be “solved fastest if all three levels of government are working together, and each level of government can bring something different.”

(Photo by Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)The Trump administration has given notice that political appointees, rather than scientists, will ultimately decide who gets grant money from the world’s largest biomedical research funder — the federal government’s National Institutes of Health.
In an Aug. 7 executive order, President Donald Trump announced that political officers would have the power to summarily cancel any federal grant, including for scientific work, that is not “consistent with agency priorities.” Senior officials should not “routinely defer” to recommendations from peer reviewers, who have provided the backbone of federal science funding for eight decades.
NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya reinforced the message in an Aug. 15 internal memorandum stating that political priorities may override the scoring system provided by outside experts appointed to hundreds of review panels.
“While the score and critiques an application receives in peer review are important factors in determining the scientific merit of a proposal,” his memo stated, NIH institutes and centers should not rely on the scientific merit rankings “in developing their final pay plans.”
Like ongoing conflicts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Reserve, NIH scientists told KFF Health News, the disruption of the peer review process represents an attack on agency expertise that the country has relied on for decades.
Although the priorities of top agency staffers have always influenced some NIH funding, those people were nearly always career scientists in the past. By downgrading its peer review process, the NIH could allow political appointees who now occupy key positions to stop grants that typically would be funded, and to fund grants they prefer that don’t necessarily meet rigorous scientific standards, a dozen current and former NIH officials told KFF Health News.
Bhattacharya’s guidelines “open the door to the politicization of NIH research,” said Jenna Norton, a program officer in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
“Peer review is fundamental and makes sure we’re doing the best science,” she said. “If you’re going to ignore that, the political appointee gets to make the final call.”
NIH spokesperson Amanda Fine said that peer review would continue to be the cornerstone of the NIH’s funding decisions but that funding would become less dependent on reviewers’ rankings of grant proposals.
This will “ensure consistent, transparent, and strategic funding decisions that align with the agency’s mission, maximize public health impact, and responsibly steward taxpayer dollars,” she said. Trump’s executive order said peer reviews would be “advisory” only.
Grants to scientists at universities and other research centers make up about 80% of the NIH’s $48 billion budget, with the rest funding internal NIH research. Since 1946, the NIH has doled out funds based mainly on merits established by a scientific review process that ranks each proposal based on innovation, importance and feasibility.
The peer review process, in which grant proposals scoring above a certain percentile generally receive funding, has always had its critics. Many a Nobel Prize speech has described failures by reviewers to recognize work that would end up leading to pathfinding discoveries, said Carrie Wolinetz, a former NIH chief of staff.
About half of the NIH’s 27 centers and institutes provide leeway to raise or drop grants on the priority list because of factors like institute-wide research goals, Fine said. But these exceptions apply to fewer than 5% of grants, according to Richard Nakamura, who led the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review from 2011 to 2018.
Nakamura’s successor, Noni Byrnes, retired last week after overseeing changes aimed at reducing one frequent target of peer review critics: the awarding of multiple grants to well-placed scientists from top-tier universities.
The Bhattacharya document “itself is not so disturbing in the light of usual practice,” said Harold Varmus, who led the NIH under President Bill Clinton and was the chief of the National Cancer Institute under Barack Obama. “What is disturbing is what it might mean in the context of the current administration.”
The expansion of the Trump administration’s political power at the NIH comes as it has strangled the release of thousands of grants with sometimes ambiguous policy statements and new layers of bureaucracy, including requirements that both the White House and the NIH director clear all new funding opportunities.
Career scientists, who have long run the NIH, have in some instances been replaced by political appointees playing critical roles in scientific decisions, staff scientists say.
New political appointees under Bhattacharya include chief of staff Seana Cranston, a former aide to conservative Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and former Department of Government Efficiency manager James McElroy, Cranston’s deputy. The position of chief operations officer was created and filled by Eric Schnabel, a political appointee — since fired — who previously had been in charge of business development for a company that sold fitness programs.
Bhattacharya’s deputy, meanwhile, is Matthew Memoli, an infectious disease scientist who emerged as a sharp critic of covid-19 vaccine mandates. The Department of Health and Human Services stunned vaccine experts in May when it awarded Memoli and colleagues a $500 million grant to develop an influenza vaccine using older technology, with no explanation other than a superlative-filled news release.
The mood at the agency is morbid, said Sylvia Chou, a program officer at the National Cancer Institute. While a minority of workers speak out in protest through documents like the “Bethesda Declaration,” others keep their heads down and their mouths shut.
Most grants must undergo new levels of review by senior NIH employees and the White House, program officers say. Staff members painstakingly police all grant applications for language — such as “diversity” or “climate change” — that might trigger scrutiny by higher-ups, according to four program officers, two of whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because they feared retaliation.
“Bhattacharya has been saying that program officers are making up banned-words lists,” Norton said. “It’s true, we haven’t gotten a list from him saying, ‘Don’t use these words.’ But we do notice that when a grant says ‘health equity,’ it gets terminated.”
“We review them and screen them for all these words as we’re supposedly not doing — but we are doing,” said a program officer who has been at the NIH for six years. “After we approve them, they go to the grant management office and sit there. Then they send them back and say, ‘What about this word?’” This leads to self-censorship, the officer said.
The officer cited a recent proposal involving the effects of hotter weather on kidney disease. It contained the phrase “climate change” as background information, but “I had them remove it,” the officer said. “It’s a level of absurdity, but I wanted to avoid more delays.”
The peer review process itself is “starting to break down” because highly scored grants haven’t been funded for sometimes obscure reasons, Chou said.
The NIH picks hundreds of deeply experienced external scientists to serve on its review panels. While screened to avoid conflicts of interest, many reviewers are themselves NIH grant recipients. They accept pay of about $200 for 100 hours of work as a kind of social contract with the NIH, said Mollie Manier, a scientist at the Center for Scientific Review.
“We’re finding that people are more likely to decline to serve on review panels because their own grants are frozen, or out of protest at what’s happening at NIH,” Manier said.
Another review officer described approaching a Brown University scientist with a request to serve on a panel recently: “They said normally they would do it, but they’ve lost three grants and need to figure out how to keep their lab running.”
As grants crawl through the system, “reviewers are starting to feel they aren’t being convened for anything real,” Manier said. “If the government cancels your grant for no good reason, you can’t expect a good-faith effort anymore.”
“It’s death by a thousand paper cuts, anything they can do to gum up payments, to gum up the decision-making, to wrest control of grant decisions from the career scientists,” said Elizabeth Ginexi, an NIH program officer for 22 years who took early retirement in April.
Fine, the NIH spokesperson, said the agency had “no evidence that recruiting peer reviewers has become more difficult than in the past.”
The administration’s skepticism of peer review feeds doubts NIH scientists already had because of what they saw as irrational villainizing of mRNA vaccines and other matters — including Memoli’s vaccine award.
Although in-house NIH research isn’t subject to the same review process as external grants, Memoli’s grant left officials aghast. “I’m not aware of a process that awards $500 million for a project using antiquated technology to develop vaccines,” one seasoned reviewer said.
Trump’s executive order says the grant review process “undermines the interests of American taxpayers,” leaving many good proposals unfunded while supporting “too much unfocused research of marginal social utility.”
“The opposite is true,” the seasoned reviewer said. “We make sure taxpayer money goes to the most high-impact research.”
“Alignment” is a word the Trump administration frequently uses to explain why an official got fired or research was rejected. Chou finds it appalling.
“The Chinese Communists call it ‘harmonization,’” she said, and now her colleagues speak routinely about grants that are “clean” because they’ve “gone through alignment.”
“We’re saying this in plain English,” she said. “Not Russian, not Beijing Chinese.”

On Aug. 29, a Parma police officer was stationed outside St. Columbkille, a Catholic elementary and middle school in the Cleveland suburbs. School administrators called them out of an abundance of caution to provide security after the Minnesota tragedy.
Two children died and 17 others were injured after a shooter opened fire on praying kids, reigniting the long-standing debate on how to fix the country’s problem of mass shootings.
It’s a nightmare situation, one that former teacher of 30 years Sean Brennan couldn’t talk about without tears.
“This was not something that I thought about when I was going through my teacher preparation,” Brennan said. “When we became teachers, we didn’t sign up to think that we were gonna have to potentially save our children from a shooter, for Pete’s sake.”
Brennan, now a Democratic state lawmaker representing Parma, said the answer includes background checks and red flag laws.
“There’s got to be some type of common-sense restrictions on owning guns,” he said.
The city of Dayton’s deadly mass shooting in 2019 prompted Gov. Mike DeWine to push for new safety regulations, but the Republican-dominated legislature never took them up. On Thursday, WEWS asked the governor what could be done now.
“We put together, a few years ago, in our public safety office, really a separate unit about school safety — and so we can go out to any school, give them an assessment,” the governor said. “We also have some money that we can help schools (with). It doesn’t guarantee that we’ll never have a shooting there, but what it does do is make sure that the school is prepared for anything.”
Ohio can do better, he said, but knows he faces an uphill battle with his own party.
“Look, I’ve tried some different things,” DeWine said. “And we’ve not gotten them through.”
What has gotten through includes safety protocols that state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said don’t infringe on the Second Amendment, like providing funding for more security at religious buildings and allowing educators to be armed in class.
“We’re going to have to provide more security,” Cirino said. “We’re going to have to utilize people that are available: retired policemen, retired military people who are properly trained and vetted.”
Blaming firearms doesn’t get to the core problem, Cirino said.
“The guns are the method used by people that are psychologically impaired, okay?” Cirino said. “We need to address the core issue, which is the psychological impairment in the first place.”
While other GOP leaders push the constitutional argument, Cirino is more focused on families being cognizant of their relatives, including the “parental responsibility for flagging potential problems earlier and monitoring their children better, and alerting law enforcement when there seems to be something that has a high probability of becoming very violent.”
The Republican said he would “like to see” some “tighter restrictions” in terms of people getting guns, possibly waiting longer.
Brennan said that both his and Cirino’s solutions should go together.
“It’s got to be an all arrows and the quiver type of approach,” Brennan said.
Some Democrats and advocates are now pushing for a constitutional amendment to put gun safety regulations into law.
DeWine said he doesn’t know what regulations he would call for at this time, with Brennan expressing disappointment that despite the governor’s repeated interest in gun safety, he has signed each bill loosening gun restrictions sent to his desk.

Republican and Democratic states are taking different approaches to using their National Guards to help the Trump administration. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)WASHINGTON — Inside a bustling Union Station, commuters and tourists breeze past armed military personnel patrolling in groups of three or four as part of President Donald Trump’s surge of National Guard troops and federal agents into the nation’s capital.
Outside on a recent weekday afternoon, Robin Galbraith stood among a handful of people protesting their presence. The retired schoolteacher from nearby Bethesda, Maryland, held a sign saying Trump is “afraid” of free and fair elections.
“We should be respecting our National Guard. We should be respecting our citizens. We should be respecting our cities,” Galbraith said. “We shouldn’t be using them as pawns for Mr. Trump to have power because he’s feeling vulnerable right now.”
Trump’s decision to put the National Guard on the streets of Los Angeles and Washington in recent months and his threat to send them into other major cities have sparked a nationwide fight over the proper role of the Army’s and Air Force’s primary combat reserve force. Trump this week signaled Chicago or New Orleans could be next.
Republican and Democratic governors, who command the National Guard in their states, are sharply divided over whether to deploy servicemembers in furtherance of Trump’s agenda. Their decisions could shape how the nationwide military force, which counts some 430,000 members, is used for years to come.
Six GOP governors have signed off on sending troops to Washington, while at least 10 have ordered National Guard members to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Many Democratic governors oppose any plans to send troops into their cities, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, has urged all governors to reject the temptation to aid a “dangerous, politically motivated agenda.”

Trump and his allies say the National Guard is aiding a necessary crackdown on crime and bolstering immigration enforcement. But Democrats and military experts warn that the White House is trampling on longtime norms against the domestic use of the military and normalizing the presence of soldiers on America’s streets. They add that no crime crisis exists that is sufficient to justify sending in Guard members.
A federal judge in California on Tuesday agreed, ruling that Trump’s deployment of troops to Los Angeles had violated a 19th-century law that restricts the domestic use of the military. The case could eventually end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
Some Trump administration critics fear troops could be used to intimidate protesters or voters during the 2026 midterm elections. At the very least, they say, Trump risks politicizing the National Guard — transforming it from an apolitical force associated with providing aid after natural disasters into something closer to another arm of the Trump administration.











I think it is a misuse of the National Guard to try to use the National Guard in this fashion.


– Retired Air Force Reserve Maj. Gen. F. Andrew Turley



“I think it is a misuse of the National Guard to try to use the National Guard in this fashion,” said F. Andrew Turley, a former Air Force Reserve major general who retired in 2012 and once served as an Air National Guard assistant to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force.
The National Guard has two primary missions, Turley said: training for active-duty military service and serving as a state militia commanded by governors, available after natural disasters. Using National Guard members for law enforcement is beyond what they’re trained for and what they’re interested in, he said.
“Many members are going to shake their heads and say, ‘This is not what we’re here for, this is not what we signed up for,’” Turley said.
Broader scope of duties
But Trump and several Republican governors have embraced an expanded role for the National Guard.
For Trump, the troops — camo-clad and sometimes carrying weapons — offer a visually striking way of projecting power. For the governors, signing National Guard members up for stints in Washington, D.C., or helping ICE offers a way to demonstrate support for the commander in chief.
“South Carolina is proud to stand with President Trump as he works to restore law and order to our nation’s capital and ensure safety for all who live, work, and visit there,” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, said in a statement last month as he announced the deployment of 200 members of his state’s National Guard to Washington.
At least five other Republican-controlled states have also announced plans to send troops there: Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. About 2,000 National Guard members are now in the district, a figure that also includes members of the D.C. National Guard.
For now, the servicemembers appear mostly stationed in high-visibility areas, such as the National Mall and Union Station, with relatively little to do. Video of National Guard members picking up trash recently gained widespread attention. However, “presence patrols” are planned in the future for residential areas, the D.C. National Guard announced last week.

Nearly 80% of district residents oppose Trump taking control of local police and the deployment of the National Guard, according to a mid-August poll conducted by The Washington Post and the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. More broadly, a Reuters poll of Americans last month found just 38% support for the National Guard deployment in the nation’s capital.
“We are based in a society where we believe that the members of the military are not deployed against our own citizens,” former Kansas Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius said in an interview.
Sebelius’ father, John Gilligan, was elected governor of Ohio in 1970 in the wake of the shootings at Kent State University, where the Ohio National Guard killed four student protesters and wounded nine others. Sebelius said she has enormous respect for National Guard members, but warned against placing them in an urban environment they haven’t trained for and where they aren’t wanted.
“It’s dangerous for them, it’s dangerous for the citizens,” Sebelius said.
After West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced in August he would send 300-400 National Guard members to Washington, opponents of the deployment sued in West Virginia state court. The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed a complaint on behalf of West Virginia Citizen Action Group, which advocates for a clean environment and open government.
The complaint alleges West Virginia law allows the governor to deploy the National Guard outside of the state only for specific purposes, such as training and active-duty military service, and that the Washington deployment doesn’t qualify. “The Governor cannot transform our citizen-soldiers into a roving police force available at the whim of federal officials who bypass proper legal channels,” the complaint says.
Blue states fear invasion by red-state National Guard troops for deportations

The lawsuit is pending. Morrisey press secretary Drew Galang wrote in an email to Stateline that the governor mobilized the National Guard at the request of Trump under the authority of federal law.
“West Virginia is proud to support our neighbors and the Commander-in-Chief when called upon,” Galang wrote.
Deployments challenged
Trump faces fewer legal obstacles deploying National Guard members in Washington than he would in sending troops to Chicago or other cities. Because the district isn’t a state, the president can deploy the National Guard there with relative ease.
Deployments elsewhere have already proven more legally challenging.
When Trump wanted to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom objected. Trump federalized — or took control of — the California National Guard and ordered some 4,000 troops into the city anyway, along with hundreds of U.S. Marines.
Newsom sued over the deployment, leading to a bench trial in August before U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee and the younger brother of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
On Tuesday, Breyer ruled that Trump violated the Posse Comitatus Act, passed by Congress in 1878 to limit the use of the military to enforce the law following the end of Reconstruction. While the act allows the military to quell rebellions, the judge found none had occurred in Los Angeles.
Breyer issued an order blocking Trump from deploying the National Guard or any military troops for law enforcement but stayed the order until Sept. 12, giving the Trump administration time to appeal the decision. About 300 National Guard members remain in Los Angeles.
Claire Finkelstein, a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania who studies military ethics and national security law, emphasized in an interview that the military is trained to neutralize threats to the country and to the U.S. Constitution — not to engage in police work.
Finkelstein, who co-authored an amicus brief submitted in the California lawsuit, said that when it comes to maintaining a sharp division between military operations and civilian law enforcement, as well as preserving military readiness, the domestic deployments are a mistake.
“What is the point of them? The real point of them is a show of force to bring Democratic governors who represent a threat to the authority of Donald Trump under the control of the federal government,” Finkelstein said in an interview before Breyer’s decision.

The outcome of an appeal in the California lawsuit could go far in determining how much power Trump has to deploy troops to other cities in the future. Trump signed an executive order last week directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to make a National Guard “quick reaction force” available for deployment nationwide, the latest signal the president intends to send troops elsewhere.
The executive order directs Hegseth to designate “an appropriate number” of National Guard members from each state to be available for rapid mobilization.
“They need help badly. Chicago desperately needs help,” Trump said in the Oval Office after signing the order.
On Wednesday, Trump said his administration is weighing whether to deploy to Chicago or New Orleans.
Cities respond to Trump’s sanctuary threats as judge extends protection from threatened cuts

Trump has cast the potential deployments as part of a wide-ranging effort to fight crime and has disparaged major cities as crime-ridden, even as violent offenses continue to fall. Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a report released in July by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker and local leaders in Democratic-controlled Chicago acknowledge crime remains an issue. But they say progress is being made and the situation certainly doesn’t warrant a military deployment.
Pritzker told reporters on Tuesday that he had reason to believe the Trump administration was positioning Texas National Guard members for potential deployment to Illinois — an extraordinary move that would represent one state sending its armed forces into another state without consent. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s office has disputed Pritzker’s assertion.
Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson on Saturday signed an executive order aimed at resisting any military deployment. It prohibits Chicago police from participating in law enforcement efforts with the National Guard or other troops, and urges any federal agents to not wear masks, a response to ICE, whose personnel have begun masking during the Trump administration.
“Calling the military into a U.S. city to invade our streets and neighborhoods, to disrupt the lives of everyday people, is an extraordinary action and it should require extraordinary justification,” Pritzker said at an outdoor news conference last week in Chicago. “Look around you right now. Does this look like an emergency?”
Guards in GOP states helping ICE
As Chicago braces for the possible arrival of troops, Democratic governors across the country are also growing more outspoken against Trump’s threatened deployments.
Last week, the Democratic Governors Association released a statement signed by 19 governors accusing Trump of politicizing the military and undermining governors’ power over state national guards.
“This chaotic federal interference in our states’ National Guard must come to an end,” the statement reads.
For their part, several Republican governors are mobilizing their states’ national guards to aid the Trump administration. But so far, those efforts have largely focused on helping deportation efforts in their own states as opposed to preparing for big-city deployments elsewhere.
The Republican Governors Association didn’t respond to a request for comment, but several Republican governors’ offices confirmed to Stateline that their state National Guard has begun assisting ICE in their states. More than 10 states are providing some level of National Guard assistance to ICE: Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.
US crime rates fell nationwide in 2024, FBI report says

In most states, National Guard members are providing administrative, logistical and other backroom support and not directly participating in immigration enforcement operations. But in at least four states — Florida, Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia — they have been empowered to take part in enforcement operations, according to research by the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania.
Governors in those states have entered into federal 287(g) agreements that allow ICE to delegate some immigration enforcement duties, potentially including arrests, to National Guard members. While 287(g) refers to a federal law in place for decades, the second Trump administration has encouraged state and local law enforcement to participate. An agreement is also pending with the Arkansas National Guard, according to ICE records.
In Texas, the largest of those states, Abbott has been an enthusiastic participant. In an email, Abbott press secretary Andrew Mahaleris wrote that the governor supports using “every tool and strategy” to aid deportations by the Trump administration and had directed all state agencies to coordinate with the administration.
“Texas will continue to assist the Trump Administration in arresting, detaining, and deporting illegal immigrants,” Mahaleris wrote.
In Republican-led states where governors have yet to mobilize the National Guard, advocates for immigrants are urging them to hold off. As Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe considers using his state’s National Guard, for example, Susie Johnson, treasurer of advocacy group Abide in Love Ste. Genevieve, said a deployment would do little good.
The local jail in Ste. Genevieve, a city of about 5,000 south of St. Louis, houses an estimated 60-85 ICE detainees on any given day, said Johnson, whose organization supports immigration detainees in the jail as well as area immigrant families. A military presence isn’t necessary, she said.
“I think that this is probably just a little more of a political game to say, ‘Well, we need to bring in, basically, the military to help control this,’” Johnson said.

Sununu, then a congressman running for U.S. Senate, speaks to supporters during a campaign rally at Nashua City Hall on Nov. 4, 2002. (Photo by Jacob Silberberg/Getty Images)The headline did not mince words. “Donald Trump is a loser,” read the title of the opinion piece, which ran in the New Hampshire Union Leader one day before the 2024 New Hampshire presidential primary. 
The man who wrote it, former U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu, is no stranger to opposing Trump. 
In 2016, Sununu, the brother of former Gov. Chris Sununu, endorsed former Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president. And in 2024, he backed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in her effort to block Trump’s path back to the White House. 
This year, Trump is president, and Sununu is exploring another run for U.S. Senate. And he is shrugging off the importance of Trump.
“Look, this is going to be about New Hampshire,” he said in an interview with WMUR Wednesday confirming that exploration. “New Hampshire voters, New Hampshire values. Putting together a strong campaign.”
Sununu has personal experience with the Senate seat; he defeated current-Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in 2002 and held the seat for one term before Shaheen ousted him in 2008. Shaheen has kept the seat since; Sununu has worked as a board member and policy adviser for banks and lobbying firms in the meantime.
But as Sununu contemplates an entry into the race, Trump’s potential influence looms large — and two of Sununu’s would-be primary rivals are actively vying for the president’s support. 
Trump has not made an endorsement, which lands in an election year where Republicans hold a bare majority and are looking for any opportunity to flip a Democrat-held seat and expand control. 
Competing for Trump’s eye
Republican candidate Scott Brown, the former Massachusetts senator, has sought to align himself with Trump’s agenda this year, praising Trump for policies on border enforcement and trade.
That bond has some history: In Trump’s first term, the president appointed Brown as ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa.
But Brown also sharply criticized Trump in May 2021 for his actions leading up to the Jan. 6 insurrection, saying that Trump “absolutely” bears responsibility for the riots and that “his presidency was diminished” because of them. 
State Sen. Dan Innis, another candidate in the race, has centered his campaign around the contention he is the most pro-Trump person in the running. 
On Wednesday, he reiterated that contention.
“Let’s be honest, there are bad eggs in this race,” Innis said in a statement Wednesday afternoon touting a recent drop in egg prices. “I’m the only pro-Trump conservative in this race, and I’ll never back down.”
Representatives for Brown and Innis did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday about the possibility of Sununu entering the race. 
The candidates are seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate seat currently held by Shaheen, who is not running for reelection. U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas and Karishma Manzur are both competing for the Democratic nomination.
In a statement Wednesday, Pappas called Sununu a “corporate sellout” and charged Republicans with starting a “scramble to find Donald Trump’s perfect candidate.”
State Republicans see game-changer
While his potential rivals are positioning themselves for a Trump endorsement, Sununu did not appear to be in a hurry Wednesday. He told WMUR he would be conducting listening sessions around the state to gauge support for his potential candidacy. And he said he hopes to receive endorsements from a broad array of people, not just Trump. 
To some state Republicans, Sununu could be a formidable challenger in the race, even with his comments about Trump.
Responding to Sununu’s announcement, House Majority Leader Jason Osborne posted on X: “This would change the whole game.” Matt Mowers, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Pappas in 2020 and 2022, also called a possible Sununu entry a “game changer,” writing that “John Sununu puts the race on the map and starts as immediate front runner.”
Lou Gargiulo, a former Republican state representative, is a longtime supporter of Trump, serving as a state co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 and 2020.
But Gargiulo has been an advocate for John E. Sununu for even longer, supporting his campaigns in 2002 and 2008. And on Wednesday, he argued that Sununu’s past opposition to Trump would not necessarily limit his prospects.
“He’s a fiscal conservative, I think he’s socially conservative, I think he’s good on the Second Amendment, I think he’s good on taxation — I think … that the base would be happy to see a guy like him in the race,” he said in an interview. 
Gargiulo has not made up his mind on the GOP primary, he said. 
But the most important factor for Sununu, Gargiulo argues, is not Trump, but Sununu’s viability as a candidate and ability to raise money. Against the financial advantages held by Pappas, that will matter most, he said. 
Still, Sununu’s Trump positions could create some headaches, Gargiulo conceded. His advice: Sununu should reach out to the president and make his case. 
Trump could also choose to be pragmatic, he added.
“It depends on who talks to the president about him,” Gargiulo said. “I think at this point, we want to pick up some Senate seats. And if he could deliver a Senate seat, then I think the president will be somewhat forgiving.”
A family history
Kathy Sullivan, who served as New Hampshire Democratic Party chairwoman during Sununu’s campaign for Senate in 2002, also doubts that Sununu’s anti-Trump positions will hold him back, at least not if he is seen as a front-runner. If that happens, his past statements won’t matter, she argued.
“As long as John E. Sununu is a member of the Republican Party, he’s a Trumpist,” Sullivan said. 
Even if Sununu avoids talking about Trump, Sullivan argued he will run the risk of either being seen as not loyal enough by Trump’s base or lumped in with the president by independent voters. 
“I don’t think he can hide from Trump,” she said. “He may say a thing here and a thing there to try to separate himself from Trump, but that’s not going to be much and it’s not going to help him.”
To Dante Scala, professor of political science and international affairs at the University of New Hampshire, John E. Sununu’s predicament with Trump is a familiar one for his family. As governor, Chris Sununu perfected the art of accepting Trump while leaving room for sporadic moments of disagreement.
“The Sununus never seemed content with that, with toeing the line,” he said. “Even when they bent the knee to Trump, they never wanted to come off as such, as just kind of Trump clones.”
But John E. Sununu is running for U.S. Senate, a body much more tied to the politics of the White House than the governor’s office, Scala noted. That affords him less cover to pledge neutrality or avoid conflict, he said.
It means Sununu will need to proactively define himself and his vision for Republican politics, Scala said — especially because his term, should he win, would extend beyond Trump’s final year in office.
“Chris Sununu really wanted to move his party beyond Donald Trump. He failed, but he did have that ambition. He probably still does,” Scala said. 
“I wonder what kind of ambition John Sununu has, in terms of the direction of his party?”
On Wednesday, speaking to WMUR, Sununu said the state needed someone who had its values, “that’s not going to vote a party line, that’s willing to take risks and get things done.”
As for Trump?
“I would want to win support, if I were to run, across the entire spectrum, and obviously that includes the president,” he said. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/johnesununu-1024x672.jpg,,,2025-09-04 05:57:31.445554

The Boston Globe reported recently that a small group of neo-Nazis gathered outside the New Hampshire State House in Concord. Wearing facemasks, they held a banner proclaiming “Trump loves Epstein.” Were they saying this was a good thing? Or were they protesting? What about Nazis’ historical hatred of Jews? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.
A posted scholarly lecture on the Virginia Museum of History and Culture’s website tells us that early KKK members wore burlap feed sacks over the faces, donned animal horns and wore white muslin masks to indicate they were “non-human,” including corpses come back to life. Who were these members of the nation’s first domestic terrorism group? The neighbors of the people they hunted? How did they feel about what they were doing? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.
Today, all across the country, masked men, claiming to be representatives of the U.S. government, are snatching people off the streets, out of courtrooms, off high school ballfields, and from the lines of workers in car washes. Are they employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement? Are they self-appointed vigilantes? Are they sex traffickers acting under cover to kidnap people for sex slavery? Who knows? It is impossible to read their expressions, because they all wear masks.
Hiding one’s face is, of course, an ancient practice. Humans have always worn masks — in war and sports, in religious ritual, during celebrations, and on stage. Shakespeare’s lovers donned them at masquerade balls. Bad guys like Darth Vader and Jason Voorhees wear masks. But so do good guys like Batman, Spiderman and Zorro. Complex anti-heroes like the Phantom of the Opera maintain their mystery behind a mask. And of course children love the strange, freeing anonymity a mask gives them at Hallowe’en.
Most of us — those who respect science and were concerned for others’ safety — wore masks for three long years during the Covid pandemic. And we were thrilled to toss them once the vaccine allowed life to return to normal. Some folks with compromised immune systems choose to wear them still, especially in crowds.
But now? For those of us not still at grave risk, or on a sport team, in a religious group or on stage, the main reason to cover one’s face is to hide our shame. Our hands instinctively fly up to our cheeks and cover our nose and mouth when we are caught doing something wrong, or embarrassing.
So a simple question for ICE agents (both real and impostors), for neo-Nazis, and for today’s white supremacists posting hateful literature on lampposts in small towns across the nation, is this: if you’re too ashamed to show your face, why are you doing what you’re doing?










For those of us not still at grave risk, or on a sport team, in a religious group or on stage, the main reason to cover one’s face is to hide our shame. 


People in public office (as I once was) are often stalked, harassed and ridiculed on social media. Sometimes, as in the tragic case of the state representative in Minnesota, they are murdered. The public expects elected officials to show their faces, literally and figuratively. It’s called accountability. And yes, often it puts a target on our back, as it has recently with Rep. Corey Paris, who is being sent the most racist, vile and dangerous threats from across the country for calling out ICE in his district. Still, I don’t know any elected person hiding behind a mask, unless you consider Trump’s orange make-up a bizarre version of kumadori, the stylized makeup worn in Japanese Kabuki theater.
In 2016, at a protest march I attended after Trump was first elected, I engaged a young man who seemed to be in his mid-20s. He wore a Trump tee-shirt and was heckling us from the sidelines. I asked why he was covering his face with a mask. He said something that cannot be reprinted here — something inspired by Trump’s boasting about what he does to women’s bodies. He spat out he would do that to me if I didn’t move on.
So I asked him what his mother would think of that. Yes, I admit, a prissy, perhaps uptight thing to do, but still. I wanted him to explain his thought process. After all, aren’t we liberals supposed to engage with these folks? To get to know their minds? Not to judge but, rather, to “meet them where they are?”
So instead of returning this threat with something similar about his private parts (which, as everyone knows, are a lot more fragile than a woman’s), I asked again: Does your mother know you’re doing this? He emitted a sort of grunt. I could not read his expression, because he wore a mask. But he did drop his shoulders a little, and bowed his head just a bit. The parade of marchers moved on.
I think of that young man often — he’s probably around 30 now. Plenty old enough to be a father to a child who may get measles. Perhaps his mother now has cancer and needs to enter a clinical trial that’s been defunded. Perhaps the tariffs have cost him his job. I wonder if the mask will fall from his face when the scales fall from his eyes.

After committee approval, both chambers will vote on the measure.
In order for the map to last 10 years, it has to receive 66% approval in each chamber, including approval from at least half the Democrats and half the Republicans in the Senate and House, according to the Ohio Constitution.
If agreement can’t be reached in the legislature by Sept. 30, the process moves to the Ohio Redistricting Commission, which would have until the end of October to come up with a bipartisan plan.
Without agreement there, the process heads back to the legislature, where a plan can be passed with a simple majority. The constitution gives a deadline of Nov. 30 for the legislature’s second attempt.
With a simple majority adoption, however, the constitution dictates that the plan would only be valid for four years.
The redistricting process is back in Ohio after previous attempts at congressional map-drawing didn’t produce bipartisan maps. Both congressional maps that were adopted in Ohio were struck down as unconstitutionally partisan by the Ohio Supreme Court.
Despite being unconstitutional, the most recently approved congressional map was used for the last general election.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)As a proud Claremont public schools alumnus, it’s been devastating to watch my hometown’s school district suffer with a more than $5 million deficit and cut more than 39 positions from its local schools. Tech Center supplies, extracurricular activities, and school programs relied on emergency fundraising days before the start of the school year, and there’s no guarantee of schools staying open even past March.
The district administration deserves scrutiny for how we got here, and the school board is stuck between a rock and a hard place. At the most recent board meeting, one member put it plainly: “We’re out of options.” But that raises the larger question: Where is the state government?
This crisis didn’t appear out of thin air. Our school budgets in New Hampshire are overwhelmingly dependent on local property taxes. When a city like Claremont already has one of the highest property tax rates in the state and a large population simply struggling to get by paycheck to paycheck, there is no room for error. Almost 30 years ago, the Claremont lawsuits established that New Hampshire has a constitutional duty to provide every child with an adequate education. That duty cannot be met by pushing the burden onto struggling communities alone.
More recently, in Contoocook Valley School District v. State, the New Hampshire Supreme Court reaffirmed that responsibility, finding the state’s per-pupil funding levels unconstitutional. The decision was clear: The state is not meeting its obligation. Yet Claremont today shows the worst of both worlds: a district that has mismanaged its finances and a state that has failed to step in when children’s education is on the chopping block.
As a Claremont resident and taxpayer, I agree with Gov. Kelly Ayotte that Claremont’s current financial situation is unacceptable. But acknowledgment is not enough. The governor’s office and the Department of Education cannot wash their hands of responsibility when the state’s own highest court has ruled the current system unconstitutional. They cannot point fingers and walk away while almost 2,000 students, kids who had no say in the decisions that created this mess, are forced to wonder whether their schools will be fully staffed, their classes offered, or their after-school activities canceled.
Let’s be clear: This crisis is primarily the fault of Claremont’s district administration. Families, teachers, and taxpayers deserve answers for how the budget was allowed to collapse so severely over the past five years. Accountability must be demanded at the local level. But state leaders do not get to stand idly by while one of New Hampshire’s city educational systems teeters on the brink.
At the end of the day, schools are not line items but places where the future of New Hampshire is being shaped every day. Teachers should be able to focus on educating, not wondering if their jobs will vanish by spring. Students should not have to scramble to save their sports teams through bake sales, and parents should not be forced to make a last-minute decision about whether to move their kids to another school district.
Claremont has made mistakes. That much is obvious. However, the children of Claremont should not bear the consequences of the failures of adults in positions of power, whether in the district office or the State House. Gov. Ayotte and Education Commissioner Caitlin Davis should exhaust every policy option possible, including even financial assistance through the current school year, to ensure that the students in the Claremont School District have the same shot at opportunity as every other child in New Hampshire.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/domeandbell-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-09-04 04:56:10.115772

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal.)LifeWise Academy, a controversial Hilliard-based religious instruction program, will be in almost half of Ohio’s public school districts this school year. 
The academy will now be in 613 Ohio schools in 303 school districts for the 2025-26 school year, said Christine Czernejewski, a spokesperson for LifeWise. 
Back in January, LifeWise was in about 160 Ohio school districts — a nearly 90% increase since the start of the calendar year.
The academy’s new count comes after a new law took effect in April that requires Ohio school districts to have a religious-release time policy. The previous law merely permitted a policy. 
“While the recent clarification in Ohio law has helped reinforce districts’ ability to offer release-time religious instruction, the growth is primarily driven by increased demand from families across the state,” Czernejewski said. “Communities have been proactively bringing LifeWise to their local schools because they understand the positive impact of Bible education during school hours.”
LifeWise operates in 34 states and plans to enroll nearly 100,000 students this year, according to its website. 
“Demand for LifeWise is surging, and we couldn’t be more excited to see families taking advantage of our programming, from urban areas to remote towns,” said CEO Joel Penton.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe non-denominational Christian program teaches the Bible to public school students during the school day, and started in Ohio in 2019. The courses usually take place during lunch or during elective courses.
But LifeWise has many critics and parents have said their students have been ostracized and bullied for not taking part in LifeWise.  
“These kids are affected when they don’t go,” said Zachary Parrish, a parent who had LifeWise file a lawsuit against him for copyright infringement. “They feel left out. They don’t understand why their parents aren’t letting them go.” 
Parrish now lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but his daughter was a second-grader in Defiance City Schools in 2021 and he is not surprised Ohio has seen such an uptick in districts offering the religious classes.  
“They’ve been in Ohio the longest,” he said. “They’ve got the most connections in Ohio. It’s where the organization is from. It’s where all the leadership is from. So it doesn’t surprise me that Ohio is the hotbed for it.”
Religious instruction under the law
The United States Supreme Court upheld release time laws during the 1952 Zorach v. Clauson case, which allowed a school district to have students leave school for part of the day to receive religious instruction.
Religious release time instruction must meet three criteria: the courses must take place off school property, be privately funded and students must have parental permission.
Tina Sobo, a rabbi at Temple Israel Dayton and mom of two students in Miamisburg Schools, said students in her congregation have heard antisemitic comments from their classmates when they return from LifeWise. 
“The curriculum teaches that because my kids are Jewish and don’t believe in Jesus, we’re going to hell … And touching on just some of the low-level antisemitism, just really more ignorant type comments,” she said. “It’s a very specific version of Christianity that, I think, goes against, in my opinion, goals of creating an inclusive, positive religious environment in America.”
LifeWise, which started in Miamisburg in January, “unequivocally condemns antisemitism or any form of harassment or discrimination,” Czernejewski said. 
“Our mission is to provide Bible-based character education,” she said. “If any student were to make inappropriate or hurtful remarks toward their peers, whether inside or outside of school, that behavior would be inconsistent with what LifeWise teaches.”
Rachel Evans, a mom of a student in Centerville City Schools, does not want to send her son to LifeWise because their family is Jewish. LifeWise is launching in Centerville this month. 
“You have these kids who are taught that they need to save people because they’re taught that hell is just the worst place you could go,” she said. “And they’re really trying to help their friends, but that can be really damaging to a kid.” 
Hearing LifeWise is in almost half of Ohio’s school districts makes Evans scared for her son’s future. 
“I have had past experiences where I was proselytized to at a very young age and it’s not a good feeling,” she said. “… The whole point of it is to disrupt the school day. … There are so many other times when this would be appropriate, and I think during the school day is not it.”

(Courtesy of Kleban for Maine)Another Democrat, co-founder of Maine Beer Company Dan Kleban, has entered the race to try to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2026.
Announcing his candidacy on Wednesday, the 48-year-old Cumberland County resident said he’s running because he feels a responsibility to do what’s right for Maine, like when he started his company with his wife and brother after being laid off from a law firm during the Great Recession.
“Executives at the big banks who crashed our economy walked away without facing any consequences. I was pissed,” Kleban said in a statement. “So my brother and I started Maine Beer Company not only to make good beer, but to live by our Do What’s Right motto that crooks on Wall Street never understood.” In practice, that motto means providing fully paid health care and donating 1% of all annual sales to environmental nonprofits, he added.
Now, Kleban said the same thing is happening in Congress, specifically calling out Collins, whose actions he sees hardworking Mainers paying the price for as they struggle to afford housing, health care, groceries, and electric bills.
Maine’s Senate race heated up last month when Graham Platner, a largely unknown oysterman and military veteran, entered the race at the encouragement of unions. Platner’s campaign raised $1 million in the first nine days and he was endorsed by independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at a Labor Day rally attended by more than 6,500 in Portland.
Kleban’s launch video and website make some similar appeals as Platner. Kleban emphasizes his working-class roots and student debt, living many of the affordability challenges he believes other Mainers want their elected officials to fix.
Most of the people vying for Collins’ seat are political newcomers, Platner and Kleban included. One Democratic candidate, Jordan Wood, is a former congressional aide who has spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C.
Establishment Democrats have been trying to convince Maine Gov. Janet Mills to run. She’s still unsure but said she’d likely decide by mid-November.
As for a primary challenge, Maine Republicans have rejected the idea, though President Donald Trump has said behind closed doors that he’d welcome a “better option.” He’s also recently revoked the otherwise unusual public deference he’d shown Collins.
Kleban spoke about the president being a threat to the values of Mainers in his launch video and said Collins “refuses to stand up to Donald Trump when it really matters.”
Kleban also criticized Collins’ 2018 vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, the majority of which then stripped nationwide abortion protections when overturning Roe v. Wade.

(Getty Images)Magistrate Judge Ron Sylvester’s story about the need to eliminate cash bonds in nonviolent cases begins with two QuikTrip hot dogs, one actual dog, and a man with mental health and addiction issues struggling to survive.
Setting bonds, said Sylvester, who retired in April after five years on the bench, doesn’t protect communities. It can, however, mock justice as it did for a then-74-year-old Thomas Wimberly, who spent 71 days in jail for stealing hot dogs he gave to his dog, Smokey Bear.
Retired Magistrate Judge Ron Sylvester (Kansas Judicial Branch)
Bail bonds, in Sylvester’s estimation, are regressive, exploitative legal system versions of payday loans that prey on people like Wimberly. Sylvester, a journalist for 40 years who covered courts for the Wichita Eagle, shared a story he’d written almost 20 years ago.
It was early July in 2006 when Wimberly put Smokey Bear into a shopping cart and headed to a downtown Wichita car show. On the way home, he stopped at a QuikTrip and grabbed two hot dogs for the hungry Smokey Bear.
But as Wimberly prepared the last hot dog, he saw Smokey Bear climbing out of the cart and left the store without paying. A moonlighting police officer saw Wimberly leave without paying the $2.11 he owed.
By the time the officer reached Wimberly, Smokey Bear had gulped the hot dogs.
Wimberly was booked on theft but his case was dismissed.
Sylvester said Wimberly thought it was over. Not close.
Wimberly had two previous misdemeanor thefts on his record — one more than a decade old. This third misdemeanor became a felony under Kansas law. The city sent the case to the district attorney’s office.
The summons the D.A.’s office sent to attend a hearing came back undelivered. So, when Wimberly didn’t show, a judge issued a bench warrant that sent Wimberly to jail on what for him was a whopping $5,000 bond.
Sylvester said bail bond services typically post a bond for 10% of the amount, but $500 exceeded what Wimberly drew in a month from Social Security. At the time of his arrest, Wimberly lived on $448 a month.
Jurors took two days off work when the case went to trial. They heard the evidence and found Wimberly not guilty. Sylvester said some jurors were irate the case went to trial.
“It was stupid,” presiding juror Krysti Mason, 21, said of Wimbley’s trial in the Eagle article
With the national conversation now about cracking down on crime, it isn’t wrong to wonder where this narrative that the nation is soft on crime comes from. Our nation has 5% of the world’s population but 25% of its criminals. We are tough on crime.
It’s time we got smart on crime. At roughly $50 a day for 71 days, the system spent a minimum of $3,550 on Wimberly’s $2.11 hot dog heist.
Sylvester said Wimberly, who also suffered from mental health issues, got Smokey Bear back and that Wimberly often carried the newspaper story with him, basking in his 15 minutes of fame.
Wimberly has since died, but his story and the cruel system of bail bonds live on.
The bonds are unnecessary, Sylvester said of most nonviolent cases. Text messages have proven sufficient to get people to return to court. The bond industry, he said, preys on fear, claiming bond-less defendants would be dangers to the community.
“Yeah, with them on the mean streets of Kingman, we aren’t safe,” he said sarcastically of the south-central Kansas town where he served as a magistrate. “All (the current system) does is allow rich, dangerous people to roam the community.”
Sylvester often offered defendants “OR bonds,” or own recognizance bonds. Defendants paid only if they didn’t show up for court dates. Besides, most of the people who appeared in front of him needed help, not punishment.
“About 90 to 95% of the cases I heard had a mental health or addiction component or both,” he said. “A lot of this has to do with the failure to pass Medicaid.”
He appeared in a Wall Street Journal article about Pratt Regional Medical Center suing many of its patients because it was the only way to generate the revenue necessary to keep the hospital open.
The Journal featured Sylvester in a story last year about how 95% of the civil cases he was hearing were brought by the hospital. In July and August 2023, four of every five sheriff-delivered court summonses in Pratt County were from the hospital.
“By December,” the story said, “it had sued some 400 people in a county of 9,000 — more than it had in the past five years combined.”
Sylvester said people who appeared in front of him pleaded for help.
“I’ve told anyone who would listen that if you want to be tough on crime, you should work to properly fund community mental health and addiction treatments in every Kansas town. You do that, and you will significantly cut crime, especially in rural areas.”
And maybe not spend thousands of dollars on bonds and hot dog larceny.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)More police agencies, from big-city departments to federal agencies, are lowering education standards for new recruits — a sign of how much the profession is changing as it struggles to recruit and retain officers.
This year, at least two major city agencies — the New York Police Department and the Dallas Police Department — have cut some education requirements for new recruits.
In February, the NYPD reduced its college credit requirement for police academy entry from 60 credits to 24. Following a new policy approval in June, the Dallas Police Department began allowing applicants with only a high school diploma or GED to qualify if they also have three consecutive years of full-time work experience.
Police agencies nationwide are loosening education requirements in an effort to address years of staffing shortages. The changes also come as President Donald Trump has drawn more attention to crime and public safety by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and signaling plans to expand federal enforcement efforts in Chicago and other cities. (A federal judge on Tuesday ruled Trump’s mobilization of U.S. Marines and the California National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles this summer violated federal law.) Trump also has taken over the District of Columbia’s police department.
Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022. Some communities, though, are still facing higher rates of certain crimes, including homicide.
The changes in New York City and Dallas are part of a yearslong trend of police departments easing college requirements, a shift that includes Boise, Idaho; Chicago; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Memphis, Tennessee; and Bellingham, Washington. Even some state police agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police and the Pennsylvania State Police, have followed suit.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXBut these changes in education requirements aren’t limited to local and state forces. The FBI — which for decades required a four-year degree — will no longer mandate one for new recruits starting in October. New recruits also will receive just eight weeks of training, down from the previous 18-week standard, according to The New York Times.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has loosened standards as the Trump administration seeks to expand immigration enforcement. The agency removed its five-week Spanish-language training requirement. Translation needs would instead be met through unspecified technology, The Intercept reported.
ICE has paired these changes with aggressive incentives, including signing bonuses of up to $50,000, as much as $60,000 in student loan repayment and retirement benefits.
These changes reflect a broader challenge in policing: Agencies are still struggling to recruit and retain officers amid increased public attention and shifting workforce expectations.
“The demand exceeds the supply, and what’s happened is the environment for being a police officer has changed,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit think tank on policing standards. “The expectations have never been higher.”
Resignations and retirements rose sharply after 2020, when nationwide protests put law enforcement under closer public scrutiny following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Additionally, some officers are leaving big-city departments for smaller agencies. At the same time, some experts say, police agencies are competing in a tight labor market in which shift jobs may be less appealing than positions with regular hours, higher pay or remote work options.
In recent years, the push for better-educated officers has been rooted in research suggesting that college graduates are less likely to use force and perform better on the job. But some say that strict education mandates can shrink the applicant pool and shouldn’t be the sole measure of what makes a good officer.
“College education, in the greater scheme of things, is advantageous. It’s necessary, but not sufficient,” Wexler said, noting that agencies should also weigh a recruit’s work history, maturity, judgement and other characteristics.
Agencies of all sizes also have adjusted other standards to attract more applicants — raising or lowering minimum age limits, loosening tattoo policies, scaling back fitness tests and waiving exam fees.
In some departments, these changes have sparked a surge in applications, but they haven’t always translated into higher staffing levels overall.
Following the NYPD’s announcement in February that it was changing its education requirement, daily applications jumped from an average of 53 to 231, according to a news release. In early August, the agency swore in 1,093 recruits — its largest incoming class since January 2016.
The New Orleans Police Department nixed its college education requirement in 2015 and saw a surge of 7,440 applications just two years later.
But hiring never kept pace: The department brought on about 100 recruits a year, and far fewer after 2020, according to the city’s hiring dashboard. In 2024, the department received 1,575 applications and hired just 35 recruits.
A report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office released late last year found that between 2019 and 2023, the department lost nearly 27% of its policing staff.
 Solving the staffing crisis

Staffing shortfalls have been a long-standing challenge for law enforcement agencies, stretching back well before 2020. But in recent years, hiring has improved in some parts of the country.
The latest Police Executive Research Forum survey, based on responses from 217 agencies across 39 states and the District of Columbia, suggests staffing trends are uneven.
As of Jan. 1, sworn staffing was up slightly from the year before but still 5.2% below 2020 levels, according to the survey. Large departments saw modest growth in 2024 but still employ 6% fewer officers than in 2020, while medium and small agencies have not just recovered but now surpass 2020 levels.
“This period we’re in now, and we have been in for the last few years, is the most challenging time to hire a police officer,” Wexler said.
In recent years, state legislatures also have looked into the education requirements for police. In 2023, for example, Oregon lawmakers considered a bill that would have required at least two years of higher education for departments with fewer than 50 officers and a bachelor’s degree for departments with more than 50. It would have applied to police, corrections, parole, probation and reserve officers, but the bill stalled in a Senate committee.
More recently, lawmakers in California are considering a bill that would, starting in 2031, require incoming officers to obtain a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. Incoming officers could also meet the requirement through prior military service or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
The proposal has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies and groups in the state, including the California Police Chiefs Association, California State Sheriffs’ Association and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.
The sheriffs’ association praised the legislation, writing in a statement that it offers a range of acceptable experiences — “enhancing academic rigor” — without burdensome requirements that could hurt agencies’ recruiting goals.
Police education requirements are often set by individual departments or local jurisdictions, rather than written into state law. Across the country, most local law enforcement agencies require only a high school diploma or GED, though officers with a college degree may have more opportunities for promotions and higher pay.
“Educational standards across law enforcement agencies vary considerably,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University.
Some agencies also have created pathways for new officers to earn college credit through completing the police academy program and offer tuition reimbursement for those who want to pursue advanced degrees.
But La Vigne told Stateline that in-service training, organizational structure, leadership and accountability mechanisms within a department also play a key role in shaping a well-rounded officer.
“Those factors, I think, override anything as simple as ‘We’re requiring or removing education as a threshold for employment,’” La Vigne said. “Educational requirements alone are not the biggest factor.”
 What makes a good cop

What makes a good police officer has long been debated, with discussions often centering on the role of education, training and personal qualities.













Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer.


– Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Research Executive Forum





Some argue that, rather than lowering education requirements, departments should improve people’s perceptions of the police by becoming more involved in the community, especially at a time when heightened scrutiny has made the job less appealing to some.
“It’s trying to fix the problem assuming that the way things work now is the way things are supposed to be,” said Jim Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and a speaker with the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership. Nolan previously served as a police officer and as an FBI unit chief. “It’s the approach to policing that’s wrong.”
Some research suggests that college-educated officers use force less often, face fewer complaints and are disciplined less frequently than their peers without a degree. Some policing experts say a college education may give officers a broader perspective on a range of issues while also strengthening critical thinking and teamwork skills.
Research also suggests that college-educated officers are stronger writers, which can lead to clearer investigations and casework, according to a 2017 report on higher education in policing.
But some experts still caution that the research is not conclusive and argue that education alone isn’t enough to determine what makes a good police officer.
“Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer,” said Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum.

I’m a retiree member of the American Federation of Teachers who taught history at West Kentucky Community and Technical College in Paducah for two dozen years.
The Knights are gone and largely forgotten. Yet they were 19th century America’s largest labor organization and an ancestor of the AFL-CIO.
Founded in 1869 in Philadelphia, the Knights “tried to teach the American wage-earner that he was a wage-earner first and a bricklayer, carpenter, miner, shoemaker, after; that he was a wage-earner first and a Catholic, Protestant, Jew, white, black, Democrat, Republican, after,” historian Norman J. Ware wrote in “The Labor Movement in the United States 1860-1895: A Study in Democracy.” I’d add “teacher” to the list of jobs.
“The Knights operated as both a trade union federation and a political movement,” wrote historian Jonathan Garlock. “Envisioning a ‘Cooperative Commonwealth’ in which producer cooperatives and nationalized railroads would replace monopolistic capitalism, the Knights launched dozens of local and state labor parties and hundreds of worker-owned cooperatives.”
Knights belonged to Local Assemblies which numbered in the thousands. Each assembly “represented members in their work places, bargaining with employers, threatening and conducting strikes,” Garlock added. “Inclusivity was the other hallmark of the KOL (especially in comparison to the American Federation of Labor unions that followed). The Knights included African American workers and counted 246 local assemblies organized by women workers.”
The main goal of the Knights and other 19th century unions was the eight-hour workday. They also called for the abolition of child labor. But the Knights argued that men and women who did the same job should get the same pay.
The Knights’ motto was, “That is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all.” The union peaked at almost a million members in the late 1880s, before fading away and all but disappearing by the turn of the 20th century.
The union spread nationwide, and even worldwide, with Local Assemblies in Canada, Great Britain and Australia. According to The Kentucky Encyclopedia, 177 assemblies operated in Kentucky — in Louisville, Covington Lexington, Frankfort and even in small towns like Fulton. I treasure a copy of The Toiler, the Fulton Knights’ newspaper.
On Nov. 25, 1894, Lexington area Knights celebrated their union’s 25th birthday at the Opera House, enjoying “a gratifying success in every feature,” according to the Kentucky Leader of Nov. 26. (A ball followed at Jackson Hall with Saxton’s Band providing the dance music.)
Success was often elusive for unions as the country rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. Well-heeled capitalists helped whip up anti-labor hysteria by demonizing unions as “un-Christian” and “un-American,” even communist.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXMost employers, notably in industry, stubbornly, even violently, resisted unions, with help from friendly local and state officials. Judges routinely issued injunctions to stop strikes. Police, sheriff’s deputies and even National Guard troops were almost always available for strikebreaking duty.
Union-busting was bipartisan. Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes dispatched federal troops to break the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, sent U.S. soldiers to crush the Pullman Strike in 1894.
To protect its members against getting fired by anti-union bosses, the Knights had started as a secret organization. The Knights dropped its veil of secrecy in 1879 and deleted “Noble and Holy Order” from its original name.
Afterwards, the union enjoyed rapid growth.
Featured speakers at the 25th birthday celebration included local Democratic Congressman W.C.P. Breckinridge, a Confederate veteran, and Dr. W.T. Bolling, a Lexington pastor.
Breckinridge acknowledged that the federal government had the power to abolish child labor, outlaw the company store system and pass laws to make workplaces sanitary. But he rebuked those who looked to federal “legislation as the great panacea or cure all of the nineteenth century,” the Lexington paper said.
Bolling advised workers that if they would “be true, be patient, honest and diligent” and vote “the time will come when the host of labor may sing as sung Israel when freed from the bondage of Egypt.”
The Leader didn’t report the Knights’ reaction to the politician or the pastor. But based on the preamble to the union’s 1878 “Declaration of Principles” they might have been disappointed. The preamble warned that “the alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations, unless checked, will invariably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses.”
Thus, it was “imperative, if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life, that a check be placed upon unjust accumulation, and the power for evil of aggregated wealth. This much-desired object can be accomplished only by the united efforts of those who obey the divine injunction, ‘In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.’”
A footnote: Not everybody was welcome to join the Knights, explained a Nov. 25 Leader story about the upcoming anniversary observance. The banned list included “stock-holders, bankers, lawyers, professional gamblers, and those who, in any way, derive their living from the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors.”

I’ve got a hot tip for you on an incredibly wasteful government project. It’s called “Alligator Alcatraz.”
I know DOGE has been hounding city and county officials — especially the ones who have ticked off developers — looking for wasted taxpayer money. You really should look into this one. It’s HUUUUUGE.
Gov. Ron DeSantis decided to blow millions in taxpayer money on a tent-and-fence camp in the middle of a major nature preserve. Believe it or not, he did it without doing one single thing to check its impact on our endangered panthers, our clean water, or our recovering Everglades.
Instead, he just rushed to build it as fast as possible, spending $218 million. He had to truck in everything the staff and inmates needed, from portable toilets that repeatedly overflowed to blinding lights that ruined one of the few dark-sky places left in our state.
Some of the contractors he hired to build and run the place were, in a word, shady. Five of them “have links to allegations of improper business practices and misuse of public funds,” the Miami Herald reported recently.
Blaise Ingoglia via CFO office
This is the kind of willful wastefulness that used to drive DOGE’s boss, new CFO Blaise Ingoglia, howling mad back when was the “Government Gone Wild” guy.
To no one’s surprise, this slapdash structure faced a serious legal challenge from Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, which lives nearby. After hearing extensive testimony — including from a scientist who said that 800,000 square feet of new paving had been put in at the soggy site — a federal judge ruled for the environmental groups and Native Americans.
The judge found that federal law required an environmental assessment before construction began, but the evidence showed the people who built this thing “did not engage with a single step of the environmental review process.”
I hear the guv whined about an “activist judge” expecting him to follow the law. Poor baby!
The judge ordered Ronnie’s Folly shut down in 60 days, at an estimated cost of another $15 to $20 million in taxpayer money. Two months after it opened, the whole place is being dismantled and everyone transferred elsewhere. It just boggles the mind.
Imagine what we could have done with that money instead of this short-lived mess that put a premium on skeevy marketing over environmental and economic stewardship.
Better than burning it
What should I call you — just Mr. DOGE? You’ll find this fascinating, Mr. DOGE.
Poking around in the wreckage of Ronnie’s Folly, investigative journalist Jason Garcia found records showing how badly the taxpayers were ripped off.
“Altogether, updated procurement records show that Florida has awarded more than $350 million in contracts and purchase orders connected with the Everglades camp, which contractors raced to build in just eight days,” Garcia wrote in his “Seeking Rents” Substack.
He added that DeSantis & Co. “actually would have done a lot less harm … if they had simply set the cash on fire.”
That’s one option, I suppose. But let’s be more imaginative and consider what we could have spent that money on instead of this dismal dog’s breakfast.
Take environmental land acquisition, for instance.

Clay Henderson via subject
I asked Eve Samples of the Friends of the Everglades what she would have spent the money on. Her answer: Buying up as much of the Everglades Agricultural Area as possible and converting it back into the River of Grass. She even pointed me toward a petition that her organization is circulating to push Florida officials to take that step.
Former Florida Audubon president Clay Henderson, suggested an even broader effort.
In 2022 the Legislature approved spending $100 million in recurring revenue for the Florida Forever land-buying fund. But this year, despite the obvious signs that Florida’s voters cherish our parks and preserves, our legislators ignored that promise and only funded $18 million.
They also voted to repeal a law that created a big source of funding for buying even more environmentally sensitive land. It’s a law they had passed unanimously and with great fanfare just a year before: the Seminole Gaming Compact. Now that gambling money will go into general revenue instead.
There went another $100 million for the Florida environment that everyone thought was guaranteed.
“Florida’s growth rate now results in the loss of 100,000 acres a year to development,” said Henderson, author of a terrific history of Florida environmental land preservation called “Forces of Nature.” “Providing $300 million for Florida Forever would allow us to protect as many acres as will be destroyed.”
Oil and water
Mr. DOGE, I consulted a bunch of other folks about better things to spend these millions on. I told people I was especially interested in anything that would have improved the Big Cypress National Preserve instead of polluting it.
Matthew Schwartz, executive director of the South Florida Wildlands Association, via subject
One of the best suggestions came from Matthew Schwartz of the South Florida Wildlands Association.
Forty-plus ago, when the federal government bought the Big Cypress Swamp and created the 729,000-acre preserve, the government left a loophole that makes the word “preserve” somewhat misleading.
While the National Park Service took charge of the land, the feds did not buy the mineral rights under it. Those still belong to the Collier Resources Co., owned by descendants of the founder of Collier County, onetime advertising kingpin Barron Collier. In the 1920s, he was Florida’s largest private landowner. The Legislature named the whole county after him.  
Despite its preserve status, Collier Resources has been operating two low-producing oil fields there.  The feds have talked about acquiring Collier’s mineral rights since the 1990s, but every attempt has fallen short.
“Back in 2002,” Schwartz said, “a deal was close that would have bought out almost 500,000 acres of Collier Resources’ mineral rights in the Big Cypress National Preserve. That deal fell through …, but $300 million would likely have been more than enough to resurrect it.”
Just think, Mr. DOGE, what a difference Gov. Ron could have made for the Big Cypress! I hope that guilty knowledge dogs his thoughts for the rest of his days.
Saving the sawfish
Mr. DOGE, there are sooooo many better things that DeSantis could have spent $350 million on.
Nicole Johnson via Conservancy of Southwest Florida
For instance, Nicole Johnson from the Conservancy of Southwest Florida pointed out to me that using the money to help imperiled species would have been wonderful, not wasteful.
“We have been asking the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to continue funding for endangered smalltooth sawfish research, as well as to reinstate funding for trash management programs to coexist with Florida black bears (instead of hunting them),” she told me.
Smalltooth sawfish look like they leaped out of a Fred Flintstone cartoon. They get their names from their saw-like rostrum.
Since 2024, dozens of these prehistoric-looking aquatic species have either washed up dead or been seen spinning crazily before they expired. At least 64 have been found dead so far.
Additional research funding would help the scientists figure out what’s making them crazy — the sawfish, I mean, not the scientists. Or us taxpayers.
As for the bears, that’s just common sense. When they can’t find enough of the food they prefer, they go looking for human garbage as a dietary source. To manage the bears, we’d better manage our human garbage.
Although I think the FWC would still be pushing the bear hunt, despite the fact that there are slightly fewer bears now than there were before the last hunt a decade ago.
A very old error
Mr. DOGE, I hope you’re as dogged as some of the folks I talked to. Cris Costello of the Sierra Club told me that the governor should have spent those millions fixing an error made six decades ago.
In 1968, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the 7,200-foot-long Rodman Dam as part of the controversial Cross-Florida Barge Canal.
The dam halted the flow of the wild Ocklawaha River into the Silver and St. Johns rivers and blocked a regular manatee migration path. Meanwhile, the reservoir created by the dam drowned 9,000 acres of the Ocala National Forest and smothered 20 freshwater springs.
Canal opponents, led by Marjorie Harris Carr, pointed out that the big ditch would damage the aquifer that supplies Florida’s drinking water. They were able to halt its construction by convincing a federal judge to issue an injunction (sound familiar?). Then-President Richard Nixon canceled funding for it.
Carr and others spent years trying to get the dam removed. It still stands today, albeit in far worse shape than when it was new. The Legislature has twice voted to take the first step toward tearing it down, only to hit an inexplicable roadblock.
That’s why Costello says it would have been wonderful to see those wasted millions spent instead on “the breach of Rodman Dam and the reuniting of the Ocklawaha, Silver, and St. John’s rivers and the restoration of so many springs and the surrounding landscape.”
Yet our fine governor didn’t see that as being nearly as important as his polluting pile of putrefaction in the Big Cypress.
Springs and a tower
Last but far from least, it would have been nice to see these millions spent on fixing up our state parks.
You may recall that just last year, another pointless project called for putting golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts in our state parks. Fortunately, the widespread public outrage convinced the golfers to back out and the Legislature to guarantee that would never happen again.
Estus Whitfield via Florida Conservation Voters
Several popular parks are centered on our incredible springs. Yet our springs are in serious trouble these days, as Estus Whitfield, who served as the top environmental adviser to five Florida governors from both parties, pointed out to me. The springs are in danger right now from rampant pollution that fouls their cleanliness and uncontrolled water consumption that limits their flow.
There was a time, back when Jeb Bush was governor, that Florida launched a drive to clean up and save our springs. Then Rick Scott came along and ditched all that.
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we had used that $350 million to revive those springs?
Or we could have repaired some of our other big park problems. For instance, there’s the Hobe Mountain Tower at Jonathan Dickinson State Park, the park where DeSantis tried to put three golf courses last year.
The tower, which sits on top of an ancient sand dune, provides a breathtaking view of the entire park. The tower needs saving — and it won’t be cheap.
“Initial estimates suggest that simply repairing or rebuilding the tower as it stands would cost between $150,000 and $200,000,” the Friends of Jonathan Dickinson State Park website says. 
Fixing Hobe Mountain Tower would have been cheaper than building Ronnie’s Folly. And it probably would have lasted longer than two months.
Another name for DOGE
Say, Mr. DOGE, I notice that you’ve gotten awfully quiet. Could that be because you’re busy writing up a lengthy memo to Mr. Ingoglia about what an atrocious waste of money this was?
Could your memo be endorsing the idea of investigating why Ronnie’s Folly was built instead of all the far more worthy projects I’ve mentioned?
Or were you perhaps reflecting on the difficulty of investigating the guy who appointed Ingoglia to his current position?
Because here’s the problem we have, Mr. DOGE.
Instead of DOGE, Ingoglia referred to it recently as FAFO — “Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight,” he called it. We knew what he meant. But I think he’s the one who’s about to find out.
Whatever y’all come up with as “wasteful spending” by local governments — especially if it’s involving climate change or other legitimate concerns — is likely to pale in comparison to the $350 million for what the governor built in the Big Cypress that lasted only two months.
If FLO-DOGE or FAFO or whatever it’s called next week comes up with a bunch of questionable receipts from, say, Orange County, but ignores this latest DeSantis disaster, nobody can pretend that Ingoglia’s doing his budget-busting in good faith.
They’ll think DOGE is too dodgy. In fact, I bet the next time he demands cooperation from local governments, they’ll just laugh in his face and tell him, “Get along, little DOGE.”

If we want to reduce the cost of electricity, we’re going to need to innovate and take advantage of new technologies.","There have been editorials written and politicians trotting out their plans at town meetings to help us reduce Connecticut’s high electricity prices — some of the highest in the country.  
All the reform advocates have studiously avoided the question of deregulating the power distribution network. (While Connecticut’s energy generation market was deregulated long ago, the distribution companies –United Illuminating and Eversource — are still regulated monopolies.) 
So the fundamental question is this:  do we continue down our current path of allowing the utilities (or, as they prefer, Electricity Distribution Corporations aka EDCs) to have a regulated monopoly or do we change the rules of the game so that there is competition?   And if we do change the rules of the game, what are these changes?
While there have been good reasons to regulate power companies (without power, people die), Connecticut’s regulatory environment is crippling innovation in energy.  We’re in the middle of a technological revolution in electricity production.  While wind power has matured over a few decades, solar cells are finally ready for prime time. 
 Forget what you heard about the costs of solar from years ago.  Electricity from solar cells is now some of the cheapest on the planet.  Not surprisingly, solar installations have taken off, with one third more solar installations globally in 2024 than 2023.  Nearly 600 gigawatt (a GW is a 1,000 megawatts) were installed around the world last year.  Electricity from renewables (solar, wind, hydro) is now 30% of electricity generated –a major shift from fossil fuels.  To put this in perspective, Connecticut’s two nuclear plants at Millstone are a little over 2 GW, so in 2024, the solar cell equivalents of 285 Millstone plants were installed around the world.
Some of you will remember when AT&T held a monopoly on telephone service.  I can recall that, in the early 1980s, a one hour phone call from Massachusetts to Indiana to talk to my girlfriend (during evening hours) was about $10 in 1980s dollars!  That was more than three first run movie tickets back then.  While there were some glitches when Ma Bell was broken up, communications costs have plummeted today.  These drastically lower communications costs have helped grow the economy since customers and businesses can now talk inexpensively no matter where they are.
We are in a similar position now with regards to electricity.  While there hasn’t been much growth in electricity usage for the past decade in the U.S., that’s rapidly changing.  Heat pumps, electric vehicless, and data centers are all going to need more electricity — a lot of it.  What we’re seeing now, though, is that adoption of some of these technologies has been slowed by the high cost of electricity so we’re not getting the savings we should.
In 2017, the Connecticut legislature saw that there was a problem with electricity costs in the state and set up the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s Innovative Energy Solutions Program.  This program called for people outside the utility industry to submit ideas to help the state meet its various goals ranging from storage to decarbonization.  (My group submitted two Phase 1 proposals which were accepted in 2024). Unfortunately, the program hasn’t delivered on its lofty goals, but at least it has showed that there was awareness of the problem.
A recent editorial made the following suggestions, but fundamentally, it’s just more of the same.  We will not see major savings in the costs of electricity.

Modernize the grid. Sure- why not?  Except that United Illuminating’s territory (about 20% of the state, mostly around Bridgeport and New Haven) is actually pretty up to date while Eversource’s territory is more of a hodgepodge.  There doesn’t seem to be much difference in rates though.  New infrastructure is what’s driving the costs of electricity to go up nationally, even though generating costs are coming down. Just look at your bill and see how big those delivery charges are.
Reduce peak demand. Currently the grid is most economically inefficient when it’s run flat out.  When we need more electricity than average days, i.e. peak demand, the costs skyrocket.  Why not try to reduce peak demands?  Well, the climate has other ideas.  Do we really want to be telling people that they shouldn’t run their air conditioners during a heat wave?  Does anyone think that heat waves are going to become less extreme in the coming years?
Use data to tell us where to string new wires. Determining where the infrastructure is needed still involves a crystal ball of predicting what new demand is going to look like.  These kinds of predictions are only as good as the data, otherwise, it’s garbage in, garbage out.
Wait for “cheaper” nuclear. It’s going to be a minimum of 10 years for new technology plants that have already been permitted to come online and there’s no data to show that these plants are actually going to be less expensive to operate.  What are we supposed to do before these plants become available? Take out another mortgage to pay our electric bills?
Rely on existing natural gas plants. We’ve already seen how the swing in natural gas prices can drive up the costs: recall the Christmas of 2023   If we have domestically produced solar, we are going to have predictable pricing for the foreseeable future as the price of sunlight isn’t going to change.  The rest of the country is adding solar and storage in a hurry. Why aren’t we?
More regional cooperation. Unfortunately, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), after dragging its heels, announced some very modest new transmission corridors which aren’t anywhere close to Connecticut.  Simply put, we’re on our own to solve this problem.

None of the suggestions that have been put forward will dramatically lower our rates.  If we want to reduce the cost of electricity, (I think 50% is a reasonable goal. That’s the national average) we’re going to need to innovate and take advantage of new technologies.  Unfortunately, the EDCs do not have innovation in their DNA, so it’s up to us to tell our legislators what we want.  Yes, the legislators have gotten the message that high electricity costs are a problem, but the EDCs haven’t put forward any really useful ideas.  That’s now up to us and the first step is to deregulate the industry sufficiently to allow innovation.  There’s a lot of moving pieces here which makes this transition challenging.  Trying to do it piecemeal doesn’t work- it’s like trying to build a house one room at a time.  But if we don’t do this now, electricity prices are going to continue to rise.
Here are some ideas:

Businesses and homeowners should have more of a choice for who supplies their electricity. Should they simply buy it from the utility or own their individual generation (most likely solar) and storage?  There’s a combination of local and state regulations that drives up the soft costs (soft costs are what’s not hardware, i.e. financing and legal costs) of solar and storage installations dramatically. Larger installations for commercial and industrial businesses have a lower percentage of soft costs which may make increasing these installations more attractive for these customers, but if soft costs overall are reduced, then energy distribution companies are going to have to compete (finally!) for their current customers dollars.  Forget subsidies for everyone except low-income people since the technology to produce your own electricity and store it is cheap enough– if we don’t have excessive bureaucracy!  Not all customers are going to be in this position, but this competition should help lower prices.
Allow Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). This is perhaps the best way for customers to get compensated by the energy companies for their own generation and storage.  Virtual Power Plants reduce peak demand quickly, and so provide a benefit for everyone.
Stop exporting electricity. The state exports electricity which makes no economic sense.  Typically, a region with a low cost of production can export to somewhere else where production costs are higher.  But in Connecticut, we have some of the highest electricity prices in the country– and we’re exporting ~30% of our electricity to neighboring states?
Pay for storage. Why does the state export electricity?  Because we don’t pay for storage.  The economics of the grid were designed to drive construction of new generation and transmission– not to store electricity till it is needed.  Deregulated states like Texas are adding storage frantically because it solves multiple problems: reduces the need for new generation and transmission, stabilizes the grid, reduces peak demand, reduces emissions, and allows arbitrage– buying electricity when its cheap to use when its expensive.  The issue has been that no one has come up with a good way to pay for storage.  We need to try some new business models to pay for storage. But we also need to be prepared to make changes if they don’t work well.

Not everyone lives in a home that could power itself in the near term.  People in apartment buildings need power and they still will need the grid and utilities.  While utilities are going to lose customers– probably both residential and commercial especially in the suburbs — in the cities, electricity consumption will probably increase as heat pumps, EVs and data centers proliferate.  Overall, utilities may wind up selling more electricity than they do now, even if they do lose some residential and commercial and industrial customers.
We are going to need more electricity in the coming years– that’s pretty clear.  But if we don’t produce electricity more cheaply and without increasing CO2 emissions, we’re in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, the technology to reduce costs as well as emissions is already here. We just need business models to use it more efficiently.   
We need our legislators to change the rules so that utilities operate more efficiently and have to face some competition.  If we do this correctly, Connecticut may be seen as a more attractive place to live, instead of just a little state with high electricity costs.

Joe Courtney,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/aukus-agreement-is-chinas-worst-nightmare/,"AUKUS is the strongest, most effective plan for the United States to deter China’s malign behavior in the Indo-Pacific.","On June 11, 2025, the news broke that U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby would lead a Pentagon review of the Australia-United Kingdom-United States security agreement (AUKUS). The Department of Defense has since articulated that this effort will be “an empirical and clear-eyed assessment of the initiative.”
If that standard is applied, the assessment must conclude, as a similar 2025 review in London did, that AUKUS is the strongest, most effective plan for the United States to deter China’s malign behavior in the Indo-Pacific.

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney,   Credit: Lisa Hagen / CT Mirror
China certainly knows that AUKUS’ promise to accelerate the deployment of advanced defense technology by the three participating nations, including the sale of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, will counter the growing strength of its PLA Navy and missile forces in the Indo-Pacific.
China has repeatedly complained about AUKUS in public and in private diplomatic channels, which should speak volumes about its value to Under Secretary Colby as he conducts his investigation. AUKUS, in a nutshell, will blunt China’s regional advantage that threatens the 80-year success of the free and open Pacific.
Much of the AUKUS skepticism in the United States is premised on the misguided notion that the technology being shared and sold among the three allies will create an unacceptable drain on the U.S. military. Since AUKUS is not a binding treaty that commits Australia and the UK to every imaginable conflict in which the United States could be engaged, skeptics argue that the cost and risks of sharing too much are unacceptable.
Under Secretary Colby himself publicly questioned the planned sale of three Virginia-class submarines to Australia last year, before re-entering the Pentagon in 2024, citing concerns that the US Navy cannot afford it. This part of the plan, developed in 2022–23 by the leadership of all three countries as part of the AUKUS “Optimal Pathway,” is essential.
Australia operates an aging fleet of diesel submarines, which will need to be phased out in the 2030s, before its own domestic industrial base is able to replace them with new submarines. The U.S. defense industrial base, despite criticism, is expected to have delivered 28 Virginia-class submarines by the end of 2026, since the nuclear-powered attack submarine was first commissioned in 2004. Ten additional Virginia-class boats will be in the works after 2026. Those 28 submarines are in addition to over 20 Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarines and three Seawolf-class fast-attack submarines currently in the U.S. Navy fleet. For comparison, the Chinese Navy currently operates six nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines, while the British Royal Navy operates five.
Looking past the 2025 submarine tally, Under Secretary Colby’s review should focus on the evolving capacity of the U.S. industrial base when Australia actually purchases its submarines in the 2030s. A key part of this equation is the massive investment by Congress in the U.S. submarine industrial base over the last seven years, which is now coming to fruition.

But CT needs to do more.,"At this moment, when all eyes are on the impact of federal budget cuts on our communities, it is important to highlight one of the most successful accomplishments of this last legislative session here in Connecticuty – the Early Childhood Education Endowment. 
We thank Gov. Ned Lamont for listening to advocates and residents who testified, and for demonstrating leadership, compassion and wisdom. This was no small feat. Our state is now a national model. By supporting the Endowment Fund, our elected leaders put their arms around our youngest residents and their families. Working families won’t have to make a Hobson’s Choice between caring for their children (and not making a living wage) or working to earn a living (just to spend it all on childcare).
This is the role of responsible and responsive government: to use resources and revenue wisely, ensuring all residents can thrive and contribute back to their communities. Those of us in philanthropy have traditionally played a partnering role by providing grants and other support to the nonprofits that are the backbones of our communities. We are prepared to step up today, as we did during the pandemic. We aspire to do our best in these times to ensure that every one of our residents is supported.
The Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut has led a campaign to “End Child Poverty Now” in our state for the last two years, with about 120 partners ranging from universities and nonprofit organizations to think tanks and municipal partners. We embarked on this campaign believing that we could do so much better in our wealthy state. We believe that every child should have what they need to reach their utmost potential.
Providing childcare for families who can’t afford it is an essential step in creating strong communities. But we need to do more. All school children should be provided with healthy school meals. Best practices in the United States and other nations demonstrate that providing nutritious meals for children and youth, especially those in struggling households, enhances their performance and reduces stress on families and teachers. Investing in school meals is a smart investment in our future generation.
As our elected leaders head into the special session this fall, we ask that they build on the success of the last session and invest in structures that can protect those who are vulnerable and promote the basic rights of all our residents. We know that the federal cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other programs will be devastating. Difficult choices must be made. Strategic choices should be made. 
Investing in school meals will ensure that children perform well in school. It will support families’ economic stability. No child should suffer from hunger and malnutrition on account of their parent’s economic status. After all, we are one of the wealthiest states in this nation. Let’s ensure that our children are well fed so that they and their families have the opportunity to thrive in this great state.

As of Wednesday there were three cases of the virus in Davis County, said Trevor Warner, communications manager at the Davis County Health Department. Two of them were neuroinvasive, a severe form of the infection that affects the central nervous system, leading the patients to be hospitalized. 
An individual over 60 years old died at the hospital last week, Warner said. It’s the first death related to the virus in the state since 2023.
“(The neuroinvasive form of the virus) can result in some long-term complications or even death,” Warner added. “So, the more severe infections, those will include a high fever, neck stiffness, the person will be disoriented, and in some cases, have tremors or muscle weakness.”

The neuroinvasive virus may also lead to other serious conditions, including meningitis, encephalitis or paralysis, the Utah County Health Department said in a news release Wednesday. However, most people infected with the virus don’t develop symptoms.
The Utah County Health Department reported five probable human cases of the West Nile virus. Four of them are neuroinvasive. 
The virus has been confirmed in mosquito pools and human cases across different counties in the state, so local agencies are urging residents to avoid mosquito bites. 
Health officials advised wearing insect repellent when outdoors, especially at dawn or dusk, as well as wearing long sleeves, pants and socks at those times, which is when mosquitoes are the most active.
Utahns are also advised to eliminate standing water around homes, even small containers, ensure that doors and windows are screened, and take extra precaution if they are older or immunocompromised to avoid severe illness.
In Davis County, Warner said, residents can call the mosquito abatement district to request an inspection to identify potential issues with standing water or any other sources of mosquitoes. When needed, the district can spray those areas to avoid mosquitoes.
“It’s not uncommon to have West Nile positive pools and have human cases of West Nile. But what is a little uncommon is the amount of neuroinvasive cases, and then the fact that we did have a death,” Warner said.

That was driven largely by outages at Millstone nuclear station.","Connecticut continues to lag behind its goal to slash greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, according to a new report released Wednesday by the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
Emissions of carbon dioxide — the most prevalent of the climate-altering greenhouse gases — rose by 1.5% in 2023 to reach 35 million metric tons, according to the report.
That was largely driven by an increase of more than 1 million metric tons of CO2 from power plants, which the report attributed to a prolonged outage of one of the reactors at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station that necessitated the burning of more fossil fuels to meet electric demand. Smaller increases in emissions were also reported from industrial and agricultural sources, according to the report.
But Connecticut otherwise made progress toward reducing emissions from the state’s two biggest sources: vehicle exhaust and heating for residential buildings.
“The evidence is in: greenhouse emissions in 2023 declined in transportation and buildings, as a result of strong federal and state programs that provide clean air, improve energy affordability, and protect public health,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in a statement included with the release of the report. 
Dykes said the effects of climate change are being felt across Connecticut in the form of heat waves, wildfire smoke and increasingly intense storms — all of which are likely to get worse if sufficient efforts are not made nationally and globally to reduce CO2. And the report came just days after the Trump administration ordered a halt to work on one of the state’s largest planned renewable energy projects, Revolution Wind.
“Addressing these impacts continues to be an urgent challenge,” Dykes said. “As we celebrate this progress in reducing emissions, we are concerned that recent actions by the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] to roll back power plant regulations, vehicle fuel economy standards, and even the Endangerment Finding, will remove critical federal tools that contributed to this progress.”
The annual report, known formally as the Connecticut Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, is required under the state’s Global Warming Solutions Act. That law, passed in 2008, set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% of 2001 levels by 2050. 
The law also set several incremental targets on the path toward meeting that goal, which started in 2020.

While Connecticut was able to meet its initial reduction targets that year, the achievement was largely the result of a the steep decline in vehicles on the road during the COVID-19 lockdown. Overall emissions have steadily increased since then, though they remain below pre-pandemic levels.
If current trends continue, the report found that Connecticut will fall about 5 percentage points below its next target: a 45% reduction by 2030. 
Lori Brown, the executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, said the state’s experience during the pandemic, when levels of air pollution dropped significantly, showcased the benefits of meeting its long-term goals. 
“It’s not just a theory, you know, it’s proof,” Brown said. “It’s the kind of thing that’s right in front of your face that shows we can really make a difference. It’s not too big for us to change the air quality in our state.” 
Brown was also critical of President Donald Trump’s rollback of many environmental and climate regulations, but she noted that data behind the most recently reported increase in emissions predated his current administration. 
She also chastised local leaders, including Gov. Ned Lamont, for supporting a proposed expansion of natural gas pipelines into the state. “It’s easy to point the finger at Trump right now, because essentially, he’s doing everything he can to destroy clean energy,” she said.
Prior to the pandemic, Connecticut’s most significant decreases in emissions came from the power sector. Emissions there declined nearly 80% between 2001 and 2022 as the state retired a number of highly polluting coal and oil-fired power plants while making strides in energy efficiency and building new, cleaner sources of power generation such as solar. 
(Connecticut is a net exporter of electricity, and the state’s greenhouse gas inventory calculates emissions based only on the power consumed within the state.)
Still, the vast majority of the electricity produced in Connecticut comes from natural gas and the Millstone Nuclear Plant. In 2023, both of the plant’s two active reactors experienced extended outages, according to the report, including one outage that was due to refueling.
As a result the plant produced less electricity than in 2022, and its output had to be picked up by other fossil fuel burning plants.
Susan Adams, the state director of government affairs and economic development for Millstone’s owner, Dominion Energy, said in a statement Wednesday that the data highlighted the facility’s role in producing carbon-free electricity and reducing emissions.
“While 2023 was an anomaly, with both a higher number of outages and longer-than-usual events, looking ahead Millstone will continue to operate with regularly scheduled refueling and maintenance outages, but we do not anticipate any extended or prolonged outages,” Adams said. “These planned outages are carefully scheduled during periods of lower energy demand, typically in the spring and fall, to minimize any impact on the grid and to help reduce reliance on fossil fuels.”
The state’s largest source of CO2 emissions comes from the transportation sector, which includes fuels burned to power cars, trucks, trains and planes. Those emissions fell by 2% in 2023, despite an overall increase in vehicle miles driven.
Increased fuel efficiency across all kinds of vehicles were cited as “the predominant driving force” in reducing in transportation emissions, along with a growing number of electric vehicles, according to the report. In addition, the report said a relatively mild winter and greater energy-efficiency measures resulted in a 5.6% decrease in emissions from residential buildings.
Emissions from commercial buildings, wastewater, solid waste and natural gas leaks all fell slightly or saw no change. 
In addition to the goal to gradually reduce emissions over the coming decades, Connecticut lawmakers earlier this year passed legislation pledging to achieve “net-zero” emissions by 2050. Net-zero emissions can be achieved when gases are sequestered or removed from the atmosphere through carbon-capture technology or more natural means such as planting forests and other green spaces.
In 2023, a total of 4.9 million tons of CO2 were sequestered in Connecticut, or about 14% of the state’s total emissions that year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP22077710170842-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-03 21:57:25.969140

Rockefeller Cancer Institute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock (Photo courtesy of UAMS)The National Institutes of Health awarded the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences a $5.8 million grant to continue its research into the side effects of cancer treatment, the health system announced Wednesday.
The five-year grant will fund the third phase of the UAMS Center for Studies of Host Response to Cancer Therapy, according to a UAMS news release. The research initiative, under the federal Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence, is the nation’s first to solely focus on the side effects of cancer treatments like radiation and chemotherapy, the release states.
Research leader and UAMS professor Marjan Boerma said the funding will allow the initiative to expand its studies into immunotherapy, “which can cause significant, but poorly understood, side effects,” according to the release.
“Most cancer patients experience side effects from their treatment, sometimes mild, sometimes severe,” said Boerma, associate director of basic science at the UAMS Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute. “If we can predict who will develop those side effects, or develop strategies to reduce them, we can make therapies safer, increase patients’ quality of life and even allow doctors to safely deliver higher doses when needed.”
The Center for Studies of Host Response to Cancer Therapy has supported 12 research project leaders and 14 pilot studies in its first two phases, according to the news release. The Radiation Biology Shared Resource within the UAMS Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute began as part of this initiative.
The funding for the third phase brings the total federal investment in the project above $27 million in the past decade, the release states.
UAMS has spent years working toward National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation, which would bring in more federal funding for research and create hundreds of new UAMS jobs, the health system has stated.
The Rockefeller Cancer Institute plans to submit its NCI application to the National Institutes of Health in January, Arkansas Business reported in August. If successful, UAMS would be home to the first NCI-designated in Arkansas, Mississippi or Louisiana.
President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed a 40% National Institutes of Health budget cut, and the potential impact on the NCI application and designation process is unclear, Arkansas Business reported.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court that reads more […],"Rex Wu testifies at a Montana Board of Regents meeting in 2023. (Screenshot of video testimony)A man who recently admitted to making hoax death threats on the campus of Montana’s largest university has been sued in federal court by two former Montana State University students for his part in orchestrating the hoax by framing them and allegedly destroying their reputations.
In a lawsuit filed in federal court that reads more like a mystery novel than court brief, an attorney laid out the details of a conspiracy, alleging former student Rex Wu orchestrated hoax death threats and violent racially charged messages against his friend, Alexandra Lin. Both used the incidents to push them toward victory in student elections, the lawsuit says, while destroying the reputations of two other students. Court documents lay out the scheme Wu used to allegedly frame the two other students so as to look as if Wu and Lin had been racially targeted as Chinese-Americans. 
The lawsuit asks a federal court judge to find Wu guilty of defamation and putting plaintiffs Dylan Dean and Daria Danley in a false light that made it nearly impossible to attend Montana State University. The lawsuit also seeks punitive damages as well as attorney’s fees, and a judgment for the pain and suffering inflicted upon both of them by Wu’s actions.
While the lawsuit does not name Lin as part of the suit, because claims against her have passed the statute of limitations, the lawsuit alleges that she was aware of Wu’s work, at one point even telling him to stop the attention he was drawing to the situation.
When contacted about the new lawsuit on Wednesday evening, Lin called the allegations an insult to the victims.
“It’s insulting to the victims of stalking and harassment,” she said. “It’s an insult to the great work the FBI and all the Montana officials who worked on it.”
In 2021-’22, the Montana State University campus was roiled with allegations that several groups, including Asian-American students and the LGBTQ+ community were being targeted. Even worse, advocates for those groups said the administration of former President Waded Cruzado had turned a blind eye to the activities, which included threats of a mass shooting at an LGBTQ+ Valentine’s Day dance.
Lin became the center and the alleged target of the violence when the AGD sorority, of which she was a member, allegedly refused to use preferred pronouns, court documents said. That controversy escalated when Lin appeared to be the target of hate letters that urged her to kill herself, or threatened that she would be killed because of her Asian ancestry. Lin would claim that she was targeted by Danley and sought a protective restraining order, which barred Danley from campus events and booted her from the AGD sorority. At one point, Lin claimed that she had discovered a noose in her bedroom closet as a invitation to kill herself.
Meanwhile,  court documents allege Wu created a sophisticated series of accounts that expressed support for neo-Nazi views and invited the MSU community to push back against diversity. The lawsuit claims that Wu created email accounts that linked Danley and Dean to the racially charged messages, and that Wu specifically leveraged his friendship with Dean to make it appear as if Dean had created the accounts or supported the views. This also landed Dean in trouble, getting several different credentials revoked, including a security TSA pre-check denied, as well as causing him to graduate late.
Both Dean and Danley identified as “conservative, white” students, but “no indications of racial hostility.”
The lawsuit claims the genesis of the controversy began when Danley rebuffed Lin for her use of preferred pronouns, as well as allegations that she had rejected Lin’s sexual advances. The lawsuit says those rejected advances caused Wu and Lin to concoct an elaborate campaign to boost their individual profiles as they both ran for MSU’s student senate, as well as open a platform for them to chastise the university for not caring more about minority students.
“Even before any investigation occurred, Danley’s life collapsed. Her sorority expelled her,” the court filing said. “But the university maintained the discriminatory no-contact order for 18 months.”
Danley was forced to go to federal court to remove the no-contact order, and the university attempted to make her go to sensitivity training, which she refused, said her attorney Matthew Monforton.
The court documents say after that incident, Danley was “effectively brand(ed) a dangerous racist.”
In February 2022, MSU dismissed all charges against Danley, but, the lawsuit claims, “only after devastating her reputation and college experience.”
The court documents say that Wu and Lin were friends and after MSU dropped charges, he designed a cyberstalking campaign designed to make it look like Danley was still targeting Lin. From an account, “DARIA_DD78” Wu is alleged to have sent messages that threatened to “kill the ch—k.”
“One of these days you will get what’s coming to you. This isn’t Missoula in real Montana we kill g—-ks like you,” another message said.
“Wu and Lin became student senate candidates and exploited their fabricated racial threats to bolster their campaigns,” court documents allege, including making impassioned pleas for the Montana Board of Regents to do something about MSU’s failure to protect “marginalized students.”
Wu followed Lin’s statements at the meeting of the Regents.
Court documents also accuse Wu of fabricating documents tied to Dean that showed Nazi swastikas as well as pornographic images. Dean was identified as a member of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group, and was falsely linked to sending threatening messages to Lin in March 2023, including: “You better watch out we know where you live ch—k.”
Hours after that threat was made, Lin received a pizza at her house in Dean’s name.
By that time, news of the events of campus has risen to statewide awareness, with the Montana Human Rights Network calling for more investigation by MSU officials.
According to text messages included in the lawsuit, Wu sent messages to his friend Dean marveling at the media attention that had been generated by the series of events: “You have Fox and CNN out here. Lmao huge national coverage in some town in Montana.”
The MSU student newspaper published an article that said “both the pizza order and the Google form threat were attributed to Dylan Dean.”
“This false attribution in the student newspaper further solidified Dean’s reputation as a violent racist among his peers and faculty,” the lawsuit said.
In April 2023, after a series of articles, including one in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Lin sent a text message to Wu to stop “becoming part of the issue.” And she told him, “We have to focus on the really serious s—t…S—t is on the front page of the (C)hronicle.”
The next day, Lin and Wu held a “teach in” to denounce the threats and share their experiences.
However, the day after the teach-in, Linn was removed as a candidate for the student senate because she “discouraged other candidates’ participation based on a protected class.”  Officials had learned that Lin had sent a text message that accused “two privileged white dudes” of “putting self interest above the common goal” by refusing to withdraw from the student senate, according to the court documents.
  The hoax surfaces 

The court documents filed on Tuesday give a glimpse into how Wu was eventually caught in his role. In December 2024, Wu texted one of Danley’s friends: “Lin did the pronouns stink because Daria wouldn’t sleep with her.”
When FBI agents interviewed Wu in February, he admitted to sending the harassing messages, the court documents said. In July, Wu pleaded guilty to federal cyberstalking charges.
“Dean and Danley did not learn of Wu’s identity as the author of the racial death threats until they learned from the press of Wu’s plea in court,” the court documents said.
The court documents said that the College Democrats of Montana expelled Lin from their organization in 2024 for “online stalking of a 13-year-old political organizer and over $1,000 in merchandise.”
“We do not associate, in any way, with Alexandra Lin,” the group said, via court documents.

(Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) OMAHA — Again on Wednesday, a federal judge rejected the U.S. government’s effort to deny bond to a worker detained and facing deportation proceedings following their arrest in Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods immigration raid.
This time, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon presided over a combined hearing in Omaha for three undocumented workers. His decision mirrored that of similar cases he had ruled on the past several weeks.

Bataillon found that the government was violating due process rights of all three by unlawfully detaining them under an “automatic stay” of a bond an immigration judge earlier had determined was appropriate.
He ordered the detainees to be immediately released upon reposting the respective bond amounts that weeks ago had been set by an immigration judge, but then swiftly challenged by the federal government.
The three — Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo, Diego Palma Perez and Ernesto Cortes Fernandez — were among about 75 Glenn Valley plant workers arrested during a June 10 workforce enforcement operation led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
ICE described the operation as a “federal criminal investigation into over 100 cases of stolen identities.” But the three in court Wednesday have faced no criminal charges, their lawyers said. They face administrative offenses and deportation for allegedly being in the country without authorization.
Federal attorneys representing the Department of Homeland Security and ICE challenged the bonds based on new July 8 guidance from the Trump administration that looks to end bond hearings for almost all undocumented immigrants as they fight deportation. 
That mandatory detention guidance hangs on a section of immigration law applied historically to newly arrived migrants, not those who, like the Glenn Valley workers, already had been in the U.S. for years, even if they entered without authorization.
Bataillon noted that ICE had arrested the Glenn Valley workers under one provision of the law, but then government attorneys wanted to hold them under the different section of law that applied to migrants who just arrived.
Attorney Christopher Ferretti, representing the feds, said during the hearing that his team still asserts that no-bond should apply. Given “short shrift” in the discussion he said, is the government’s interest in “controlling its borders.”
Jamie Arango, a Lincoln immigration attorney representing two of the Glenn Valley workers Wednesday, said the government’s strategy to prolong detention can drive some migrants to self-deport.
 “It’s depriving them of due process,” she said.

Arango said family commitments led her clients to endure more than two months in a North Platte jail. Both have several children, she said, and have been in the country working for decades. “They didn’t want to leave their families behind.”
She said she represents another Glenn Valley worker in a similar situation, awaiting a federal hearing.
Arango said there are numerous people like her clients in Nebraska and across the country. “They’re not letting anyone out on bond,” she said, adding that it is clogging up the immigration justice system. 
Grant Friedman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, who represented Carmona-Lorenzo, said the ACLU has at least one more client arrested in the Glenn Valley raid awaiting a similar hearing.
Bataillon last month ordered the release of three other Glenn Valley workers held under similar circumstances.
Carmona-Lorenzo had been in the U.S. for more than 20 years when she was detained in June, her lawyers said. She and her husband have five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Three are minors, one is in college, and the other serves in the military.
The Glenn Valley workers’ lawyers challenged the prolonged detention in federal civil rights lawsuits that argue the automatic stay unlawfully violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond ICE authority by overriding an immigration judge’s decision on a bond.

“There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote.
ICE officials have said repeatedly that the focus after the raid should be on American “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by migrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.
The new no-bond practice urged in the Trump administration’s memo is the subject of a national class action lawsuit filed by immigrant rights advocates, including the national ACLU.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/busICE.jpg,,,2025-09-03 20:57:41.378228

(Photo by Emily Fitzgerald/Washington State Standard)Washington loggers, school leaders and conservation activists on Wednesday decried the state lands commissioner’s proposal to set aside 77,000 acres of older forests while opening 29,000 acres back up for logging. 
Some said the plan, announced by Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove last week, didn’t do enough to protect the state’s older forests, while others said it would lead to layoffs, business closures and delay of critical school construction projects.
“Not only will this set-aside acreage jeopardize manufacturing jobs in our state, it also threatens beneficiaries with staggering losses in revenue,” said Austin Serrano, a forester who gave public comment during the Board of Natural Resources’ monthly meeting on Wednesday 
Criticism of the plan dominated the meeting’s hourlong public comment period. 
Under Upthegrove’s plan, 29,000 acres of older forests will remain available for harvest. Most of the roughly two-dozen timber sales that were paused in January will proceed.
Members of the timber industry told the board that Upthegrove’s decision to set aside older forest land would hurt their businesses. 
The representatives of logging companies and mills said the bulk of their timber supply comes from Department of Natural Resources lands. Older trees are necessary to make certain specialty wood products like power poles, they said.  
Pausing timber sales has already put the state behind schedule for the sustainable harvest level for the year, and the decision to set aside 77,000 acres of highly-profitable older forests creates further uncertainty within the industry, one lumber company representative said. 
A representative of another company said their business is looking at laying off the bulk of its 35-member crew until the paused sales move forward and additional timber sales are approved. 
Eatonville School District is waiting on its share of revenues from a paused timber sale to help fund a stadium improvement project. 
The district is relying on those dollars to cover the interest on a capital levy passed by voters in 2024. State law doesn’t allow districts to use tax revenue to pay the interest, according to Eatonville School Board President Ronda Litzenberger. 
“Our community believed in this project because we believed that the trust would be honored. We’re doing everything we can to uphold our end of the promise, and we’re asking for your partnership in upholding the state’s,” Litzenberger said during public comment on Wednesday. 
Counties and schools have received logging revenue from the federal government since 1906. 
A federal program to offset timber revenue lapsed at the end of 2023, making more school districts dependent on those funds to operate. 
“We have a good program now that’s providing good, solid, revenue, predictable revenue,” Mt. Baker School Board President Russ Pfeiffer-Hoyt said after Wednesday’s meeting. 
He said the commissioner’s plan “doesn’t make sense” because it will jeopardize that revenue by setting aside older forest land and count on less reliable ways to generate money from forests, like carbon markets.
Chris Reykdal, the state superintendent of public instruction and member of the Board of Natural Resources, supports Upthegrove’s proposal. 
Reykdal’s longterm goal is to fully fund Washington’s schools with state dollars and to not have to rely on timber revenue, which he said has been dwindling for years. 
“It’s inevitable that they’re going to have to change,” Reykdal said of school funding models after the meeting. 
The Washington State Association of Counties, which represents the state’s 39 counties, is evaluating the proposal. 
“We’ve had significant concerns about the process that led to the commissioner’s decision,” association spokesperson Hart Stanley said during public comment, adding that last week’s press conference was a surprise to the organization and its members. 
“Counties are the primary beneficiaries of these working trust lands and to be excluded from such a significant decision is eroding our ability to maintain trust,” Stanley said. 
A spokesperson for the American Forest Resource Council said the regional trade organization was also concerned Upthegrove acted without completing a public process or going through the Board of Natural Resources. 
The Department of Natural Resources says it doesn’t need approval from the board or the Legislature to set aside the forestland.
The board sets policies to guide how the Department of Natural Resources manages the state’s nearly 6 million acres of state public land, including about 3 million acres of “trust lands” that produce revenue – mostly from logging – for schools, counties and other parts of government.
The board also approves logging sales. 
The 29,000 acres of older forests not set aside for conservation will be enough to honor all of the state’s trust agreements for the next decade, according to the agency. 
Upthegrove has said that gives the department time to find alternative methods, like the sale of credits on the carbon market, to make up for any lost revenue. 
Meanwhile, conservation activists expressed dismay Wednesday that many of the proposed timber sales for the next five years were going forward. They said the plan failed to protect what they saw as the most ecologically valuable areas of older forest. 
“The order was celebrated as a bold action, but when it comes to legacy forests, it’s sort of like a rebranding of the status quo as new conservation,” said Sarah Gardam of Whatcom County.
She was one of several who criticized the maps of the older forests created by Department of Natural Resources staff, saying the acres set aside for conservation are primarily strips of trees that are not part of continuous forests. 
Those who voiced support of Upthegrove’s proposal also acknowledged that the maps need work, but said it is a promising concept. 
The maps are still being developed and have not yet been finalized, the Department of Natural Resources said. 
It is standard practice for board members to not respond to public comment during the meeting. Upthegrove, likewise, did not respond to public testimony during the meeting.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dave-upthegrove-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 20:57:41.378228

A call on the governor to temporarily suspend Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar will continue despite an attempt from Molnar to rescind it — but with support from staff to hold firm on the complaint against him.
Wednesday, commissioners voted 3-to-2 against a motion from Molnar to pull back a complaint PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder made to Gov. Greg Gianforte.
The letter asked the governor to suspend the president while an investigation into allegations of professional misconduct proceeds.
Commissioner Randy Pinocci supported Molnar’s motion to recall the letter, but Fielder and Commissioners Annie Bukacek and Jeff Welborn opposed the rescission.
Fielder, who wrote the complaint to the governor on behalf of an internal “response team,” said she did not want to write the letter, and in fact, had counseled Molnar one-on-one on his behavior for months.
But Fielder said the team decided to ask the governor to intervene after it received substantiated evidence Molnar had engaged in retaliation.
Fielder said Molnar’s disruptions included a threat to “take out” anyone involved in filing complaints against him, and she said he has been untruthful and dismissive about the allegations against him.
The PSC has characterized the allegations as complaints of “unprofessional conduct.”
At the meeting Wednesday, Fielder also said they include allegations of sexual harassment, which could be jokes, slurs or innuendo.
Fielder said Molnar had repeatedly interfered with the investigation — attempting to undo a contract with a firm the PSC had hired and denying payment of bills.
She also said Molnar refused to meet with the team unless it was on his terms. Fielder said his tactics have created delays, even though it aims to complete its work.
“There’s a big obstacle in our ability to do that,” said Fielder, also acting chairwoman of the team. “That obstacle is President Molnar. And so we are trying to remove that obstacle for a temporary time period so that we can complete our work.”
Molnar has denied interfering in the team’s work and said his public calls for due process are not retaliation but protected speech. He also said he told a joke but did not see any sexual innuendo in it and has mocked the title of the head of the PSC as inflated — president instead of chairman.
“That doesn’t mean the governor can overturn an election. It doesn’t,” Molnar said.
The governor and all five commissioners are Republicans.
Staff members expressed support for Molnar’s experience — he served on the PSC from 2005 to 2012 before taking office again in January — but pleaded for commissioners to allow the letter to the governor to stand.
PSC staff member Patricia Trooien said employees have voiced complaints about Molnar’s conduct, and staff have a right to be heard as well as their confidentiality protected.
Trooien said she believes the investigation should continue with full cooperation from Molnar.
“I have personally seen your good heart, and I believe you have the capacity to be empathetic, compassionate and fair,” Trooien said. “Your refusal to participate in the investigation is causing damage to you, those around you and this agency.”
She said Molnar has an obligation to take full responsibility for his actions and for the perceptions of his actions.
“I ask you to please take ownership of your actions by participating in the investigation,” Trooien said.
PSC Executive Director Alana Lake also weighed in on the matter — but said it was the last thing she wanted to do.
Lake said Molnar’s experience adds “immense value” to the agency, and she respects his commitment to the people he serves.
But Lake said she values transparency and due process, and even a commissioner is not above the law.
Despite Molnar’s statements to the contrary, Lake said she and other managers took steps to initially address complaints against Molnar at the “lowest levels” possible and with multiple internal counseling sessions.
But she said those less formal attempts failed, and the situation escalated.
She said Molnar told her directly that he would “take out” anyone involved in the process against him and said he had hired a lawyer and private investigator to “go after these individuals.”
“There were no other options than to seek outside investigative support to address the issues,” Lake said.
The PSC retained outside counsel and contracted with a management and communications firm for up to $10,000 for the investigation.
Lake also said retaliation has continued and grown during the past few months, which is one of the reasons for the suspension request.
“I have exhausted all the tools I have as the chief of staff to protect our staff and commissioners from retaliation,” Lake said.
Additionally, Commissioner Annie Bukacek said a “reasonable person” could believe that holding a press conference as Molnar did would discourage witnesses from coming forward.
Molnar announced the investigation to the public in a press conference in July and raised concerns about due process then. He has waived his privacy rights in the matter.
Bukacek also said complaints were lodged against Molnar before June or July — she said she personally made a complaint “several months” earlier.
In her comments, Fielder reviewed the recent history of the workplace climate at the Public Service Commission. Audits had identified numerous problems.
Fielder said the PSC had made progress, but even just a year and a half ago, an audit said staff were concerned about the effectiveness of a new structure.
“Particularly, the audit noted that staff were concerned about management’s ability to address inappropriate behavior in the department,” Fielder said.
She said the agency is obligated to stop inappropriate behavior to both act responsibly and protect staff and to protect itself from liability.
Commissioner Welborn led the meeting, and at one point, he asked Molnar if he would be willing to voluntarily place himself on administrative leave — “that kind of thing can be a tough pill to swallow.”
But Welborn said it would satisfy the desire of the response team to move forward without interference, and it would allow the agency to take care of its own matters without involvement of the Governor’s Office.
In response, Molnar suggested Fielder should place herself on leave for policy errors.
Molnar said he couldn’t leave 200,000 people in his district without representation, and he wouldn’t silence their voices in a current rate case that’s under consideration.
He also said he does not believe he has hampered the investigation — and he doesn’t plan to do so in the future.
“I’m under a microscope now. Would I purposefully do something to impede an investigation?” he asked.
He said the letter to the governor is invalid without a public meeting and without four votes calling for suspension. Molnar also called on his fellow commissioners to follow the policies they were pressing him about.
“I’m tired of being vilified,” Molnar said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-09-03 20:57:41.378228

The spokeswoman, Emi[...]","President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson in Anchorage last month. (White House/Daniel Torok)President Donald Trump left his Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin without a deal for a cease-fire in Ukraine.
The summit did, however, leave the city of Anchorage with one tangible result: more than $200,000 in municipal expenses, largely on law enforcement workers, according to a spokeswoman for Mayor Suzanne LaFrance.
The spokeswoman, Emily Goodykoontz, said the city will seek reimbursement from the Trump administration. A White House spokeswoman referred questions to the U.S. Secret Service; a Secret Service spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, did not directly answer a question about whether it will agree to Anchorage’s request.
During Trump’s first term, the federal government reimbursed Palm Beach County some $40 million a year for protection the municipality provided the president while he was at his Mat-a-Lago estate. And in July, Palm Beach County officials said they would ask for payment out of a $300 million appropriation in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act dedicated to reimbursing local expenses for protecting any formally designated “residence of the president.”
But it’s not immediately clear whether that pot of money can be used to compensate the city of Anchorage, where Trump only briefly visited a military base for the summit.
Guglielmi said that conversations about reimbursement would remain “between the Secret Service and our local partners.”
Trump’s past visits to municipalities as a candidate, meanwhile, have resulted in an array of unpaid invoices sent to his campaign.
In Erie, Pa.; El Paso, Texas; Albuquerque, N.M.; Wildwood, N.J.; Missoula County, Mont.; and Mesa, Ariz., among other places, local governments have tried to compel Trump’s campaign committee to pay up — to no avail. Some have been waiting years for payment from the committee, or from the U.S. Secret Service.
The city of Green Bay, Wis., sent invoices related to local police, fire, public works, parks and traffic services across four appearances during 2024 by candidate Trump and vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Total bill: $56,204.
The Trump campaign, in May 2024, told the city that it “does not pay for policy or security-related invoices,” according to Green Bay spokesman Michael Bergman. The campaign referred the city’s requests to the Secret Service, which also hasn’t paid, he said.
“We have sent demand letters, phone calls, and made public statements,” Bergman said. “We have received no response.”
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign also has $1,822 in unpaid invoices from Green Bay.
In Spokane, Wash., local officials say they’ve simply given up on Trump, and other presidential candidates. The Trump campaign still has a $65,124 tab for police overtime costs stemming from a visit in 2016, while Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign owes $33,318 and Hillary Clinton’s campaign owes $2,793.
“While there are outstanding balances, we do not anticipate payment and are not actively pursuing collection efforts,” Spokane spokesperson Erin Hut told Northern Journal.
Since entering presidential politics in 2015, Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly touted his law-and-order bona fides, vowing to support police and “back the blue.” More recently, an April executive order Trump signed called for “empowering state and local law enforcement,” including increasing pay and benefits for officers.

In Anchorage, summit-related expenses in excess of $200,000 would be a “huge hit to the budget,” said Chris Constant, who chairs the city’s Assembly.
Yearly spending by the city exceeds $600 million, with more than $100 million for the police department alone. But Assembly members can still engage in prolonged debate over individual budget items of $100,000 or less.
“Twenty or 30 grand, I might feel okay with. Fifty grand, starting to get pretty real. But $200,000, that’s a real painful amount of money,” said Constant, a Democrat. “That is how many child care units of service? How many police responses is that to criminal activities happening in the city, or homeless camps?”
Guglielmi, the Secret Service spokesman, said Congress has not authorized his agency to issue reimbursements.
“State and local law enforcement play a crucial role in our ability to effectively safeguard the president and other Secret Service protectees,” he said in an email. “However, the U.S. Secret Service currently lacks a mechanism to reimburse local governments for their support during protective events.”
Constant said expenses for last month’s summit could have been much higher, but were limited because Trump and Putin did not leave the Anchorage military base that hosted the meeting.
Nonetheless, he said, city employees had to be prepared for duty that day, even if they were physically distant from the summit itself. He said he spoke with an Anchorage law enforcement worker who spent the day of the event on call while otherwise recruiting at the Alaska State Fair, far outside city limits.
“Her arm was in the car, ready to drive to town. Everybody was on and ready, right?” he said. “It’s not fair that the local government should have to cover the federal government’s bill. They don’t even have to balance their budget.”

During a Wednesday press conference, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) told reporters that they’re “not getting anywhere” in negotiations with the Senate, continuing to criticize the upper chamber for their failure to present a road funding plan. 
While the budget proposal put forth by the House allocates $3.4 billion to road repairs, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer putting forth her road funding plan in February, the Senate is the sole negotiator left without a proposal for a new funding model. 
Transparency surrounding legislative spending directives, otherwise known as earmarks or pork projects, remained a key division between the chambers. While the House instituted rules requiring lawmakers to submit their funding requests for review, Hall argued the Senate wants to continue the status quo, not disclosing their earmarks until after the bill is signed. 
“I’m not going to sign up for another bill where we spend hundreds of millions of dollars that we don’t know what it is until way after the bill is signed, and then you guys tell us what they are months later and we find out it was all scandalous. Let’s disclose it now, like we did,” Hall told reporters.

In a statement posted to social media, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) hit back on accusations that she has been the issue in budget negotiations.
“When you’re taking breakfast and lunch from kids to balance your budget, I’m going to have a problem with that. When you gut health care and supports for moms and babies, then yeah, I’m going to be a problem. When you’re cutting hundreds of police officers and services for crime victims, you better believe I’m going to cause a problem,” Brinks said. “That’s his plan. And I pledge to the people of Michigan that I will be a “problem” until Republicans start putting them first. I’m in your corner and I’m not going anywhere.”

While House Republicans’s school funding plan included an increase to per-pupil funding, Democrats and education advocates have spoken out against the proposal, as those classroom dollars would need to be used to fund other programs like free school lunches and at-risk programs.
During the press conference, Hall, alongside House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) and Minority Vice Chair Matt Maddock (R-Milford), responded to several criticisms of their budget – including the reduction in funding for 300 full time employee positions within the state police – alleging that several state departments had overbudgeted for hiring, requesting state funds for hundreds of unfilled positions and retaining those funds.

When asked how many of these positions were open due to retirements or other temporary vacancies, the lawmakers could not immediately provide an answer. 
“It is very hard to get this information out of the departments. It’s very, very difficult. We do have regular reports that we get, but they don’t want to disclose the information,” Bollin said.
With a new fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, lawmakers have until the end of the day on Tuesday, Sept. 20 to reach an agreement, pass a budget and avert a government shutdown.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Former Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson has resigned as manager of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport less than eight months after he was appointed to run the fourth-largest cargo airport in the world.
“Airport Manager Dave Bronson has announced his resignation from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) for personal reasons, with September 2 as his final day of service. Departing in good standing, we appreciated Mr. Bronson’s contributions to ANC, and extend our best wishes as he begins his next chapter,” said Lex Yelverton, the airport’s communications and PR specialist. 
Yelverton said the airport’s division operations manager will work as the acting manager while the position is vacant.
Bronson did not immediately return a phone call or text message seeking comment on his resignation. He told the Anchorage Daily News that it was “time to move along” and “it’s hunting season.”
Bronson has occasionally been mentioned on social media as a possible candidate for governor in next year’s statewide elections.
Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2026. With a little over 11 months remaining before the primary election, 10 candidates have already filed documents indicating they intend to campaign for the office. Nine are Republicans.
The airport director’s job is a political appointment by the office of the governor, Yelverton said.
Bronson, a Republican, was elected Anchorage’s mayor in 2021, months after the incumbent Democratic mayor resigned during a sex scandal and amid a conservative backlash to COVID-19 prevention efforts by the city.
One of the leaders of that opposition movement, conservative activist Bernadette Wilson, has already declared her candidacy for governor.
During Bronson’s term as Anchorage mayor, he was accused by city employees, including some of his own hires, of mismanagement and unethical behavior.
Bronson ran for re-election in 2024 but was defeated by independent candidate and current Mayor Suzanne LaFrance. 
Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan endorsed Bronson’s candidacy for re-election.
Before working as mayor, Bronson was a commercial airline pilot, an officer in the Alaska Air National Guard, and served in the U.S. Air Force. 
At the time of Bronson’s selection for the airport job, Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities Commissioner Ryan Anderson said Bronson’s “blend of hands-on aviation expertise and public sector experience is an asset to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.”
The Ted Stevens airport, thanks to its location as a refueling stop on transpacific cargo flights, has been one of the busiest cargo airports in the world for almost a decade. 
In rankings published July 8 by the Airports Council International, it was the No. 4 cargo airport in the world and the second-busiest in the United States by cargo volume, with 3.7 million metric tons of cargo shipped, only slightly behind Memphis (3.75 million tons) and Shanghai (3.78 million tons). Hong Kong, with 4.9 million tons of cargo shipped, is the No. 1 cargo airport in the world.
The ACI statistics show Anchorage cargo traffic grew 9.4% from 2023 to 2024. 
That growth may have slowed — it predates the imposition of international tariffs by President Donald Trump and his administration’s decision to end the de minimis tariff exemption, which allowed packages worth less than $800 to be shipped to the United States without an import tax.
That exemption had applied to much of the cargo shipped through Ted Stevens, and its expiration could reduce cargo demand.

(Courtesy of Disney)A mother lies dead. A son on the run. Mysterious creatures in the Alaskan wilderness create a paranormal encounter for the suspected killer.
Derived from the best-selling Audible audiobook “Midnight Son,” by James Dommek Jr., a new documentary on Hulu premiers September 4,“Blood & Myth,” directed by Kahlil Hudson and executive produced by Dommek. The story follows Dommek’s investigation into a series of shocking violent crimes that shatter a remote Native village in Northern Alaska.
Dommek first learns about a string of bloody attacks, and the details don’t add up. At the center of the rampage is fugitive Teddy Kyle Smith, a fellow Iñupiaq man and successful actor who was admired within his tribe.
The mystery deepens when Smith is apprehended after making a run for it in the wild, and makes a shocking claim: while out in the wilderness, he had a frightening encounter with Iñukuns – sinister beings well-known and long-feared by the Iñupiaq people – and that they had guided his violent actions.
“The first thing he said after being captured was ‘They’re real!’” Dommek told ICT from Alaska. “He says he heard them and then they showed themselves to him.”
During a subsequent trial, Smith’s tale of Iñukuns fell on deaf ears. The truth of his actions doomed him to being convicted of attempted murder after he left his mother lying dead on the floor of her house, ran into the woods and shot two men in a cabin who both survived. His mother’s death was ruled inconclusive with no actual cause given. He claimed to have encountered the Iñukuns in the woods outside his tent.
Dommek knew the frightening stories of “the little people” – whose existence is accepted as fact by northern Native communities and supported by first-person accounts and chilling sightings.
Obsessed by the story, he takes a journey back to the village to uncover the truth behind what Smith allegedly saw in those mountains. Was it possible that those myths were true, or was it all a “theater of the mind” as he says?
“I’ve always been obsessed with Alaskan survival stories,” Dommek says. “There were so many things going on with the story, but the crime, the matricide, the violence, those were a part of the story, but it’s not the whole thing. It’s just many little strings that braid together to make a pretty strong rope.”
Dommek is eventually allowed to visit Smith in jail.
“He was guarded about tough questions in there. Smith wanted to do the interview with his side of the story. He’s exhausted his appeals, but he still has hope. He’s still working to get a sentence reduction; he didn’t want to incriminate himself.”
The documentary shows footage taken by a woman that had flown over the area and shows a few rocky villages along a river that no one knew were there or who lived there.
“I don’t know where it is exactly,” Dommek says. “The government put a restriction on the area. The president of our tribe can’t even go there and that’s our land. There’s a buffer of 10 miles; they’re calling it a sacred site. I heard they were going to send a team of archaeologists this past summer to go and check it out, but there were massive wildfires in the area that prevented them from going.”
Dommek says the villages look like a wintertime camp, except the homes are made out of rocks. The size of the doorways and windows are very tiny and would have been difficult for adult humans to get in and out of.
In the film, Smith claims he first heard the little people and then they showed themselves to him one night, and he knew that he couldn’t show any fear or they might harm him. They told him he was “weak” and “vulnerable,” words that scared him into violent action.
After hearing his claim, Dommek met Smith in prison. What was his take after meeting him in person?
“My take on meeting him in person was I don’t believe he has mental issues. He was a US Marine, and the Marines have a very extensive vetting process, including a lot of psychological tests. He’s incredibly sharp. He’s grounded. We asked everyone we interviewed, what do you think? Do they exist or not? Now they may not be mythical magical creatures, but I definitely think that there was a group of small people that lived out on the land, as recent as a couple decades ago, and may still be out there now.
“What I hope people take away from this is that number one, Native people are very good storytellers. And number two, there is still some mystery that exists in this world. The Western concept is that we know it all. In the Indigenous concept, especially northern Alaskan, we don’t know it all. It’s a big wild place. That’s what I hope people take away. I’m excited to introduce this new monster in the woods that most viewers will never have heard of.”
The film presents a spectrum of different images of what these beings could be and how malevolent or benevolent they might be. The filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to decide, what they are, what they could be, how much Teddy may have been influenced by these beings who he may have contacted.
“There’s also the other social justice side,” director Hudson says, “getting into the issue around the justice system in rural Alaska and how it’s failed Native communities for centuries. The Western justice system is not set up to serve rural Alaska villages. Something needs to be done, more work and awareness brought to light and how those failures are impacting Native communities.”
Based on the facts, myth aside, he was convicted of attempted murder. They sent his mother’s body to Anchorage and the coroner said her death is inconclusive. Perhaps she was scared to death or shocked, but it was enough to send her panicked son on the run.
“I was always under the assumption only guilty people run,” Dommek claims. “After talking with Ted, I came to a new conclusion that maybe he thought he did something to her so frightening that she died from the shock. This is all speculation. But he was given 99 years for the attempted murders, the strictest sentence an Alaskan can get. We don’t have the death penalty up here.
“I don’t know if too many other stories exist like this, where it’s an Indigenous true crime told through an Indigenous lens. I just hope that we did the story justice. I’ve been obsessed with this since I first heard it.”
Dommek says he did an audiobook first for a reason.
“I wanted to tap into Native storytelling and oral tradition and the ‘theater of the mind’ and using words and unveiling the facts more like a movie does. The audio book did really well, and here we are today talking about the documentary.”

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)An updated state protocol that New Mexico health officials hope will remove barriers for residents seeking COVID-19 vaccines will likely be effective by the end of the week.
State Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie signed a public health order on Aug. 29 directing the health department to work with the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy “to amend regulations to remove barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
The order followed reports of some “pharmacies announcing they cannot administer the vaccine in New Mexico unless recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has yet to convene and act on the matter,” the health department said in a news release over the weekend.
NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source New Mexico on Wednesday that the updated protocol from the Pharmacy Board is expected to remove any of the barriers presented by the current federal guidelines.
Currently, he said, many of the vaccines administered in the state are done so through its pharmacies, which are governed by a protocol established by the Pharmacy Board and others that essentially requires the pharmacies to follow the ACIP guidelines in order to have “prescriptive authority” and give vaccines. Lacking the ACIP guidelines, Smelser noted, the pharmacies’ parent companies “have determined that they require a prescription in order to get a vaccine.”
The revised protocol, he said, addresses the situation.
“We anticipate that that will alleviate the problem,” he said, “however, we cannot control the decisions made by the parent companies of the pharmacies in New Mexico.”
New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department Communications Director Andrea Brown confirmed to Source NM on Wednesday that the updated protocol from the Board of Pharmacy “is pending final approval and should be effective by the end of this week.”
Smelser said New Mexico has not received its full allotment of the COVID-19 vaccine, but health officials expect more to be available in the state in the next few weeks. He said residents can call the health department’s hotline, 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for assistance finding or scheduling their COVID-19 vaccines.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recent approved the updated COVID-19 vaccine formulations, but added new restrictions. As noted in the new health order, under the new FDA order, people over the age of 65 are eligible, but younger people require an underlying medical issue for eligibility. Smelser said he believes a large number of residents “will meet the criteria” and be able to access vaccines once the new protocol is in place and more of the allotment has arrived.
“New Mexico Department of Health believes that these are safe and effective vaccines for prevention spread in our communities, as well as to prevent severe outcomes like hospitalizations of death,” Smelser said. “So our main objective is to be able to get the vaccines out in an efficient manner to those who need it in our state.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/COVID-vaccine.jpg,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ amendments to an Ottumwa coal plant’s water discharge permit have stirred controversy among environmental groups in Iowa, who allege the permit allows the station to avoid federal regulations on leachate discharges. 
Despite DNR promises that the Ottumwa Generating Station does not discharge leachate, water that has interacted with the waste products associated with burning coal, the discharge of leachate occupied most of the conversation at the Wednesday public hearing for the permit. 
Wendy Hieb, DNR’s coordinator for industrial wastewater permitting, said at the hearing that the amendment adjusted discharge limits at a wastewater outfall that was new when the Ottumwa Generating Station’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, NPDES, permit was last renewed. 
Hieb said the amendment makes use of data collected from the new outfall over the past year as it has been in use. 
“I want to be very clear what it does not do: Landfill leachate is not discharged via this NPDES permit, nor are we proposing to do so,” Hieb said.

In July, environmental groups including the Iowa Environmental Council, Sierra Club and Environmental Law & Policy Center submitted comments on DNR’s draft permit amendment, alleging the permit “unlawfully” avoided federal guidelines for leachate discharges. 
DNR staff and an Alliant Energy spokesperson said at the time that the permit draft “incorrectly” included mention of leachate discharge. 
Hieb reiterated that DNR made a mistake in including mention of leachate in the draft permit for the Ottumwa Generating Station, which is owned by Interstate Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy. 
A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said at the time that the Ottumwa Generating Station “does not produce leachate and the plant is not allowed to discharge leachate from any landfill under its permit.” 
Leachate, which collects between the bottom of a coal ash landfill and the lining of the landfill, is pumped out. According to DNR, IPL, which also operates the nearby Ottumwa Midland Landfill to process the coal ash generated from the station, now transports its leachate from the landfill to either be used and evaporated at the generating station, or to be treated at the Ottumwa Water Pollution Control Facility. 
Hieb said this change was made to come into compliance with the latest effluent limitation guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. She said these guidelines also change with almost every administration, making it “no small effort to keep up” and ensure permits are current. 
Per the same guidelines, Hieb said the landfill has to cease discharging to the municipal water treatment facility by 2027. 
Raihan Rashidi with the Iowa Environmental Council said in public comments that the permit “cannot delay action.”
“Communities and surrounding ecosystems deserve protection,” Rashidi said.
Michael Schmidt, general counsel for the Iowa Environmental Council, also spoke in public comments and said the federal regulations require “action as soon as possible” to ensure coal burning facilities are compliant. 
“These discharges of heavy metals should be a concern to everyone in the area, and we encourage DNR to impose compliance requirements rather than avoiding the issue,” Schmidt said. 
Leachate and groundwater
The public hearing was requested by the environmental groups in their comments on the permit. Since then, more written comments have been sent to DNR about the permit.
Hieb said most of the submitted public comments on the permit have “not been germane” to the limit guidelines but have been about leachate and “underdrain” water, another type of water that can become polluted in a coal-ash landfill system. 
Underdrain water, or the water that seeps past the coal-ash landfill and is pumped out of the ground, was the subject of a notice of intent to sue from environmental groups to Interstate Power and Light. The notice alleged IPL was discharging this water, without the proper permit, into a wetland that flowed into the Des Moines River. 
Hieb said IPL is working to secure a different type permit system to address the underdrain, which she said cannot be covered by Iowa’s stormwater permits. 
Brian Rath, an environmental engineer senior who leads the solid waste and contaminated site section for DNR, further explained that the department has a process to determine if the underdrain water has been impacted by the coal residue, by comparing it to groundwater at an upgradient, opposite to the flow of groundwater, site. 
If the underdrain has higher levels of heavy metals, like arsenic and boron, than what is measured in groundwater at the upgradient site, then that water must be collected and treated the same as leachate. 
But, Rath said when the groundwater underdrain at the landfill is compared to up-system groundwater levels, they have “not shown that they are impacted by the landfill.” 
“Instead, they are exhibiting similar characteristics to that upgradient groundwater,” Rath said. “Therefore, there is no discharge of unmanaged leachate coming from the Ottumwa Midland landfill, through the groundwater, underdrain system, or otherwise.” 
In addition to interested environmental groups, members of the public, some Ottumwa residents, attended the virtual hearing and voiced concerns about living downstream of the plant and the impacts it might have on their health. 
One Ottumwa resident said “we’re just really getting tired of corporations not being held accountable.” 
Josh Mandelbaum, an attorney with the Environmental Law & Policy Center, also called for greater transparency from the plant, per the EPA’s effluent guidelines, often referred to as ELG rules. 
“This permit fails to meet the transparency requirements of the ELG rule,” Mandelbaum said. “The public deserves to know what’s in our water and what is being done to address this pollution.”
Terry Langan, the co-president of the Nishnabotna Water Defenders Board, said the DNR needed to “uphold the public trust.” 
“Stop allowing these industries to export their externalities to downstream,” Langan said at the hearing. 
DNR’s responses to public comment and questions asked Wednesday will appear on the department’s website once filed.

How the settlement will benefit students,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/09/la-unified/,"The settlement affects about 250,000 students, who will get access to one-on-one tutoring and other services.","In summary
The settlement affects about 250,000 students, who will get access to one-on-one tutoring and other services. 


More than 250,000 students in Los Angeles Unified will be eligible for extra tutoring, summer school and other academic help after the district settled a class-action lawsuit alleging that its remote learning practices during the pandemic were discriminatory.
The settlement, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, was announced Wednesday by the law firm representing families who said their children fell disastrously behind during the Covid-related school shutdown in 2020-21.
“After five years of tireless advocacy on behalf of LAUSD students and families, we are proud to have secured a historic settlement that ensures students receive the resources they need to thrive,” said Edward Hillenbrand, a partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. “This critical support will help pave the way for lasting educational equity.”
Los Angeles Unified had no comment on the case because the settlement has yet to be approved by the court. A hearing is set for December, although the settlement goes into effect immediately.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles and nearly every other school district in California closed for in-person learning from March 2020 through fall 2021. Students attended classes virtually, and most fell behind academically. Test scores statewide plummeted after schools reopened. Chronic absenteeism soared.
In fall 2020, a group of families whose children were languishing during remote learning sued Los Angeles Unified, saying the district wasn’t doing enough to ensure students were receiving an adequate education.
One parent, Akela Wroten Jr., said that his second-grade daughter was behind before the pandemic and became even more lost during remote learning. She struggled with reading and never got the extra attention she needed because teachers weren’t assessing her progress. 
Another parent, Vicenta Martinez, said her daughter didn’t get any instruction in spring 2020, in part because she never received logon information for remote instruction and the school never followed up. When she finally did access remote classes, the lessons were short and teachers offered little feedback.
“LAUSD’s remote learning plan fails to provide students with even a basic education and is not preparing them to succeed,” the lawsuit alleged.
The suit singled out an agreement between the district and its teachers union that said teachers would only be required to work four hours a day, wouldn’t have to give tests and weren’t required to deliver live lessons — their lessons could be asynchronous, or recorded beforehand. In addition, the agreement said the district wouldn’t evaluate or monitor teachers during that time.
United Teachers Los Angeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs argued that the district’s policies discriminated against low-income, Black, Latino, disabled and English learner students, because those were the students least likely to have adequate support to succeed in remote learning. Those student groups also comprise the vast majority of students in the district, the nation’s second-largest.
The settlement requires the district to offer a host of academic support, including summer school and after-school tutoring, to the 250,000 students who were enrolled in L.A. Unified during the pandemic and are still with the district. Among those students, 100,000 who are performing below grade level will be eligible for 45 hours of one-on-one tutoring every year through 2028.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081820_LAUSD-COVID_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031

Carrie Hamblen and Rep. Nathan Small join New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair at the groundbreaking on Sept. 3 for a project to increase housing in southern New Mexico. (Leah Romero for Source New Mexico) State and local lawmakers broke ground on the Arcadia Phase 4 project in Las Cruces Wednesday, one of various projects funded by $120 million allocated by the state to help increase affordable housing and reduce homelessness throughout New Mexico.
Officials gathered in a lot located in Las Cruces’ East Mesa at the northeastern reaches of the city, where new residential construction is largely focused. The housing project will include 52 single-family homes in the Arcadia subdivision, Natalie Green, housing and neighborhood revitalization administrator for the city, told Source New Mexico.
Green explained that the Arcadia neighborhood has been many years in the making and is part of the city’s master plan. She said the next development is Mesa Vista and areas will again be set aside for affordable homes, but construction is still years away.
“We’re planning well in advance,” Green said. “We just want to emphasize, especially for Arcadia, that it’s single family homeownership. It’s for those first-time home buyers, for some of our families who are just currently priced out of the market, whether it be because of escalating costs or interest rates, and so we’ve developed a program to just help get families into single family housing.”
The program is a partnership between the City of Las Cruces and Tierra Del Sol Housing Corporation, which works to help people attain housing.
The Arcadia project received $3.25 million in state funding, according to a news release from the city. Las Cruces and Doña Ana County received a total of $11 million of the state’s $120 million affordable housing and homelessness allocation in House Bill 2 during the most recent legislative session.
The other projects include more single-family home neighborhoods, multifamily rental housing, senior housing, transitional housing and the Landlord Risk Mitigation Program – a partnership between the city and Mesilla Valley Community of Hope, a nonprofit organization that provides various assistance to unhoused people.
“There is a vision for what this community wants to look like, and how you want to build, how you want to support the families who are from here, how you want to accommodate new growth, and how you want to…support all different income levels of family,” New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions Sec. Sarita Nair said during the groundbreaking. “And that was really, again, unique in the state and it made it easy to make the choices to make these investments here.”
Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), chair of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee, said the work of the committee during the most recent legislative session was focused on supporting investments that make life easier for New Mexicans.
“I am absolutely dedicated to making sure that we have first-class infrastructure, investment and support across every area, so that we have jobs, and you see fewer help wanted signs,” Small said during the groundbreaking. “That’s going to drive down costs for all of us and make life affordable, so that we have a wide range of places for folks to live. And you know what that does? That makes it more affordable for all of us to live in this incredible community, even as it continues to grow.”

(Photo by Alex Wroblewski-Pool/Getty Images)Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited Annunciation Catholic school and church Wednesday afternoon, one week after a shooter opened fire on the school’s first Mass of the year, killing two and injuring 21. 
The Vances also visited 10-year-old Lydia Kaiser, who was critically injured in the shooting, at Children’s Minnesota in Minneapolis. 
Kaiser was shot while protecting her younger “buddy,” according to the family’s GoFundMe. Her father, Harry Kaiser, is a gym teacher at Annunciation who was also in attendance at Mass; he stayed with students, reuniting families, while his daughter was rushed to the hospital. 
In a press conference Wednesday afternoon at Children’s, Harry Kaiser read aloud the message that he shared with Vance during the visit:
“Will you please promise me, as a father and a Catholic, that you will earnestly support the study of our culture, that we are the country that has the worst mass shooter problem? … Will you please promise to pursue, despite powerful lobbies, some commonsense, bipartisan legislation as a starting point, so we can come out of our corners and find the values that we share, so that this time, progress is made?”
Speaking with the press before boarding his flight back to D.C., Vance said he’s “never had a day that will stay with me like this day did.” He asked the public for prayers for one child victim of the shooting who is still in critical condition — 12-year-old Sophia Forchas — and said he would honor the families affected by the shooting by hugging his children and saying he loves them.

Asked about Gov. Tim Walz’s plan to call a special session of the Minnesota Legislature to address mass shootings, Vance said he won’t tell Minnesota leaders how to respond.
“I think that there’s a strong desire from across the political spectrum to do something so that these shootings are less common. I think that it’s important that they actually take steps that are favorable, that are going to work,” Vance said. 
Leah Kaiser, the mother of Lydia, referenced a proverb — quoted by Annunciation Principal Matthew DeBoer shortly after the shooting — that goes, “When you pray, move your feet.”
“Vice President Vance, you have enormous authority. Please, use this moment to move your feet and transcend our political divides to promote peace, and unity, and hope,” Leah Kaiser said. 
On the sidewalk outside of Annunciation, someone wrote the prayer of St. Francis — the same prayer House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, who was assassinated earlier this summer, carried in her wallet: 
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:

where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;

However, DHS said the designation will end in 60 days after the notice is published in the Federal Register. Initially, Venezuelans with TPS were granted protections until October 2026 under the Biden administration, but Noem revoked that extension.DHS is currently being sued over Noem’s decision to revoke the extension granted under the Biden administration for TPS for two groups of Venezuelans, people who arrived in 2021 and those who arrived in 2023. DHS has already terminated TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans who arrived in 2023, which is still being challenged in courts. “Given Venezuela’s substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration’s efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. During the last day of President Donald Trump's first term, he granted deportation protections for that group of Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. before Jan. 20, 2021, citing unstable conditions with the country’s government. “The deteriorative condition within Venezuela, which presents an ongoing national security threat to the safety and well-being of the American people, warrants the deferral of the removal of Venezuelan nationals who are present in the United States,” according to Trump’s 2021 proclamation. After that designation, under the Biden administration in March 2021, then-Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas created a TPS designation for Venezuelans who entered the U.S. before March 9, 2021.Mayorkas created a second TPS designation, for another group of Venezuelans who arrived in 2023, about 350,000. TPS is designated when a country is deemed too dangerous for return, due to violence or a major disaster.

“It's a once-in-a-generation investment that's going to shape our communities for decades,” said Christa Shute, executive director of NEK Broadband.

Vermont is moving closer to universal broadband internet access, officials say, as the state’s Community Broadband Board released a proposal last week to allocate nearly $180 million in federal, state and private funds for broadband infrastructure projects. 
The bulk of the funds have been made available to Vermont through the federal Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment, or BEAD, program. If the proposal is accepted by the federal government, rates of access to broadband internet will rise to 99% statewide through these grants, according to Community Broadband Board Executive Director Christine Hallquist.
The board, which was formed in 2021 to advance broadband access in the state, has faced a number of challenges in crafting the proposal, including bureaucratic delays and the high inherent costs of rural broadband construction. But local leaders say the infrastructure this funding will provide — if approved by the federal government — will have far-reaching benefits for rural communities across the state, and particularly in the Northeast Kingdom.
The timeline for greenlighting BEAD funding has been complicated. 
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration under President Donald Trump changed its requirements for state proposals in June, giving states just 90 days to submit revised materials. Vermont’s broadband board made its proposal available for public comment starting last week, and the federal deadline for submission is Thursday. 
The board’s plan seeks to use about $119 million in federal BEAD funding to deploy infrastructure — just over half what the state was originally allocated by the program in 2023. There has been no guidance from the Trump administration about how or if the state will be allowed to use the remaining funds.
A spokesperson for the Vermont Community Broadband Board said the state will also submit a proposal for related non-infrastructure projects to the same funding source Thursday, but that its contents remained confidential until then.
Among the telecommunications administration’s June rule changes was new language about how states should weigh different technologies, including a reclassification of low Earth orbit satellite internet as a potentially equivalent alternative to fiber optic. 
In the wake of that policy change, Elon Musk’s company SpaceX applied for its Starlink service to be the provider for essentially every Vermont address that the federal grants were intended to cover, according to Hallquist.
But Hallquist said the technology simply doesn’t work very well for many places in Vermont when you account for factors like foliage cover and the state’s irregular, mountainous landscape.
“We did an extensive engineering analysis,” Hallquist said, to which SpaceX “didn’t even respond properly.”

“We defined them as a non-priority technology,” Hallquist said of providers like SpaceX. The state will use low Earth orbit satellites only where the cost for ground technology exceeds $17,000 for a single location.
Fiber-optic internet is the clear focus of the board’s proposal, accounting for roughly 90% of the nearly 15,000 BEAD locations covered by the grant. Satellites will cover less than 7% of locations.
SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment.
The new rules also placed a greater emphasis on finding lowest-cost solutions for broadband services, and eliminating what the new administration views as unnecessary regulatory measures surrounding issues like climate awareness and equitable hiring practices.
In an ideal world, Hallquist said, broadband internet would be guaranteed to all residents, regardless of price, but that she saw the logic of cost-cutting by transferring a small number of marginal, expensive sites in rural areas to satellite coverage. In talks with providers, the board was also able to reach lower cost agreements this summer than in previous negotiations.
Environmental impact and fair employment are not significant worries, according to Hallquist. Providers will still have to meet statutory environmental requirements, and Vermont employers meet high fair-practice requirements anyway, she said.

‘A once-in-a-generation investment’
The Community Broadband Board has made NEK Community Broadband the largest provisional grant recipient in the proposal by far, with an allocation of over $93 million. The Northeast Kingdom provider, which is run as a communications union district (a municipal body formed to advance local internet infrastructure), serves 72 towns in the region.
Christa Shute, executive director of NEK Broadband, said her organization’s service area includes more than half of the state’s eligible households underserved by internet. The funding would help build over a thousand miles of fiber optic infrastructure, reaching nearly 10,000 addresses, she said.
Shute’s optimism is cautious — she’s aware the proposal still needs to be accepted at the federal level. 
Hallquist said the board was confident enough in the proposal getting federal approval that it would be appropriate for some providers to begin construction at their own risk. Shute intends to stop short of that, but said her team will begin the permitting and design work that must come before construction begins.
“It’s a once-in-a-generation investment that’s going to shape our communities for decades,” Shute said. “It will put individuals (in the NEK) on an equal playing ground for the opportunity to join the rest of the world.”
Heather Alger,  the head of economic access programs at Northeast Kingdom Community Action, said she views internet access as a necessity for full participation in society. It’s necessary not just for social connectedness, but for health care, civic engagement and social services. 
“Individuals here are left behind because they don’t have access,” Alger said. “We need to get infrastructure into the Northeast Kingdom.”
NEK Broadband offers reduced rates and free installation for qualifying low-income customers, which Alger has seen make a “tremendous impact” for her clients.

Ellie de Villiers, president of the Vermont Communications Union District Association and executive director of Maple Broadband, another provisional BEAD recipient, said she was glad the majority of the contracts had gone to district companies laying terrestrial technology.
The cost-driven language of the new telecommunications administration rules had made de Villiers worried that smaller or publicly owned companies wouldn’t be able to compete with larger for-profit corporations, she said. De Villiers called the level of resourcing that will potentially be gained by Vermont communications union districts “very good news.”
Several private companies have also been provisionally allocated grants, including Consolidated Communications and Comcast.
“We recognize how important it is for Vermonters to have access to affordable, reliable broadband … we have a strong track record of working closely with Vermont’s Communications Union Districts (CUDs) to deliver future-ready fiber to unserved and underserved communities,” wrote a spokesperson for Consolidated Communications in a statement to VTDigger on Wednesday. “Our goal is to expand choice, not limit it.”
Shute also emphasized the possible cultural impacts of the investment. 
“We all talk about health and we talk about business,” she said, “but just being able to connect with people is also really important.”

(Photo by Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) ANGOLA – A section of the Louisiana State Penitentiary undergoing emergency repairs is being used to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, Gov. Jeff Landry and officials with the Trump administration announced Wednesday.   
Landry said the facility “will house the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested by ICE.”
A complex at the state prison is already being used to house 51 detainees and has a total capacity of 416. 
Joining Landry at the prison to make the announcement were U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheehan, who previously served as Landry’s Wildlife and Fisheries secretary. 
“Louisiana, you’re going to be an example for the rest of this country,” Bondi said. 
Landry declared a state emergency in late July to allow the expedited repair of Camp J at Angola. The four-building complex had been closed since 2018, with its only use as a quarantine site during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Neither the governor nor Noem shared whether the facility will be used as a post-conviction facility or as another ICE detention center where detainees await charges or trial. 
The detainees will join more than 4,000 inmates at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which stands on the site of a former slave plantation that is still a working farm now staffed with prisoners.  
Workers on the prison’s “farm line,” who pick vegetables that help feed the prisoners, are currently suing the state, alleging dangerous working conditions. Inmates at Angola can earn a maximum of $8 a week, regardless of the type of work they do. 
Landry touted Angola’s natural features, including “forests full of bears” and “swamps full of alligators” as among the new facility’s safety features. 
The Camp J section of the prison where ICE detainees are being held was once known as the “Dungeon.” It was designated as solitary confinement to segregate prisoners for disciplinary reasons. Prison officials closed it seven years ago after its cell locks malfunctioned, allowing inmates to evade security checks. Dozens of weapons were discovered after its closure, and more than 80 prison employees quit, retired or were fired related to misconduct at Camp J. 
Though it was rumored Camp J would be renamed Camp 47 to honor President Donald Trump, it has instead been renamed Camp 57 in honor of Landry, the 57th governor of Louisiana. 
The governor also referred to the facility as “Louisiana Lockup,” a title that was featured prominently on an oversized licensed plate that adorned the lectern he, Bondi and Noem used at a news conference in front of the facility.  
Landry’s emergency order in late July suspended state procurement code and public bid law to allow the officials to secure any materials and write or amend any contracts needed to respond to the emergency. 
Despite being asked by reporters multiple times, Landry would not disclose how much money the state spent on renovations or operations or whether the federal government would reimburse the state for any of its costs. 
Sheehan said the facility has been brought up to ICE standards, and detainees will have access to attorneys and a law library. 
Aside from its state penitentiary, Louisiana has become a go-to location for the Trump administration since it placed a heightened emphasis on immigration enforcement in January. The state’s nine ICE processing and detentions centers have a combined capacity of 6,000 people, second only to Texas with more than 28,000.
Louisiana State Penitentiary has room to hold more than 6,000 incarcerated people. Its population was 4,253 as of June 30, according to the most recent statistics from the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety. 
Immigrant rights advocates say the Louisiana ICE facilities have been full for several months because Bondi and the U.S. Department of Justice consider federal courts in the South to be more friendly venues for its immigration cases. 
According to data analysis from the Deportation Data Project, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 1,989 people in Louisiana from when Trump returned to office Jan. 20 through June 26. More than half of those arrestees have since been deported or removed from the United States.
The analysis also found that just 6% of ICE arrests in Louisiana over the period were convicted violent criminals.        
Critics of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration have called on federal courts to uphold the U.S. Constitution’s requirement of due process for persons who are arrested. They note the vast majority of immigrant detainees have not been allowed to post bail while awaiting trial and are therefore unable to build their defense and secure witnesses.

Pulaski County Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson heard arguments from attorney David Couch, representing the plaintiff League of Women Voters of Arkansas, and from Justin Brascher of the Arkansas Attorney General’s office, representing Secretary of State Cole Jester.
Act 236 of 2023 increased the number of counties where ballot initiative groups must gather signatures from 15 to 50. The League of Women Voters has supported multiple citizen-led ballot initiatives in the past few years, including a current effort to put proposed direct democracy protections on the 2026 ballot, and asked the court to enjoin Act 236.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Couch said Wednesday that Act 236 interferes with petitioners’ ability to collect signatures, especially because compiling petitions for submission to the Secretary of State is a multi-step process.
The state Constitution’s Article 5, Section 1 put forth the 15-county minimum for signatures on petitions for ballot measures. Couch argued that Act 236 violated this section’s “unwarranted restrictions” provision, which states, “No law shall be passed to prohibit any person or persons from giving or receiving compensation for circulating petitions, nor to prohibit the circulation of petitions, nor in any manner interfering with the freedom of the people in procuring petitions.”
Another provision of the same section states, “No legislation shall be enacted to restrict, hamper or impair the exercise of the rights herein reserved to the people.” Couch said this supports the plaintiff’s case.

The constitutional question in the case is whether the Legislature can change a portion of the state Constitution by passing a law, Couch said. Brascher argued in response that Act 236 does not violate or amend the state Constitution but instead “works within the confines of Article 5, Section 1.”
“The Constitution says you’ve got to have at least 15 [counties], and that’s a floor from which the General Assembly can make a decision going up,” Brascher said.
He also argued that the case should be dismissed because of sovereign immunity, the principle that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
The higher threshold for secretary of state approval did not stop reproductive rights advocates from collecting more than 102,000 signatures in 53 counties in an attempt to put a proposed limited right to abortion on the November 2024 ballot. Citizen-led constitutional amendments require 90,704 signatures.
The proposed abortion amendment did not end up on the ballot after then-Secretary of State John Thurston’s office disqualified more than 14,000 signatures on a technicality and the state Supreme Court upheld his decision.
Thurston was the initial defendant in the current case, but Jester was appointed secretary of state after Thurston was elected treasurer last year.
Ballot coalitions request preliminary injunction in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, was a plaintiff in the suit when it was first filed. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Herbert Wright ruled last year that King did not have standing to bring the complaint and dismissed him as a plaintiff. The case was assigned to Johnson after Wright was elected to Little Rock District Court.
Couch said after the hearing that he is confident the plaintiffs will prevail in the case.
He is also representing the League of Women Voters in their federal court challenge against a slate of new laws passed this year placing more requirements on direct democracy efforts. Two ballot question committees asked the court in July to temporarily block the six challenged laws. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Sept. 30 in Fayetteville.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Two Kentucky Republicans are playing conflicting roles in a drama that threatens to divide President Donald Trump’s political base.
U.S. Reps. Thomas Massie and James Comer are central players in the controversy over releasing investigative files in the case of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Massie, who had already gained Trump’s ire, is leading a crusade to force a House vote on the full release of the Epstein documents by the Department of Justice (DOJ).
House Republican leaders oppose Massie’s move and are hoping an investigation by Comer’s committee will satisfy Republican demands for more transparency on the Epstein investigation and prosecution. 
Epstein’s death in federal custody in 2019 was ruled a suicide, although many Trump supporters have speculated that he was murdered to keep him from revealing embarrassing information about prominent people. Trump fueled speculation about Epstein’s death during his 2020 campaign. In 2024, Trump said he would declassify the Epstein records if returned to the presidency.
Massie appeared Wednesday with accusers of Epstein and U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., in a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol. 
Massie has filed a discharge petition that needs 218 signatures, or half the House, to force a vote on a records release that the Trump administration has resisted. If all Democrats sign the petition, it would need six Republicans to succeed. Only four Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, had signed by Wednesday afternoon, two short.
On Wednesday, Trump said calls for the full release of Epstein files are “a Democrat hoax that never ends.” The president has previously vowed to recruit a Republican opponent for Massie in next year’s primary election. The two clashed this summer over Trump’s bombing of Iran and Massie’s vote against the GOP megabill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

House Republican leaders are hoping to dissuade congressional Republicans from signing Massie’s discharge petition, instead supporting an investigation by the House Oversight committee, led by Kentucky Republican Comer. 
Comer’s committee on Tuesday released more than 30,000 pages of records from the investigation of Epstein, although the top Democrat on the committee said most of the information in the records had already become public.
The Oversight Committee also heard what Comer called “heartbreaking” stories from the survivors of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted and is in prison. He is pressing for a House resolution that directs the Oversight Committee to continue its investigation.
“The Committee is working at an unprecedented pace and doing the work as it is supposed to be done,” Comer told the House Rules Committee. “What we heard today is that these survivors support these efforts and support transparency and accountability — goals we all share. This resolution furthers those goals. It supports our work. It supports the release of documents. And most importantly, it achieves what the survivors want. There is no question that Epstein and Maxwell were terrible criminals.”
Massie said he appreciated Comer’s efforts, but said he still had concerns about redaction of information within the documents and that some documents were already publicly available. 
“They may find some information, but they’re allowing the DOJ to curate all of the information that the DOJ is giving them,” Massie said outside the Capitol. 
At least one GOP candidate vying to replace outgoing U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell is standing with Trump. 
Nate Morris, a Lexington businessman who is a staunch opponent of McConnell, said after a Tuesday night town hall that Republicans in Washington “don’t need distractions.” 
“We’ve got a finite amount of time. We don’t need distractions. We don’t need people deviating from the president’s agenda,” Morris said. “We’ve got a once in a generation opportunity when we’ve got the Congress, we’ve got the executive office. We’ve got to move quickly to continue the push for the America First agenda, and we don’t need any distractions.”
A pro-Trump super PAC has been running anti-Massie ads in Kentucky in keeping with Trump’s vow to unseat the incumbent.
One rumored candidate for the president is state Sen. Aaron Reed, a Shelbyville Republican elected to the state legislature last year. Ahead of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast in August, Reed told reporters that he is “happy being a senator right now” and is preparing for the 2026 legislative session.
“It’s a great honor to be a senator, and it’s also an honor to be considered, by some, to possibly be a congressman,” Reed said when asked about the rumors. “That wasn’t my focus. It’s not my focus today, but if God’s will is to do that, it’s kind of hard to fight that.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/massiesept32025-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031
,DC,2025-09-03 23:06:18+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Immigration groups ask appeals panel to reinstate refugee programs,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/immigration-groups-ask-appeals-panel-reinstate-refugee-programs,,"WASHINGTON — Immigration attorneys asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to restore two injunctions against the Trump administration's move to suspend refugee processing and to reinstate funding for refugee resettlement.Attorneys from the International Refugee Assistance Project pushed for three judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to lift a stay the court issued earlier this year that narrowed a ruling from a district court judge in Washington state. That stay allowed the Trump administration to continue blocking refugees, but said the processing for individuals conditionally approved for refugee status must continue, despite a more favorable ruling for the immigration groups at the district court level.Earlier this year, a district court in Seattle issued two preliminary injunctions, one to block the Trump administration from ending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and another to resume funding to refugee assistance organizations. The judge found the president exceeded his authority in trying to end a program established by Congress.Melissa Keaney, a senior IRAP attorney, said during Wednesday’s oral arguments that failing to restore the program and funding would upend the half-century-old legal framework for refugee resettlement and those it is meant to serve.“What is at stake are the lives of thousands of refugees for whom Congress devised a careful plan for their effective resettlement that's been in place for 50 years,” Keaney said.Day 1 executive order dismantled refugee programThe suit challenges President Donald Trump’s January executive order that suspended all refugee admission and processing, as well as funding for organizations that handle resettlement in the United States. Three groups that had their cooperative resettlement agreements with the State Department terminated are plaintiffs in the suit — Church World Service, Lutheran Community Services Northwest and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, or HIAS.“With one stroke of his pen, the president has elected to dismantle it all, causing overwhelming and irreparable harm to refugees stranded abroad, their families who are awaiting reunification, and the states and localities that have planned for their arrival,” Keaney said.Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis said the Refugee Act allows the president to set caps on refugees and to determine who is allowed to be admitted into the country.“The president here made a finding that it was against the national interest because of the unprecedented surge of migration over the last four years, and because of the burden that placed on localities and on taxpayer funds,” Davis said.The panel of three judges that heard oral arguments were Kenneth Kiyul Lee, Jay S. Bybee and Richard R. Clifton. Former President George W. Bush nominated Bybee and Clifton. Trump nominated Lee. 128,000 refugees waiting to enterThe judges questioned the indefinite nature of the proclamation, which allows the president to make a determination every 90 days whether to continue suspending refugees' admissions.“If we don't know when the proclamation will end, what's the justification for stopping the processing for people who, … at least in theory, in six months, the door may be opened again, but since nobody has been processed, nobody will actually be standing in line,” Clifton said. Davis said that 128,000 refugees have been processed and would be waiting to enter the U.S.Clifton asked why processing of refugees should be stopped completely. Davis said the State Department doesn’t believe it’s efficient to “start processing a bunch of people who won't have any chance of getting in until the president determines that.”Bybee said processing refugees is different than allowing them to enter the U.S.“The (executive order) covers admission, it doesn't cover processing or applications,” Bybee said. “The Refugee Act provides a very, very detailed set of instructions about how we designate refugees and how we ultimately admit them.”Davis said that “if you can't get admitted, there's not really much of a remedy.” Refugee resettlement servicesDavis gave a similar answer about why resettlement services for refugees were suspended, saying the State Department suspended them because “it didn't make sense to continue providing funds when no new refugees would be admitted.”Lee asked if there are refugees admitted into the U.S. who would be eligible for resettlement services. Davis said some of the lead plaintiffs in Wednesday’s suit have gotten services and that the cancellation of grants was for future services. “A lot of the money has already gone out throughout the year, and the government has committed to paying for any work that's already been done,” Davis said. “It's just terminated individual grants going forward.”Lee asked if those resettlement funds were mandatory under a federal law authorizing funding for refugee services, but Davis said the Trump administration’s reading of the statute is that the funds are discretionary. “So you say, ‘You got into the United States, good luck?’” Bybee asked. Davis said the secretary of State has the authority to make that determination.Clifton pushed back and said the statue says the federal government “shall” provide refugee resettlement services.“We've got a congressional act which says this is what the government should do,” Clifton said. “Where does that give the government discretion to decide we don't want to do it anyway?”Order subverted law, immigration attorney saysLinda Evarts, senior IRAP attorney said Trump’s executive order overrode Congress’ authority, which created the refugee program. She added that by suspending refugee services the executive order also violates the Refugee Act because the law entitles qualified refugees to certain resettlement services such as job training.“The act has two main objectives,” Evarts said. “One: To provide a permanent and systematic procedure for admitting refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States. And two: To provide comprehensive and uniform provisions for the effective resettlement of those admitted refugees.”Bybee asked if Congress allows the president to set caps on the number of refugees admitted in a year, why Trump couldn’t set the cap at zero.Evarts answered that would effectively kill the program Congress created.“That would be directly contrary to Congress's system, to have a permanent and systematic way for admitting refugees into this country and providing for them once here,” Evarts said.",,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Freedom’s Frontier has received the half-million dollars the federal government held hostage for six months, ensuring the organization can continue for another year to preserve the story of the struggle for freedom through historic sites across Kansas and Missouri.
Freedom’s Frontier is among 62 National Heritage Areas that recognize historic, cultural and natural resources, with an emphasis on preservation, recreation, tourism and educational projects. NHAs are supported through public-private partnerships, and the Trump administration had refused to release congressionally approved funding for them.
A Freedom’s Frontier spokesman said during a conversation for the Kansas Reflector podcast in June that the organization would cease to exist without the federal support. He urged anyone who cares about preserving history to contact their representatives in Washington.
The funding was released on Tuesday.
In a statement, Lucinda Adams, executive director of Freedom’s Frontier, said “advocacy turned the tide.”
“Because of the dedication and advocacy of our friends and partners across the region, we are now able to continue our core mission of promoting tourism and economic development in rural Kansas and Missouri,” said Lucinda Adams, executive director of Freedom’s Frontier. “Your calls and conversations with your representatives mattered. We are deeply grateful.”
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, a Missouri Democrat, sent a letter in June to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget urging the release of funds for Freedom’s Frontier and other National Heritage Areas. The freeze was lifted in July, but reduced staffing at the National Park Service caused further delays and uncertainty, according to a statement from Freedom’s Frontier. The funding would have expired if not distributed before Sept. 30.
Freedom’s Frontier unites more than 200 sites across 41 counties in eastern Kansas and western Missouri. Collectively, they preserve the story of the border war that preceded Kansas’ entry into the union, the enduring struggle for freedom and the settlement of the western frontier.
The sites include the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri, the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in Topeka, the Little House on the Prairie Museum in Independence, Kansas, the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum and Hangar Museum in Atchison, and the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.
Johnny Szlauderbach, director of communications and strategic projects at Freedom’s Frontier, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast in June that the organization was working to “make sure that people understand that these stories are nationally significant.”
“This area is interesting in that it’s served as a kind of microcosm for concepts of freedom throughout American history,” Szlauderbach said, from the abolition of slavery to the fight for women’s suffrage, to the landmark legal battle that ended segregation in public schools.
“This is a testing ground. We serve to be stewards of that nationally significant story,” Szlauderbach said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6130212-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho state government agencies’ budget requests for the next fiscal year are now publicly available. 
The requests are online on the Division of Financial Management’s website, and are for Idaho’s fiscal year 2027, which starts July 1, 2026. 
Last month, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered all state government agencies besides public schools to cut their budgets mid-year by 3% ahead of an $80 million projected budget shortfall. But the budget shortfall estimate didn’t account for tax cuts in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which could cost Idaho another $167 million to implement, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.
The budget request for Idaho’s largest state government agency, the Department of Health and Welfare, was not available online by 4 p.m. Wednesday. 
The requests are one of the first major steps in the process to fund state government. 
In January, Little typically releases his own proposed state budget. Then the Idaho Legislature, which usually meets during the first few months of the year, considers budget requests by state agencies and the governor as lawmakers craft budget bills. 
Idaho’s powerful budget-setting committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, has shifted to a different budgeting process that splits agency budgets into barebones funding and new spending.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier / NC Newsline)North Carolina’s public schools reached their highest graduation rate in history last year, while students also posted a three-year high on most standardized tests, according to test data presented Wednesday to the State Board of Education.
The state’s four-year cohort graduation rate climbed to 87.7% for the 2024-25 school year, marking the third consecutive increase. 
“We’re very excited, of course, today to recognize the highest four-year cohort graduation rate for North Carolina at 87.7%,” said Tammy Howard, the Department of Public Instruction’s senior director of accountability and testing, during a press conference on Wednesday. “This is a consistent increase for the past three years, but most notable, the highest ever.” 
The report showed improvements in 12 of 15 reading and math exams, including gains on every end-of-grade math test for grades three through eight. Howard said the results also revealed steady progress across all racial and ethnic groups, the strongest performance in three years.

“These results represent more than just numbers,” said State Superintendent Mo Green. “They represent thousands of students better prepared for their next phase in life.” 
One of the standouts was Nash Early College High School, which earned an overall A rating and exceeded academic growth targets for the sixth year in a row. Students there achieved proficiency rates of 83% in biology, 89% in math and 96% in English. 
Principal Thomas B. McGeachy attributed the school’s success to its strong culture of teamwork and willingness to take risks.. “I’ve tried to create an environment where I encourage staff and scholars to take risks,” he said during the press conference. “Don’t be afraid of failure, because if you didn’t achieve what you wanted to that means you reflect on the experience and you build upon it.” 
Frederick Lindsay, a 13th-grader at the school, said the school’s dual enrollment program with Nash Community College gave him new experiences that reshaped his goals. 
“Since we’re linked with Nash Community College, we have a wide variety of opportunities,” Lindsay said. “I got to experience a new country for the first time for $500 to stay there for five days. That’s an opportunity that you wouldn’t get many places.”
Challenges remain
While math proficiency is nearing pre-pandemic levels, only 52.5% of third- through eighth-graders were proficient in reading last year, a rate still below the 57.3% recorded six years ago.
“Reading is more difficult and takes more time,” said said Stacey Wilson-Norman, chief academic officer. “Our teachers have been trained, but we just need to align some of the other supports to really accelerate that progress.”
Green noted that North Carolina ranks 48th nationally in per-pupil spending, nearly $5,000 less per student than the national average, which could constrain future improvements. That gap, he said, makes it harder to attract the best teachers and to offer a full range of resources.
Officials also pointed to lingering setbacks from the pandemic and natural disasters, including lost instructional days in western school districts impacted y Hurricane Helene.
Despite these challenges, state leaders said the gains mark an important step toward their goal of making North Carolina’s public schools the best in the nation by 2030.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7295-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341

“It's a great nation,” said Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex. “I want a news source that’s going to report and reflect (that) accurately.”

Courtney Cutting has listened to the local radio stations around her hometown of St. Johnsbury for as long as she can remember. Her listening hit a stride two summers ago, she said, when flood damage shuttered the diner she worked at, putting her out of a job.
But last month, Cutting noticed a change on the airwaves. The newscasts that her favorite station — WMTK “The Notch” — played at the top of the hour, and which she relied on for national and international news, sounded different.
“When it would come on, I would turn up the radio to be like, ‘What am I hearing?’ Cutting said in an interview. “And then that’s when I got the end tagline, which is, ‘America’s listening to Fox News.’”
“The Notch” is one of seven stations based in the area where Cutting grew up that are now owned and operated by Essex County Republican Sen. Russ Ingalls. The Newport real estate broker purchased the media group earlier this year in a $1 million deal with longtime local broadcaster Bruce James. The stations, which air different types of music and some sports and talk programs, broadcast throughout the district Ingalls serves in the Senate.
Cutting emailed Ingalls to ask about the change, and when the senator replied, it confirmed what she had suspected for weeks: While the seven stations previously aired news from a mix of sources, he had switched all of the broadcasts, solely, to Fox News. Ingalls told VTDigger that, before the change in early August, the stations played news from either the Associated Press or the major broadcasters ABC, CBS and NBC.
Cutting wrote back, in an exchange she shared with VTDigger, that the switch had left her frustrated. To her ears, she wrote to Ingalls, the Fox newscasts offered scant context about the many controversial actions taken by President Donald Trump’s administration in recent months, and often lacked the perspectives of people who opposed them.

Ingalls contended in response that the reaction he’d received from listeners after changing the newscasts had been overwhelmingly positive. He told VTDigger he had received more than 1,400 supportive messages from local residents since he made the change, while he’d so far had only “two confirmed emails of dissatisfaction.” 
“I’m sorry that you don’t like the president,” Ingalls wrote to Cutting. “I didn’t like the last one much but he was still the president. I don’t know what I can tell you that will help you other than it was a good business decision based on what we are hearing.”
The stations Ingalls operates include WMOO “Moo 92,” JJ Country and WIKE “The Notch” in Newport; Magic 97.7, Kix 105.5 and WSTJ out of the St. Johnsbury area; as well as WMTK “The Notch” in Littleton, New Hampshire.
Earlier this year, as he was starting to operate the local radio group, the senator told VTDigger he did not want to make the stations’ content more political — even as he, himself, is one of the area’s most recognizable politicians. In an interview this week, he contended he was motivated to change the newscasts not by his conservative politics, but by the repeated requests he heard from listeners to “do something about the news.”
None of those listeners specifically asked for a change to Fox News, Ingalls said. He settled on that network because people were asking for more “positive” stories about the country, he continued, something he believes Fox News provides. He said he’s frustrated by “negative” news coverage of Trump in mainstream news sources.

“Just because CBS, ABC, NBC and AP hate Trump doesn’t mean that the rest of America does. I mean, he’s our president,” Ingalls said. “I was tired of the negativity that was coming from all those other news sources. That’s not what my stations are about. That’s not what Russ Ingalls is about. It’s not … how I run my businesses. I like cohesiveness. I like people getting along and being together.”
He contended, too, that the decision had nothing to do with supporting Trump.
“I don’t give two shits about Trump. I really don’t. But it’s the country in itself — this country is doing very, very well. It really, really is. It’s a great nation,” he said. “I want a news source that’s going to report and reflect (that) accurately.”
Fox News’ radio programming is syndicated to about 1,500 stations across the country, according to a company press release. The network frequently features pro-Trump opinion hosts; the president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, has her own program on the network.
In 2021, Fox News was sued by the voting equipment manufacturer Dominion Voting Systems over claims the network’s hosts had knowingly peddled falsehoods that Dominion rigged the 2020 presidential election so Trump would lose. The news giant later agreed to pay about $790 million in damages to resolve the case. 
Ingalls is well-known as one of the Vermont Senate’s most conservative voices. He faced criticism from the state’s Democratic Party in April when he was one of a handful of members of the chamber to vote against a resolution condemning the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student activist, by masked federal immigration agents in Colchester. The Columbia University student, who was a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, was later ordered released by a federal judge.
To be sure, Ingalls also represents some of the state’s most politically conservative areas. In Essex County, which makes up most of his district, 55% of voters supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election, compared to 33% on average statewide. 
Cutting, the longtime radio listener, said there are other changes Ingalls has made to the stations’ content that she likes. She said she’s noticed more spotlights on local businesses — “that is a wicked cool idea” — and regular on-air listings of community events. There’s even a show Ingalls hosts himself that “I just love to listen to,” she said.
“I really stand behind the way he wants to use it in building community, and making it a forum to foster these kinds of conversations,” Cutting said of the radio network.
“We need to be informed and have hard conversations as a community,” she said — but added that if “all of these radio stations go to one news source that isn’t reporting the full breadth of the news, then, what’s there going to be to talk about?”

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The State Board of Pharmacy held a special meeting on Wednesday to vote on a measure to effectively bypass the immunization recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), following concerns that federal health authorities may politicize recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination.
The  board is responsible for determining when and to whom pharmacists can administer vaccines. Historically, it has followed the recommendations of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel of experts who issue guidance for the nation’s doctors and pharmacists.
The measure voted on by the board unanimously will allow the State Board of Pharmacy to issue guidance based on the recommendations of three medical professional societies: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The professional organizations comprise thousands of doctors from specialized fields of medicine, and have long been involved in the study and creation of vaccination guidelines based on evidence and rigorous scientific review. Each group has recommended broad use of COVID-19 vaccinations.

Wednesday’s vote means, despite the federal vaccine advisory panel not yet issuing COVID-19 immunization guidelines, pharmacies across the state can administer the latest seasonal vaccines as soon as they obtain them. However, a spokesperson for Gov. Josh Shapiro advised Pennsylvanians who want a vaccine to first contact their pharmacy.
Grace Sesi, the executive director of regulatory affairs for CVS Health, which operates the nation’s largest pharmacy chain, spoke at the board meeting to support the measure. She said CVS pharmacies in Pennsylvania have already received the latest COVID-19 vaccines and are “ready to act with urgency” to administer them.
The board scheduled the meeting after concerns were raised by Shapiro, as well as doctors and pharmacists across the commonwealth, that the federal panel’s recommendations may be guided more by politics than science. 
In June, U.S. Sec. of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime and outspoken vaccine skeptic, removed and replaced all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee. And in May, Kennedy said that the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, citing no specific studies and potentially putting the authority’s guidelines at odds with professional associations representing thousands of pediatricians, gynecologists, family doctors and scientists across the country.
While the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has yet to issue vaccination guidelines for this year’s seasonal COVID-19 shots, it is scheduled to meet later this month. But already, the Food and Drug Administration, which approves vaccines for public use, has deviated from its typical recommendation that virtually all adults and children over six months old receive the shot. Instead, it has suggested its use only for those 65 and older, as well as for children and adults with health conditions that place them at risk of more severe infection from COVID-19.
The move signaled that immunization recommendations from federal health authorities may be at odds with mainstream scientific consensus among doctors and researchers.
Rob Bonacci, a clinician, former CDC employee and special advisor to Pennsylvania’s secretary of Health, told the State Board of Pharmacy that recent changes at the federal vaccine advisory panel “have left many concerned about the integrity of the [vaccination] review process, and the trustworthiness of those recommendations.” 
“We’re in new territory,” he added. “When I think about where else I go as a public health professional and a clinician for public health guidance, I think of our professional organizations.”
A spokesperson for the State Board of Pharmacy referred questions from the Capital-Star to Shapiro’s office.
Following the vote, Shapiro issued a statement applauding the board’s decision and calling efforts by the Trump administration to limit COVID-19 vaccine access “outrageous.”
“I called on the State Board of Pharmacy to hold a special meeting to bring clarity to the people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said in the statement. “Health care decisions should be up to individuals — not the federal government and certainly not RFK Jr. My Administration will continue to protect health care access for all Pennsylvanians.” 
Some lawmakers have also made moves to ensure pharmacists in Pennsylvania can administer vaccines, regardless of the recommendations of the CDC’s immunization advisory panel.
On Tuesday, Rep. Arvind Venkat (D-Allegheny), an emergency physician, issued a memo announcing his intention to introduce a bill he says will put immunization recommendations for Pennsylvanians in the hands of state health authorities instead of federal ones.
“Chaos in federal health agency policymaking, which is no longer backed by scientific evidence, but instead by anti-vaccine ideology, will cost people’s lives,” Venkat said. “This legislation will allow Pennsylvanians to avoid this politicization of healthcare and get the life-saving vaccines they need, even if the federal government stops recommending them purely due to politics.”
A previous bill introduced by Venkat would also require insurance companies to cover vaccines recommended by state health authorities and medical professional organizations.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The company operating some of the most visited pornographic websites in the world has agreed to pay Utah $5 million over allegations that it didn’t do enough to remove harmful content, including videos depicting rape, child sexual abuse and secret recordings. 
Officials announced a proposed consent order on Wednesday, filed in federal court in the district of Utah, in conjunction with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. It targets Aylo, which operates websites like Pornhub, Redtube and, as Margaret Busse put it, “hundreds of other sites with names that are really too obscene to mention.” 
“Aylo has openly, repeatedly and severely violated Utah’s consumer protection laws for years by allowing the unconscionable distribution of the worst of the worst,” said Busse, the executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, during a news conference. 
In addition to the $5 million, Aylo will be required to implement a more stringent review and regulatory process on its websites.

According to court documents, since 2012 Aylo profited off of the distribution of “tens of thousands” of videos and images depicting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and non-consentual material (NCM), which includes things like revenge porn, rape, secretley recorded videos and “other absolutely appaling categories of content,” said Melissa Holyoak, commissioner with the FTC. 
“One of Aylo’s employees referred to Pornhub as a ‘goldmine for rape content,’” Holyoak said Wednesday during the press conference. 
Aylo’s websites are incredibly popular — In 2021, its sites saw a total of 800 million monthly visits from U.S. consumers, per court documents.
According to the complaint, the company falsely claimed CSAM and NCM content could be flagged by users and removed; that it would ban users that uploaded CSAM and NCM; that content previously flagged would be “fingerprinted” so it could not be re-uploaded; and that it would verify the ages of people in its videos. 
Users would then view, download and further distribute these videos “millions of times, often not knowing it was CSAM or NCM,” further victimizing people in the video according to court documents. 
Officials say Aylo only started to restrict CSAM and NCM after credit card processing companies began threatening the company with fines. 
“All of this adds up to a portrait of a company that has no intention to comply with its own policies, even when called out by credit card companies, journalists, and just a general public outcry,” Busse said, telling reporters Aylo was not only motivated by “unprecedented profits,” but seemed to “relish spreading this kind of content for its own sake.”
The proposed consent order directs Aylo to pay the state of Utah $5 million that Busse said will go into a consumer protection education fund. The company will also be required to pay an additional $10 million if it violates the terms of the settlement. 
According to court documents, Aylo will now:

Implement a program preventing the dissemination of CSAM and NCM, which includes “policies, procedures and technical measures to ensure that such content is not published on its websites and a process to respond to reports about CSAM and NCM content.” 
Create a verification system to ensure people who appear in videos on Aylo’s websites provide their consent. 
Remove all content uploaded prior to the agreement until Aylo verifies the people in the videos were consenting adults. 
Post a notice on its websites informing users about the allegations and legal action. 
Establish a privacy and information security program. 

In a statement, an Aylo spokesperson said the settlement “reaffirms and enhances Aylo’s efforts to prevent the publication of child sexual abuse material and non-consensual material on its platforms.” 
The company also pointed to several safety measures it’s taken in recent years, including verification requirements for users who upload content and proof of consent and identification for performers. And, it said the allegations levied by Utah and the FTC all stem from content uploaded before 2020 — since then, Aylo has implemented a number of safety features.  
“The resolution reached involved enhancements to existing measures but did not introduce any  new substantive requirements that were not either already in place or in progress,” a statement from the company reads.
Holyoak said that’s why the settlement is important — it will require Aylo to review all existing materials while strengthening future protections. 
“It ensures the protection of the current content on the website, but then it goes further, now we have prevention for future materials that might be uploaded. It’s such an important guardrail,” she said. 
According to Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, an independent third party will audit Aylo and its websites over the next 10 years to ensure its compliance. If they violate the terms of the settlement, they could face criminal action in addition to the increased fine. 
“If they don’t do these things, let me be very clear, I will take them back to court,” Brown said. “For years, Aylo ignored hundreds of thousands of flags on its videos, including those flagged by its consumers as potentially CSAM or NCM. As of today, they can no longer do that.”

Meanwhile, attorneys for Trevor Jones, who resigned the $164,800-a-year job in 2022, filed their own brief with the Nebraska Supreme Court maintaining that the AG’s office had errored in trying to appeal the discharge.
The competing court briefs are the latest chapter in an on-again, off-again prosecution of Jones. He was alleged to have committed theft by deception for redirecting $270,000 in funds provided by the private Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation to a competing foundation he had set up.
The funds were intended to cover expected operating losses by the Nebraska State Historical Society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and state auditors maintained the funds should have been deposited with the State Treasurer, not another foundation.
Theft by deception is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
But the state’s prosecution of the case was first dismissed by a Lancaster County District Court Judge for violating Jones’ right to a speedy trial. A later appeal was discharged by the State Court of Appeals for not following proper court procedures.
The Attorney General’s Office, in a brief written by Solicitor General Zachary Viglianco, argued that Appeals Court Judge Frankie Moore misapplied past court precedent in granting a discharge of the prosecution.
Viglianco maintained that the AG’s office had followed proper procedure in appealing the judge’s ruling, which it argued was a “special proceeding” that is “inherently” a civil matter, thus allowing an appeal.
But Jones’ attorneys have contended and repeated in the brief Tuesday that the discharge was a “criminal” matter, and, by rule, the Attorney General’s Office had no right to appeal a final ruling of a “substantial right” — a speedy trial.
The Attorney General’s Office filed the criminal charge in December 2023 against Jones, who had served six years at chief of the agency, which he had rebranded as “History Nebraska.” The name change was reversed by Gov. Jim Pillen.
Jones resigned in 2022 — saying he wanted to travel in Europe — shortly before a state audit came out that was critical of the redirection of the funds.
It was uncertain when the Nebraska Supreme Court might schedule oral arguments and rule on the appeal.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma higher education leaders said Wednesday that they are concerned lawmakers might not have allocated enough funding to meet demand when children of public school teachers become eligible to participate in the expansion of a state-funded scholarship program.
Officials said applications are expected to open later this month, but the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education were allocated $700,000 to fund the expansion of Oklahoma’s Promise, which could cover costs for 15 students, said Colbi Beam, assistant vice chancellor of state grants and scholarships.
“It’s not going to go very far,” she said. “We have no idea what the impact will be for enrollment, but I’m really interested to see. We’ve gotten a lot of buzz and a ton of teacher phone calls.”
Under House Bill 1727, which took effect July 1, a teacher can apply for their child to participate in the program if the educator is certified and teaching in Oklahoma public schools for at least 10 years and their household meets income eligibility requirements. School administrators and emergency certified teachers are not included. 
Beam said allowing Oklahoma public school teachers to be eligible to apply for a state-funded scholarship program, which has traditionally helped lower-income students afford college, amount to some of the most “substantial changes” to Oklahoma’s Promise since its inception.
“With Oklahoma’s Promise in general, I think we’ve moved away from our mission a little,” she said. “I think we need to refocus on the students who need access. I think we are adding more administrative steps for students to be eligible instead of reducing those. So if I had a magic wand, I’d want to make it easier on students to apply.”
Students who are in the current cohort of high school seniors will be the first to be eligible for the extension of Oklahoma’s Promise. 
The scholarship program offers qualified Oklahoma students an opportunity to earn a scholarship for college tuition. The measure extends the program’s application window to Dec. 31 of the student’s senior year. 
The household income of the student’s parents must be less than 700% the federal poverty level. For a four-person household, this equates to an income of $225,050. 
Traditional Oklahoma’s Promise students will continue to qualify with  separate financial eligibility qualifications. 
The financial impact of Oklahoma’s Promise for educators’ children is estimated to be over $740,000 in the first year and to exceed $3 million by the fourth year, according to the Legislature’s fiscal impact report.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/7FD038E3-71A2-4E42-92C7-5B7535943993_1_201_a-1024x724.jpeg,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341
,DC,2025-09-03 22:36:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump speculates New Orleans is next as he weighs National Guard expansion,"Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-speculates-new-orleans-next-he-weighs-national-guard-expansion,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump was unclear Wednesday about his plans to deploy National Guard troops to cities around the country, seeming to backtrack slightly on sending troops to Chicago while teasing New Orleans as a possible next location instead.Despite a Tuesday morning ruling from a federal judge in California that called Trump’s use of military personnel for law enforcement in Los Angeles illegal, the president continued to explore further use of Guard units for what he said is crime prevention in other U.S. cities. But in the face of pushback from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, and other state and city officials in Chicago, Trump said Wednesday he still wanted to send troops to the city, but may be more inclined to call up the Guard in a politically friendlier state.“We're making a determination now,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance Wednesday morning. “Do we go to Chicago? Or do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite tough, quite bad.”Landry, a Republican, said on social media Wednesday he would accept federal troops.“We will take President @realDonaldTrump’s help from New Orleans to Shreveport!” he said.Third Democratic city for National Guard?If the president follows through, it would be the third heavily Democratic city where he orders troops this year. He deployed the California National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles this summer and called Guard members from multiple states — including Louisiana — to the District of Columbia while also seizing the police force in the city. The president has said he’s using troops to quell crime, despite violent crime decreasing in cities across the country. Last month, the president signed an executive order directing state National Guard units to be ready to assist in local, state and federal law enforcement, a potential step toward a dramatic expansion of Trump’s use of military personnel for domestic policing.The use of the military has stemmed from the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and plans for mass deportations. The president deployed troops to Los Angeles following massive protests against federal immigration officers' aggressive tactics. In the District of Columbia, immigration officials and federal law enforcement officers have established checkpoints in metro stations and elsewhere inquiring about immigration status. Chicago is considered by Republicans to be a “sanctuary city,” because it leaves immigration enforcement to the federal government. The Trump administration has slammed those policies, attempting to revoke federal funding from cities and states with similar stances.Trump has also mentioned Baltimore as another candidate for Guard deployment.‘All they have to do is ask’Pritzker’s opposition was keeping him from deploying troops to Chicago, Trump said. Governors control their states’ National Guard units, except in rare circumstances in which the president can assume control. Trump this summer federalized the California National Guard over the objection of Gov. Gavin Newsom, but has waffled about repeating that experience with Chicago. “We could straighten out Chicago,” he said Wednesday. “All they have to do is ask us to go into Chicago.”A day earlier, Trump indicated it was only a matter of time before he sent troops to the largest city in the Midwest.“Chicago is a hellhole right now,” he said late Tuesday. “We're going in. I didn't say when. We're going in.”If Trump were to either send Guard members from another state into Illinois or federalize the state’s troops, it would likely see swift legal action. Pritzker told reporters Tuesday state leaders would have to see how the administration acts before bringing a lawsuit.Louisiana Republicans praise TrumpLike Landry, U.S. Sen. John Kennedy said he and his fellow Louisiana Republican, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, supported the idea of a Guard presence.“Unlike Democratic governors, @SpeakerJohnson and I aren’t scared of a little help from the brave men and women of our National Guard,” he wrote on X. “Anybody who actually wants to stop crime would welcome our troops in a skinny minute.”Christopher Mirasola, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said he found the idea of Trump mobilizing a red-state Guard “confusing” because that state’s troops are already controlled by its Republican governor.“If the governor of Louisiana wanted to use the military for some kind of law enforcement action in Louisiana, he certainly has the authority to do it under Louisiana law,” he said.“There really is no role for the federal government. In fact, the governor of Louisiana probably has more authority under state law to use the National Guard for these domestic deployments than if the National Guard was used under some federal authority.”Texas gov’s office denies Pritzker reportSpeaking to reporters shortly after Trump’s Tuesday comments, Pritzker said a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official had recently called the head of the Illinois State Police to inform state officials that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would soon be sent there.The call was the only communication state leaders have had with the administration about its plans for the city, Pritzker said.“It's the first outreach we have received from the Trump administration on this topic,” he said.Without clear communication from Trump officials, Pritzker said he sought information from anonymous federal workers and well-placed reporters. Information from those people led Pritzker to believe the administration was readying to deploy the Texas National Guard to the state, he said.“We have reason to believe that the Trump administration has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois,” Pritzker said. “We know before anything has happened here, that the Trump plan is to use any excuse to deploy armed military personnel to Chicago.”That report has not been verified and an aide to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott denied such a deployment was imminent.Abbott has tangled with Pritzker before on national issues. He bused migrants to Chicago during an immigration wave in President Joe Biden’s term in office.The White House declined to comment Wednesday. ‘It would be an invasion’If Pritzker’s information was correct, and Guard troops from Texas or another state were sent to Illinois without Pritzker’s consent, it would represent a new development in Trump’s use of military members within the U.S. — and could cross a red line of state sovereignty — legal experts told States Newsroom.“It would be an invasion,” Stephen Dycus, a professor emeritus in national security law at the Vermont Law and Graduate School, said.“I’m not aware of that ever happening in the past, and I don’t think it would be legal,” Dycus said. “There's no provision in the Constitution or anywhere else that would allow one state to attack or invade another for any purpose.”Joseph Nunn, counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, agreed that it would be a “constitutional barrier” for one state’s governor to send National Guard troops to another without that governor’s approval.Illinois would quickly challenge such a deployment and would likely prevail in litigation, Nunn said.But Mirasola said because courts have never considered the issue, it is not clear a challenge by Illinois would succeed.Courts, including a unanimous 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel hearing a case on the National Guard’s deployment to Los Angeles this year, have given the executive branch “incredible deference” to mobilize the National Guard, Mirasola said. “It's a pretty close analysis in terms of which way I think courts would land on the issue,” he said. “I don't think it's clear.”A safer legal route for Trump could be to federalize one state’s National Guard and send them to Illinois or another state that does not request a deployment, Nunn said.“It’s far more likely that you see a red state’s National Guard being voluntarily federalized — federalized with the consent of the governor — and then deployed to Illinois,” he said. “Because in that circumstance those become essentially federal troops. And the president can send federal troops wherever he wants to send them.”",,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341

Gabe Vasquez on Wednesday predicted that small-time farmers and ranchers, as well as small grocery stores, in rural areas of his congressional district will be devastated by Republican food assistance cuts. 
Vasquez, in an interview with Source New Mexico, cited a new report from the Washington-based nonprofit Food Research & Action Center that found rural areas will be the hardest hit by changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program contained in the“One Big Beautiful Bill Act” 
“There is a cruel irony in the sense that some of our farmers and ranchers and rural food producers are the ones who stand to lose the most from these Republican cuts to food assistance,” said Vasquez, a Democrat in his second term representing New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District. 
The report cited the ways in which SNAP cuts will hit hardest in non-urban areas, which have higher poverty rates, fewer food retailers and less employment opportunities. The report also revealed that more than three-quarters of 303 “high risk” counties nationwide — counties identified as highly reliant on a small number of SNAP-approved retailers — are rural. 
Nineteen of New Mexico’s 33 counties — most of them rural — appear on a list from the left-leaning Center for American Progress identifying where retailers are at the highest risk of closing due to the SNAP cuts. 
NM Pueblo leader says recent USDA tribal food program cuts means more reliance on ‘commodities’

New Mexico also has the highest rate of SNAP recipients in the country, which Vasquez said puts a “huge bull’s eye on the state of New Mexico” when it comes to these cuts.
Vasquez said the reductions in SNAP benefits to families and individuals will mean the closure of rural grocery stores. He listed grocery stores in Lordsburg and Sunland Park that he said receive three-quarters or more of their revenue from SNAP. 
Recent estimates from the state Health Care Authority predict about 1,700 gas stations, groceries, convenience stores and farmers’ markets statewide stand to lose about $1.3 billion in SNAP revenue. 
“So not only are we taking food away from rural communities that produce our food, but we’re also potentially putting their grocery stores out of business,” Vasquez said. “And that’s just not a solution that works for rural New Mexico.”
The spending bill President Donald Trump signed July 4 imposes costs on states to administer SNAP, plus extra costs for states like New Mexico with high SNAP administration error rates. It also reduces SNAP benefits and imposes work requirements. 
NM food banks say they will struggle to provide meals for those who lose federal benefits

All told, New Mexico’s 450,000 SNAP recipients will experience benefit reductions, and 40,000 will lose their SNAP entirely due to work requirements or their immigration status, according to the Health Care Authority estimates.
Vasquez said he continues to push for changes in the Farm Bill that would reduce some of the cuts, and he said he’s working with state lawmakers to find ways to mitigate the cuts on residents or the state budget.
The state can update eligibility rules, for example, to remove child support payments from taxable income, which will make more families eligible for SNAP, Vasquez said. Lawmakers can also shore up cuts with the state’s “healthy” budget reserve for the short-term, at least until Democrats regain the majority, Vasquez said.
“Between Medicaid and SNAP, this state Legislature is going to have an important job to do,” Vasquez said. “And I wish it wasn’t this way, but it is the reality that New Mexico faces, thanks to the action of Republicans and this administration who chose to cut food assistance.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0573-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341

But a judge had already restricted raids there.","In summary
After agents were forced to stop ‘roving patrols’ in LA, they moved north to Sacramento. But a judge had already restricted raids there. 


The ACLU and United Farm Workers have filed a motion alleging that the Border Patrol violated a court order intended to curb racial profiling and unlawful, warrantless arrests in the Central Valley. 
They want the judge to require new training and forbid agents involved in a July raid in Sacramento from participating in other operations until they are retrained. 
In April, a federal district court judge ruled that the Border Patrol likely violated the Constitution’s protections against unreasonable search and seizure during a January operation in Kern County called “Operation Return to Sender,” in which agents swarmed a Home Depot and Latino market, among other areas frequented by laborers. The judge ordered the Border Patrol, led by El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, to stop the raids in California’s Eastern District, which covers much of the state’s Central Valley, including Sacramento. 


Bovino in June took his agents to Los Angeles, where they spent weeks aggressively pursuing Latino-looking workers outside of Home Depots, car washes, bus stops and other areas. The agents often wore masks and used unmarked vehicles.  
After a federal district court judge temporarily barred agents from conducting raids in the Los Angeles area, Bovino briefly moved north to Sacramento in July, detaining Latino day laborers in a Home Depot parking lot. 
In an interview near the parking lot with Fox News, Bovino indicated at the time that his operations were ramping up, not slowing down. “There is no sanctuary anywhere,” Bovino said.
“We’re here to stay. We’re not going anywhere. We’re going to affect this mission and secure the homeland.”
Bovino told Fox the raids were targeted and based on intel. 
“Everything we do is targeted,” he said. “We did have prior intelligence that there were targets that we were interested in and around that Home Depot, as well as other targeted enforcement packages in and around the Sacramento area.”  
In a motion filed last week, the ACLU and the United Farm Workers asked the federal district court to enforce the preliminary injunction issued in April that barred Border Patrol agents from stopping people without reasonable suspicion and from making warrantless arrests without assessing flight risk. 
If granted, the motion could potentially bar Bovino from planning or participating in new raids in the Eastern District. Bovino appears to be moving on regardless: He announced Tuesday on his social media account that the LA crackdown would be expanding to other cities across the country.  
A Border Patrol spokesman did not return a request for comment about the ACLU and UFW’s motion. 
If the plaintiffs in the Kern County case are successful in getting a judge to strengthen or enforce the original injunction, the case could have nationwide implications, providing a legal strategy that could be replicated in communities where agents are using similar tactics. In Los Angeles and Southern California, agents have continued high-profile raids and violent tactics, despite a similar but separate temporary restraining order in the Central District, barring similar activity there.


As part of the original preliminary injunction, Border Patrol agents were required to provide the ACLU with documentation on their specific and individual reasonable suspicion for each warrantless stop. 
The plaintiffs allege agents fabricated and copied and pasted boilerplate language for those reports from the raid at the Home Depot in south Sacramento.
According to the filing, dozens of armed and masked agents from the Border Patrol, ICE, and other federal agencies corralled people in the parking lot in Sacramento, ordering them not to move while demanding to see their papers. 
Witnesses described unmarked Chevy trucks, agents dressed “like soldiers,” and people being grabbed and handcuffed with no explanation. At least one U.S. citizen was chased and detained during the operation, but Border Patrol won’t release that arrest report to the ACLU because they said it was unrelated to an immigration violation, according to the court documents. The agency told the media that the man slashed one of their tires in the parking lot. 
Student detained near Home Depot sweep
Agents also tackled and arrested an 18-year-old high school student who happened to be walking to a nearby Ross, according to the ACLU and UFW’s motion. 
Selvin Osbeli Mejia Diaz, a senior at Valley High School, fled violence in Central America last year and came to the United States as an unaccompanied minor. He lives with his aunt in Sacramento and is complying with the orders in his immigration court case seeking asylum, according to the ACLU and UFW motion. 
According to his declaration, he was walking to the store to buy a shirt when an unmarked Chevy pulled up behind him. A masked agent burst out from the vehicle, tackled him to the ground, and handcuffed him without asking any questions, according to Mejia Diaz’s declaration. 
“Everything happened very fast, and I felt very afraid because I did not know who the man was,” Mejia Diaz wrote in his declaration. “He was much taller than me and he used a lot of force, and he immediately handcuffed me while I was on the ground … I think they saw me and figured they could arrest me because I looked Latino.” 
Mejia Diaz was born in Guatemala and turned himself in to border agents in June 2024 after crossing the U.S. border. After the Home Depot raid, he was taken to a detention center in downtown Sacramento, where he had to sleep on a hard ceramic floor with an aluminum blanket. He said he was detained for several days before he was allowed to call his aunt for a couple of minutes. 
He is still being detained in the Imperial Regional Detention Facility. 
The Border Patrol’s arrest report for Mejia Diaz incorrectly states he was in the Home Depot parking lot, the ACLU alleges, which they say supports their assertion that agents are using “copy and pasted” language for each arrest report.
How the Border Patrol justified arrests
The ACLU also says that Border Patrol’s official documentation of the raid, required by the court order, is riddled with other factual errors and boilerplate language. 
The forms, known as Form I-213s, are meant to document agents’ reasonable suspicions for each warrantless stop they make. During discovery, Border Patrol gave the ACLU 11 such arrest reports for the Sacramento raid. Three of them included “X” placeholders instead of specific information about locations or names or details for the arrests. 
Nearly every report used identical language, claiming people “fled from agents” as a factor in the agents’ reasonable suspicion. Several witnesses told the ACLU some people did not run, according to the motion. The plaintiffs also argue that running from masked, armed men who do not identify themselves should not be enough for reasonable suspicion. 
A handful of the reports justified the warrantless arrests by stating: “Sacramento, California has been identified as a city where many illegal aliens are known to stay, live and work without having any legal documentation in the United States.” Others noted that California is a sanctuary state. 
“(Person) was located in California, which is a sanctuary state. Sanctuary states shield the identity of illegal aliens from immigration officials,” the arrest reports noted. The plaintiffs argue that someone being in a sanctuary state is not enough cause to give an agent reasonable suspicion that they are in the country illegally.  (California’s sanctuary law curbs local law enforcement cooperation with immigration authorities and prevents the automatic transfer of people to federal immigration custody, except for people who have been convicted of serious or violent felonies.) 
Border Patrol would not provide reports for individuals who were detained but then released, the motion states. The ACLU is asking the judge to shorten the amount of time Border Patrol has to share the arrest reports from seven days to four days because many of the people detained in the Sacramento raid had already been deported by the time they got the arrest reports, according to their motion.

""We have the opportunity to create something here that's a new model for how college campuses or other facilities in their communities can more purposefully work together,"" said David Bergh, president of Vermont State University.

The town and village of Johnson on Tuesday announced they were entering into a partnership with Vermont State University to relocate town services onto the school’s campus in Johnson.
Essential town services like Johnson’s municipal offices, post office, and the town’s health center could move onto the university’s campus — which sits on higher ground, out of reach from the Lamoille and Gihon rivers’ floodplain, according to a joint announcement from officials with the town, village and university.
Johnson was hard hit by the July 2023 floods. The town offices, health center, post office and grocery store were all displaced, along with many homes and businesses in the area. The town in April this year moved its public library a half-mile through town and across the river — not far from the university’s Johnson campus.
The parties plan to apply for funding from a federal community development block grant for disaster recovery in response to the July 2023 floods, according to the announcement, which was posted on social media.
The project, if borne out, would transform the university’s Matinetti Hall into a Community Services and Resilience Center. While final details will still need to be worked out, officials said the arrangement could blend the roles of the university and the town in new ways.
“We have the opportunity to create something here that’s a new model for how college campuses or other facilities in their communities can more purposefully work together,” said David Bergh, the president of Vermont State University.
Tom Galinat, the town administrator for Johnson, said they were “facilitating, hopefully, a new arrangement that allows both of us to prosper and to grow into a more resilient community.”
“There’s this wonderful symbiosis where the needs are crossing at the same time,” he said. “It’s really exciting.”
Vermont State University is in its third year of an integrated statewide university system. The Vermont State Colleges System in 2021 merged Castleton University, Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College into a single institution.
Much of the institution’s building stock is not being used to its current and anticipated needs, Bergh said. Meanwhile, the university, like many small colleges and universities, has seen declining enrollment.
“Across the country, you have college campuses closing, merging, being shuttered,” Bergh said. “Our intent is to keep these campuses vibrant, but to find a way to do so where we’re reducing our operational footprint and expense, and to do so really thoughtfully, and to do so in ways with partners that connect to our mission.”
The parties in their announcement said the “flood-resilient and energy-efficient hub” could “strengthen the campus-community connection, a long-held community goal.”
The futures of the campus and the community are “inextricably intertwined,” Bergh said, and he envisioned the partnership would bring services to campus that could connect to academic programs. A health clinic, for example, could tie in with the university’s nursing program on campus, he said.
“For us to recruit students and employees who want to be there on a campus, they want to come to a place that has a vibrant community with active businesses,” he said. “And then for those businesses to be successful, they need, in part, for us to keep bringing people in the community.”
While both sides expressed optimism for the “one of a kind” partnership, they acknowledged they are still early in the process, and, in their announcement, said “there are hurdles to clear before determining how best to move forward.”
The university will host a forum at the school’s Stearns Hall Performance Space to discuss the partnership on Tuesday, Sept. 16. The final application for the grant is due Sept. 30, Galinat said.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe special election to choose the next state senator in a suburban Atlanta district is going to a recount ahead of a Sept. 23 runoff.
Steve West, the third-place finisher in the race to replace Republican former state Sen. Brandon Beach, requested the recount Wednesday, a spokesman for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office said.
Beach stepped down to serve as U.S. Treasurer, and seven people stepped up to replace him, including six Republicans and one Democrat in a reliably conservative district that includes parts of Cherokee and Fulton counties.
The sole Democrat, Milton mom, attorney and small business owner, Debra Shigley, placed first place with 8,444 votes, good for nearly 40% of the vote, but not good enough for an outright win.
Instead, she’ll duke it out in a runoff with the second-place finisher, who appears to be Jason Dickerson, a Republican investment manager, who earned just over 17% of the vote with 3,709 ballots cast. But West, a former Cherokee County Commissioner, trailed Dickerson by just 67 votes according to the initial count, putting him within the .5% margin required to call for a for a second tallying.
In a statement, West’s campaign confirmed they are seeking a runoff and are reviewing the results “to ensure no voting irregularities occurred that may have impacted the outcome of the election.”
State law doesn’t give a timeline for finishing a recount, but it’s likely that the counties will want to complete the recount quickly so they can finalize their runoff ballots. Early voting is set to begin as soon as Sept. 13 in some areas of the district.
Shigley’s performance last month was notable because Beach, a steadfast MAGA supporter, consistently won re-election by large margins in the heavily Republican district. Democrats hope her strong numbers show dissatisfaction with Republican leadership at the state and federal level and portend an anti-GOP mood going into next year’s midterms.
Republicans say Shigley’s margin was bolstered by the GOP vote being split six ways and that their candidate will easily win the runoff.
In a statement, Dickerson expressed confidence that both the recount and the runoff will go his way.
“We look forward to the recount confirming the certified result,” he said. “We won’t be distracted and will remain focused on defeating woke liberal Debra Shigley in the runoff that is already underway!”

Ro Khanna, D-California, have introduced the Epstein List Transparency Act to force the federal government to release all unclassified records from the cases of Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A push to release all the federal government’s files on a Florida sex offender reemerged as Congress returned from the August break.
Kentucky U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie is pressing a discharge petition to force a vote to release more of the government’s files on Jeffrey Epstein, as a House oversight panel released some Epstein material Tuesday. What the panel released was already publicly available.
All of Nebraska’s House members voted Wednesday for a non-binding resolution to support the House’s oversight panel in continuing its investigation. But none signaled support for Massie’s effort to force the release of the fuller files.  
Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith said the “victims of Jeffrey Epstein deserve justice and said he would continue supporting efforts to bring justice to those complicit in Epstein’s crimes. But he said he would not sign onto a discharge petition, “which hands control of the House floor to congressional Democrats.” 
Nebraska’s 1st District U.S. Rep. Mike Flood told CNN Tuesday that he “doesn’t support discharge petitions,” because “I support regular order.” 
“We have a plan. It’s going to get implemented, and it’s going to happen this week,” Flood said in the interview. “What Massie and the Democrats are doing is all-out reckless … They do not have victim protection … it was written in a sloppy way.”

When asked by the Examiner whether or not he would join Massie’s discharge petition, Nebraska’s 2nd District U.S. Rep. Don Bacon said, “I’m going to vote on the bill that will come to the floor.”  
Bacon released a statement after Wednesday’s vote on the symbolic resolution saying he had voted to “release the Epstein files.” He called the House resolution “more far-reaching than the discharge bill.”
Wednesday’s vote was non-binding, as the Oversight Committee is free to continue its probe without floor auction which Politico reported. House GOP leadership argues it’s a better option than Massie’s legislation, which would compel release of unclassified materials from the Epstein case within 30 days. 
Massie’s effort comes after the U.S. Department of Justice in July released an unsigned memo declaring “a systemic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” and department and FBI officials concluded that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”
House GOP leadership is trying to appease Republicans who want more information released. Accusers of Jeffrey Epstein held a press conference on Wednesday calling for the release of all materials. The accusers suggested that they could release their own client list. 
“The truth needs to come out, and the government holds the truth,” U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, said during Wednesday’s conference with Epstein’s accusers. “The cases that are sealed hold the truth. Jeffrey Epstein’s estate holds the truth. The FBI, the DOJ and the CIA hold the truth.”
President Donald Trump has called the Epstein discussion a “Democrat hoax that never ends.” The White House views the discharge petition as “a very hostile act.” 
“Helping Thomas Massie and Liberal Democrats with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration,” a White House official told CNN.
The Trump administration has been criticized by some in the GOP base and by congressional Democrats for a lack of transparency surrounding Epstein, after some Trump-picked agency heads raised expectations about what would be released related to the deceased sex offender, who died in prison in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. 
Massie, the Kentucky Republican, has only three other House Republicans who have signed his petition.  The rest are House Democrats; Massie would need two more GOP members to sign on to allow him to bypass leadership and get his bill on the floor. 
The three Republicans publicly supporting his effort are South Carolina U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert and Georgia’s Taylor Greene.

,DC,2025-09-03 21:34:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Despite shutdown deadline, little movement in Congress on spending deal","Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/despite-shutdown-deadline-little-movement-congress-spending-deal,,"WASHINGTON — Members of Congress began searching for compromise on a short-term government funding bill Wednesday, with just a few weeks left to broker a deal before a possible shutdown.Fresh off their August recess, congressional leaders and members of the Appropriations Committee appealed for bipartisanship from the other side while admitting they are far from a final agreement. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declined to say during a press conference whether he will negotiate a stopgap spending bill with Democrats, or use the go-at-it-alone approach that succeeded in March. “Republicans are committed to keeping the government open, and unfortunately, it seems like not all Democrats agree with that, and they're beginning to apply the government shutdown pressure,” Johnson said. “But I want you to remember one thing: All but one House Democrat voted to shut down the government in March, and we expect, sadly, that that may happen again.”Johnson said he was open to negotiations with Democratic leaders as long as they “are willing to work with us and think responsibly about how we can spend less than we did last year.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during an afternoon press conference that Democrats want GOP leaders to negotiate the stopgap spending bill across party lines. “The bottom line is very simple: We Democrats want a bipartisan bill and we are pushing the Republicans very hard to do it,” Schumer said. “We’re on our front foot. We’re unified.” Schumer, who took considerable flak for helping Republicans limit debate on a partisan stopgap bill in March, said “it’s much different than last time.” Pressed by several reporters about what Democrats would help move through the Senate this time around, Schumer said: “We are willing to sit down and negotiate a bipartisan proposal with significant Democratic input. So far, they are not.”Spending running on autopilotThe House and Senate are supposed to complete work on the dozen annual government funding bills by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1 but that hasn’t happened for decades, so lawmakers rely on a stopgap spending bill to keep federal departments and agencies running on autopilot for a couple months. That measure, sometimes called a continuing resolution, is intended to give lawmakers a bit more time to complete bipartisan House-Senate negotiations on the full-year appropriations bills, though Congress used three CRs to fund the government this fiscal year instead of getting its work done. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he expects lawmakers will need to approve a stopgap spending bill “for some time into the foreseeable future,” but that discussions are ongoing about how long it will last and what else might be added. “My hope would be that whatever that CR looks like, that it is clean and that it enables us to buy some time to get a regular appropriations process done,” Thune said. “I still think the best way to fund the government is through the appropriations process.”President Donald Trump said from the Oval Office earlier in the day that he expects Republicans will vote for a stopgap spending bill but he didn’t address how it would get through the Senate's 60-vote legislative filibuster, which requires bipartisanship. “I think the Republicans will vote for an extension,” Trump said. “We won’t have any Democrat votes."" Three spending bills seen as possibleHouse Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters he hopes to negotiate final versions of three full-year bills with the Senate before the end of the month.Lawmakers would then use a stopgap spending bill to keep the departments and agencies covered in the other nine bills flat funded for a couple of months until the two chambers can reach final agreement on the spending levels and policy within those measures. “We’re talking about relatively modest bills and bills where there is either broad agreement, like MilCon-VA, or LegBranch and Ag,” Cole said. “We’re not talking about major bills. You can’t really do that until you have a topline and we don’t have a topline.”The Agriculture-FDA, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-VA spending bills are generally easier to negotiate than some of the other full-year measures, like Defense, Homeland Security and Labor-Health and Human Services-Education. Cole said when House and Senate leaders begin negotiating a total spending level for all of the bills, or topline, is “above my paygrade.”“I’m ready to do it at any time if they want to empower us, otherwise the leadership on both sides and the president have to” figure that out, Cole said.The House and Senate are supposed to start off the annual government funding process in the spring by reaching bipartisan agreement on how much in total spending to spread throughout the dozen appropriations bills. Those talks haven’t even started for fiscal 2026, which is slated to begin Oct. 1. Instead, the House and Senate Appropriations committees have separately decided how much to spend and written vastly different versions of the bills. House and Senate at oddsThe 12 bills that have been released by the GOP-led House committee are partisan, while the eight bills released by the Senate panel have received broad bipartisan support in committee. Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she’s spoken with Cole a couple of times about the three-bills-plus-stopgap strategy and supports the concept. “I have and I agree with that approach,” Collins said.Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, said any stopgap bill “needs to be a real bipartisan compromise.”“For the last few months we have shown a bipartisan way forward on the Appropriations Committee,” Murray said. “Democrats have shown that we are willing to work in good faith to write bipartisan funding bills that protect investments in education, life-saving research and a lot more. “We’ve already passed eight out of the committee and three on the floor: MilCon-VA, Ag and LegBranch. As part of a bipartisan short-term CR, I support conferencing those three bills and passing them with the short-term CR for the remaining nine bills.”House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro said “the best case scenario for us is to move forward.” “No gimmicks, no riders, let's clear the decks,” the Connecticut Democrat said. “Talk about how we get Republican priorities, Democratic priorities.” Negotiations ‘for weeks now’House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said “there’s a chance” to wrap up negotiations between the two chambers on final versions of some of the full-year government spending bills before the end of the month. “It might not be all 12, but a few of them for sure,"" Scalise said. ""So let's give the appropriators that opportunity to keep negotiating. They've already been having negotiations for weeks now — Tom Cole and a lot of his counterparts. I have faith they can hopefully get a lot of things done.”Scalise, R-La., said he plans to reserve floor time later this month to  ensure whatever spending bill gets written is “the top priority.”Rep. Robert Aderholt, chairman of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee, said he thinks most people agree there’s going to be some sort of stopgap given all 12 of the annual bills aren’t close to becoming law.The Alabama Republican said this feat is “almost impossible” given the short number of legislative days left before the shutdown deadline. “The solution, of course, obviously, or the only alternative, would be to have a CR, but I think the shorter the CR, the better,” he said, noting that the measure would have to be “long enough that you can have negotiations, but short enough that it doesn’t drag out until Christmas and that ... we’re up here at Christmas doing an omnibus or something like that, which everybody wants to avoid.” Congress has often bundled the final, conferenced versions of the dozen bills together into a sweeping omnibus package at the end of the year to ensure quick floor votes, though GOP leaders have tried to get away from that practice in recent years. Rep. Chuck Edwards, a North Carolina Republican who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, said that while he hopes a stopgap spending bill is “not necessary,” the panel is “certainly prepared to put together a short-term CR if that's what’s required to avoid a shutdown.”",,,,2025-09-03 17:58:16.771169

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality on Tuesday denied a petition to weaken Lake Koocanusa’s standard for selenium, a pollutant stemming from Canadian coal mines that can have adverse effects on fish and wildlife.
The Lincoln County Commission submitted the rulemaking petition challenging the current site-specific standard of acceptable selenium concentration of 0.8 micrograms per liter of water, a more stringent threshold than the federal standard of 1.5 micrograms per liter. The commissioners asked DEQ to align with the federal standard, saying it was in the best interest of the county.
In a phone call with the Daily Montanan on Wednesday, Commissioner Noel Duram said he was disappointed in DEQ’s decision, but wanted to continue working with the department on the issue.
“We might be disagreeing with how things work, but we both have a goal to provide a safe environment for our community,” Duram said.
During an Aug. 14 public hearing, Duram said the standard affected Lincoln County specifically, by limiting additional discharge into Lake Koocanusa. He said the economic interests of the county would be stymied by such a stringent standard, which could prevent companies from investing in industries, such as mining, but DEQ rejected that argument.
“Fishing and recreational tourism on Lake Koocanusa and the Kootenai River downstream generates significant revenue and jobs in Lincoln County and elsewhere, as supported by public comments,” according to DEQ’s statements rejecting the petition, which said the commissioners provided no evidence of economic hardship under the stricter standard.
And while representatives from Elk Valley Resources and the North American Selenium Working Group wrote letters in support of a weaker standard, the overwhelming sentiment of the public was for keeping it as is.
Nearly a dozen opponents to the petition pushed back against Duram’s comments at the hearing, claiming Koocanusa had some of the worst selenium contamination in the world and continued acceptance of high levels of pollutants would negatively impact the lake’s clean water and aquatic life.
“Selenium is a scary element, and we’re not talking about a little bit of pollution here,” said Derf Johnson, deputy director for the Montana Environmental Information Center, during the hearing.
MEIC praised DEQ’s ruling in a press release as a “clean water victory,” adding that the organization would continue to defend the protective standards.
In DEQ’s rejection of the petition, the department stated the commissioners “did not provide sufficient evidence to support their proposed rule amendment,” citing data from federal researchers showing the high concentration of selenium in fish.
Selenium is a mineral often found in coal-rich deposits. While the element is an essential nutrient for animals, it is toxic in high concentrations and high accumulations in fish can lead to growth inhibition, reproductive defects and increased mortality.
Upstream of Lake Koocanusa along the Elk River, four active mountaintop-removal metallurgical coal mines are operated by Elk Valley Resources, a subsidiary of Swiss mining conglomerate Glencore. The mining operations have leached various pollutants into the Elk River, including selenium and nitrates, according to multiple studies spanning more than a decade.
Montana instigated its site-specific rule in 2020, and it the standard has been embroiled in litigation on both sides of the border and attempts by Montana officials to revert to the looser, federal standard.
But opposition to further change bas been strong.
The Department of Environmental Quality also received nearly 200 public comments urging DEQ to reject the petition and keep the stricter standard, including from the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, and several federal agencies.
“The transboundary Kootenai watershed sits entirely within transboundary Ktunaxa territory and provides critical habitat for rare and threatened fish species including bull trout, burbot, westslope cutthroat trout, and endangered Kootenai River white sturgeon. Unabated selenium inputs from the Elk Valley mines into Koocanusa Reservoir demonstrate a clear, increasing trend dating back to 1985,” wrote Michael Dolson, Tribal chairman of the CSKT, which is part of five Tribal governments comprising the Ktunaxa Nation. “Selenium leaching from the mines in the Elk Valley of British Columbia is resulting in degradation of water quality and presenting unacceptable impairment and risks to CSKT and Ktunaxa resources.”
Representatives from the Idaho Conservation League also weighed in during the public hearing and with written comments, asking the state to protect the downstream Kootenai River that winds through northern Idaho.
“So much selenium is contaminating Lake Koocanusa that after it is released through Libby Dam and flows downriver into Idaho, it has caused the Kootenai River in Idaho to be designated as impaired with selenium under the Clean Water Act,” said Jennifer Ekstrom, the League’s North Idaho Director. “We are writing to urge you to once again stand up for Montana, and for Idaho, by rejecting this ill-founded petition.”
The Lincoln County petition argued that in addition to potential economic impacts to the county, the data from fish tissue and ovary samples tested for selenium in recent years did not accurately represent the pollutant’s concentration and were not consistent with state and federal tissue sampling procedures.

But researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey submitted comments showing that “In short, these data showed that during the time of sampling (2020 and 2021), fish ovary selenium concentrations often exceeded the Montana Kootenai/Koocanusa fish egg/ovary selenium criterion,” for two fish species, with selenium concentrations in the water found to be higher than the current 0.8 standard.
Further data collected downstream of Libby Dam showed selenium concentrations in a majority of fish sampled also exceeded selenium criterium “even though selenium concentrations in river water were consistently less than the proposed criterion of 1.5 micrograms per liter,” the USGS letter states.
Duram said one his biggest problems with the decision to keep the strict standard is that areas of Lake Koocanusa current exceed the site-specific standard.
“Setting a standard that is vastly lower than the existing level is insane,” Duram said. “If they’re going to set a lower standard, I think they’re obligated to fix it.”
He also pushed back against environmental groups which he said were spreading misinformation about how polluted the waters are, saying the lake “isn’t compromised.”
Selenium pollution in Lake Koocanusa has been a concern for both countries and tribal nations in the area for years, with the transboundary Ktunaxa nation raising concerns about water quality in 2012 and the British Columbian government subsequently ordering the mining companies to stabilize and reduce contaminants leaching into the Elk River.
Last year, the International Joint Commission, an organization created by the United States and Canada to resolve disputes related to shared waterways, convened a board of experts to study the issue of transboundary pollution in the Elk-Kootenai River Basin. The commission’s plan of study, released in March, outlines a series of objectives for the board including collecting and analyzing data on water quality and pollutants, determining impacts to ecosystems and human health, and identifying possible mitigation and remediation efforts.
A preliminary report is expected this fall with a final report to the IJC provided in September 2026.
Due to the international efforts to study the pollutants in Lake Koocanusa and nearby waterways, the federal Environmental Protection Agency recommended the state of Montana “consider whether it is appropriate to make any potential revisions to the Lake Koocanusa selenium criterion at this time given these efforts are still underway and may result in newly developed information,” according to agency comments. “Both the IJC and ENV efforts could help inform DEQ on selenium data, information, and science for Lake Koocanusa.”
The Department concurred with that assessment, writing in their decision “it would be premature” to make any changes before that work is done.
Duram added that the commissioners are not likely to submit another petition, but will hope the triennial review conducted by DEQ next year and the findings from IJC will provide a better, collaborative way forward.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stelprdb5261097-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 17:58:16.771169

(Screenshot/Google Maps)The owner of a century-old Westerly country club has once again been told he can’t redevelop the 120-acre property. 
Winn Properties had tried to use the state’s affordable housing laws to build 2,300 homes on the site but the town’s planning board rejected the proposal last July, a decision upheld by a Washington County Superior Court judge last week. 
In his decision, Associate Justice Jeffrey A. Lanphear ruled the board had “competent evidence” to reject the proposal to redevelop the century-old Winnapaug Country Club.
Winn Properties, which has owned the Shore Road country since 2021, proposed leveling the 18-hole public course in order to build 90 three-story buildings — 30% of which would be reserved for low and middle-income residents. 
Nicholas Scola, who owns Winn Properties with his wife Jill, had previously proposed turning the country club into a golf resort, plans that were shot down by the Town Council in 2022.
On Wednesday, Scola referred comment on the Superior Court’s ruling to their attorney, Matthew J. Landry. Landry did not immediately respond to inquiries from Rhode Island Current.
Winn Properties sought to make use of the state’s Low and Moderate Income Housing law, which limits the ability of municipalities to block high-density projects if less than 10% of the community’s residences qualify as affordable, in order to get the project off the ground.
Westerly’s affordable housing stock sat at around 6.45% as of 2024, according to data compiled by RIHousing, the quasi-state agency that finances affordable home construction.
The proposal was submitted to the town in December 2023 and quickly generated pushback from residents, including representatives from the local group Keep Westerly Green, over the magnitude of the development and potential strain on town infrastructure and services.
“The long-range plan for the town did not include this kind of development,” Ed Rossomando, a member of Keep Westerly Green’s executive committee, said in an interview Wednesday.
The planning board had a similar stance when it unanimously rejected Winn Properties’ plan at its July 16, 2024 meeting. The board agreed that the town needed more affordable housing, but that it should not be done with an “overproduction” of large-format multi-family structures in a single area.
The board also argued that Winn Properties’ proposal failed to offer a variety of housing options and the plans did not reflect the character of the neighborhood which consists of single-family homes overlooking Winnapaug Pond.
“A massive program of redevelopment, with a giant bump in residential density, such as the proposed development is contrary to the town’s public interests and needs,” then-Chairman Justin Hopkins wrote in the board’s formal denial.
Winn Properties appealed the board’s rejection in Superior Court on July 30, 2024 — as is allowed under laws passed in 2023 creating a dedicated land use docket in the Superior Court.
In its appeal, Winn Properties argued the board’s decision was improper and “erroneous,” citing the town’s severe shortage of low- and moderate-income housing. But Lanphear disagreed, writing that the state’s housing production law does not require the planning board to approve any and all projects that come their way.
“Surely, the planning board does not serve to rubber stamp an application,” Lanphear wrote. “Even though it requests affordable housing — the planning board is charged with applying its reasoned discretion.”
Town Solicitor William Conley Jr. did not immediately respond to comment on the ruling.
Rep. Samuel Azzinaro, a Westerly Democrat whose district includes the country club, also stood by the planning board’s decision. He said in an interview Wednesday that a dense development is “not the right fit,” particularly near Winnapaug Pond.
“I would be scared to death of septic systems that would have to be put in to take care of these things,” he said.
Azzinaro also lamented the potential loss of the town’s only public golf course, which he said remains popular with both residents and tourists.
“You go by there on a Sunday morning and the parking lot is overflowing with cars,” he said.
Rossomando told Rhode Island Current he was “cautiously optimistic” saying there is always the potential for Winn Properties to appeal to the state Supreme Court or come back to town officials with another proposal.
“We don’t know that this is the end of the story,” Rossomando said.

Wyoming Game and Fish retirees and conservation groups say the state agency's planned shrinkage of a protected corridor runs counter to science-based wildlife management. 
The post Wyoming appeases stockgrowers, trims Red Desert and southwestern Winds from ‘Path of the Pronghorn’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Proposed pronghorn migration corridor protections flowing by Jim Magagna’s west slope Wind River Range ranch didn’t look right to the longtime livestock industry lobbyist. 
Two portions of the Sublette Pronghorn Migration Corridor —  the “Red Desert” and “East of Farson” segments — were “basically separate,” “much shorter,” lacked bottlenecks and “don’t have any of the same risks” as the other eight segments traversed by the long-studied Green River Basin pronghorn herd, Magagna told WyoFile.
“If they need a formal designation — which I tend to think they probably don’t — that ought to be a separate process,” said Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association.

In public meetings, a formal comment letter and in conversations with “various people at the top,” Magagna let it be known that he wanted the 270,000-plus acres dropped and not designated as a migration path. That’s about one-tenth of the proposed corridor’s overall acreage. The request, he said, was not based on the migration paths going through his ranch and federal land grazing allotments. 
On Tuesday, the public learned that Magagna is in line to get his wish. 
The Game and Fish Department outlined its current proposal ahead of next week’s Wyoming Game and Fish Commission vote on whether to advance the state’s first protected pronghorn corridor. If approved, the commission’s recommendation would then go to Gov. Mark Gordon — the next step in a politically fraught process that’s been going on for six years and counting. 

Wyoming Game and Fish Department officials are no longer recommending the designation of two southeastern segments formerly considered part of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration corridor, illustrated in this map. The segments would be “identified,” but not “designated” and not afforded policy protections if Game and Fish commissioners agree to the change. (WGFD)
One document shows that the state wildlife agency no longer wants to designate the “Red Desert” and “East of Farson” segments as part of the migration corridor. The recommendation doesn’t mention Magagna’s input, instead citing a lack of “high-use” habitat in the area, no bottlenecks and “limited threat levels” as the rationale for dropping two of the pronghorn corridor’s ten segments. 
Game and Fish officials couldn’t be reached Tuesday or Wednesday morning for an interview. 
Rich Guenzel, a retired Game and Fish biologist who personally endowed a pronghorn-specific conservation fund, sees the move as detrimental to pronghorn. 
“My recommendation to the commission is that they go with the biology,” he told WyoFile. “This is your opportunity to get the best [outcome] for wildlife. We shouldn’t water it down on our own, we should take our best shot.”

Guenzel, who’s a member of the Wyoming Outdoor Hall of Fame, pointed out an “area working group,” which will include industry representatives, has yet to convene and will have an opportunity to tinker with the migration protection proposal stemming from the state agency’s science-based assessment. Then the actual decision will be made by Gov. Mark Gordon or a future governor, he said. 
“If it’s going to be a political decision,” Guenzel said, “let the politicians own it.”
The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission has shown some appetite for shooting down politically influenced wildlife management proposals from its department. In July, the governor-appointed body reversed planned hikes in hunting quotas for mountain lions in the Laramie Mountains. 
“If it’s going to be a political decision, let the politicians own it.”rich guenzel
At least one conservation group that has tracked the sluggish implementation of Wyoming’s migration policy voiced similar concerns to Guenzel. Greater Yellowstone Coalition staffer Jared Baecker said he supports Game and Fish’s earlier inclusion of all 10 migration segments, which used data from over 600 GPS-collared pronghorn tracked over two decades. 
“The Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s data has demonstrated the importance of the East Farson and Red Desert segments to pronghorn survival during the winter of 2022/2023,” Baecker wrote in an email. “Excluding these areas from designation goes against the North American model of including the best-available science in wildlife management.” 
The Game and Fish commission will also consider authorizing some additions to the proposed pronghorn corridor. The tacked-on areas stem from 54 animals fitted with GPS collars between fall 2022 and this spring, and include 5,900 acres of “high use” corridor, 29,000 acres of “medium use” corridor and 119,000 acres of “low use” habitat. 

Continued monitoring of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd has tentatively added  tens of thousands of acres of habitat to the proposed migration corridor. New acreage is in red. (WGFD)
The added habitat is a drop in the bucket relative to the expanse of the overall migration corridor, which was sized up at 2.6 million acres — larger than Yellowstone National Park — prior to the planned removal of the “Red Desert” and “East of Farson” segments, which would lop off the 270,000-plus acres. 
Although the corridor covers a lot of ground, only its bottlenecks, totalling 27,375 acres, would be subject to rigid policies governing surface-disturbing activities. And nearly half of the bottleneck acreage would be exempt from protections because it occurs on private land, which isn’t subject to restrictions imposed by Wyoming’s migration policy. 
Wyoming’s migration policy has been ballyhooed and called one of the first and most robust forays into the conservation of wildlife migration. But the current policy — in 2019, due to controversy, it was updated and codified as an executive order under Gordon — has still never been used to designate a corridor in a state where dozens have been scientifically mapped. The Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration is the first attempt.
At 8:30 a.m. Sept. 10 in Lander, the Game and Commission is scheduled to vote on whether Gordon or a future governor should formally designate the state’s first migration corridor under the new policy.

A Michigan man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a felony charge that he voted twice during last year’s August primary election.
Prosecutors said Frank Prezzato, 68, of St. Clair Shores, voted using his absentee ballot and then showed up at his polling place and voted there as well.
A news release from Attorney General Dana Nessel said Prezzato “acknowledged that he acted recklessly.” As part of a plea agreement, he will serve six months of delayed probation. After that, the charges can be dismissed with prejudice — closing the case permanently — if Prezzato meets the conditions of his probation. His formal sentencing is set for the end of October.
“Voting twice undermines our democratic process,” Nessel said. “My office will continue to prosecute those who violate our voting laws to ensure Michigan voters have confidence in the integrity of our elections.”
In total, Nessel’s office pursued charges against seven people in the scandal — four voters and three poll workers. Five of those people, including the poll workers, have since had charges against them dismissed, including one man whose attorney argued he had been entrapped by the government.
The other remaining defendant, Stacey Kramer, could have a jury trial as soon as this month, according to court records.
In all four cases of alleged double-voting, officials say both votes were counted. Still, double voting is extremely rare in Michigan and across the country.
In Michigan, several safeguards are in place to prevent double voting before it occurs. The most significant is the use of e-pollbooks — computers that poll workers use to check voters in at polling places. These systems flag when a voter has already submitted an absentee ballot, so they don’t get a second one. If a voter who shows up to vote at a polling place has an outstanding absentee ballot that has not yet been returned, the e-pollbooks prompt election workers to arrange to cancel it before issuing an in-person ballot.
In the rare instance that it does happen, double voting is usually a matter of timing — the in-person vote is cast before the absentee ballot is received and input by election officials. In that case, officials are notified while processing the absentee ballot that an in-person ballot was cast. In the St. Clair Shores cases, prosecutors alleged that the appropriate warnings did come up, but that poll workers overrode them and issued in-person ballots anyway, allowing two ballots to be cast by the same person.
Macomb County Prosecutor Pete Lucido initially declined to press charges against any of the people involved in the St. Clair Shores case. He argued that it appeared no one had intended to commit a crime.
But two months later, Nessel filed charges not only against those accused of casting two ballots but also against the poll workers who allegedly assisted them. At the time, the move was viewed as part of a broader effort by Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to underscore the security of Michigan’s elections ahead of the 2024 presidential race.

The Centers for Disease Control, the nation’s top public health agency, is in chaos following the firing of its director by President Donald Trump and the resignations of its top leaders last week. Nine former CDC directors wrote in the New York Times this week that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, who spearhead the purge of the CDC and is a longtime leader of the anti-vaccine movement, is “endangering every American’s health.”
States are increasingly spurning Kennedy and taking health matters into their own hands. Northeastern states, including Vermont, have formed a regional health coalition in response to concerns about federal vaccine guidance. The governors of California, Washington and Oregon declared this week said that the CDC has become “a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science … that will lead to severe health consequences.” The three western states are banding together to coordinate their own vaccine policy.
Meanwhile, the state of Florida has just announced that it will become the first state to do away with all childhood vaccine mandates, eliciting strong objections from public health experts.

Can Vermont trust the health advice coming out of the federal government? What are the leading threats to public health confronting the state and country?
“It pains me to say, I don’t know that you want to trust the CDC,” said Dr. Becca Bell on The Vermont Conversation. Bell is associate professor of pediatrics at the Larner College of Medicine and a pediatric critical care physician at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital. She is the immediate past president of the Vermont Medical Society and of the Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. (Bell noted that she is speaking in her personal capacity, not on behalf of the organizations with which she is affiliated).
Bell said that “the officials that have left the (CDC) have really raised the alarm that … we shouldn’t trust what’s coming out of the CDC in terms of some immunization guidance in particular.”
She encouraged families to look to other sources for accurate information, especially the parenting website of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which represents 67,000 pediatricians. She also recommended the Vermont Department of Health and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
“Then I ask families to talk to their own child’s doctor, because that’s going to be a great source as well.” 
Kennedy, the Health and Human Services secretary, announced in May that the CDC would no longer recommend a COVID shot for healthy children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued contrary guidance, recommending a COVID shot for all children under the age of 2 since they are “especially vulnerable to severe COVID-19.”
Bell credited Vermont with being proactive “about how we can keep Vermonters safe,” but added  that she feels “really sad” for the future of child health in the United States. “I think that we’re going to see a lot of disparities, not just with access to vaccination but access to health care in general, with the big Medicaid cuts that are coming up as well.”
Bell warned that Medicaid cuts, which will result in some 45,000 Vermonters losing health insurance, will fall hardest on children. One third of Medicaid enrollees in Vermont are children.
“What we’re about to see with that One Big Beautiful Bill Act (is) a huge transfer of resources from low income folks to the highest earners in this country,” said Bell. “Accessible, affordable health care is what kids need to succeed and for families to succeed, and so we are deeply concerned about the future of pediatric health care because our foundation is Medicaid. This is how we care for kids. It’s what supports our clinics.”
“The lack of investment in children is just really concerning and very short sighted.”

(Capitol News Illinois illustration by Andrew Adams)
Article Summary

The Trump administration has demanded Illinois turn over its complete statewide voter registration database, including sensitive information such as voters’ dates of birth, driver’s license and Social Security numbers.
The Illinois State Board of Elections has given DOJ a redacted data set that does not include sensitive information, but it says state privacy laws preclude it from sharing the unredacted database.
DOJ says it wants the information to determine whether Illinois is complying with federal requirements to keep its voter rolls accurate and up to date.
A former Justice Department attorney who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research says the DOJ has no legal authority to demand the information.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois State Board of Elections said this week it will not hand over to the Trump administration a copy of the state’s complete, unredacted voter registration database, citing state laws that require the agency to protect voters’ sensitive personal information.
In a letter Tuesday to the Voting Section of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, ISBE general counsel Marni Malowitz said releasing the data would expose Illinois voters to unnecessary risks.
“We take Illinoisans’ privacy very seriously; data breaches and hacking are unfortunately common, and the disclosure of sensitive information contrary to state law would expose our residents to undue risk,” Malowitz wrote.
Illinois is reportedly one of several states that DOJ has asked to turn over entire voter registration databases, including sensitive personal information such as dates of birth, driver’s license or state ID numbers, and partial Social Security numbers.
DOJ has said it wants the information in order to enforce federal requirements that states maintain accurate and up-to-date voter registration lists. But state elections officials have said they are precluded under state law from releasing sensitive information contained in the registration files.

In August, state officials sent DOJ a copy of the same type of data file it shares with political committees and other government agencies. That file includes voters’ names, addresses and their age at the time they registered, but not their date of birth, driver’s license, state ID or Social Security number.
But DOJ wrote back on Aug. 14 saying that was not good enough. It demanded the state turn over its entire database, with “all fields, including the registrant’s full name, date of birth, residential address, his or her state driver’s license number or the last four digits of the registrant’s social security number as required under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) to register individuals for federal elections.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, the elections board had not indicated whether it had received a response from the Justice Department to its latest letter.
DOJ has said it wants the information to determine whether Illinois is complying with requirements under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act and the 2003 Help America Vote Act to keep the voter registration lists accurate and up to date. That includes occasionally purging from the voter rolls the names of people who have died or moved.
Read It: Illinois State Board of Elections letter to DOJ
But DOJ has also asked Illinois to identify the number of registered voters who have been removed from the rolls for other reasons, such as not being U.S. citizens, being adjudicated incompetent, or for felony convictions.
David Becker, a former DOJ attorney in the voting section of the Civil Rights Division who now directs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, said during a media briefing Wednesday that the federal agency has only limited authority to enforce the list maintenance requirements of those laws.
“The DOJ has sole authority to require that the states engage in a general, reasonable program of list maintenance,” he said. “What the DOJ can’t do is say, ‘Remove Jane Doe, but keep John Doe on.’ That is the role of the states and states alone.”
He also said the department has no legal authority to demand voters’ sensitive personal information and it would have little use for the information even if it could have access to it.
“The DOJ could not possibly, even if they had it, conduct better list maintenance than the states are currently doing,” he said. “The most valuable asset that (states) have is their DMV database, which the federal government does not have access to. So even if they had a legal authority to gain this data, it wouldn’t do them any good, and they don’t have the legal authority to get this data.”

Mike Braun speaks at a news conference on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun has lifted a longtime utility customer advocate to the state’s top job — and directed her to find ways to cut bills.
Two members of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission also have announced plans to resign early, handing Braun more opportunities to impact utility rates. They join a third whose term has already lapsed.
“Hoosiers have been burdened with utility rate increase after increase. We can’t take it anymore,” Braun said in a Wednesday news release. His chief of staff told reporters that the governor will be focusing on energy and energy rates this fall.
Abby Gray (Courtesy Office of Utility Consumer Counselor)
Braun appointed Abby Gray to run the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor on Tuesday, according to the agency’s website. The 92-year-old office serves as utility customers’ legal and technical representative in IURC rate cases and matters.
Gray previously spent more than 16 years directing legal operations for the agency, per the website. Before that, she served 23 years as a senior administrative law judge and senior commission counsel for the IURC.
“I have dedicated my career to public service and it’s the honor of a lifetime to continue to serve Indiana ratepayers in this new role,” Gray said. “I am deeply humbled and appreciative of Governor Braun’s confidence in me and look forward to advocating for Indiana utility consumers.”
Former Counselor William Fine left his longtime post last week.
Braun also directed Gray to evaluate utility companies’ profits and look at other cost-saving measures to “ease the burden on ratepayers.”
“I would also like to see the utilities’ investors bear more of the cost of doing business,” he added, pointedly.
That’s the IURC’s realm.
Changes coming for utility regulators
When regulated utilities want to hike customer bills, they go to the commission for permission. The IURC can also regulate construction projects, asset acquisition, financing, bonding, environmental compliance plans, service territories and more.
While Gray and the OUCC explicitly represent Hoosiers, the commission is “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities,” according to its website. It is supposed to ensure utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates.
Indiana’s “big five” investor-owned electricity providers are monopolies in their exclusive service territories.
Gubernatorial candidate Braun promised that, as seats on the IURC “become open,” he’d add appointees that “hold my views on the future of energy in Indiana.” Now, as governor, he has vacancies to fill.
IURC Chair Jim Huston’s current term ended in April. Without a replacement named, he’s continued serving. The terms for Commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett were set to end early next year, but both announced plans on Wednesday to resign in October.
In a news release, Freeman said she was “honored” to have spent nine years as a commissioner, and thanked Huston for his leadership.

Bennett called it a “blessing” to have served Hoosiers alongside his commission colleagues for the last two years.
Both have notified Braun of their intent to step down, according to the release, “ensuring time for the IURC Nominating Committee to open applications and fill the vacancies by their resignations.”
The administration says it wants the IURC to give more scrutiny to rate cases brought by the investor-owned utilities. New appointees will focus on ratepayers, affordability and supply.
Some lawmakers applauded Braun’s actions, but warned that Hoosier ratepayers are unlikely to see relief.
“I appreciate Gov. Braun’s stated commitment to lowering utility costs for consumers and share that desire with him,” Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, said in a news release Wednesday. “… Changing the consumer ratepayer advocate commissioner does little to change the fact that the legal deck is stacked against Indiana utility consumers.”
“Thanks to a slew of new laws championed by the Republican supermajority, utility companies are still allowed to pass on the cost of expensive experimental projects to consumers, and data centers are exempt from paying sales tax,” she continued. “I hope that my House Republican colleagues will join us in advocating for consumers over utility company profits in the future, especially as consumers begin to understand that AI companies are passing on the cost of doing business to everyday families.”
Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville, also announced plans to file legislation aimed at lowering utility bills next session.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-03 20:57:51+00:00,CT Mirror,"Survey: CT businesses face growing uncertainty, unease amid policy shifts",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/03/cbia-business-survey-economy-ct/,"While CBIA found business opinions were fairly consistent from 2024, what changed in 2025 was uncertainty about state and federal policy.","As Connecticut’s economy continues to face a complex mix of challenges — ranging from rising operating costs, to difficulty filling jobs, affordability concerns and the state’s high cost of living — national and state policy changes are adding additional uncertainty to the mix, according to a new survey of businesses released on Wednesday. 
In the latest edition of the “Survey of Connecticut Businesses,” an annual survey compiled by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, businesses across the state weighed in on a variety of topics — including federal tariff policy, the impacts of state regulation and taxes, and Connecticut’s overall business climate. 
“Employers are increasingly dealing with unnecessary uncertainty generated by both federal and state policy decisions, particularly tariffs and the pivot by Connecticut policymakers away from the fiscal guardrails and no-tax policies that brought much-needed economic stability in recent years,” Chris DiPentima, the president and CEO of CBIA, said in a statement released alongside the survey. 
“While our survey shows some signs of optimism, concerns about the state’s competitiveness, workforce challenges, and cost pressures continue to temper expectations,” he added. 
The survey was sent to 2,800 businesses across the state during the summer, with roughly 13% of businesses responding to the survey. Most of the firms were small, CBIA said, “with 68% employing less than 50 people, 13% with 50 to 99 people, 11% between 100 and 249 employees, and 8% employing between 250 and 499 people.” Overall, the report found that business opinions are widespread and are fairly consistent with the survey responses reported last year. 
What was different in 2025, however, was a growing sense of unease and uncertainty amid policy shifts at the local, national and international levels — specifically the onset of new state regulations and global tariff and trade policies. 
[RELATED: A US tariff exemption for small orders is ending. It’s a big deal for CT small businesses]
That instability, respondents noted in the survey, arrives as businesses face persistent workforce difficulties, increased expenses and frustrations with state lawmakers. But the survey also found some business leaders in the state are seeing positive signs as well, focusing on innovation and optimization as the uncertainty continues.
That duality was on display Wednesday at CBIA’s annual Connecticut Economy conference, as business leaders and economic experts unpacked the survey results, describing the current political landscape as presenting both risks and rewards. 
“Don’t count on the uncertainty going away,” Ezra Greenberg, a partner with McKinsey & Company, said while presenting regional and national economic data at the conference Wednesday morning. “We’ve been talking about this for years, so we have to think about it.”
Costs are rising, for workers and for businesses
According to the survey, Connecticut businesses are dealing with two problems in particular: an increase in business costs and a shortage of workers. 
In July, there were more than 77,000 unfilled job openings in the state — more vacancies than before the pandemic began in March 2020. 
Some 9 in 10 respondents also said that costs were increasing for a number of reasons, including labor expenses, health care, energy, taxes and compliance costs. 
Those costs make it harder for businesses to continue operating, they said, with one respondent arguing that “raising the minimum wage, workers’ compensation costs, and increasing the threshold on unemployment costs will ultimately make it unaffordable to stay in Connecticut.” 
Some respondents said policy decisions from the Connecticut legislature aggravated these difficulties. The report noted that respondents largely held neutral or negative opinions about the state Legislature when it comes to lawmakers’ handling of the economy. 
That led to a swift rebuke by GOP state senators Stephen Harding, Henri Martin and Heather Somers.
“Connecticut job creators are very concerned about what they see happening at our State Capitol, and rightly so,” the lawmakers noted in a statement released Wednesday. “Connecticut Democrats continue to overtax working families and businesses.” 
Survey respondents’ view on the issue went deeper than taxes. On a question about regulatory burdens, 45% of respondents said that Connecticut labor policies like paid sick leave and paid FMLA requirements were their biggest challenge. Another 23% cited insurance mandates and difficulty managing health care costs.

“Business leaders are navigating a complex cost landscape that directly impacts their ability to grow and compete,” the survey report noted. “At the same time, employers understand the rising costs their employees face to live in the state — leading them to find ways to increase salaries and offer other means of supporting their workforces.” 
That tension has been outlined in other recent reports.
In July, CT Voices for Children released a report arguing that addressing wage inequality — in other words, closing gaps in pay experienced largely by women, Black workers, and Hispanic workers — could help address affordability issues in the state. On Wednesday, Gov. Ned Lamont announced that Connecticut’s indexed minimum wage will increase to $16.94 in January 2026, one of the highest in the nation. 
Economic experts said Wednesday that if Connecticut hopes to be competitive regionally and nationally, it will need to find a way to thread the needle between businesses wanting lower costs and workers pushing for higher wages. 
“When you’re talking about quality of life, it’s not just quality of life, it’s for whom is the quality of life,” said Dustin Nord, director of the CBIA foundation for Economic Growth and Opportunity. “What are we doing to make it affordable for people that are at the beginning of their career, that they have opportunity and the ability to afford a nice place to live and have the amenities that they might be able to get in Charlotte, or if they go to D.C. or go to Virginia?” 
A regional – and national – competition
Wednesday also saw the release of a new CBIA foundation index comparing economic conditions in Connecticut to states across the country. 
The index report found that Connecticut is a mixed bag, ranking near the top of the nation on some measures like per capita personal income (2nd), and bachelor degree attainment (6th). But the state ranks close to the bottom on others, including job creation, where the state ranked 34th in one-year employment growth and 42nd for growth over a ten-year period. 
The ranking showed that Connecticut is struggling to keep up with more affordable states, making it harder for the state to attract new residents, keep young people after college, and support working families.

“The data reveals a state at an inflection point,” an introduction to the index report stated. “We have the educational attainment, research capacity, and income levels that typically drive economic success, and yet we’re not seeing that translate into the job creation and business formation that sustain long-term competitiveness.” 
On Wednesday, those gathered for the CBIA event acknowledged that the state is still in the process of charting its path forward. But for businesses, speakers said, at a time of heightened uncertainty and continued costs, finding support within the community will be key to moving forward.
“I think in these trying economic times, it is a time where businesses have to work together, where you have to partner,” said Robyn Sullivan, president of data recovery and cloud computing provider, Cloudsmart LLC. “There is some common ground that can be made.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CBIA_Economy_001-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 17:58:16.771169
,DC,2025-09-03 20:57:13+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘Congress must choose’: Epstein survivors demand vote to release case files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-must-choose-epstein-survivors-demand-vote-release-case-files,,"WASHINGTON — As survivors of abuse inflicted by the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein pleaded on Capitol Hill Wednesday for the release of investigative files, Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie accused House GOP leaders of using “the oldest trick in the swamp” to avoid the issue.An unusually large crowd gathered outside the U.S. House to hear from the women, who described emotional manipulation and physical coercion, beginning as early as age 14 in some cases, at the hands of Epstein and convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The speakers included family of the late Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who pursued charges against Maxwell and died earlier this year by suicide.In speech after speech, the victims urged Congress and President Donald Trump to make public what federal authorities uncovered about the reach of Epstein’s abuse, and specifically voiced support for Massie’s bipartisan effort that would bypass House leadership and force the release of volumes of records.“Congress must choose — will you continue to protect predators, or will you finally protect survivors?” said Lisa Phillips, who was victimized by Epstein on his private Caribbean island and now hosts a podcast about healing after abuse. The government’s investigation into Epstein’s widespread sexual abuse has dogged and splintered House Republicans since July, when Trump’s administration declared it would not share any further information on the powerful and well-connected financier. Epstein died in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. Epstein surrounded himself with celebrities and politicians, including Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Trump campaigned on releasing what he and many describe as the “Epstein files,” and for years many of his supporters, including some now in his administration, fixated on conspiracy theories about the scandal.Discharge petition roils House“There are real victims to this criminal enterprise, and the perpetrators are being protected because they're rich and powerful and political donors to the establishment here in Washington, D.C. So today, we're standing with these survivors,” Massie said at the outdoors press conference.Massie and House Democrat Ro Khanna of California need just two more Republican signatures on a discharge petition that would trigger the release of the Epstein case file, leapfrogging House leadership.

House Speaker Mike Johnson instead urged his party Wednesday to support a symbolic measure approving an already ongoing GOP-led committee probe.Khanna, and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, welcomed the victims to Capitol Hill alongside Massie.“This is the most important fight we can wage here in Congress, fighting for innocent people that never received justice, and the women behind me have never received justice. And do you want to know why? It's because Jeffrey Epstein somehow was able to walk among the most rich, powerful people,” Greene said.Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina joined Massie and Greene in signing the petition. All Democrats in the House, which has a 219-212 split, are expected to sign.Lured by Epstein With the U.S. Capitol as their backdrop, numerous women shared stories of being lured, some at just 14 years old, by money and opportunities Epstein offered to them.Annie Farmer said she was 16 when she and her sister were flown to New Mexico to spend a weekend with Epstein and Maxwell, where she said they were assaulted and photographed. Her sister reported their sexual abuse to authorities later that year.“I am now 46 years old. Thirty years later, we still do not know why that report wasn't properly investigated, or why Epstein and his associates were allowed to harm hundreds, if not thousands, of other girls and young women. “We have never been told whether those images were found when they discovered a large amount of child sexual abuse material on his property,” said Farmer, who testified publicly in both cases against Epstein and Maxwell.Farmer said for many years it felt like Epstein’s abusive behavior was “an open secret” and that his network of powerful friends “chose to look the other way because it benefited them.” Farmer called for a thorough public review of the government’s findings in the Epstein case.“At a time with record-high levels of distrust in our institutions and a perception that there are two Americas — one for those with power and privilege and one for everyone else — passing this Epstein transparency bill is one important step that can be taken to prove to Americans that the government does not side with sexual perpetrators,” she said.Jena-Lisa Jones told the large crowd that Epstein began abusing her when she was 14.“I know that I was just a little kid, but sometimes I still feel like it is my fault that this happened,” she said.“If you’re a member of Congress and you’re listening to all of us speak here today, please really listen to us. Please vote for this bill to be passed. Please recognize how important it is for transparency relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this does not matter.”Jones then directly appealed to Trump: “Please, President Trump, pass this bill and help us. Make us feel like our voices are finally being heard.” Trump rebuffs reports on Epstein relationshipTrump’s past relationship with Epstein has been under a microscope since July. The president sued the Wall Street Journal for reporting on a 50th birthday card Trump gave to Epstein. The card allegedly featured a cryptic message and a doodle of a naked woman with Trump’s signature mimicking pubic hair. The Journal also reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed the president in May that his name appeared in the Epstein case files. The context in which his name appeared is unclear. Trump has denied the reports.Trump dismissed questions about releasing the Epstein case files when asked by reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon.“This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,” Trump said while sitting alongside Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki during their previously planned meeting.“What they're trying to do with the Epstein hoax is getting people to talk about that instead of speaking about the tremendous success like ending seven wars. I ended seven wars, nobody's going to talk about (that) because they're going to talk about the Epstein whatever,” Trump continued. Trump did not detail specifically which wars.“I understand that we were subpoenaed to give files, and I understand we've given thousands of pages of files, and I know that no matter what you do, it's going to keep going.”The GOP-led House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released roughly 33,000 pages Tuesday night related to the government’s Epstein investigation. But the collection was quickly dismissed by many observers as duplicates and items that were already public.“I appreciate the efforts of my colleague, James Comer, who's leading the Oversight Committee,” Massie said of his fellow Kentucky lawmaker. “They may find some information, but they're allowing the (Department of Justice) to curate all of the information that the DOJ is giving them. If you've looked at the pages they've released so far, they're heavily redacted. Some pages are entirely redacted, and 97% of this is already in the public domain.” Subpoenas issuedComer’s committee has also subpoenaed testimony from Clinton, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and numerous former Department of Justice officials, from both Democratic and Republican administrations.Massie told reporters Wednesday that Speaker Johnson urged colleagues not to support the Kentucky Republican’s discharge petition and instead vote for a procedural rule to support the Oversight Committee’s investigation. A committee investigation, however, does not require a floor vote to proceed.“My message to my colleagues was, ‘Don't set yourself up.’ Yes, the speaker's resolution will give you temporary political cover, but there are millions of people watching this,” Massie said.Members of the House Oversight Committee met with several Epstein victims Tuesday.Johnson, of Louisiana, said Massie and Khanna’s petition is “moot and unnecessary.”“The Oversight Committee's investigation is already ongoing. They're already producing and putting out there the documents that are covered, the White House is in full compliance. The administration is willfully complying with the subpoenas because they want maximum transparency as well. I talked to the president himself last night, so this is going to be an ongoing effort.”Jennifer Shutt and Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-03 17:58:16.771169

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)The Democratic governors of California, Oregon and Washington said Wednesday they are forming an alliance to coordinate vaccine recommendations for their states.
Meanwhile, Florida announced plans to become the first state to phase out all vaccine mandates, including ending requirements that kids be vaccinated against dangerous diseases before enrolling in schools.
Public health experts have relied on vaccines, including school mandates, for decades to limit the spread of communicable diseases and keep kids and adults safe.
The contrasting moves come amid turmoil at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where several top leaders resigned last week to protest efforts by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
Flanked by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo said at a news conference Wednesday that vaccine mandates are “wrong” and “immoral,” the Florida Phoenix reported.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” Ladapo said.
“They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
The Florida Department of Health can eliminate some vaccine mandates on its own, Ladapo said, but the Florida legislature would have to scrap other ones. He did not mention specific vaccines, but repeated that his goal was to end “all of them. Every last one of them.”
The goal of the new West Coast Health Alliance, governors said, is to disseminate evidence-based recommendations about who should get immunized, as well as to provide vaccine education throughout the three states. In the coming weeks, the states will coordinate and finalize immunization guidelines that are in line with leading medical organizations.
In their announcements, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson criticized recent Trump administration actions, including the firing of scientists and the upheaval at the CDC.
“When federal agencies abandon evidence-based recommendations in favor of ideology, we cannot continue down that same path,” Washington Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham said in a statement.
Worsham added that “public health at its core is about prevention — preventing illness, preventing the spread of disease, and preventing early, avoidable deaths.”

Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states rely on the committee to form vaccination guidelines.
And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for children and pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19 — sidestepping the usual process for issuing official recommendations.
The three Western states said the “dismantling” of the CDC has created “a vacuum of clear, evidence-based vaccine guidance,” hampering health care providers, disrupting manufacturers’ production plans and creating uncertainty for families.
In 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the three states, along with Nevada, created a similar workgroup that emphasized the scientific rigor behind the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in an effort to boost confidence in the shot.
“President Donald Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people,” the joint statement from the three governors’ offices said.
“The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences. California, Oregon, and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk.”

(Northwest Team 2 photo / Peelee Clark)A major deadline set by an Executive Order from President Donald Trump to consolidate the firefighting apparatus in the Department of Interior and the U.S. Forest Service is approaching, with some advocacy organizations hoping it will improve coordination.
Interior and the Forest Service, which is housed in the Department of Agriculture, need to present a plan by Sept. 10 on how they’re going to consolidate firefighting efforts. A second deadline, on Dec. 9, requires the two departments to unveil a plan to increase state and local firefighting capacity.
Partners in Wildfire Prevention, a coalition which includes clean energy interest groups, economic organizations, the Western Fire Chiefs Association and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, said there’s not enough attention on the issue of wildfires at the national level. They view the order as some acknowledgement of that and are hopeful it improves fire response.
“What we don’t know yet is exactly what the decisions are that come out of the order,” said Chet Wade, a spokesperson for the group. “That’s why we think it’s important to draw attention to it. And what we hope to see is greater collaboration, stronger communication, better more effective operations.”
The order places more emphasis on using technology to fight fires. This mostly deals with early detection – computer-assisted systems can report fires, and aerial capacity, both with suppression efforts and fire reconnaissance is where more technology for managing fires could be implemented.
“There are lots of new technologies, you know, using satellites, using AI, using other sensors that allow for either monitoring and understanding when there is a higher risk and what can be done about it, or responding quickly,” Wade said.

Not all groups have been rosy about the prospect of the order, with Andy Stahl, director of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, telling the Daily Montanan earlier this year it was just an effort to rile up members of President Trump’s base.
It’s unclear what the changes will ultimately mean to day-to-day operations. 
“At the direction of President Donald J. Trump, we are unifying federal wildfire programs to streamline bureaucracy and leverage new technologies and partnerships to better equip local responders, accelerate suppression efforts, and strengthen preventative measures—all essential to protecting communities and conserving our public lands,” Erin McDuff, an Interior Department spokesperson wrote in an email to the Daily Montanan in late June.
Montana has seen a fire season devoid of large fires. On Monday, the state’s fire tracking website said there have been 1,942 wildland fire incidents this year, but acreage burned is lower than last year. Gov. Greg Gianforte said late last month “aggressive” work by firefighters in the state had limited the acreage burned this year to about a third of what it was in 2024.
Fires across the state appeared to mostly be under control, with a spate of fires that kicked up during a warm week in late August mostly tampered down.
The Windy Rock fire, 15 miles from Drummond was the exception, which was listed at 4,130 acres and was 1% contained on Wednesday. There is a public meeting scheduled for 5 p.m. at the Helmville Community Center on Wednesday.
The fire is being managed by a large, national team. No structures have been destroyed by the fire to date.
It’s been an expensive fight, though, and the fire’s cost for suppression efforts was listed at nearly $25 million. Firefighting costs are split between state and federal governments and are divided out at the end of the year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/306A4612-NW@-PIO-Peelee-Clark-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-03 16:57:49.720985

Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus recently sent a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern over incidents in which her agency and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement have prevented members of Congress from inspecting ICE immigrant detention facilities.
The letter contends that new DHS protocols — which require seven days’ notice for a visit, among other provisions — violate federal law and urges Noem to “immediately rescind the facility visit guidance that impedes congressional access to detention facilities and ensure full compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.”
The ICE facilities, the letter said, “are funded by billions of taxpayer dollars and exhibit persistent issues related to health and safety, human rights, and waste, fraud, and abuse. It is imperative that Members conduct timely oversight to determine whether public funds are being spent as mandated by Congress and ensure the safety and wellbeing of individuals who are detained by the government.”
Vasquez visited the Otero County Processing Center in July where, as Source previously reported, he was unable to speak with detainees; ICE officials were “unwilling and unable” to provide clear answers about their treatment of detainees; and inmate phones were broken and toilets would not flush.
Staff members for U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) visited the Torrance County Detention Facility in May, and heard at least 10 people file complaints with an ICE official for verbal and physical abuse; lack of access to laundry; being forced to wear old, dirty clothing; and lack of medical care, according to a letter Heinrich sent to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.
“Congress needs and must be able to inspect and enforce the inspection of detention facilities,” Vasquez told Source on Wednesday. “Part of our job is oversight of federal facilities like ICE facilities, and we’re being denied that right all across the country. And so this is essentially a letter that spells out what the clear letter of the law is.”
A dozen Democratic members of the U.S. House have also gone to court over being denied access.

Ron DeSantis, speaking at Grace Christian School in Valrico on Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)VALRICO — Manatee County Commissioners have voted to join a lawsuit challenging a new state law (SB 180) that restricts local governments from regulating developments.
On Tuesday, they joined 10 other local governments in the state, including Orange County and the cities of Alachua and Stuart, that have joined a prospective lawsuit contending that the law is an unconstitutional infringement on home rule. They want to see it repealed.
During his press conference in eastern Hillsborough County Wednesday, the Phoenix asked the governor what he makes of local governments that say that the measure precludes them from managing growth in their communities.
“I have vetoed bills that have tried to pre-empt local [control] in the past,” DeSantis said at the end of a lengthy press conference centered on his plan end to vaccine mandates in Florida.
“I’ve signed bills that have done it. And kind of on this one the reason why I thought these people needed relief is because their home gets damaged by a major hurricane. They want to go out and restore their home to what it was like before the storm hits, and the local governments are telling them, ‘You can’t do it. You gotta do something else.’
“What right do they have to tell you that you can’t rebuild your home?” he said to a cheering crowd. “This isn’t California. This is Florida.”
The governor’s response emphasized what the bill sponsor, Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie, said during the session was his motivation for the legislation: to streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination following a major storm.
The lawmaker said that he had heard from too many of his constituents in Pinellas County after the devastating one-two punch of hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall who faced roadblocks and excessive bureaucracy from local governments when trying to restore their properties.
Problematic provision
However, a provision of the proposal that was barely mentioned at all during the bill’s journey to becoming law is what is inspiring local lawmakers to pursue litigation. That provision bars new local land-use or development regulations considered “restrictive or burdensome,” even if they are completely unrelated to storm recovery.
The law also specifies that “any person” can serve a local government with notification of intent to sue on belief that the government has violated the law. The local government then has 14 days to correct any problem. If the government chooses to repeal the restriction, any case would be dropped. If it declines to repeal, that person can go ahead and file a lawsuit.
Local officials say that the phrase “more restrictive or burdensome” is hopelessly vague and/or subjective, and that it incentivizes lawyers for developers, land owners, and interest groups to challenge almost any regulatory or procedural change a local government makes.
The provision “is the largest intrusion into home rule authority of local governments since the Florida Constitution was adopted in 1968,” said Fort Lauderdale attorney Jamie Cole, who is working on filing a class action against SB 180 for the local governments later this month.
Current restrictions
Among the policies environmental groups like 1000 Friends of Florida say local governments can be restricted from enacting now because of the new law include:

Identifying appropriate locations, standards and densities for new development.
Protecting sensitive environmental and agricultural lands.
Managing water quality and supply (including stormwater).
Enhancing community resilience to lessen impacts from and costs of natural disasters.
Raising impact fees to keep up with increasing costs of infrastructure to accommodate new development.

“They may be challenging other provisions, I didn’t write the bill,” DeSantis added on Wednesday.
“There may be things in there that in a perfect world I would not have necessarily agreed to, but I did feel compelled to stand up for the homeowners who were getting stymied by local governments, and I thought that they deserved the right to be able to restore their property to where it was prior to the storm.”
“Basically what he’s saying is that he viewed this just as most of the legislators, who think that this is dealing with recovery after emergencies, after hurricanes,” said Cole. “If your house is destroyed, you want the ability to rebuild your house right away. You don’t want the government getting involved. Absolutely,” he said, laughing. “That is fine.
“The problem is this bill goes way beyond that and deals with situations that have nothing to do with hurricanes and emergencies.”

Florida announced plans to end all state vaccine mandates, while three Western states — California, Oregon and Washington — are forming an alliance to issue their own vaccine guidelines amid federal upheaval. (Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)The Democratic governors of California, Oregon and Washington said Wednesday they are forming an alliance to coordinate vaccine recommendations for their states.
Meanwhile, Florida announced plans to become the first state to phase out all vaccine mandates, including ending requirements that kids be vaccinated against dangerous diseases before enrolling in schools.
Public health experts have relied on vaccines, including school mandates, for decades to limit the spread of communicable diseases and keep kids and adults safe.
The contrasting moves come amid turmoil at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where several top leaders resigned last week to protest efforts by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
Flanked by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo said at a news conference Wednesday that vaccine mandates are “wrong” and “immoral,” the Florida Phoenix reported.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” Ladapo said.
“They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

The Florida Department of Health can eliminate some vaccine mandates on its own, Ladapo said, but the Florida legislature would have to scrap other ones. He did not mention specific vaccines, but repeated that his goal was to end “all of them. Every last one of them.”
The goal of the new West Coast Health Alliance, governors said, is to disseminate evidence-based recommendations about who should get immunized, as well as to provide vaccine education throughout the three states. In the coming weeks, the states will coordinate and finalize immunization guidelines that are in line with leading medical organizations.
In their announcements, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson criticized recent Trump administration actions, including the firing of scientists and the upheaval at the CDC.
“When federal agencies abandon evidence-based recommendations in favor of ideology, we cannot continue down that same path,” Washington Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham said in a statement.
Worsham added that “public health at its core is about prevention — preventing illness, preventing the spread of disease, and preventing early, avoidable deaths.”
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states rely on the committee to form vaccination guidelines.
And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for children and pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19 — sidestepping the usual process for issuing official recommendations.
Despite federal shift, state health officials encourage COVID vaccines for pregnant women

The three Western states said the “dismantling” of the CDC has created “a vacuum of clear, evidence-based vaccine guidance,” hampering health care providers, disrupting manufacturers’ production plans and creating uncertainty for families.
In 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the three states, along with Nevada, created a similar workgroup that emphasized the scientific rigor behind the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in an effort to boost confidence in the shot.
“President Donald Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people,” the joint statement from the three governors’ offices said.
“The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences. California, Oregon, and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk.”

McIver from her committee assignment on the Homeland Security Committee.","Rep. LaMonica McIver (Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)House Democrats and a few Republicans killed the effort to censure a New Jersey congresswoman over her involvement in a scuffle outside a Newark migrant jail that led to federal charges. 
Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) celebrated the failure to censure her, calling it a partisan attempt to “shut me up.” 
“I was not elected to play political games — I was elected to serve,” McIver said on social media shortly after the vote. “I won’t back down. Not now. Not ever.” 
In a 215-207 vote, the House tabled the measure, which would have also removed McIver from her committee assignment on the House Homeland Security Committee. Every Democrat voted to table the measure. They were joined by five Republicans: Reps. Don Bacon and Mike Flood of Nebraska, Rep. David Valadao of California, and Reps. Dave Joyce and Mike Turner of Ohio. Two Republicans also voted present. 
Bacon said in a statement that he didn’t support the censure of McIver because he wants the Ethics Committee to finish the report on this matter. 
Republicans lashed out at McIver after she was accused by acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba of assaulting an officer during a May 9 altercation while Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested outside Delaney Hall, an immigration detention center that opened in the city in May. Baraka saw his charges dropped weeks later. 
A federal grand jury indicted McIver on three counts of interfering with federal law enforcement authorities. McIver pleaded not guilty and maintained that the prosecution is political retaliation. Her attorneys recently asked a judge to dismiss the case against her, which is set to go to trial in November. She faces 17 years in prison if convicted.
Democratic U.S. Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman were also with McIver that day to conduct an unannounced oversight visit of the facility. Menendez and Watson Coleman did not face any charges. 
While officials read the censure resolution — introduced by Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, before the August recess — Democrats shouted and jeered. Wednesday’s effort is the second time House Republicans have moved to reprimand a Democrat lawmaker this year — in March, 10 Democrats joined Republicans to rebuke Rep. Al Greene (D-Texas) for heckling the president during a joint address. 
Only 28 House members have been censured in U.S. history. Four of those have been since 2021.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LaMonicaMcIver01-1024x803.jpg,,,2025-09-03 16:57:49.720985

They are joined by AFL-CIO President Josh Sword and Education West Virginia Executive Director Kym Randolph. (Photo by Jennifer Wood/Education West Virginia)The state’s two teachers unions officially merged into one organization this month, forming a new labor union called Education West Virginia.
With public education facing funding declines, insurance hikes and teacher shortages, leaders of the West Virginia Education Association and American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia said it was the right time to come together.
“This was a thoughtful, deliberative process that was almost three years in the making, seeking to build on strengths of the former organizations while also creating a stronger, more member engaged union than ever before,” said Kristie Skidmore, co-president of Education West Virginia. Skidmore formerly served as president of AFT-WV. 
Skidmore and other co-president Dale Lee, former president of the WVEA, held a press conference Wednesday in Charleston to formally announce the merger. 
“By joining together, we will fight the challenge,” Skidmore said. 
The previous unions began discussing a merger back in 2018 during the West Virginia teachers strike, where thousands of school teachers and personnel demonstrated at the state capitol over pay and benefits. 
The merger, which went into effect Sept. 1, comes as teachers and state workers just saw a major price hike to insurance premiums under the Public Employees Insurance Agency.
Due to the program’s financial issues, the agency’s finance board approved a round of July 1 premium hikes for state and local government employees as well as retirees. Both state and county employees using PEIA saw an increase of  40% in their out-of-pocket maximum as well as increases in co-pays.The monthly spousal surcharge for state employees more than doubled, from $147 to $350. 
The increases are projected to equal roughly $113 million, but PEIA costs are expected to keep climbing due to medical inflation. 
West Virginia has the lowest teacher pay in the country. Lee said the level of salary and benefits was contributing to the hundreds of unfilled teacher jobs across the state. 
“Employees deserve affordable quality health care, and their collective voices will play an important role in driving home that message to the Legislature,” he said. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has proposed a four-point plan to “fix” PEIA, MetroNews reported. It included: establishing a new plan for new employees; removing coverage eligibility for spouses who are offered health insurance through their own employer; and establishing a PEIA fraud unit.
The governor may call lawmakers in this month for a special session to vote on his PEIA plan, but there isn’t clear support among the GOP-super majority Legislature for Morrisey’s idea. The possible PEIA-focused special session could start as early as Sunday since lawmakers will gather in Charleston for September legislative interim meetings. 
“We have to have a long term stabilization of PEIA,” Lee said. “We know that the cost continues to increase, and we also understand that we have to have some skin in the game, but all the skin can’t be ours. It has to be everyone going to the table and coming up with a long term stabilization for this plan.”
Lee said Education West Virginia will also ask lawmakers to increase mental health support for children in schools. He noted that a new state elementary student discipline law, which mandates screening students in trouble for underlying causes, is a good start. 
“Children can’t focus on learning if they come to school hungry or stressed out or traumatized by the situations they face at home. The behavior disruptions and their violent outbursts from students are at an all time high based on what we’re hearing from our members,” he said. “It is critical that our state provide the mental health services and the resources students need.”
Lee and Skidmore will serve as co-presidents of Education West Virginia until spring 2027, when the union will have its first convention and elect a new president. 
Education West Virginia will operate under the umbrella of West Virginia AFL-CIO.
“West Virginia has a very, very rich and historic labor history … and I believe that the creation of Education West Virginia will go down in history as one of the most important and influential labor actions our state will ever see,” said West Virginia AFL-CIO President Josh Sword.
“To watch two organizations who were fiercely competitive for membership for close to 50 years put the past behind them and join together to further their common goals — for educators, for children, for communities, for public education — to be here today, celebrating this historic accomplishment, proves yet again that in solidarity, anything can be achieved,” he said.

Only around 20 lawmakers were present Wednesday afternoon when the Missouri House convened for the beginning of a special legislative session focused on changing the congressional map and making it harder for voters to amend the state constitution. 
Bills were introduced and public hearings were scheduled for Thursday. 
Rep. Emanuel Cleaver promises lawsuit if Missouri Republicans gerrymander his district

Democrats were quick to point out a quorum of 82 members is required by the constitution for the House to conduct business. And although historically the chamber has utilized “technical sessions” for routine business when a quorum is not present, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune said “that doesn’t make it legal or right.”
“The stakes are too high in this special session to allow this illegal practice to continue unchallenged,” said Aune, a Kansas City Democrat. 
Mid-decade redistricting is rare. In Missouri, it hasn’t happened since the 1960s. 
But President Donald Trump, facing a potentially difficult midterm election cycle next year, has demanded GOP-controlled states redraw maps to add more Republican seats.
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe answered the call last week, ordering the legislature back into session to carve up one of the state’s two districts held by a Democrat.
The goal is to ensure seven of Missouri’s eight congressional districts are controlled by Republicans. In the crosshairs is the 5th District, based in Kansas City and currently held by 11-term U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. 
While eliminating a Democratic congressional seat has taken center stage, Republican lawmakers are also hoping to change the initiative petition process to require a statewide majority and a majority vote in all eight of the state’s congressional districts in order to approve a constitutional amendment. 
Currently, a simple majority is all that is required. 
The redistricting plan is being shepherded through the legislative process by state Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Noel Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee. A special committee created by Speaker Jon Patterson will hold a public hearing Thursday at noon in the Missouri Capitol.
Another committee will hold a public hearing Thursday at 1 p.m. for the proposed changes to the initiative petition process. State Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican, is sponsoring the legislation which, if passed by both the House and Senate, would require voter approval next year. 
The House is expected to debate and vote on both bills early next week. The Senate is scheduled to convene Wednesday to begin its work.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota tribes and a group of tribal citizens formally petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court this week to review an appeals court decision that found they cannot sue the state of North Dakota for alleged voter discrimination.
The tribes say that the decision, if allowed to go into effect, would not only limit their representation in the North Dakota Legislature but be a detriment to racial equality across all seven states in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Private groups in these states would no longer be able to challenge state or local governments for alleged racially discriminatory voting practices. 
The tribes’ lawsuit, filed in 2022, accuses a legislative district map adopted by North Dakota lawmakers in 2021 of unlawfully diluting the power of Native American voters. The plaintiffs —  the Spirit Lake Nation, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and three tribal citizens — claim that the map caused them to lose representation in the state Legislature.
While U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in a 2023 ruling agreed with the tribes and in early 2024 put an alternate map in place, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his decision in May. The appellate court concluded that the tribes do not have standing to bring the case because a law they used to bring it, known as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, can only be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice. Section 2 makes it illegal to limit someone’s voting rights on the basis of race.
The plaintiffs have been open about their intent to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court since early July, though Tuesday’s petition makes their request official.
“The idea that we don’t have the right to advocate for ourselves and for fair voting is undemocratic and goes against the principles that our country was founded on,” Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chair Jamie Azure said in a Tuesday news release announcing the petition’s filing.
The state of North Dakota wants the 8th Circuit’s decision to stand. In previous court filings, attorneys for the state argued that private plaintiffs should not be allowed to destabilize state district maps. The state maintains that the 2021 map is not discriminatory.
The 8th Circuit is the only appellate circuit to rule that private plaintiffs cannot enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The court originally made this finding in a 2023 case, though the May decision reaffirmed and solidified the position.
The tribes argue that Congress had always intended for private citizens to be able to file lawsuits under the statute.
They also say the federal government cannot be counted on to police racial discriminatory voting practices on its own. The petition cites research that indicates the vast majority of cases brought under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act over the past several decades were filed by private groups like the tribes.
The U.S. Supreme Court has hinted that it may be interested in hearing the case in its upcoming term. In July, the justices agreed to prolong a temporary freeze on North Dakota’s legislative district map, which prevents the appellate court’s decision from taking effect.
This means that for the time being, voters in the 8th Circuit can still bring private lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It also indicates that North Dakota will likely keep Welte’s map in place for the 2026 election.
US Supreme Court to keep North Dakota district map in place until voting rights case wraps up

Background
The lawsuit concerns two voting districts in northern North Dakota — District 9 and District 15.
Before the Legislature adopted the 2021 map, District 9 followed the boundaries of Rolette County. The county includes the Turtle Mountain Reservation and in 2020 had a voting age population that was 74% Native American, according to the Tuesday petition. Richard Marcellais, former chair of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, for years represented the district in the Senate.
Redistricting happens at least every 10 years to adjust district lines following the U.S. census. In 2021, North Dakota discovered it had to change the boundaries of District 9 to meet the minimum population requirement. 
The 2021 map approved by the Legislature made District 9 bigger by adding Cavalier County and part of Towner Country. The district was also divided into two subdistricts, which each elected one representative to the House. District 9A was majority Native American and included most of Rolette County, including the Turtle Mountain Reservation. District 9B included a small portion of northern Rolette County, plus Cavalier County and most of Towner County, which made the subdistrict mostly white.
The plaintiffs argue that this made it much harder for Native voters in the district to elect leadership of their choice.
In 2022, Marcellais lost his bid for reelection, marking the first time since 1990 that there were no Native Americans serving in the Senate, the petition states. District 9 only elected one lawmaker backed by the tribes — Rep. Jayme Davis, a Turtle Mountain citizen who represented District 9A. Davis is also a Turtle Mountain citizen.
The Spirit Lake Reservation also opposed the 2021 district map. Over the objections of its leaders, it was placed in District 15, which only had a Native American voting population of about 23%, the petition states. District 15 also did not elect any candidates preferred by Native American North Dakotans in 2022, the plaintiffs argue.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation’s 2022 lawsuit argued the maps denied them proper representation and asked to be placed in the same voting district.
Welte, the North Dakota federal district judge, granted the plaintiffs’ request. His map, imposed in January 2024, places the two reservations into District 9. In the 2024 election, three Native American candidates from that district were elected to the state Legislature: Marcellais, Davis and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit. All three are Democrats.
Until 1922, North Dakota didn’t allow Native Americans to vote unless they “severed their tribal relations” and assimilated to white culture, according to the petition. The first Native American wasn’t elected to the state Legislature until 1970, it notes.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)After a dozen days in limbo, state and federal officials keep ramping up the pressure on the Trump administration to let the Revolution Wind project resume. The offshore wind project already under construction south of Rhode Island was put on hold on Aug. 22, leaving workers in the lurch and risking critical energy reliability and climate change mandates.
In a Wednesday letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Gov. Dan McKee outlined the consequences of the stop-work order, while asking for a meeting with President Donald Trump.
“The stop-work order undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability,” McKee wrote to Burgum. “This action puts hundreds of well-paid blue-collar jobs at risk by halting a project that is just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.”
More than 1,000 union workers have spent much of the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 45 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity was set to be delivered by mid-2026, and already baked into the long-term plans for meeting Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates under the state’s 2021 Act on Climate law. It is also critical to regional electrical grid reliability, especially in extreme weather events where fuel supply might be limited.
McKee spoke with Burgum on Aug. 29, with a virtual meeting among staff members for both officials earlier Wednesday, Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email.
His request for a meeting with Trump comes a day before a federal court hearing in Massachusetts, where a group of 18 state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, are seeking to bar the Trump administration from blocking offshore wind projects more broadly. When the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts in May, the Revolution Wind project did not appear in jeopardy, having already secured all of its federal and state approvals and been under construction for 18 months. Trump’s initial executive orders regarding offshore wind appeared to only affect projects still in need of federal approvals.
But that same executive order was invoked by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in its Aug. 22 letter, ordering Danish developer Orsted to stop work on the Revolution Wind project due to national security concerns, along with environmental risks. The order left a dozen millwrights temporarily idled aboard the Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound, where they were working on the construction of turbines.

Millwrights return to shore
The turbine installation vessel has since returned to shore in New London, but the workers are still on board, waiting to hear if they can head back out before their four-week shift ends on Sept. 10, said Andy Benedetto, president of the Millwrights Local 1121. 
“They’re just staying on the boat so they’re ready,” Benedetto said in an interview Wednesday. “This was unplanned.”
Benedetto lamented the waste of training and jobs for local workers. Among the dozen laborers aboard the docked installation vessel is a mother-son apprentice duo, whose family depends on their incomes from the continued work, Benedetto said.
“These people are people, and it’s jobs and they were excited about this work continuing,” Benedetto said. “They had work lined up for the next couple years basically and it’s being taken away from them.”
In addition to an estimated 1,200 direct construction jobs, the project was projected to create “dozens” of long-term maintenance and operation positions filled by local union workers, according to Orsted.
Another two dozen laborers with other local unions were set to head to sea for a rotation beginning Aug. 28, but were still waiting for the call on land as of Tuesday, according to Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. If their offshore shifts get delayed much longer, they may have to file for unemployment, depending on terms of individual contracts, Hammond said.
Democratic U.S. Reps. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island and Nikki Budzinksi of Illinois, who co-lead the Congressional Labor Caucus’ Building Trades Task Force, called on Burgum to lift the stop-work order in a joint statement Tuesday.
“Along with other clean energy projects the Administration has halted, this is yet another attack on construction workers. Secretary Burgum needs to lift the order and allow these hardworking men and women back to finish the job, provide for their families, and help achieve American energy independence,” they said.
Orsted has also pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company  is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, with an “extraordinary general meeting” Friday to secure board approval for its share sale.
Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Wednesday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind, scheduled for a 2:30 p.m. court hearing Thursday in Boston before U.S. District Judge William Young.

(Scott Bauer/Agriculture Research Service, USDA)Avian flu has hit turkey farms in North Dakota and South Dakota, the first cases in commercial flocks in the United States since early July. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service on Aug. 28 confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Faulk County in northeast South Dakota. The outbreak meant 55,400 birds were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.
It is the first case in a U.S. commercial flock since July 2, when the avian flu was confirmed at a game bird facility in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. 
The North Dakota Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that bird flu had been confirmed Saturday at a turkey farm in Dickey County, near the South Dakota state line. 
“After a quiet summer, it’s not unexpected that we have another case of HPAI as birds are gathering to begin the fall migration,” North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said in a news release. 
Dr. Ethan Andress, state veterinarian in North Dakota, said 60,000 birds had to be destroyed in Dickey County. 
Andress said that because large flocks of waterfowl, such as snow geese, are not yet migrating south over the Dakotas, it may be an indication that the virus was spread from local waterfowl. 
Avian influenza exists in many wild birds and can be transmitted by contact with infected birds or through infected food and water.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the public health risk is low but notes that avian flu also has spread to dairy cattle and humans with one human death.
In August, the avian flu also was confirmed at a live-bird market in Los Angeles County, California, and in backyard birds in St. Lawrence County, New York, according to the USDA.
The poultry industry has been combating different strains of avian influenza since 2020, according to the CDC.

New Mexico is one of three states implementing laws to restrict the use of PFAS — often called ‘forever chemicals’ — that can be found in a wide array of consumer goods and firefighting foam. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images)New Mexico will soon release an initial draft of rules to ban consumer products that contain so-called “forever chemicals,” the state’s top environment official told lawmakers Tuesday.
Earlier this year, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed House Bill 212, passed by lawmakers to institute the gradual phasing out of intentionally added per-and-polyfluouroalkyl substances in everyday items.
Lawmakers also passed a second bill, House Bill 140, to allow the New Mexico Environment Department to regulate and manage cleanup for firefighting foams containing PFAS on military bases, which have caused contamination in groundwater around the state.
“Both of these laws work together to keep PFAS out of our economy, out of our drinking water and out of people’s bodies,” Environmental Secretary James Kenney told lawmakers during an interim Radioactive Materials and Hazardous Waste interim committee meeting.
New Mexico is the third state to enshrine a ban in state laws to address the use of PFAS in consumer products, joining Maine and Minnesota. This class of manmade chemicals is often used in waterproofing and is able to withstand breaking down in water, oil and sunlight. As a result, PFAS can be found across a range of products, including cookware, takeout containers, dental floss, cleaning supplies, cosmetics, menstrual products, textiles and upholstered furniture.
But exposure through contaminated water and soil, as well as through the plants and animals, cause PFAS to build up in the human body. While still being studied, PFAS exposure is linked to increased cancer risks, fertility issues, low birth weights or fetal development issues, hormonal imbalances and limiting vaccine effectiveness.
The initial rules will be released sometime in September; require a public input process; and approval from the seven-member Environmental Improvement Board.
Once approved —potentially next summer —  the PFAS ban would roll out in phases, starting with cookware, food packaging, firefighting foams, dental floss and “juvenile products,” by January 2027. Additional items would follow, such as cosmetics, period hygiene products, textiles, carpeting, furniture and ski wax. The rules will include exceptions for PFAS used in products such as: medical devices, pharmaceuticals, electronics and cars.
Kenney said the rules will contain instructions requiring manufacturers to label products containing PFAS; establish a process for companies to receive an exemption if needed; and develop fines for companies violating the ban.
The department will also soon be releasing its draft rules on regulating firefighting foams containing PFAS, expected to receive final approval in the fall 2026. Those rules, Kenney said, will help environment officials develop a statewide inventory of the foams and determine how to characterize, treat and ultimately dispose of them.
Kenney  highlighted the recent report issued by the department finding the “fingerprint” of firefighting foam PFAS in people’s blood in Clovis, surrounding Cannon Air Force Base.
‘Forever chemicals’ detected in Clovis-area blood tests, New Mexico environmental officials say

As a result of those findings, Kenney said the department is working to spend $2 million lawmakers set aside in capital outlay to move people off of private wells and onto public drinking water systems.
Furthermore, the department plans to conduct additional testing around Holloman Air Force Base and push for cleanup as multiple federal lawsuits between New Mexico and the military remain in the courts. 
“We are going to continue to be in a groundwater war and a public health war with the Department of Defense,” Kenney said.
Sen. Ant Thorton (R-East Mountains) asked what the minimum level of exposure is safe for PFAS and what the state considered realistic.
Kenney said that he couldn’t provide an exact number “since I’m not a toxicologist,” but instead compared PFAS contamination in drinking water systems in two locations with known exposure: Curry County, near the base, and La Cieneguilla, which has detected contamination from the Santa Fe Regional Airport. 
Curry County, he said, has higher risks of exposure, as its drinking water has PFAS levels 650,000% higher than federal standards. While “not negating” La Cieneguilla’s concerns, he said, levels for that community are “much closer” to the federal standard.
“We need to figure out where the greatest risk is occurring and minimize it from there,” Kenney said. “I think many people would say there’s no acceptable risk level for PFAS, I’m a little bit more pragmatic — it’s a forever chemical. It’s going to be hard to get out of the environment, and our risk is always going to be something greater than zero.”

Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, two current Mississippi Supreme Court justices, testified at the Senate confirmation hearing about their nominations by President Donald Trump to lifetime judicial slots in northern Mississippi. 
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the committee’s chairman, said the slate of nominees that appeared before the committee was full of “highly qualified men and women who understand the importance of judicial independence in our constitutional design.” 
But senators from both parties still questioned the two men about their judicial records and how they would approach the job of ruling in civil disputes and overseeing criminal trials.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the committee, asked Maxwell to justify the majority opinion he wrote in Nash v. State of Mississippi. In this case, the state Supreme Court upheld a lower-court judge’s sentencing of a man to serve 12 years in jail for possessing a cell phone in a correctional facility. 
Maxwell responded that the lengthy sentence may have been harsh, but his role wasn’t to impose a personal sentence on the defendant. 
“Our role as the Mississippi Supreme Court is to determine if that was a lawful sentence as set by the parameters of our state Legislature,” Maxwell responded. 
The nominees also stated at the hearing that they believed Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled separate but equal segregation unconstitutional, and Loving v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared state bans on interracial marriage unconstitutional, were correct decisions. 
However, Chamberlin did not answer a similar question from Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut about whether he thought the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges recognizing a right for same sex couples to marry was a correct ruling.
“It is the better practice not to comment on the wisdom of these decisions,” Chamberlin said. 

Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Robert Chamberlin Credit: Special to Mississippi Today
Both of Mississippi’s Republican senators, Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith, spoke in support of the two nominees at the hearing. Wicker said that Chamberlin was “a rock-solid choice,” while Hyde-Smith stated she had complete confidence in Maxwell’s “qualifications, character and commitment to justice.”
Maxwell earned his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Mississippi. Former Gov. Haley Barbour in February of 2009 appointed Maxwell to the state Court of Appeals. 
Maxwell was elected to the post in 2010 and reelected in 2014. 
Former Gov. Phil Bryant appointed him to the state Supreme Court in January 2016. He was later elected to an eight-year term in November of 2016 and reelected in 2024.
Maxwell said his prior experience as a federal prosecutor and growing up with an attorney for a father helped make him qualified to become a federal judge. 
Chamberlin earned his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Mississippi. He first served as a state circuit court judge for 12 years in the 17th Circuit District. In 2016, he was elected to an open seat on the state Supreme Court and reelected in 2024. 
Before becoming a judge, Chamberlin was a member of the state Senate for five years, representing DeSoto County. 
Chamberlin, at the hearing, said his role as a state circuit court judge has prepared him to preside over a federal courtroom because he’s previously had to “run a docket” in a state court. 
Chamberlin and Maxwell will replace U.S. District Judges Michael Mills and Sharion Aycock, both of whom decided to take senior status in recent years. 
It’s unclear when the committee will vote on the two nominees, but Republican U.S. Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama said at the hearing that members of the Judicial Committee can submit written questions to the nominees until Sept. 10.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06101033/HB-1020-appeal6.jpg,,,2025-09-03 15:58:20.998100

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

A circuit court judge’s ruling Wednesday prevents the state Election Commission from providing the requested voter registration data ahead of a hearing next week.
The order follows a lawsuit, filed last Friday in Calhoun County, that seeks to prevent South Carolina from providing voters’ information to the U.S. Department of Justice.
The federal agency’s letter, dated Aug. 6, was part of a nationwide push by the Trump administration to get voter rolls from all states. It set a deadline of this Friday and seeks information that includes full names, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers. How, exactly, that information will be used is unclear.

PIImageDisplay (2)-7-8 
Some states declined straight away, citing voters’ privacy.
South Carolina’s Election Commission staff started working last week to fulfill the administration’s request for the information, agency spokesman John Michael Catalano said in an email.
The lawsuit filed on behalf of Calhoun County voter Anne Crook argues divulging her personal information is an invasion of her privacy.
The state constitution guarantees residents a right to privacy, and state law prohibits divulging certain personal information, wrote her attorney, Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, in the court filing.
State law also requires the Election Commission keep all personal information confidential, wrote the Orangeburg Democrat.
Hutto’s concern over the federal government getting people’s private information grew after a whistleblower claimed last month the Department of Government Efficiency put millions of people’s Social Security numbers at risk of hacking, Hutto told the SC Daily Gazette.
A similar lapse with other personal information, such as driver’s license numbers, could open people up to identity theft and other crimes, he said.
Crook, a former president of Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, had concerns over how that data might be used that other residents shared, Hutto said.
“I think most people have some questions about why the federal government wants their data,” Hutto said.
Judge Diane Goodstein’s order may bring some answers.
Releasing a voter’s personal information could cause “immediate and irreparable damage” in violating her right to privacy, wrote the 1st Circuit Court judge in putting any transfer of information on hold.
State law shouldn’t keep states from releasing voter information, reads the U.S. Department of Justice letter, along with a follow-up letter sent just over a week later. The letter cites federal voter registration laws that the attorney general is tasked with enforcing, claiming those laws give the department the right to access voter data.
Goodstein set a hearing for Sept. 10 in Aiken to hear arguments over whether she should keep the block in place.
Until then, the Election Commission “will continue to coordinate with the DOJ to explore lawful options for data sharing while adhering to the court’s order,” Catalano said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/I-Voted-Sticker-scaled-e1726250561576-1024x834.jpg,,,2025-09-03 15:58:20.998100

Schoolchildren, college students, and even nursing home residents would no longer have to be vaccinated against infectious diseases and viruses if Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his boss, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, have their way.
The DeSantis administration rolled out the proposed change on Wednesday and, if it is successful, the state would be the first in the nation to completely eliminate vaccine requirements that many health experts credit with nearly eliminating some diseases.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” said Ladapo, attacking the government mandates.
“It’s wrong, it’s immoral. They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
’Choose a side’
Neither Ladapo nor DeSantis discussed with legislative leadership their intent in the 2026 legislative session to push to eliminate vaccine mandates from the books before Wednesday’s announcement.
The surgeon general praised the Legislature and went so far as saying he “loves our lawmakers.” But Ladapo issued an ultimatum.
“They’re going to have to make decisions, right? That’s the way that this becomes possible. So, people are going to have to make a decision. People are going to have to, have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that you know the moral side is, it’s so simple.”
Patients would remain free to take shots if they like.
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Democratic officials quickly blasted the announcement, deeming it a “reckless” decision that could lead to a drop in those immunized in the state. Florida has already seen its immunization rate for school-aged children tick down in recent years, although more than three-quarters of school children have received shots.
“This is ridiculous. Florida already has broad medical and religious exemptions for childhood vaccines, so any family that has a sincere opposition to vaccination can opt-out. Removing the mandate wholesale is dangerous, anti-science, and anti-child. Nobody wants to go back to the days of iron lungs,” Senate Democratic leader Sen. Lori Berman, from Boynton Beach, said in a statement.
“Republicans have gone from entertaining anti-science conspiracy theories to fully endorsing an anti-science health policy. As a member of the Senate Health Policy Committee, I’ll be doing everything in my power to protect our kids from these reckless attempts to harm them.”
Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat from Miami Gardens, also criticized the announcement.
“Ending vaccine mandates poses a grave public health risk and will likely lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases. This reckless move jeopardizes the health and lives of countless Floridians — from children to seniors — especially those too young to be vaccinated or those with compromised immune systems. The DeSantis administration is actively undermining public health, making communities more vulnerable to outbreaks and increasing the burden on healthcare systems.”
Florida law contains a number of immunization requirements for the young and the old.
Immunization for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus are required for entry and attendance in Florida schools, childcare facilities, and family daycare homes. The state allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems and, in some cases, allows personal exemptions for philosophical beliefs.
Florida law also requires school districts to develop and disseminate parent guides that include information about the importance of student health and available immunizations and vaccinations, including, but not limited to, recommended immunization schedules in accordance with federal recommendations.
The school guide must include detailed information regarding the causes, symptoms, and transmission of meningococcal disease and the availability, effectiveness, known contraindications, and appropriate age for the administration of any required or recommended vaccine against that infection.
College students who reside in on-campus housing must provide documentation of vaccinations against meningococcal meningitis and hepatitis B. Again, the law contains exemptions and students who refuse the vaccines are required to sign waivers.
Nursing homes are required to assess residents within five business days post admission of eligibility for pneumococcal vaccinations or revaccinations. If indicated, the resident must be be vaccinated or revaccinated within 60 days after admission, in accordance with the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, subject to exemptions for medical contraindications and religious or personal beliefs.
Immunization may not be provided to a resident who provides documentation that he or she has been immunized. A resident may elect to receive the immunization from his or her personal physician and, if so, the resident needs to provide proof of the immunization to the facility. The agency may adopt and enforce any rules necessary to comply.
2025 efforts fall short
The 2026 legislative session begins in January, which is when the DeSantis administration will  work with the Legislature in hopes of accomplishing its goal. But the Department of Health will also revise rules for a handful of vaccines that are mandated in rule but not in statue.
A substantially scaled-back effort to address vaccine mandates fell short during the 2025 session.
The DOH this spring championed a broad bill (HB 1299) continuing a law initially passed in 2021 that banned businesses, government entities, and education institutions from denying people entry or service based on vaccination status or requiring people to wear masks. HB 1299 extended the ban permanently.
The bill expanded the Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities statutes to prohibit providers and facilities from denying admission, care, or services to a patient based solely on vaccination status.
Although the House agreed to the language, passing HB 1299 by a near-unanimous vote, state Sen. Gayle Harrell, whose late husband was a physician, warned that the requirement would open doctors to increased liability. Independent Sen. Jason Pizzo said the mandate to treat patients would have contradicted a law DeSantis championed that guarantees Florida physicians legal protections to not treat patients on the basis of their conscience.
The Senate deleted the language before passing the proposal and the House ultimately agreed to the Senate’s version.
Ladapo the lightning rod
Ladapo is a well known vaccine skeptic. He emphasized parents’ rights to send their kids to school unvaccinated in spring after a measles case in a Miami-Dade County high school. He altered a DOH Covid vaccine study to exaggerate the risks of cardiac death for young men
His positions on vaccinations aren’t the only reason he’s become a public health lightning rod.
The DOH last month announced 21 cases of Campylobacter and E. coli infections tied to raw milk consumption in the central and northeast portions of the state, and said that seven people had been hospitalized. Six of the cases were reported in children under age 10. Nevertheless, Ladapo didn’t warn against consuming raw milk.
Two days later, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson issued a statement encouraging residents to stick to pasteurized milk.
And in 2021, Ladapo made national headlines when he refused to don a mask during a meeting with state Sen. Tina Polsky, who was being treated for cancer and requested that he wear one. At the time, Ladapo was up for Senate confirmation.
Polksky, a Democrat from Boca Raton, also lambasted Ladapo’s announcement Wednesday.
“Vaccines are crucial for our children because they protect them from deadly diseases and keep entire communities safe through herd immunity. Diseases, including polio, that once destroyed our children’s health and futures, will have the chance to return under this dangerous policy change. I voted against Dr. Ladapo’s confirmation in 2023 because he has a habit of misrepresenting science and making decisions that affect the health of Floridians. He remains determined to prioritize political dogma over smart health decisions.”
Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission
Ladapo’s announcement dovetails with DeSantis’ news that he has created a Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission that will recommend the integration of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again effort. The Florida Commission will be co-chaired by  first lady Casey DeSantis and Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)The owner of a Twin Cities roofing company faces felony charges after investigators said he stole an estimated $118,000 in wages from seven workers who replaced roofs and gutters at a public housing project in St. Paul.
Jose Manuel Herrera, 71, the principal owner of Bayvista, was charged on Wednesday in Ramsey County with two felony counts of wage theft and six felony counts of tax evasion and insurance fraud. His wife and son, Carrie Jane Gutbrod-Herrera, 66, and Joseph Earl Herrera, 41, were also charged with felony tax evasion as part owners in the contracting business.
The case is one of the first in Minnesota to use the state’s 2019 wage theft law that made it a felony to steal more than $1,000 in wages, like other forms of theft.
While labor experts and law enforcement say wage theft is pervasive, it is seldom prosecuted. That’s starting to change in Minnesota as trade unions, state agencies and law enforcement invest more resources in investigating and prosecuting labor violations.
“This will not be the last case. We have many many more that are in the pipeline,” Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said Wednesday at a news conference.
He credited the coordinated effort with the St. Paul Police Department, the state Department of Revenue and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
According to the criminal complaint, Jose Herrera’s company was hired in 2024 by Magnuson Construction to supply workers to replace the roofing and gutters at McDonough Homes, 580-townhome style affordable apartments run by the St. Paul Public Housing Agency.
The contract was worth over $500,000 and because the renovations were publicly funded, the Herreras were required to pay minimum prevailing wages set by the state.
Roofers were entitled to $68.54 per hour in wages and benefits and the gutter replacement workers were entitled to $83.74 per hour. But workers were only paid between $120 to $200 per day, in cash, according to the criminal complaint.
Jose Herrera knew what workers were supposed to earn because he instructed them to tell anyone who asked that they were being paid the prevailing wage and to not mention the daily rate, according to the complaint.
The Reformer called phone numbers listed for the Herreras but could not reach them.
While the complaint alleges wage theft from just seven workers, Choi said the investigation is ongoing and he believes at least two dozen workers were shorted upwards of $250,000 in wages.
In addition to stealing from workers, the complaint alleges the Herreras shorted the government by underreporting their incomes and the number of their employees in order to pay lower income taxes, unemployment contributions and workers’ compensation insurance premiums.
Jose Herrera avoided paying more than $135,000 in workers’ compensation insurance premiums and $1,000 in unemployment insurance contributions, according to the complaint.
He and his wife also failed to pay an estimated $158,509 in 2024 in Minnesota income taxes from dozens of construction contracts with Bayvista’s estimated gross revenue of $4.8 million that year. Joseph Herrera failed to pay an estimated $55,764 in state income taxes, according to the criminal complaint.
Furthermore, by paying workers in cash and not withholding income taxes for workers, Bayvista shorted state coffers more than $26,000.
St. Paul police opened an investigation after receiving reports from representatives from the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters, who had talked to workers on the project, about possible wage theft and unsafe practices with workers not using safety harnesses.
Trade unions have played an instrumental role in nearly every major wage theft case in the state by monitoring job sites and helping workers file complaints with law enforcement and state regulators.
The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades union helped workers come forward in Minneapolis leading to the very first conviction of felony wage theft in Minnesota this summer. And the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers assisted Choi’s office in bringing a case against Stillwater Masonry Restoration with the owner pleading guilty to felony tax evasion.
“Some people think that (trade unions) are just looking out for their membership. They are not. They are looking out for what’s fair and what’s right out in our community,” St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry said.
Mike Wilde, executive director of the Fair Contracting Foundation of Minnesota, said the case against the Herreras illustrates “garden variety” wage theft with a contractor using cash payments to conceal underpayments and reduce their tax and insurance liabilities.
While the practice may be common, it is also hard to prosecute because it requires workers to participate as witnesses.
That may become even harder under the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement since many victims of wage theft in construction are in the country without authorization. Under the Biden administration, noncitizen workers who were victims of labor violations could be protected from deportation.
“When you scare all the witnesses away because of deportation threats, then you have less cooperation,” Wilde said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P1230729-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 15:58:20.998100

A coalition of liberal groups in Colorado want to ask voters in 2026 whether higher earners in the state should pay more in income taxes to raise billions more in revenue.
The group, dubbed Protect Colorado’s Future, submitted ballot measure language Wednesday for a constitutional amendment that would raise the income tax rate for Coloradans making at least $500,000.
“A graduated income tax is just common sense: 98% of us get a tax cut, and the folks doing really well chip in a fair share to keep our schools strong, our healthcare system solid, and our communities thriving. That’s how we build a Colorado where everyone gets ahead, not just the lucky few,” Kathy White, executive director of the Colorado Fiscal Institute, said in a statement.

Colorado’s income tax is currently at 4.4%. The measure would bump that rate to 4.6% for people making at least $600,000 and increase it as people earn more, to a 9.2% rate for people making at least $10 million per year. People earning less than $250,000 per year would see a slight income tax reduction.
The proposal is what’s known as a graduated income tax rate, in which people pay a higher percentage as their income increases. Twenty-seven states and Washington D.C. use a similar system. Colorado is one of 14 states with a flat income tax.
Colorado is also subject to the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, which caps annual state spending according to inflation and population growth. Colorado can retain and spend tax revenue only up to that limit, even if it collects more and even if costs for government services balloon.










The cruel cuts to healthcare and the absurd corporate tax giveaways in the federal budget bill have pushed Colorado over the edge, and only the voters of Colorado have the power to make the wealthy pay their fair share and restore funding to critical state priorities.


– Chris deGruy Kennedy, head of Bell Policy Center


“For more than three decades, an upside-down tax code has hurt Colorado’s schools, health care, childcare and the environment,” said Chris deGruy Kennedy, head of the left-leaning Bell Policy Center. “The cruel cuts to healthcare and the absurd corporate tax giveaways in the federal budget bill have pushed Colorado over the edge, and only the voters of Colorado have the power to make the wealthy pay their fair share and restore funding to critical state priorities.”
The recent federal spending cut and tax break bill slashed Colorado’s expected tax revenue for the current fiscal year by about $1.2 billion and will increase the state’s financial obligation for Medicaid and nutrition assistance programs in future years.
The groups behind the proposal include the Bell Policy Center, the Colorado Fiscal Institute, the Colorado Children’s Campaign, the Colorado Center on Law and Policy, New Era Colorado, Great Education Colorado, the Colorado Statewide Parents Coalition, the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, the Blueprint to End Hunger, Colorado Counties and Commissioners Acting Together, the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, and the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights.
To place the constitutional amendment on the ballot, the coalition would need to get at least 125,000 petition signatures, including from at least 2% of the voters in each of the state’s 35 state Senate districts.
Conservative activists are pursuing other ballot measures that would cut the income tax rate across the board. Voters approved rate cuts in 2020 and 2022.

Chuck Grassley said he plans to follow up with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the Thursday Senate Finance Committee hearing about his commitments to issues like regulating pharmacy benefit managers, improving rural health care systems and oversight of agriculture and dietary guidelines.
When Kennedy faced questions from senators on the committee during the confirmation process in January, Grassley presented him a list of statements on what he expects from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These included calling for Kennedy to “leave agricultural practice regulations to the proper agencies,” provide timely and complete information when responding to congressional oversight requests and work to lower drug prices through measures targeting business practices of PBMs, the entities that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and health insurance companies.
Grassley presented his expectations to Kennedy and asked him if he agreed or disagreed with the statements — all of which Kennedy said he agreed with in January.

During a call with reporters Tuesday, Grassley said he plans to follow up on these expectations at the hearing.
“Now he’s been in office for five or six months, I’m thinking that maybe I ought to go back and say, ‘this is what you told me in January or February, whenever it was — do you still think you told me the right thing?’ And, ‘are you doing what you told me you would do?'” Grassley said.
The Iowa Republican also said there are many other issues he hopes to hear about from Kennedy at the hearing tomorrow, saying “he still has some attitudes about agriculture that I’m interested in getting further readout.”
Kennedy’s appearance before the Senate Finance Committee Thursday follows major leadership changes in the federal government’s public health centers. President Donald Trump fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez in late August, and several other high-level CDC officials resigned shortly after. As HHS secretary, Kennedy is involved in overseeing the CDC.
Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress have called for answers and investigations into the HHS and related public health entities following the shake-up, and have also brought up concerns about the administration’s current approach to subjects like vaccinations. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, who chairs the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said last week “high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.” He also called for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to indefinitely postpone its September meeting as “serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting.”
According to the Des Moines Register, Grassley told reporters Aug. 29 he believes decisions made by public health officials and scientists on vaccines “should not be a political determination.”
“He’s got some changes he wants to make in vaccines,” Grassley said at an Indianola event. “I don’t think it’s quite fair to say he’s anti-vaccine, but he’s got some changes he wants to make. I think we need more direction where he’s headed for.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Almost 12% of Utahns are enrolled into the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplace, a platform established in 2010. That’s the fourth highest number in the country.
The percentage represents about 421,900 Utah enrollees. According to a Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute study, that’s higher than the state’s Medicaid enrollment rate, which accounted for 9.7% of Utahns as of February 2025. 
HealthCare.gov is a platform run by federal or state governments that helps families, small business owners, their employees, and self-employed workers without access to Medicaid or Medicare compare and select health insurance plans.

“The Marketplace and the accompanying tax credits help make health insurance coverage affordable for Utahns who do not have access to health insurance coverage through work or public health care coverage programs,” Melanie Beagley, senior health research analyst at the Gardner Institute said in a news release. “These include small business owners, their employees, and self-employed workers.”
About 710,000 Utahns work at small businesses, which aren’t mandated to provide health insurance coverage to employees. Only 40.8% of them have access to insurance through their employers, analysts wrote. That’s the sixth lowest in the nation. 
The federal government funds up to approximately $1.7 billion in premium tax credits for the state, the study estimated. With a monthly average tax credit of $463, the monthly average marketplace plan premium for Utah residents is $70.



Let us know what you think...


 


However, premium subsidies that were increased in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan Act for every income level, including those making below 200% the poverty level, and were extended in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are set to disappear at the end of this year without another extension.
That would have a deep impact on most enrollees, as almost 63% of Affordable Care Act Marketplace enrollees have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level, which this year is roughly $31,300 per year for individuals and about $64,200 for a family of four. 
The largest chunk in Utah are children under 18 years old, representing about 28% of the whole population that uses the platform.

(Stock photo by Getty Images)School children, college students, and even nursing home residents would no longer have to be vaccinated against infectious diseases and viruses if Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his boss, Gov. Ron DeSantis, have their way.
The DeSantis administration rolled out the proposed change on Wednesday and, if they’re successful, the state would be the first in the nation to completely eliminate vaccine requirements that many health experts credit with nearly eliminating some diseases.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” said Ladapo, attacking the government mandates.
“It’s wrong, it’s immoral. They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
’Choose a side’
Neither Ladapo nor DeSantis discussed with legislative leadership their intent in the 2026 legislative session to push to eliminate vaccine mandates from the books before making the announcement.
The surgeon general praised the Legislature and went so far as saying he “loves our lawmakers.” But Ladapo issued an ultimatum.
“They’re going to have to make decisions, right? That’s the way that this becomes possible. So, people are going to have to make a decision. People are going to have to, have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that you know the moral side is, it’s so simple.”
Patients would remain free to take shots if they like.
Democratic officials quickly blasted the announcement, deeming it a “reckless” decision that could lead to a drop in those immunized in the state. Florida has already seen its immunization rate for school-aged children tick down in recent years, although more than three-quarters of school children have received shots.
“This is ridiculous. Florida already has broad medical and religious exemptions for childhood vaccines, so any family that has a sincere opposition to vaccination can opt-out. Removing the mandate wholesale is dangerous, anti-science, and anti-child. Nobody wants to go back to the days of iron lungs,” Senate Democratic leader Sen. Lori Berman, from Boynton Beach, said in a statement.
“Republicans have gone from entertaining anti-science conspiracy theories to fully endorsing an anti-science health policy. As a member of the Senate Health Policy Committee, I’ll be doing everything in my power to protect our kids from these reckless attempts to harm them.”
Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat from Miami Gardens, also criticized the announcement.
“Ending vaccine mandates poses a grave public health risk and will likely lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases. This reckless move jeopardizes the health and lives of countless Floridians — from children to seniors — especially those too young to be vaccinated or those with compromised immune systems. The DeSantis administration is actively undermining public health, making communities more vulnerable to outbreaks and increasing the burden on healthcare systems.”

Current requirements

Florida law contains a number of immunization requirements for the young and the old.
Immunization for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus are required for entry and attendance in Florida schools, childcare facilities, and family daycare homes. The state allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems and, in some cases, allows personal exemptions for philosophical beliefs.
Florida law also requires school districts to develop and disseminate parent guides that include information about the importance of student health and available immunizations and vaccinations, including, but not limited to, recommended immunization schedules in accordance with federal recommendations. 
The school guide must include detailed information regarding the causes, symptoms, and transmission of meningococcal disease and the availability, effectiveness, known contraindications, and appropriate age for the administration of any required or recommended vaccine against that infection.
The Florida Education Association issued a statement warning that changing the rules would endanger students and faculty.
“When leaders talk about pulling back vaccines, they’re talking about disrupting student learning and making schools less safe. State leaders say they care about reducing chronic absenteeism and keeping kids in school — but reducing vaccinations does the opposite, putting our children’s health and education at risk,” the union said.
“We’re reviewing the potential impacts on public schools and our communities. But, make no mistake, FEA will continue to stand up for our students, our educators, and our public schools.”
College students who reside in on-campus housing must provide documentation of vaccinations against meningococcal meningitis and hepatitis B. Again, the law contains exemptions and students who refuse the vaccines are required to sign waivers.
Nursing homes are required to assess residents within five business days post admission of eligibility for pneumococcal vaccinations or revaccinations. If indicated, the resident must be be vaccinated or revaccinated within 60 days after admission, in accordance with the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, subject to exemptions for medical contraindications and religious or personal beliefs.
Immunization may not be provided to a resident who provides documentation that he or she has been immunized. A resident may elect to receive the immunization from his or her personal physician and, if so, the resident needs to provide proof of the immunization to the facility. The agency may adopt and enforce any rules necessary to comply.
2025 efforts fall short
Sen. Gayle Harrell (Photo via the Florida Senate.)
The 2026 legislative session begins in January, which is when the DeSantis administration will work with the Legislature in hopes of accomplishing its goal. But the Department of Health will also revise rules for a handful of vaccines that are mandated in rule but not in statue.
A substantially scaled-back effort to address vaccine mandates fell short during the 2025 session.
The DOH this spring championed a broad bill (HB 1299) continuing a law initially passed in 2021 that banned businesses, government entities, and education institutions from denying people entry or service based on vaccination status or requiring people to wear masks. HB 1299 extended the ban permanently.
The bill expanded the Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities statutes to prohibit providers and facilities from denying admission, care, or services to a patient based solely on vaccination status. 
Although the House agreed to the language, passing HB 1299 by a near-unanimous vote, state Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Republican from Stuart whose late husband was a physician, warned that the requirement would open doctors to increased liability. Sen. Jason Pizzo, a Hollywood lawmaker with no party affiliation, said the mandate to treat patients would have contradicted a law DeSantis championed that guarantees Florida physicians legal protections to not treat patients on the basis of their conscience.
The Senate deleted the language before passing the proposal and the House ultimately agreed to the Senate’s version.
Ladapo the lightning rod
Ladapo is a well known vaccine skeptic. He emphasized parents’ rights to send their kids to school unvaccinated in spring after a measles case in a Miami-Dade County high school. He altered a DOH COVID-19 vaccine study to exaggerate the risks of cardiac death for young men
His positions on vaccinations aren’t the only reason he’s become a public health lightning rod.
The DOH last month announced 21 cases of Campylobacter and E. coli infections tied to raw milk consumption in the central and northeast portions of the state, and said that seven people had been hospitalized. Six of the cases were reported in children under age 10. Nevertheless, Ladapo didn’t warn against consuming raw milk.
Two days later, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson issued a statement encouraging residents to stick to pasteurized milk.
And in 2021, Ladapo made national headlines when he refused to don a mask during a meeting with state Sen. Tina Polsky, who was being treated for cancer and requested that he wear one. At the time, Ladapo was up for Senate confirmation.
Polksky, a Democrat from Boca Raton, lambasted Ladapo’s announcement Wednesday.
“Vaccines are crucial for our children because they protect them from deadly diseases and keep entire communities safe through herd immunity,” she said in a written statement.
Diseases, including polio, that once destroyed our children’s health and futures, will have the chance to return under this dangerous policy change. I voted against Dr. Ladapo’s confirmation in 2023 because he has a habit of misrepresenting science and making decisions that affect the health of Floridians. He remains determined to prioritize political dogma over smart health decisions.”
Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission
Ladapo’s announcement dovetails with DeSantis’ news that he has created a Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission that will recommend the integration of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again effort. The Florida Commission will be co-chaired by  first lady Casey DeSantis and Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.
Meanwhile, at the end of August, the Food and Drug Administration approved updated vaccines for COVID-19.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Cuts to public health and homelessness services that rely on Medicaid. Increased strain on food banks. Fewer housing vouchers for low-income renters. The risk of a “massive loss” in funding for roads and bridges.
Those are just some of the impacts that officials at the local level in Colorado are left to deal with in the wake of congressional Republicans’ passage of a domestic policy megabill earlier this year, advocates said at a press conference outside Denver’s City and County Building on Wednesday.
The GOP’s tax break and spending bill cut an estimated $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, health insurance subsidies, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other areas of federal social spending. At the same time, it enacted more than $5 trillion in tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthiest Americans, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Colorado lawmakers convened at the state Capitol last month for a six-day special legislative session to address the bill’s impacts to the state budget, which were triggered because the state’s income tax code automatically mirrors changes at the federal level. They passed legislation that repealed certain tax credits and loopholes for Colorado businesses, tapped into the state’s reserve funds and gave Gov. Jared Polis special authority to make about $250 million in midyear spending cuts, primarily to health care, higher education and state grant programs.
Wynn Howell, Colorado state director of the Working Families Party​, blamed the megabill for the shortfall it created in the state budget, which Polis’ office estimated to be $783 million​. “But there’s not been enough conversation about how this is impacting local communities, because it certainly is doing that too​,” Howell said.
Denver’s two at-large City Council members, Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez and Sarah Parady, spoke about the fallout for Denver’s economic well-being and the city budget, which already faced a $250 million shortfall this year driven by rising costs and sluggish growth in sales tax revenues.
“If you were to ask either one of us or anyone who we work with in this building, what keeps us up at night, we would begin racking off a list for you of expenses and costs, and (the question of) how we’re going to keep this city safe, secure, fed, sheltered, housed, given the impacts of this federal bill,” Parady said. “It is probably the number one thing weighing on me as a member of this council.”










If you are a member of Congress and you supported this bill, then I'm going to tell you — you have no clue what regular Americans, regular Coloradans, regular Denverites are facing. You have no clue.


– Sarah Parady, Denver City Council at-large member


State lawmakers wrote in a letter earlier this year that Colorado’s hospitals, clinics and other providers could lose up to $990 million in annual federal Medicaid funding. Those impacts could be particularly acute in Denver, where most major medical providers serve patients who are enrolled in Medicaid, Parady said, as the GOP bill’s work requirements and other restrictions on Medicaid eligibility go into effect.
“Anyone who’s doing a lot of their services to people who are living in poverty, they are going to now have this huge bureaucratic burden of basically trying to help people stay enrolled, re-enroll, or meet particular requirements and jump through particular hoops,” she said. “Otherwise they lose what is effectively a huge portion of their budget in Medicaid reimbursements.”
The Republican measure also included an estimated $186 billion in cuts to SNAP funding, largely through new eligibility restrictions and by shifting costs onto states. Colorado lawmakers will ask voters this November to partially offset the lost SNAP funding with excess revenue from a universal school meals program, but food assistance providers across Colorado are bracing for the potential impacts of increased demand.
“People will wonder, why are they relying more on food banks and food access programs, leaving millions upon millions of children and families to go hungry?” Gonzales-Gutierrez said. “Because of the cuts to SNAP.”
“If you are a member of Congress and you supported this bill, then I’m going to tell you — you have no clue what regular Americans, regular Coloradans, regular Denverites are facing. You have no clue,” Parady said. “This bill is delusional. It is a wave of harm that is coming for our cities, and we are trying to hold the bag with a tax base that cannot possibly meet what we are losing.”

(City of Las Vegas photo)The Las Vegas City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to appoint a replacement for Victoria Seaman, who resigned from the position last week to become a regional director in Denver for President Donald Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services. 
The council rejected the prospect of holding a special election, which is projected to cost $467,000, according to city officials. 
The council is seeking applicants interested in temporarily representing Ward 2. The application, which is posted on the city website, includes a pledge from the applicant that they will not run for election to the council next year. 
“There’s nothing that we can do to enforce that. Is that correct?” Councilwoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong inquired of the city attorney, who agreed the appointed councilmember could not legally be prohibited from running. 
“While it’s not legally binding, it’s very important, from my perspective, that this council not engage in any electioneering or trying to give one candidate an advantage over another,” Councilwoman Francis Allen Palenske responded. 
Appointed council members are historically at an advantage in subsequent elections. 
In 2004, newly appointed Las Vegas City Councilman Steve Wolfson faced 11 challengers in the city’s general election, but prevailed and went on to win another two elections to the seat.  
The city intends to advertise the council opening on its website today through 5 p.m. Friday. 
Applicants must live in Ward 2, which encompasses much of Summerlin. 
The mayor and council will individually review the applications and resumes and submit their top three in ranking order to Human Resources by Sept. 7, according to Human Resources Director Vince Zamora. Based on the council rankings, HR will forward the top three finalists for discussion at the Sept. 17 City Council meeting.

Bill Lee’s office announced Wednesday.
Deputy Commissioner Andy Holt, a former Tennessee House representative, will take the reins on Oct. 1.
Hatcher, a veterinarian and fifth-generation Tennessee farmer, was among Lee’s first cabinet picks after Lee won the 2018 gubernatorial election. Hatcher was sworn in as the state’s 38th commissioner of agriculture in January 2019.
Hatcher said his time as commissioner was “the honor of my life” in a prepared statement.

“Together, we have made the largest investments in rural Tennessee’s history, expanded opportunities for young people through FFA, 4H, and education partnerships, and safeguarded farmland for future generations,” he said.
Hatcher also praised Lee’s push to preserve Tennessee farmland, most recently through the Tennessee Farmland Preservation Act. 
Tennessee’s General Assembly approved the governor-backed legislation in May, setting aside $25 million in grants for farmers who choose to place their farmland in a permanent conservation easement. The easement blocks farmland from being sold for any purpose other than agricultural use. It took two years for Lee to rally support for the act, which went into effect in July.
“I am proud to have played a role in carrying forward his vision,” Hatcher said of Lee’s farmland conservation initiative.
Prior to his appointment as commissioner, Hatcher served as the agriculture department’s state veterinarian starting in 2009.
Outside of his nearly 21 years of government service, Hatcher founded Rock-N-Country Veterinary Services in College Grove in the early 1990s. The practice is now run by his daughter Jennifer. 
The Hatcher family farm and dairy, which is now run by his son Charles, have called College Grove home since 1831.

Lee said he is “confident (Holt) will serve Tennesseans with integrity by strengthening rural communities and supporting our agriculture industry” in a Wednesday statement. 
As deputy commissioner, Holt oversaw the Tennessee Department of Agriculture’s daily operations, including programs spanning food safety, animal and plant health, forestry, and agricultural development, according to a news release from Lee’s office.
Holt, a first-generation farmer, lives with his wife Ellie and their seven children on Holt Family Farms in Dresden.
Holt’s farming operation fell under scrutiny in 2015 when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency threatened to seek $177,500 in fines from him, alleging that he improperly buried hog carcasses and dumped around 800,000 gallons of waste water into a tributary of the Mississippi River without a permit. 
Holt said at the time that he self-reported the discharges. The EPA ultimately withdrew its filing in 2016 when he agreed to enter into a consent order requiring him to close and clean up two wastewater lagoons on the property.

Dos legisladores del Inland Empire instan a las autoridades estatales a tomar medidas para salvar un hospital en Blythe.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
La primavera pasada, el Hospital Palo Verde en Blythe estuvo al borde del cierre, después de que una serie de contratiempos financieros lo dejaran sin fondos.
 En mayo, el hospital anunció que no aceptaría nuevos pacientes “en el futuro previsible”, aunque su sala de emergencias y su clínica permanecieron abiertas, informó el Riverside Record.
 LEER MÁS : Regreso al futuro: ¿Esta prisión de California volverá a convertirse en un hotel de lujo?
 Pero la financiación estatal de emergencia anunciada este verano ayudará a que el hospital rural permanezca abierto, según el senador estatal Steve Padilla, demócrata de San Diego, cuyo distrito incluye partes del Inland Empire.
“En un momento en que nuestros hospitales rurales enfrentan dificultades financieras y un posible cierre, es crucial que el estado intervenga para garantizar que todos los californianos tengan acceso a atención médica vital”, declaró Padilla . “Estos hospitales suelen ser la única fuente de atención médica para toda una comunidad. El Hospital Palo Verde es el único centro de cuidados intensivos en una area de 160 kilómetros, aproximadamente a dos horas en coche; demasiado lejos en caso de emergencia”.
Como el Hospital Palo Verde había suspendido la admisión de nuevos pacientes en mayo, el representante Raúl Ruiz, demócrata de Palm Desert, pidió al gobernador Gavin Newsom que asignara $4 millones del presupuesto estatal para mantenerlo a flote, informó el Desert Sun.
 Calificó el cierre inminente como una emergencia de salud pública que “pone vidas en riesgo y dejaría una brecha masiva en la atención médica en una de las regiones más desatendidas de nuestro estado”.
 Las agencias estatales intervinieron, pero no proporcionaron la cantidad solicitada por Ruiz. El Departamento de Servicios de Atención Médica del estado agilizó los pagos de Medi-Cal por $560,000 al Hospital Palo Verde “para apoyar las operaciones del hospital y proteger el acceso a la atención médica para la comunidad”, informó la Agencia de Salud y Servicios Humanos de California a CalMatters en un correo electrónico.
 El año pasado, el Departamento de Acceso e Información sobre Atención Médica otorgó al centro 8,5 millones de dólares a través del Programa de Préstamos para Hospitales en Dificultades, pero ya no hay fondos disponibles a través de dicho programa. Como beneficiario de dicha ayuda, el hospital tuvo que presentar un plan de reestructuración que detallaba cómo utilizaría estos fondos para mantenerse solvente a largo plazo.
 El hospital también obtendrá una extensión en el pago de los préstamos estatales, lo que le permitirá destinar ese dinero al cuidado de los pacientes en lugar del servicio de la deuda, dijo la oficina de Padilla a CalMatters.
 El Centro Médico Regional El Centro, en el Condado de Imperial, otro centro en el desierto con graves dificultades financieras, recibió 28 millones de dólares a través del Programa de Préstamos para Hospitales en Dificultades el año pasado y recientemente obtuvo una condonación de la deuda de dicho préstamo, según informaron funcionarios estatales. En julio, el Ayuntamiento de El Centro aprobó la venta de dicho centro a un sistema más grande, el Distrito de Salud del Valle Imperial, según informó el Calexico Chronicle.
 El Hospital Palo Verde atiende a los 18,317 residentes de Blythe, a los 2,600 reclusos de la Prisión Estatal de Ironwood y a miles más de la región, declaró Ruiz en una carta a Newsom . Sin él, la atención médica más cercana estaría a unas dos horas de distancia en el Hospital JFK Memorial de Indio y el Centro Médico Colorado River de Needles.
Ruiz dijo que el hospital había enfrentado una cascada de problemas, incluidos litigios, reemplazos de sistemas operativos y un ciberataque, que dejaron al hospital con un flujo negativo de aproximadamente un millón de dólares por mes.
 El cierre de la prisión estatal de Chuckawalla Valley en 2024 provocó una disminución de la población en la ciudad, y las bajas tasas de reembolso de Medi-Cal y de seguros también llevaron a la crisis financiera del hospital, según el Riverside Record.
 No es el único. Los hospitales rurales de California siempre han operado con un margen de beneficio limitado, y varios están al borde del cierre este año, según informó Capitol & Main en junio, añadiendo que «el sistema de salud rural de California ha estado en una situación financiera precaria durante años».",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090225-El-Centro-Hospital-GB-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-03 14:57:18.408431

Sept. 3, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceGathering with lawmakers from both sides of the legislative aisle on Wednesday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced a renewed push to clamp down on human trafficking in the state while supporting survivors.
Alongside state Reps. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) and Carol Glanville (D-Walker) and state Sens. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) and Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills), Nessel heralded the reintroduction of several policies from previous sessions supporting prosecutors and survivors, as well as new policies from the Michigan Senate boosting penalties for the facilitators of human trafficking. 
“Human trafficking is a crime that thrives in the shadows. It is modern day slavery. Traffickers use force, fraud and coercion to exploit the most vulnerable among us for profit leaving scars that last a lifetime,” Nessel said. “This isn’t an epidemic happening in some far away place. It’s happening right here in Michigan, in our neighborhoods, in our communities and in every corner of our state. No region is immune.”
While Nessel’s office has made prosecuting human trafficking a top priority, the state’s laws continue to receive an “F” rating from Shared Hope International and the Polaris Project, two groups dedicated to bringing an end to human trafficking. 
Survivors of human trafficking still face several barriers that prevent them from healing, rebuilding and reclaiming their futures, Nessel said, as many are charged with crimes they were forced into committing.

Survivors are often left without housing, employment and the protection they need to feel safe, Nessel added, as many more are afraid to come forward out of fear they will be punished rather than protected. 
“We know we cannot end trafficking through prosecution alone. Prevention and victim support must go hand in hand with enforcement,” Nessel said. “We must ensure that when survivors escape, they have a safe place to turn. We must provide legal protection so they are not re-traumatized by the criminal justice system. We must educate the public so that everyone – teachers, doctors, business owners, hotel staff, neighbors – can help identify the warning signs and then act upon them.”
With previous efforts to bolster protections for survivors of human trafficking failing to reach the governor’s desk, Damoose said he chose to act on Nessel’s concerns that the Legislature would never pass meaningful laws on human trafficking. 
While the bills set to be introduced in the Senate will not put an end to human trafficking, Damoose said his goal for the policies is to greatly reduce the number of individuals who would have been trafficked over the next two years. 
Among those reforms are increased penalties for both providers and solicitors of human trafficking, including penalties of up to 20 years for engaging in commercial sex with minors, felony penalties punishable by 20 years in prison and $20,000 fines for various human trafficking offenses, and life in prison for trafficking minors coupled with a $50,000 fine. 
Human trafficking goes beyond sex crimes, Breen said, extending into forced labor and domestic servitude where victims are coerced by threats, fraud, debt bondage and a fear of coming forward. 
“Our current policies and practices, however much good they do, are limited. Survivors are left without support. Families are left without justice. We have a moral responsibility to do better. We need to protect survivors, hold traffickers accountable and give prosecutors the tools they need to build strong cases without re-victimizing people who have already endured trauma,” Breen said.

Changes reintroduced in the house include allowing survivors to have their convictions set aside for crimes committed as a result of trafficking. The legislation also creates an affirmative defense for survivors charged with crimes committed under coercion. 
“These bills build upon reforms championed by Attorney General Dana Nessel and the prior Attorney General Bill Schuette. They ensure survivor statements can be used in court. By doing so, prosecutors will gain the tools they need to dismantle trafficking networks while keeping survivor safety at the center of every case,” Breen said. 
Budgetary concerns
In addition to advocating for movement on these bipartisan policies, Breen and Nessel decried cuts for programs supporting survivors of human trafficking and sexual assault in House Republicans’ proposed budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. 
The House’s budget does not include funding requirements for Sexual Assault Kit testing, although these requirements were included in proposals put forth by both Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Democratic-led Senate. 
The proposal also halves the Department of Attorney General’s general fund compared to the 2024-2025 budget, which Nessel said is used to pay for the department’s work on criminal cases. 
“We’ll be losing 57 special agents. We’ll be losing 13 trial prosecutors and three appellate criminal prosecutors and all of our victim advocates except one.… And I will tell you this as a longtime prosecutor: Yes, prosecutors are important and special agents are important, but no one is more important than victim advocates,” Nessel said. 
Under this level of proposed funding Nessel said she was uncertain if her department would be able to continue work on their Operation Survivor Justice initiative, which connects county prosecutors with funding for extraditing perpetrators of sexual crimes. 
Under the House’s proposal, Nessel said that the department’s address confidentiality program – which has 459 participants – has been effectively defunded. The program aims to protect survivors of domestic violence, sexual violence, and those who have experienced stalking and human trafficking by providing them with a legal mailing address to be used in place of their actual address when an address is needed by a government agency, preventing their abuser from locating them through their voting records or other documentation. 
“If you are really concerned about ensuring that we have the budget we need for all the things that we do, I think it’s important to note, for every $1 that goes to the Department of Attorney General in Michigan, we bring $4 back to the state.…it’s really disappointing, the House Budget, and I’m very, very hopeful that the Senate will stand strong and ensure that that doesn’t ultimately become our budget, and that the governor’s office also appreciates how important it is for us to have a strong budget here,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5431-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 14:57:18.408431

(Photo courtesy of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)A former Republican lawmaker will represent District 25 in southeastern North Dakota, filling the position that has been vacant since Rep. Cindy Schreiber-Beck died in May.
The executive committee for District 25 Republicans selected former Rep. Kathy Skroch, R-Lidgerwood, to complete the remainder of the term. 
Skroch beat out finalists Jason Heitkamp, a former lawmaker and 2024 state superintendent candidate, and former Republican district chair Erik Nygren during the interview process with the district’s executive committee.
“I was completely humbled by the outcome,” Skroch said Wednesday.
Skroch represented District 26 in the Legislature from 2017 to 2022 and narrowly lost her 2022 reelection bid by 85 votes to Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton, after redistricting combined portions of District 26 with districts 25 and 28.
Appointment of North Dakota lawmaker in limbo amid dispute over district party chair

Schreiber-Beck’s seat had remained vacant because the district’s reorganization meetings during the spring were deemed invalid by the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office, leaving NDGOP District 25 without an official chair or executive committee to make the appointment. The Republican district party was officially reorganized on Aug. 12 with Matt Evans becoming the new district party chair.
Sen. Larry Luick, R-Fairmount, a member of the District 25 executive committee, said he is excited to move on from the district’s leadership “hiccup” and thinks Skroch will represent the area well. 
“She’s very friendly to everybody,” Luick said. “I think we’re going to do just fine.”
He touted her wide-ranging experience as a benefit to her constituents. Skroch is a business owner through Vinnie’s Mud Bog in Lidgerwood, has experience in health care working previously in a geriatric care unit and has an agriculture past through framing and ranching in the area.
“I understand the importance of property rights and landowners’ rights and the impact that occurred with Richland County with the Fargo diversion and now the CO2 pipeline,” Skroch said. “I see the benefits, but I also see the risks to landowners when the big projects come in, or big corporate interests come in.”
She said she’d be willing to serve on any of the interim committees that she is selected for, but she said she believes she can contribute the most on the interim agriculture and human services committees.
Skroch added she could also provide insight on the interim education committee with her experience as a member of the Lidgerwood School Board and putting all seven of her children through the North Dakota public school system.
Grand Forks lawmaker resigns to join North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services

Skroch said she plans on running for election to the seat in 2026.
The North Dakota Legislature also has a vacancy in the Grand Forks area after Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, resigned to become deputy commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, a member of the NDGOP District 42 executive committee, said the district received the official notice of vacancy on Tuesday. The committee is required to meet within 21 days to select O’Brien’s replacement.
Cory said anyone interested in filling the legislative seat should contact NDGOP District 42 Chair Kim Efta or email the district at nddistrict42@gmail.

(Getty Images creative)The Milwaukee County judge accused of helping a man evade arrest by federal immigration authorities this spring is set to go to trial in December. 
Judge Hannah Dugan, who has been charged with federal felony and misdemeanor counts, said on Wednesday she would not appeal a U.S. District Court judge’s decision not to dismiss the case against her — though she reserved the right to appeal later. On Wednesday, federal Judge Lynn Adelman scheduled Dugan’s trial to begin Dec. 15. 
Dugan’s case has become a national example of the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on officials in other branches of government at the local, state and federal levels who are perceived as working against Trump’s aggressive immigration policies. Her April arrest drew widespread condemnation as a threat to judicial independence and criticism of federal Department of Justice officials for publicizing the case before she was even indicted. 
The case stems from what federal prosecutors allege was a deliberate attempt to conceal Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant, from federal authorities. Flores-Ruiz was in Dugan’s courtroom for an appearance in a misdemeanor battery case against him when federal agents arrived with an administrative warrant — which only allowed the agents to operate in the public areas of the Milwaukee County courthouse, not within Dugan’s courtroom. 
Dugan directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a side door of the courtroom, which led them to the same hallway where the agents were standing but not directly past them. An agent rode down in the elevator with Flores-Ruiz and he was later arrested on the street.

(Photoby Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A group of Latino advocates and researchers in North Carolina have launched a “geospatial database” mapping camps, emergency services and shelters across eastern counties.
The tool is designed to aid farm workers and other Latino workers across the region who may not otherwise know about or have access to resources during hurricanes and severe weather during storm season.
Advocates say some of those workers, who may not speak English or fluent Spanish, remain at higher risk during flooding and storms.
“There is limited access to emergency information in Spanish or the language that they speak,” said Lariza Garzón, the North Carolina director for the Hispanic Federation. “Barriers to adequate housing or health care, or fears tied to immigration status. These communities are too often left out of their response, and left behind in their recovery.”
The database was spurred by research from UNC’s Carolina Population Center, which examined local governments’ plans for disaster preparation and recovery. Many of those plans lacked best practices, particularly when it came to aiding Latino and migrant workers, said Nathan Dollar, director of the center’s Carolina Demography program.
Out of 41 counties surveyed, 14 of them mentioned having Spanish materials in their formal recommended practices, according to Dollar and his colleagues’ research. Nine mentioned translators, and seven mentioned interpreters.

Those written guidelines don’t always reflect the full extent of local operations and plans, Dollar said. But they do signal that gaps remain in actively seeking out Latino and migrant populations in their areas. Some live in ultra-rural regions, at addresses not listed in the state’s central emergency address list.
“We are working with the Department of Labor and others to try to make sure that every registered labor camp is registered with the 911 master address list,” Dollar said.
By the end of the year, the new collective — called Unidos por la Tierra y la Comunidad (United for Land and Community) — hopes to have all 100 counties mapped out.
The database will not be publicly available, but will be provided upon special request to local emergency officials and workers at non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, who have a “verified professional need” to use it, Dollar said.
Still, advocates know that some barriers will be harder to remove while completing the project. Ongoing immigration enforcement has created more distrust of government, Garzón acknowledged, meaning that third-party community leaders would be more important than ever.
“We are hoping that people realize that it would be a big mistake to leave entire communities out of disaster response,” Garzón said. “Especially when it’s our community often who are working towards recovery, rebuilding the homes, fixing electrical issues.”

(Photo by Nick Evans/Ohio Capital Journal)Ron DeSantis does not want former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner to succeed him as governor, he told a packed crowd Wednesday.
“I’m not supporting Paul Renner,” DeSantis said during a Valrico press conference, hours after the Palm Coast Republican filed for the 2026 governor’s race. Renner will face the only other high-profile Republican in the race, Donald Trump-endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds.
“I think it was an ill-advised decision to enter the race,” DeSantis added.
His blunt take on the 48-year-old’s candidacy stood in contrast to Renner’s campaign launch earlier Wednesday, when the former House Speaker lauded himself as a top GOP figure who played a key role in advancing DeSantis’s agenda.
“As a legislator and Speaker of the House, I stood with Ron DeSantis to brand our state the Free State of Florida. I’m running for Governor so that when the DeSantis era comes to an end, we can defend our victories and solve the challenges that remain,” Renner said in a press release.
DeSantis doesn’t think so.
Less than a year before the gubernatorial primary, Renner is the second high-profile Republican DeSantis has publicly dismissed in the governor’s race. When Trump endorsed Donalds in February for Florida’s top job, DeSantis accused the three-term member of Congress of missing out on Florida’s “wins” during his tenure in Washington.
Still, Renner remains confident that he can “earn the support” of DeSantis as his campaign continues.
“The governor and I had a fantastic partnership making us the Free State of Florida, and I’m confident I’ll earn his support along the way,” he said in a statement to the Florida Phoenix.
DeSantis has yet to formally announce who he does support as a successor. For months, he juxtaposed Donalds and First Lady Casey DeSantis, touting her as a Rush Limbaugh-approved gubernatorial candidate while hinting that she might run. But those rumors faded to a faint whisper after Hope Florida, a charity championed by the First Lady, was barraged with scandalous financial allegations.
Recent reports suggest that Jay Collins, a former state senator elevated by DeSantis as lieutenant governor, will be DeSantis’ picks as his successor.
Renner’s gubernatorial hopes are not new to DeSantis.
In July, as the Jacksonville attorney was touting his pro-DeSantis record on social media, Renner told the governor he wanted to succeed him. The private conversation came after a brutally long legislative session marked by rare infighting between the governor and top GOP lawmakers, when Renner publicly sided with DeSantis on a controversial insurance reform bill.
Citing distaste for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the former House Speaker also led the charge to block Santa Ono, a former University of Michigan president, from becoming president of the University of Florida.
A month-and-a-half later, Renner’s plan came to fruition. And evidenced by Wednesday’s pithy public questioning of Renner’s decision making, DeSantis isn’t pleased.

(Photo by Getty Images)North Carolina is falling short in how it serves students with disabilities, according to a 2023-2024 state report on special education presented at Wednesday’s State Board of Education meeting.
The U.S. Department of Education has again labeled the state as “needing assistance,” a designation North Carolina has carried for several years. More than 30 states fall into the same category, but for North Carolina it signals ongoing issues with meeting all federal requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
While the label does not cut funding, it means the state must work with federal advisers and report on its progress. If improvements are not made, North Carolina could face a tougher designation of “needs intervention.”
Staffing is one of the biggest challenges North Carolina is facing. Across the state, there are 1,544 open positions for special education teachers. This teacher shortage, with vacancies averaging 10% annually, often means larger caseloads for existing teachers, uncertified staff filling roles, and students missing out on services required in their education plans. Specifically, there are 758 special education openings in elementary schools, 385 in middle schools, and another 401 unfilled positions in high schools. 
Recruitment remains difficult. Fewer than two dozen applicants showed up for a recent job fair.
“I think it’s very challenging,” Dr. Carol Ann Hudgens, senior director of the Office of Exceptional Children, describing how few people are entering the field.
The state has launched new initiatives to address some of the issues. For example, about $2 million has gone out to local districts to support training programs, help with recruitment efforts, and improve retention. Department of Public Instruction (DPI ) officials said districts are tracking which teachers attend professional development sessions to help target support where it’s needed most.
The state is also offering regional training institutes and conferences to better support exceptional children educators.
Despite the recruitment challenges, the report did note some gains. Graduation rates for students with disabilities rose from 62.5% to 66.6%, according to the report.

The State Board of Education is expected to vote on the report’s approval on Thursday before it is submitted to the General Assembly.

DPI identified key priority areas for support, including:

Student performance on statewide assessments
Suspension and expulsion rates
Preschool outcomes
Child find and early childhood transition
Secondary transition and post-school outcomes

The massive tax cut and spending law that Congress passed in July, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,  limited tax credits for green energy projects, such as the two solar farms Evergy received regulatory approval to build in Kansas and Missouri.
Two weeks ago the U.S. Treasury Department published its interpretation of the bill, outlining deadlines for beginning construction and clarifying when certain tax credits would go away. That allowed companies to determine the viability of planned projects. 
“The solar power plants that have been approved by the Kansas and Missouri commissions will be generating electricity for customers in time to qualify for the existing tax credits,” said Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman. 
Joseph Astrab, consumer counsel at the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, said tax credits are taken into account when determining expected costs on green energy projects. 
“It’s going to be hard to tell what the immediate impacts will be. It’s going to be a process,” he said. “The biggest importance of these tax credits was to help make renewable resources, such as wind or solar, more cost competitive with other types of resources, such as natural gas.”
Astrab said the integrated resource planning, which utility companies complete on a regular basis, will address the effects federal changes will have on how energy is distributed in Kansas. In that process, the companies are considering resources, needs in the generation system and making a future-looking plan, he said.  
“From CURB’s perspective, we’re looking at both trying to balance affordability and reliability,” he said. “But clearly from the public hearings we’ve seen in the past and recently with different rate cases, a lot of people are concerned about affordability.”
“In the last few years, we’ve been able to compare solar and wind projects to thermal projects, including the offset of those tax credits to make it more economical,” Astrab added. “That analysis will change going forward.”
A lot depends on how Evergy will evaluate projects going forward, he said. 
“Looking at Evergy’s 2025 (integrated resource plan), the question becomes whether or not Evergy is going to be shifting away from procuring more solar, renewable types of resources in a system, and falling back on — and I’m not saying it’s a sure thing — more readily accessible, economical natural gas resources and procuring more of those.”
Evergy received approval from the Kansas Corporation Commission to build two new natural gas plants, as well as the Kansas solar field, to the tune of about $2 billion. 
Penzig said Evergy develops a long-term outlook for expected electricity demand every three years and a plan to meet needs.
“We create a plan that will provide reliable electricity for the least expected cost,” she said. “Plans are updated annually between the triennial filings as factors change.”
The plans look at multiple factors that affect generation costs, Penzig said. 
“Some of the most significant impacts include expected demand for electricity, construction costs including any related transmission expansion, fuel, plant maintenance, major plant upgrades, environmental regulation and state or federal policy treatment including tax benefits,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1090642-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-03 14:57:18.408431

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Public health and access to lifesaving vaccines are on the line in a high-stakes leadership battle at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to fire CDC director Susan Monarez is more than an administrative shake-up. The firing marks a major offensive by Kennedy to seize control of the agency and impose an anti-vaccine, anti-science agenda that will have profound effects on the lives and health of all Americans, public health leaders say.
Kennedy wants to see the Pfizer and Moderna messenger RNA-based covid-19 vaccines pulled from the market, according to two people familiar with the planning who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak to the press. He’s also set his sights on restricting or halting access to some pediatric immunizations, some public health leaders say.
His actions have already reduced federal help to states, creating the potential for more infectious disease outbreaks and incidences of foodborne illness. Some public health leaders say they expect Kennedy will use the CDC to publicize health information that isn’t grounded in science.
“It’s crazy season,” said Richard Besser, former acting CDC director during the Obama administration. “People want information they can trust to make critical decisions about their health. Until now, we’ve been able to say look at the CDC. Unfortunately, we’re not able to do that anymore.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard disputed the criticism.
“Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again, dismantling the failed status quo that fueled a nationwide chronic disease epidemic and eroded public trust in our public health institutions,” Hilliard said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Kennedy and Commissioner of Food and Drugs Marty Makary have reiterated that covid shots will remain available for Americans who need and want them.
“The Trump administration is restoring Gold Standard Science as the sole guiding principle of health decision-making,” Desai said in an email. “Only the Fake News could ignore these facts to continue pushing Democrat talking points and hysteria.”
Behind the ouster
The shake-up began last week, when Kennedy sought to fire Monarez, a microbiologist who’d just been confirmed by the Senate in July. She refused to leave the position, and her lawyers said Kennedy sought to oust her because she wouldn’t fire senior staff or follow unscientific directives. Four top career officials at the CDC resigned on Aug. 27 in protest.
Career staffers at the CDC and some public health groups had hoped President Donald Trump would intervene and put the brakes on Kennedy. Instead, the White House backed Kennedy, saying Monarez was fired.
Trump on Sept. 1 demanded that drug companies show that covid vaccines work, in a further sign he’s not set on defending the shots.
“I hope OPERATION WARP SPEED was as ‘BRILLIANT’ as many say it was. If not, we all want to know about it, and why???” Trump said on Truth Social.
Operation Warp Speed was the initiative that Trump himself announced in 2020 to accelerate the development of covid vaccines, including the Pfizer and Moderna shots. The vaccines have proved safe and effective in multiple clinical trials; a study published in JAMA Health Forum estimated that they saved about 2.5 million lives worldwide.
CDC staffers are worried the agency’s next director won’t fight for science, according to an employee who asked not to be identified for fear of professional retaliation.
Trump’s support for Monarez’s ouster was a watershed moment that signaled there are no checks on Kennedy and his agenda, public health advocates say. Leading congressional Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Kennedy’s firing. Hundreds of HHS staffers have also implored Congress to intervene, saying Kennedy threatens science and public health. He is slated to testify Sept. 4 before the Senate Finance Committee.
Kennedy said in a message to CDC staff that his focus is on boosting the agency’s reputation and leadership. The Atlanta-based agency was already reeling after the Trump administration pushed out thousands of its staff and a gunman who reportedly believed the covid vaccine had caused him health problems fired hundreds of rounds at its campus last month, killing a police officer.
“The CDC must once again be the world’s leader in communicable disease prevention. Together, we will restore trust,” Kennedy wrote. “Together, we will rebuild this institution into what it was always meant to be: a guardian of America’s health and security.” He said his deputy, Jim O’Neill, would serve as acting CDC director.
Nine former CDC directors or acting directors who served under both Republicans and Democrats criticized Kennedy in the aftermath of the Monarez firing, saying in an op-ed in The New York Times that the impact on public health is “unacceptable, and it should alarm every American, regardless of political leanings.”
HHS spokesperson Hilliard took exception with this point, listing four covid vaccines that continue to get the nod for use.
However, the Food and Drug Administration last
week approved updated covid mRNA boosters only for people 65 or older and others at high risk of complications. The CDC has also stopped recommending the shots for healthy children and pregnant women. Previously, the shots had been advised for anyone 6 months or older.
As a result, many people who don’t meet the criteria but want the vaccine will have to get prescriptions or consult with their doctors. Insurance may not always cover the shots, which can run around $200. Major drugstores such as Walgreens and CVS have said the shots may not be available at all pharmacies and may require a prescription.
The American Academy of Pediatrics on Aug. 19 broke with the administration, recommending that all young children get the covid vaccine. Insurance still may not cover the cost in some cases and parents could face obstacles in getting the vaccines without a prescription.
Next move: The advisory committee
Kennedy and his team changed official covid vaccine recommendations even though there have been no new safety issues. A dose of the 2023-24 covid mRNA vaccine prevented significant illness and death across all age groups, according to a study published in August led by a University of Michigan researcher. The virus killed about 1,000 people a week in the U.S. in mid-January, and cases are rising again and expected to accelerate this winter.
Kennedy has handpicked a vaccine advisory committee for the CDC that is reviewing mRNA-based covid vaccines, which he falsely claimed in 2021 were “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” The covid vaccine review is being led by Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has said without evidence that the shots cause serious harm, including death. If the committee recommends against them, Kennedy and the FDA could then begin the process of removing them from the market.
Taking mRNA-based covid shots off the market would leave consumers with fewer options for protection. Paxlovid, an antiviral medication that treats the infection in high-risk adults, would be available.
The CDC advisory committee reviewing the covid shots is also probing a long-debunked link between aluminum, used in many childhood immunizations such as those for hepatitis A and pneumonia, and autism or allergies.
The group’s findings are expected to support the erroneous link, some public health officials say. HHS could then require drugmakers to undertake costly reformulations of the shots or stop manufacturing them altogether.
“That would set up the elimination of all childhood vaccines,” Besser said.
The advisory group’s next meeting is set for Sept. 18, although Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has called for the meeting to be indefinitely delayed. Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, voted for Kennedy’s confirmation as HHS secretary after receiving assurances, he said, that the longtime vaccine opponent wouldn’t disrupt the U.S. vaccination system. Kennedy’s promises, Cassidy said, included that he wouldn’t change the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Kennedy removed all of the panel’s members in June and replaced them with his own appointees, including anti-vaccine activists.
Kennedy’s move to put his stamp on the CDC means states that have long relied on the agency’s expertise and help in crises such as disease outbreaks will largely be left to fend for themselves, said Ashish Jha, who served as President Joe Biden’s covid response coordinator from 2022 to 2023.
“States are going to be left on their own,” Jha said. “States will struggle with the CDC incapable and dysfunctional. Our system is not designed for states to go it alone.”
The CDC typically plays a critical role by assisting states with disease surveillance, public health interventions, and outbreak response, especially when a crisis spills across state lines. An outbreak of measles this year led to more than 1,400 cases nationwide, and states including Texas, where the outbreak was identified, struggled to get help from the CDC.
A CDC program that has long tracked pathogens in food has already reduced the number of hazards it looks for from eight to two, which public health leaders say is making it harder to identify outbreaks. Staff overseeing a CDC program that tracks outdoor pollution that can exacerbate asthma also have been cut.
The agency runs a hotline that doctors around the country can call to get treatment and other types of advice. Under Kennedy’s watch, the CDC has had to pare assistance because of staffing reductions, said Wendy Armstrong, vice president at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
“Lives are 100% at stake, no question about it,” Armstrong said. “That you can no longer trust the recommendations out of the CDC is just devastating. It’s appalling to think we can’t trust that information is science-based anymore.”
Kennedy wants to shake up CDC leadership because he sees the agency as the heart of corruption and resistance within the federal health bureaucracy, according to people familiar with his planning. Kennedy has said the agency suffers from malaise and bias.
Many public health leaders, however, view the CDC as under siege by an administration they say is corrupting science for its own ends. HHS staffers signed onto a letter that now has more than 6,800 signatures, saying Kennedy is “endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information.”
Kennedy has also been fending off mounting criticism of his response to the shooting at the CDC’s headquarters. He responded to the attack on social media, hours later, after first posting pictures of himself fly-fishing.
Some younger staffers are considering leaving and some workers feel like the shooting accelerated Kennedy’s overhaul of the agency, the CDC employee said.
With the battle for control of the CDC still raging, public health leaders are now looking to Congress to put the brakes on Kennedy. Some Republican lawmakers have called for a review of Kennedy’s actions.
“These high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee,” Cassidy said Aug. 27 on the social platform X. Cassidy had backed Monarez to lead the agency.

This year, at least two major city agencies — the New York Police Department and the Dallas Police Department — have cut some education requirements for new recruits.
In February, the NYPD reduced its college credit requirement for police academy entry from 60 credits to 24. Following a new policy approval in June, the Dallas Police Department began allowing applicants with only a high school diploma or GED to qualify if they also have three consecutive years of full-time work experience.

Police agencies nationwide are loosening education requirements in an effort to address years of staffing shortages. The changes also come as President Donald Trump has drawn more attention to crime and public safety by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and signaling plans to expand federal enforcement efforts in Chicago and other cities. (A federal judge on Tuesday ruled Trump’s mobilization of U.S. Marines and the California National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles this summer violated federal law.) Trump also has taken over the District of Columbia’s police department.

Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022. Some communities, though, are still facing higher rates of certain crimes, including homicide.
The changes in New York City and Dallas are part of a yearslong trend of police departments easing college requirements, a shift that includes Boise, Idaho; Chicago; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Memphis, Tennessee; and Bellingham, Washington. Even some state police agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police and the Pennsylvania State Police, have followed suit.
But these changes in education requirements aren’t limited to local and state forces. The FBI — which for decades required a four-year degree — will no longer mandate one for new recruits starting in October. New recruits also will receive just eight weeks of training, down from the previous 18-week standard, according to The New York Times.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has loosened standards as the Trump administration seeks to expand immigration enforcement. The agency removed its five-week Spanish-language training requirement. Translation needs would instead be met through unspecified technology, The Intercept reported.
ICE has paired these changes with aggressive incentives, including signing bonuses of up to $50,000, as much as $60,000 in student loan repayment and retirement benefits.
These changes reflect a broader challenge in policing: Agencies are still struggling to recruit and retain officers amid increased public attention and shifting workforce expectations.
“The demand exceeds the supply, and what’s happened is the environment for being a police officer has changed,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit think tank on policing standards. “The expectations have never been higher.”
Resignations and retirements rose sharply after 2020, when nationwide protests put law enforcement under closer public scrutiny following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Additionally, some officers are leaving big-city departments for smaller agencies. At the same time, some experts say, police agencies are competing in a tight labor market in which shift jobs may be less appealing than positions with regular hours, higher pay or remote work options.
In recent years, the push for better-educated officers has been rooted in research suggesting that college graduates are less likely to use force and perform better on the job. But some say that strict education mandates can shrink the applicant pool and shouldn’t be the sole measure of what makes a good officer.

“College education, in the greater scheme of things, is advantageous. It’s necessary, but not sufficient,” Wexler said, noting that agencies should also weigh a recruit’s work history, maturity, judgement and other characteristics.
Agencies of all sizes also have adjusted other standards to attract more applicants — raising or lowering minimum age limits, loosening tattoo policies, scaling back fitness tests and waiving exam fees.
In some departments, these changes have sparked a surge in applications, but they haven’t always translated into higher staffing levels overall.
Following the NYPD’s announcement in February that it was changing its education requirement, daily applications jumped from an average of 53 to 231, according to a news release. In early August, the agency swore in 1,093 recruits — its largest incoming class since January 2016.
The New Orleans Police Department nixed its college education requirement in 2015 and saw a surge of 7,440 applications just two years later.
But hiring never kept pace: The department brought on about 100 recruits a year, and far fewer after 2020, according to the city’s hiring dashboard. In 2024, the department received 1,575 applications and hired just 35 recruits.
A report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office released late last year found that between 2019 and 2023, the department lost nearly 27% of its policing staff.

Solving the staffing crisis

Staffing shortfalls have been a long-standing challenge for law enforcement agencies, stretching back well before 2020. But in recent years, hiring has improved in some parts of the country.
The latest Police Executive Research Forum survey, based on responses from 217 agencies across 39 states and the District of Columbia, suggests staffing trends are uneven.
As of Jan. 1, sworn staffing was up slightly from the year before but still 5.2% below 2020 levels, according to the survey. Large departments saw modest growth in 2024 but still employ 6% fewer officers than in 2020, while medium and small agencies have not just recovered but now surpass 2020 levels.
“This period we’re in now, and we have been in for the last few years, is the most challenging time to hire a police officer,” Wexler said.

In recent years, state legislatures also have looked into the education requirements for police. In 2023, for example, Oregon lawmakers considered a bill that would have required at least two years of higher education for departments with fewer than 50 officers and a bachelor’s degree for departments with more than 50. It would have applied to police, corrections, parole, probation and reserve officers, but the bill stalled in a Senate committee.
More recently, lawmakers in California are considering a bill that would, starting in 2031, require incoming officers to obtain a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. Incoming officers could also meet the requirement through prior military service or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
The proposal has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies and groups in the state, including the California Police Chiefs Association, California State Sheriffs’ Association and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.
The sheriffs’ association praised the legislation, writing in a statement that it offers a range of acceptable experiences — “enhancing academic rigor” — without burdensome requirements that could hurt agencies’ recruiting goals.
Police education requirements are often set by individual departments or local jurisdictions, rather than written into state law. Across the country, most local law enforcement agencies require only a high school diploma or GED, though officers with a college degree may have more opportunities for promotions and higher pay.
“Educational standards across law enforcement agencies vary considerably,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University.
Some agencies also have created pathways for new officers to earn college credit through completing the police academy program and offer tuition reimbursement for those who want to pursue advanced degrees.
But La Vigne told Stateline that in-service training, organizational structure, leadership and accountability mechanisms within a department also play a key role in shaping a well-rounded officer.
“Those factors, I think, override anything as simple as ‘We’re requiring or removing education as a threshold for employment,’” La Vigne said. “Educational requirements alone are not the biggest factor.”

What makes a good cop

What makes a good police officer has long been debated, with discussions often centering on the role of education, training and personal qualities.










Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer.


– Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Research Executive Forum


Some argue that, rather than lowering education requirements, departments should improve people’s perceptions of the police by becoming more involved in the community, especially at a time when heightened scrutiny has made the job less appealing to some.
“It’s trying to fix the problem assuming that the way things work now is the way things are supposed to be,” said Jim Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and a speaker with the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership. Nolan previously served as a police officer and as an FBI unit chief. “It’s the approach to policing that’s wrong.”
Some research suggests that college-educated officers use force less often, face fewer complaints and are disciplined less frequently than their peers without a degree. Some policing experts say a college education may give officers a broader perspective on a range of issues while also strengthening critical thinking and teamwork skills.
Research also suggests that college-educated officers are stronger writers, which can lead to clearer investigations and casework, according to a 2017 report on higher education in policing.
But some experts still caution that the research is not conclusive and argue that education alone isn’t enough to determine what makes a good police officer.
“Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer,” said Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum.
